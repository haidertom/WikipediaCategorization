'''American College of the Building Arts''' (ACBA) is a private four-year liberal arts and sciences college located in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. It is licensed by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to grant a Bachelor of Applied Science and an Associate of Applied Science in six craft specializations in the building arts.

The college's model is unique in the United States, with its focus on total integration of a liberal arts and science education and the traditional building arts skills. Students choose from among six craft specializations: [[timber framing]], [[carpentry|architectural carpentry]], [[plaster]], [[masonry]], [[blacksmith]]ing (forged architectural iron) and [[stone carving|architectural stone carving]].

ACBA's stated mission is to educate and train [[artisan]]s in the traditional building arts in order to foster exceptional craftsmanship and encourage the preservation, enrichment and understanding of the world's architectural heritage through a liberal arts and science education.

[[File:American College of the Building Arts junior measuring for a custom stair.jpg|thumb|American College of the Building Arts junior measuring for a custom stair.]]
Current students come from more than 30 states. One quarter of the student body is female and one fifth are veterans. The majority of students have secured employment in their respective trades prior to graduation, aided by expertise gained from their education and externship experiences, critical analysis and deep knowledge base in preservation, restoration and appropriate materials needed in each of their chosen fields. The [[interdisciplinary]] approach allows graduates to be as educated as the architects with whom they work.&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/buildingartscollege/docs/acba.2013-2014.catalog.fincat.08141&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:American-College-of-the-Building-Arts-library.jpg|thumb|left|American College of the Building Arts library interior.]]American College of the Building Arts was founded in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Hugo]], which struck the Southeastern coast of the United States in 1989. The devastating category four hurricane damaged or destroyed many historical coastal-Carolina buildings and left much of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston's]] iron, plaster and fine wood work in disrepair. It took ten years to rebuild and restore the city's damaged homes and historical buildings, in part, because of a shortage of skilled artisans. In 1999, in response to this gap in the building arts, a group of local movers and shakers planted the seeds that led to the founding of ACBA.

Initially, classes and workshops that focused on the building arts were offered at a number of different Charleston area locations. However, the original educational model proved difficult to execute, and the college founders regrouped to establish a degree-granting college, integrating the American liberal arts degree model with the artisan teaching styles of Europe. In 2004, ACBA was licensed by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to recruit students for a Bachelor of Applied Science and an Associate of Applied Science in the building arts. In 2009 the college awarded its first degrees to seven students. During these same years, ACBA reconfigured its administration, hiring current president, Lt.(ret.) General Colby M. Broadwater III and other administrative team members with strong business experience.

== Academics ==
[[File:American College of the Building Arts student working with steel.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Student at the American College of the Building Arts working with steel.]]American College of the Building Arts combines a traditional liberal arts education with programs in trade education that are based on [[Europe]]an and other models. The framing and plaster programs are based on the French [[Compagnons du Tour de France|“les Compagnons du Devoir,”]] a trade guild offering high-skill vocational and educational training rich in culture and humanity. The stone program is based on programs at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and [[Wells Cathedral]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The iron program has a long association with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and also with the work of [[Philip Simmons]], famed [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] ironwork artisan and one of the founders of ACBA. Pieces designed and made by Simmons are displayed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[South Carolina State Museum]] and outside the United States in [[France]] and [[China]]. In addition to trade-specific classes, students pursue a course of general studies that includes not only typical college courses, such as English and mathematics, but also specialized courses in drawing, design, materials science and construction management. ACBA maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio to ensure the highest standards of quality in its programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/buildingartscollege/docs/acba.2013-2014.catalog.fincat.08141&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:American College of the Building Arts freshman math class.JPG|thumb|American College of the Building Arts freshman math class.]]

The Byrne-Diderot Library is a major research resource for students and faculty. The library houses a specialized collection of books, periodicals, newspapers and audiovisual materials in the building, visual, decorative and liberal arts. The library's main collection contains over 6.500 items. The D.A.R. Special Collections room contains another 500 rare books, catalogs and periodicals, as well as examples of historical tools and 19th century Charleston iron work.

==Campus history ==
[[File:American College of the Building Arts junior carving a stone mantle.jpg|thumb|American College of the Building Arts junior carving a stone mantle.]]American College of the Building Arts first classes were offered at several different locations in and around the city of Charleston, including the [[Old Charleston Jail|Old Charleston District Jail]], which became the college's primary location for 17 years. Carpentry and forged architectural iron programs were housed at a separate site. The Jail was originally constructed in 1802 and expanded in 1855 to include living quarters for the warden and jailers on the street side and an octagonal rear wing. Many infamous inmates were housed in the prison, including high seas pirates, the female mass murderer Lavinia Fischer and [[Denmark Vesey]], a free African American who plotted a slave rebellion that was discovered before it could be executed. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] both [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] prisoners were incarcerated within its walls. Although it had no electricity or running water, the jail housed prisoners until it was decommissioned in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/charleston/old.htm&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Groundbreaking with Mayor Riley.jpg|thumb|left|American College of the Building Arts ground breaking of the Old Charleston Trolley Barn on May 7, 2015.]]

During the years spent occupying and renovating the jail, the college viewed itself as caretaker of the building and its rich history. As part of ACBA's living learning laboratory, faculty members led students in assessing needs and proper methods of restoration, preservation and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2009/september-october/hands-on-education.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Having outgrown its existing facilities, ACBA launched a major fundraising effort in 2014 to establish a single, expanded campus that could consolidate the teaching of all trades under one roof. With a major donation from Parallel Capital and from Russell and Betty Joan Hitt, founders of Virginia-based HITT Contracting, early supporters of ACBA, the college raised funds to purchase and renovate the abandoned Charleston Trolley Barn on Upper Meeting Street. On May 7, 2015, 150 people attended the ground breaking ceremony.

It took just over one year and approximately $6 million to build the new state-of-the-art ACBA campus that was formally opened in October 2016. The newly repurposed building maintains the historical ethos of the original structure while providing the students with modern academic and workshop space. Approximately 39,000 square feet were carved out of the barn's original 24,000 square foot footprint. The front third of the three-story building houses an exhibition lobby, administrative offices, classrooms, labs and a community room available to local civic groups. Workshops and trade classrooms are located in the back two-thirds of the building. A student lounge, faculty offices and conference spaces occupy the second floor. The third floor rafters house the computer lab and ACBA's unique library and its special collections.  The building has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In September 2018, the College received national accreditation from the [http://www.accsc.org/ Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges].

==Additional Programs==
A diverse lineup of evening courses was introduced to the public beginning in the fall of 2017, including AutoCAD, interior design and history of Charleston architecture. In January 2018, ACBA initiated intensive one-week courses in areas such as sculptural blacksmithing, decorative woodcarving, furniture restoration, furniture design and stained glass. In the fall of 2018, the addition of an undergraduate major in classical architecture and design will bring the list of ACBA majors up to seven.

'''Anxiety/Uncertainty Management''' ('''AUM''') theory was introduced by William B. Gudykunst to define how humans effectively communicate based on their balance of anxiety and uncertainty in social situations.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing About Intercultural Communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9780761927495|editor-last=|editor-first=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Gudykunst believed that in order for successful [[intercultural|intercultural communication]] a reduction in anxiety/uncertainty must occur. This is assuming that one person within the intercultural encounter is a stranger. AUM is a theory based on the [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] (URT) which was introduced by Berger and Calabrese in 1974.&lt;ref name="Berger&amp;Calabrese"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Charles R.|last2=Calabrese|first2=Richard J.|date=1975-12-01|title=Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=99–112|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00258.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Mitchell R.|last2=Wiseman|first2=Richard L.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=J.

==Differences between URT/AUM and the introduction of anxiety==

URT is based on the human's thought process and their approach to social situation in which they have uncertainty. URT suggests that uncertainty stems from the human's attempts to "[proactively predict] ''the other's attitudes, values, feelings, beliefs and behaviors''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; during social encounters. Humans attempt to reduce their uncertainty in social encounters when there is a motivation to do so,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; URT highlights three core motivations; they anticipate other social interaction at another point in time, the recipient has something the human needs or wants as a form of reward and/or the recipient is acting in a strange or deviant which is unexpected.&lt;ref name="Berger2"&gt;Berger, C. 1979. ''The contact hypothesis in ethnic relations''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

Berger identified 7 axioms and 21 theorems within URT&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (theoretical statements which are generally excepted, but can be used to observe behaviours to be further proved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theorem|title=the definition of theorem|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with these theorems providing the inspiration for a multitude of expansions to the theory, one of which is AUM. AUM uses the foundations of URT to formulate 47 axioms, with AUM integrating the human anxiety management within social situations, as well as their uncertainty management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; AUM builds on URT's focus on individual or one-to-one communication, as the axioms and theorems focus on intercultural and intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Young Yun|last2=Gudykunst|first2=William B.|date=1988|title=Cross-Cultural Adaptation: Current Approaches.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED351737|journal=International and Intercultural Communication Annual|language=en|volume=11|pages=|issn=0270-6075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

AUM incorporates both the URT and the works of Stephan and Stephan on anxiety within his axioms to expand URT to explain intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Stephan&amp;Stephan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Walter G.|last2=Stephan|first2=Cookie White|date=1985-10-01|title=Intergroup Anxiety|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=157–175|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUM focuses on both anxiety and uncertainty reduction, this highlights the major difference between URT and AUM, with the intended outcome of URT being simply to reduce [[uncertainty]], whereas AUM's outcome was for cultural adaptation and not solely the reduction of uncertainty. The inherent difference is that managing anxiety is to maintain it between minimum and maximum thresholds along a spectrum while reducing anxiety is unidirectional. This realization, along with the introduction of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] as a factor of effective communication, led Gudykunst to finally designate an appropriate name for his research: Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory (AUM).

Gudykunst assumed that at least one person in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. He argues that strangers undergo both anxiety and uncertainty; they don’t feel secure and they aren’t sure how to behave. Gudykunst noted that strangers and in-group members experience some degree of anxiety and uncertainty in any new interpersonal situation, but when the encounter takes place between people of different cultures, strangers are hyperaware of cultural differences. They then tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individuals’ distinctions.

The purpose of the first iteration of AUM was to be a practical application with a high degree of utility. The format of AUM includes numerous [[axioms]], which in turn converge on one another moving in the direction of effective communication. (See Figure X). The specific number of [[axioms]] has varied over the last fifteen years according to updated research in the field of cross-cultural communication.

==Scope of AUM==
Communication theories commonly focus on 4 levels: [[individual]], [[interpersonal]], [[intergroup]], and [[cultural]].&lt;ref name="Doise"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/levels-of-explanation-in-social-psychology/oclc/13004532|title=Levels of explanation in social psychology|last=Doise|first=Willem|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press ; Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l'Homme|isbn=978-0521307482|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; New York; Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

• The [[individual]] level is the motivation for human communication, influencing the ways humans create and interpret messages (for example the need for group inclusion and self-concept support).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[interpersonal]] level is the way the message is exchanged when humans are communicating as an individual (for example one-on-one communication, intimate relationships and social networks).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[intergroup]] level is the exchange of messages when humans are communicating as a collective (for example social identities, collective self-esteem).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[cultural]] level is how people communicate similarly or differently dependant on their culture (for example dimensions of cultural variability).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

AUM focuses on interpersonal and intergroup levels of communication, with Gudykunst's [[axioms]] fitting into either the interpersonal or the intergroup categories. AUM discriminates between interpersonal and intergroup communications by examining predictions of behaviour. If the behaviour can be explained with cultural norms or with sociological norms, it can be classified as intergroup communication. When the behavior is best explained by psychological factors it is likely interpersonal communication. A second effective differentiator is to examine the identities that guide human behavior. When our behavior is guided by personal or human factors, interpersonal behaviors tend to occur. When it is guided by social factors the opposite is true.

==Working assumptions==
Complex theories such as AUM need to accept certain assumptions as true before the real content can be explored. Some metatheoretical assumptions Gudykunst makes on AUM are on the nature of reality, the way we gain knowledge, and the basis of human behavior. Gudykunst assumes that the basic processes of communication are the same across cultures; only the methods of interpretation vary. Also, he assumes these interpretations are how we gain data to create theories. Finally, and vital to AUM, he assumes that when humans are mindful they have greater control over their communications behaviors. This aspect of human nature is sometimes referred to as determinism.

Gudykunst also employs several theoretical assumptions. The first is that strangers will trigger both interpersonal and intergroup anxiety. The perspective he takes for the sake of developing axioms is that of the stranger immersed in an ingroup.

Another assumption deals with the concept of uncertainty. Gudykunst assumes that when uncertainty falls between an individual's minimum and maximum acceptable levels, effective communication will then take place. The maximum threshold is defined as the amount of uncertainty that we can possess and still comfortably predict the behavior of a stranger. Uncertainty above the minimum threshold keeps us from getting bored with the stranger and hence constraining communication.

[[Anxiety]] for the purposes of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on the fear of negative consequences. It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added fear of appearing [[prejudiced]] when dealing with an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing [[eustress]] and [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or "confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared"&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/45409297|title=The Resolution of Conflict : Constructive and Destructive Processes|last=Deutsch|first=Morton|date=1973|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300016833|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} The negative consequence is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.

Another term needing a working definition for the purpose of anxiety/uncertainty management is "effective communication". Simply put, effective communication is the extent to which a message is interpreted by its recipient with the intended meaning from the sender. Communication is more effective when both the sender and receiver use the same frames of reference. However, in [[intercultural communication]] this is often untrue and interactions with strangers can in turn prove more difficult.

Finally, the mechanism around which anxiety/uncertainty management revolves is [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. When people communicate mindlessly, they tend to utilize broad categories and [[stereotypes]] to predict behavior. As mindfulness increases, the categories become more specific and typically more accurate predictors. Since being mindful makes us open to more information we are more likely to correctly identify the receiver's frame of interpretation.

Mindfulness refers to a conscious choice rather than scripted behavior. Em Griffin, author of the Communication book; "A First Look At Communication Theory" and Professor Emeritus of Communications at Wheaton College in Illinois defines mindfulness as "the way that in-group members and strangers can reduce their anxiety and uncertainty to optimum levels".&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Scripted behavior serves us well in familiar situations, but not in cross-cultural communication. William Howell suggests four levels of communication competence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

* '''Unconscious incompetence:''' We are unaware that we're misinterpreting others' behavior.
* '''Conscious incompetence:''' We know that we're misinterpreting others' behavior but don't do anything about it.
* '''Conscious competence:''' We think about our communication and continually work to become more effective.
* '''Unconscious competence:''' Our communication skills are automatic.

Gudykunst defined mindfulness as stage three (Conscious competence), in Howell's model. In this stage cognitive choice moderates the destructive force of doubt or fear. The last stage (Unconscious competence), is less competent than stage three and can quickly shift into oblivious incompetence. Mindfulness involves the creation of new categories, a new process of thinking, and formation of a kin which reinforces Delia's description of how a cognitively complex person uses a lot of interpersonal constructs.

==Theory constructions==
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Graphical Representation.svg|thumb|Schematic describing Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory]]
Gudykunst uses two types of theoretical statements to construct his theory; axioms and theorems. Axioms are "propositions that involve variables that are taken to be directly linked causally; axioms should therefore be statements that imply direct causal links among variables"&lt;ref name="Blalock"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/25192027|title=Theory construction : from verbal to mathematical formulations|last=Blalock|first=Hubert M|date=1969|publisher=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0139133435|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Some axioms do not apply in all situations. Boundary conditions specify when the axioms hold. The axioms can be combined to derive theorems. When combined the axioms and theorems form a "casual process" theory&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;Reynolds, P. D. 1971.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primer in theory construction. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. that explains effective communication.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}} Dialectical processes influence much of our communication within specific interactions. To illustrate, uncertainty involves a dialectic between predictability and novelty. In the current version of the theory, dialectics are incorporated as boundary conditions for the axioms where applicable.

Gudykunst states that in generating the axioms for the theory he assumed that managing anxiety and uncertainty are “basic causes” influencing effective communication. Other variables (e.g. self-concepts, motivation, reactions to strangers, social categorization, situational processes, connections with strangers, ethical interactions, anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness and effective communication), are treated as "superficial causes" of effective communication. The influence of these “superficial causes” on effective communication is mediated through anxiety and uncertainty. Being mindful allows us to engage in anxiety and uncertainty management.

Gudykunst uses 47 [[axioms]] as building blocks for the theorems of AUM. Axioms can be thought of as the lowest common denominators from which all causal theorems are derived.

==Self-concepts==
Axioms one through five all relate to our views of ourselves, or self-concepts. Gudykunst includes personal identities, social identities, and collective self-esteem in this category. Social identities are employed when we try to predict intergroup behavior and personal identities are naturally employed for interpersonal behavior. They both act in such a way as to help us manage uncertainty and anxiety by sufficiently predicting behavior. If either of these identities feels threatened, Gudykunst believes that we will attempt to raise collective self-esteem and hence fostering a more positive outcome. The greater our self-esteem, the better we are able to manage our anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man.|last=Ernest.|first=Becker|date=1972|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|isbn=978-0029021903|location=|pages=|oclc=651907062}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Motivation==
Gudykunst's next set of axioms suggest that our motivation to interact with strangers is directly related to the fulfillment of needs. First, we have a need to trust others to behave favorably or at least in an expected manner. Second, and only in the context of intergroup relations, we need to feel inclusion with the group or anxiety will surely develop. Paradoxically, the third need that Gudykunst points out is our need for self-concept confirmation. We want to be included in the group, but not to the extent that our identity is lost in the crowd.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Reactions to strangers==
We tend to act more favorably toward strangers whose mannerisms and beliefs converge with our own. In this case, we have a greater propensity to exhibit empathy, tolerate more ambiguity, and have a less rigid social posture when seeking closure. A rigid attitude, or close-minded thinking, leads us to seek closure to an interaction in the most direct way possible. If we were to exhibit [[empathy]] and attempt to think more objectively about the perspective of the stranger, we should in turn be postured to accept more ambiguity and seek the most appropriate solution instead of the most direct.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Social categorization of strangers==
The next seven axioms of this theory focus on how people order their social environments into categories. When people categorize themselves, they become aware of being members of [[ingroup]]s and [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]s, which generates [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]]. People tend to have more categories for their ingroup than they do for an outgroup, but the more familiar they are with an outgroup, the more categories they see. The categories that people create for outgroups will lead to expectations about the behavior of a member of that group, which can be either positive or negative. Expectations then help people predict, accurately or inaccurately, a stranger's behavior.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Situational processes==
The next four [[axioms]] are based on the situations in which communication occurs. People have different [[behavioral script|scripts]] they expect to follow for a given situation, much like actors may follow a [[movie script]]. Miscommunication occurs when people follow a script they assume the stranger with whom they are communicating to be familiar. People also react to strangers differently based on the conditions in which they interact. For example, cooperation was found to lead to positive feelings towards those one is working with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/276646|title=Cooperation: the basis of sociability|last=Argyle|first=Michael|date=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415035453|location=London ; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People also tend to have less anxiety when there are other members of their ingroups present. Power also affects communication, and a person who feels they have less power than the stranger in an interaction will feel more anxiety towards that interaction.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Connections with strangers==
The next five axioms are based on connections between people. What the axioms come to is the more connected people feel to strangers, the less [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]] they feel in communicating with them. These connections come from [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], [[interdependence]], levels of [[intimacy]], and number of the same people both communicators know.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Ethical interactions==
The next three axioms are based on [[dignity]] and [[respect]]. Both dignity and respect are assumed to be returned when given to a stranger. This leads to moral inclusiveness, which is good for interactions with strangers because both sides expect the rules of fair play to apply to them. When strangers are considered morally excluded, they are treated almost as nonexistent, or as not deserving of respect or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opotow|first=Susan|date=1990-04-01|title=Moral Exclusion and Injustice: An Introduction|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00268.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral inclusiveness applies not only to communication, but also to bystanders not actively involved in communication with strangers. For example, if a person makes an anti-[[prejudice]] statement, the people he or she is with are less likely to make a [[prejudiced]] statement towards a stranger.

==Anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness, and effective communication==
Langer states that mindfulness involves creating new categories, an openness to new information, and being aware of strangers' perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindfulness|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|date=1989|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co|isbn=978-0201523416|location=Reading, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18779775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness is essential for effective communication and one needs to develop mindful ways of learning about strangers. Langer concludes that this should involve: openness to "novelty", awareness of distinctions, being sensitive to different contexts, an awareness of multiple perspectives, and an orientation to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The power of mindful learning|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=978-0738219080|edition=|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=914195352}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, strangers are usually more mindful and able to "negotiate potentially problematic social interactions more effectively" than ingroup members.&lt;ref&gt;Devine, P., Evett, S., &amp; Vasquez-Suson, K. (1996). "Exploring the interpersonal dynamics of intergroup contact". In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition''. (Vol 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;423–464). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ingroup members should be mindful of the process of communicating as opposed to being mindful of the outcome of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=Sage|others=|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=305|oclc=55800766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following five axioms are essential for effective communication because they focus on the basic causes and processes of effective communication whereas the previous 34 axioms focused on managing our anxiety and uncertainty when communicating with strangers.

==Cross-cultural variability in AUM processes==
Gudykunst believes that for the theory to be complete there must be a cultural level of analysis included and that the axioms regarding cultural variability should only be tested on the cultural level. It is necessary to address cross-cultural variability in the major components of the theory because different types of anxiety are emphasized more in some cultures than in others. This is because there are differences in the dynamics of stranger-ingroup relationships across cultures. For example, Triandis offers that collectivist cultures tend to make a stronger distinction between ingroup and outgroup members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individualism And Collectivism|authorlink1=Harry C. Triandis|last=Triandis|first=Harry C.|date=1995-05-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780813318509|location=Boulder, Colo.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} whereas members of individualistic cultures usually only draw as sharp of distinctions among differing ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=Sage|others=|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=307|oclc=55800766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
There are many ways AUM theory can be applied. It can be effective in studying the behavior of a stranger adjusting to a new culture, as well as in examining how individuals communicate with strangers and often accurately predict their behavior; this is done when we are mindful. Gudykunst explains that some axioms can be combined to form theorems. These theorems that are generated might be consistent with previous research, while others might be useful for future study. He notes that not all axioms can be combined to form a new theorem. Huber and Sorrentino&lt;ref name="Huber"&gt;Huber, G., &amp; Sorrentino, R. (1996). ''Uncertainty in interpersonal and intergroup relations.'' In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition'' (Vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;591–619). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} differentiate between certainty–oriented individuals and uncertainty-oriented individuals and argue that theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations have an "uncertainty orientation" bias. Gudykunst gives three reasons why AUM theory is not limited to uncertainty-oriented individuals. First, uncertainty-orientation is incorporated into the theory. Second, the superficial causes or factors that influence our uncertainty in a situation influence the amount of uncertainty we feel. Lastly, our personality characteristics influence our behavior only when we are not mindful. Gudykunst also defends the number of axioms in the theory because when the goal of a theory is to improve communication, one cannot afford to be vague. Gudykunst acknowledges that there are certain areas where additional research is needed. For instance, one cannot always be mindful when communicating. Potential problems then refer to the recognition of instances in which mindfulness is needed and defining the optimal levels of anxiety or uncertainty. Future research needs to develop ways to measure an individual's minimum and maximum thresholds of uncertainty and anxiety in the same way that anxiety and uncertainty are measured. AUM theory is in a constant state of revision and even the current version of the theory is not complete.

===Critiques by Griffin and Ting-Toomey ===
Griffin identifies the complexity of the AUM theory as a weakness arguing, "hypothetically, the 47 axioms could spawn over a thousand theorems."&lt;ref name="Critique"&gt;.{{Cite journal|last=Yoshitake|first=M.|date=2002|title=Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: A critical examination of an intercultural communication theory|url=https://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/13-Masaki-Yoshitake.pdf|journal=Intercultural Communication Studies|volume=11|pages=177–193|via=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Potential expansion of the axioms as a result of incorporation of more cultural variability indicates the possibility of causing greater confusion and complication.

Ting-Toomey explores the content of AUM theory as a potential weakness demanding further revision of the theories. She points out five conceptual issues in relation to URT and the social penetration theory.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

''' Conceptual issues of URT and Social Penetration Theory:'''&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;
## the need for motivational factors and other variables of the host side that influence the uncertainty reduction process;
## the lack of attention to relational changes;
## the necessity of actual research on dyadic effect of reciprocity;
## the inevitability of integration of more contextual dimensions into the theories and research;

===Limited focus: effective communication===
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Critique.svg|thumb|Visual representation of Yoshitake's critique of AUM theory.]]

The AUM theory regards effective communication as a primary construct, defining effective communication as the attribution of the closest meaning to incoming messages as intended by the sender which would minimise misunderstanding. This view leads to two potential problems as the definition of effective communication and effective communication as the goal of ICC.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of the definition of effective communication===
There are various reasons for human communication which lead to questioning the possibility and the necessity of attributing the closest meaning to such great variety of communication situations. The AUM theory regards effective communication as attribution of the closest  meaning to the intended meaning diminishes communication mechanical and linear activity "where messages are transferred from sender to receiver".&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of effective communication as a goal of ICC===

AUM theory defines the goal of effective communication as the decrease of miscommunication. Such perspective on communication is mechanical with little emotional attachment, regarding pure communication without misattribution as ideal. As great importance is given to efficiency, culture is referred to as “noise” that obstructs the smooth transition of communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Excessive reliance on consciousness===
Anxiety/uncertainty management theory has been criticised for its heavy focus on the person being mindful during communications, with there being an assumption that a person should have to adopt a high level of consciousness throughout communication. However the theory is difficult to apply to instances where a person is compelled by emotion or irrationality, which overrides conscious thought to reach an end goal during communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Meta-theoretical critique===
The meta-theoretical assumptions specific to Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory have been critiqued by Masaki Yoshitake of the University of Oklahoma, who suggests that anxiety/uncertainty management theory is inherently inefficient when attempting to describe a universal experience shared between strangers and members of different cultures. Yoshitake states that it is questionable whether interpersonal communication is really a pure form of communication and suggests a difficulty to determine what is in the mind of a person from another culture altogether. Yoshitake asserts that pure communication never exists in the first place, as every attempt to share a direct experience is mitigated by the limitations of a person's own perceptions. This results in an ever-present "otherness" in communication. Such commentary is a product of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] thought.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

The training of an architectural technologist concentrates on the ever-increasingly complex technical aspects in a building project, but matters of aesthetics, space, light and circulation are also involved within the technical design, leading the professional to assume decisions which are also non-technical.&lt;ref&gt; Breakfast with Arup: Tuesday 11 December 2012, Paul Nuttall, Director, Building Engineering London, Arup In this talk, Paul Nuttall shares his insights on designing buildings in the 21st Century. The presentation explains how the work of the architect, engineer and technologist are related / similar with a different optic and a different approach / philosophy of the project.  The video is widely available on youtube and other websites. &lt;/ref&gt;
    
Most architectural technologists are employed in architectural and engineering firms, or with municipal authorities; but many provide independent professional services directly to clients,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workingincanada.gc.ca/report-eng.do?noc=2251&amp;action=search_occupation_confirm Architectural Technologists and Technicians], Working in Canada, Government information website&lt;/ref&gt; although restricted by law in some countries. Others work in product development or sales with manufacturers.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Hong-Kong]] (Chartered Architectural Technologist), [[Canada]] (Architectural Technologist or Applied Science Technologist), [[Argentina]] (M.M.O Maestro Mayor de Obras / Chartered Architecture &amp; Building Science Technologist) and other nations, they have many abilities which are extremely useful in a technological sense to work alongside architects, engineers and other professionals - the training of a technologist  provides skills in building and architectural technology. It is an important role in the current building climate. Architectural technologists may be directors or shareholders of an architectural firm (where permitted by the jurisdiction and legal structure). To become an architectural technologist, a four-year degree (or equivalent) in Architectural Technology is required, which can be followed by a Master's Degree, with structured professional and occupational experience.

==By country==

===Canada===
Most [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] in Canada have an association representing architectural technologists and technicians. On behalf of the public, the [[provincial government]]s have granted the provincial architect's associations with the privilege to regulate the profession.

In the province of [[Ontario]], there were protracted efforts by the Association of Architectural Technologists of Ontario (AATO) to persuade the provincial government and the Ontario Association of Architects (OAA) that the public may be served by having technicians and technologists also design small buildings. In 2003, OAA's efforts to work with AATO failed and, instead, OAA established a relationship with the Ontario Associated of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists (OACETT). This joint effort resulted in the creation of a new association called the Ontario Association for Applied Architectural Sciences (OAAAS). Through OAAAS, a qualified technologist can be licensed by the OAA as a Licensed Technologist OAA, with authority to design small buildings. In 2011, OACETT withdrew and OAA embraced OAAAS as its Technology Program.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland|RIAI]] declares being the leading professional body for Architectural Technologists in Ireland. The RIAI recognises the professional Architectural Technologist as a technical designer, skilled in the application and integration of construction technologies in the building design process. RIAI Architectural Technologists are recognised as professional partners to Architects in the delivery of exemplary buildings in the Republic of Ireland and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riai.ie/uploads/files/RIAI_Standard_Knowledge_Skill_Competence_Architectural_Technologist_2010.pdf RIAI Standard of Knowledge, Skill and Competence for Practice as an Architectural Technologist (2010)], as published on RIAI website&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland has always prevented its technician members to provide a full architectural service. Many qualified architectural technologists believe that a conflict of interest exists, that the RIAI represents architects and cannot adequately defend the interests of architectural technologists: "The RIAI acts as the Registration Body and Competent Authority for "Architects" in Ireland and only provides support services for Irish AT'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Irish-register-Architectural-Technologists-3788787.S.116501217 "An Irish Register for Architectural Technologists" Linkedin conversation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another representative body is the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists [[Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists|(CIAT)]]. The technical membership of the RIAI (RIAI tech) is equivalent to the technician membership of CIAT (TCIAT). Chartered members of CIAT (MCIAT) are qualified and recognised to lead a project from inception through to completion. The RIAI and the CIAT were represented within the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB) which advised the Minister for the Environment on matters relating to the Building Regulations. BRAB is no longer active.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to BRAB (Building Regulations Advisory Body) as per the [http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/BuildingStandards/BRAB/ Irish Minister for the Environment website]&lt;/ref&gt;  CIAT is now challenging the Building Control Regulations 2014, which are depriving its members from providing full architectural services in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0009.pdf Building Control Regulations 2014] as published by the Irish Government&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish Government appears to have no valid reason to prevent CIAT members from practising in the Republic of Ireland. The restrictions imposed on members of the CIAT are viewed as anti-competitive and in breach of European Law for free movement of services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2014-000236+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en Parliamentary question from MEP Mairead McGuinness as published on the European Commission website: "On 1 March 2014 national legislation, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013, will come into force in Ireland. The new legislation precludes chartered architectural technologists(1) from providing their current professional services within the building environment. In anticipation of the implementation of the regulations, chartered architectural technologists are reporting a number of difficulties, such as restrictions reducing the number of members of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) who can bid for projects due to commence after March 2014. They say that this results in a loss of potential clients as well as economic loss. Does the Commission interpret the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013 as a breach of EC law, specifically legislation relating to competition and the free market? Does the Commission feel that the new legislation prevents chartered architectural technologists from earning a living in their field of training and expertise(2)?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The CIAT is awaiting for an opinion from the European Commission on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140321022820/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2014-000236&amp;language=EN Answer to parliamentary question] given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission as published on the European Commission website: "The Commission is aware of the introduction of a register for architects and building surveyors by the Building Control Act of 2007. On 1 March 2014 this regulation will be amended to circumscribe the profile of professionals who can design, inspect and certify for compliance all buildings greater than 40 square meters. Such regulatory protection, for a profession with not only significant safety but also environmental and urban impacts, is common across many Members States and as such Ireland is not a minority in seeking to reassure that standards are made, met and maintained.
The Commission has received a number of complaints raising concerns that the actions of the Irish government and the impact of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulation 2013 pose a breach of EC law in areas on the recognition of professional qualifications, freedom of movement and, with specific regard to its impact on Architectural Technologists.
Commission services are currently examining the issues raised to determine any possible contraventions of EC law and if any actions may be necessary in such cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]] the profession is by the South African Institute of Architectural Technologists SAIAT.&lt;ref&gt;Website of the South African Institute of Architectural Technologists [http://www.saiat.org.za/ SAIAT]&lt;/ref&gt; Senior architectural technologists (10 years or more in practice) enjoy the same statute than architects. The [[South African Institute of Architects]] (SAIA) explains that: "Architecture can be practiced in one of four categories of registered person, namely professional architect, professional senior architectural technologist, professional technologist or professional draughtsperson. The possibility of progression from one category to the next has been provided for in the Regulations."&lt;ref&gt;refer to the website of the South African Institute of Architects [http://saia.org.za/education_careers.php SAIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210063530/http://saia.org.za/education_careers.php |date=December 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, chartered architectural technologists enjoy the same status as architects. They deliver similar services with a different orientation. The Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists [[Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists|CIAT]] regulates the profession. CIAT defines chartered architectural technologists as follow: Chartered Architectural Technologists provide architectural design services and solutions. They are specialists in the science of architecture, building design and construction and form the link between concept and construction. They negotiate the construction project and manage the process from conception through to completion. Chartered Architectural Technologists, MCIAT, may practise on their own account or with fellow Chartered Architectural Technologists, architects, engineers, surveyors and other professionals within the construction industry. As professionals adhering to a Code of Conduct, they are required to obtain and maintain mandatory Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) if providing services directly to clients.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Lancashire County Council website: "[http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/consumer-advice/consumer-advice-information/details.aspx?doc_id=292603&amp;cat_id=12 Consumer Advice]"&lt;/ref&gt; They specify products with reference to the ''[[RIBA Product Selector]]'', ''Architects Standard Catalogue'', ''Barbour Index''&lt;ref name="Yeomans2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David T Yeomans|author2=Stephen Emmitt|title=Specifying Buildings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ota1ylQwWjwC&amp;pg=PT207|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=23 April 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-36538-6|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trade literature.

[[Image:Maciejowski Tower of Babel.jpg|thumb|right|A high medieval construction site from the [[Maciejowski Bible]].]]
'''''Artes Mechanicae''''' or '''mechanical arts''', are a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills, often juxtaposed to the traditional seven liberal arts [[Artes liberales]]. Also called "servile" and "vulgar",&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Cicero's''De Officiis'', Book I, xxlii.&lt;/ref&gt; from antiquity they had been deemed unbecoming for a free man, as ministering to baser needs.

==Overview==
[[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (9th century) divides them somewhat arbitrarily into seven parts: 
*''vestiaria'' ([[tailor]]ing, [[weaving]])
*''agricultura'' ([[agriculture]])
*''architectura'' ([[architecture]], [[masonry]])
*''militia''  and ''venatoria'' ([[war]]fare and [[hunting]], Military education, "[[martial arts]]")
*''mercatura'' ([[trade]])
*''coquinaria'' ([[cooking]])
*''metallaria'' ([[blacksmithing]], [[metallurgy]])&lt;ref&gt;In his commentary on Martianus Capella's early fifth century work, ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'', one of the main sources for medieval reflection on the liberal arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Didascalicon]]'', [[Hugh of St Victor]] (12th century) includes [[navigation]], [[medicine]] and [[theatre|theatrical arts]] instead of commerce, agriculture and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Hugues de Saint-Victor, ''Libri septem eruditiones didascaliae'', ch.26 (PL 176, col.760): lanificium, armaturum, navigationem, agriculturem, venationem, medicinam, theatricam&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh's treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity, a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals.&lt;ref&gt;See Georges Legoff, ''Time, Work and Culture in the Middle Ages'', (Chicago, University of Chicago Press) 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention of Art"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiner | first = Dr. Larry | year = 2003 | pages = 28–30 |title=[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]] |publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of the ''Artes Mechanicae'' as applied [[geometry]] was introduced to Western Europe by [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] (12th century) under the influence of his readings in Arabic scholarship.

In the 19th century "mechanic arts" referred to fields of which some are now known as [[engineering]].  Use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the [[performing arts]] and the [[fine arts]] which were for the upper class of the time, and the [[intelligentsia]].  The mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families.

Related phrases, "[[useful arts]]," or "applied arts" probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general.

The most famous usage of the term "mechanic arts" (and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today) is in the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].

{{Atmospheric sciences}}
'''Atmospheric chemistry''' is a branch of [[atmospheric science]] in which the [[chemistry]] of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and that of other planets is studied. It is a [[multidisciplinary approach]] of research and draws on [[environmental chemistry]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]], [[computer modeling]], [[oceanography]], [[geology]] and [[volcanology]] and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other arenas of study such as [[climatology]].

The composition and chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and [[living organisms]]. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as [[volcano]] emissions, [[lightning]] and bombardment by solar particles from [[corona]]. It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], [[photochemical smog]], [[greenhouse gas]]es and [[global warming]]. Atmospheric chemists seek to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.

== History ==
[[Image:Atmosphere composition diagram-en.svg|thumb|290px|left|Schematic of chemical and transport processes related to atmospheric composition.]]
The ancient [[Greeks]] regarded air as one of the [[four elements]]. The first scientific studies of atmospheric composition began in the 18th century, as chemists such as [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] made the first measurements of the composition of the atmosphere.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries interest shifted towards trace constituents with very small concentrations. One particularly important discovery for atmospheric chemistry was the discovery of [[ozone]] by [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] in 1840.

In the 20th century atmospheric science moved on from studying the composition of air to a consideration of how the concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere have changed over time and the chemical processes which create and destroy compounds in the air. Two particularly important examples of this were the explanation by [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[Gordon Dobson]] of how the [[ozone layer]] is created and maintained, and the explanation of [[photochemical smog]] by [[Arie Jan Haagen-Smit]]. Further studies on ozone issues led to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry award shared between [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Mario Molina]] and [[Frank Sherwood Rowland]].&lt;ref name= "NobelPrize1995"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/press-release/ |title=Press Release - 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=October 11, 1995 |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=Nobel Prize Org |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century the focus is now shifting again. Atmospheric chemistry is increasingly studied as one part of the [[Earth science#Earth system science|Earth system]]. Instead of concentrating on atmospheric chemistry in isolation the focus is now on seeing it as one part of a single system with the rest of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]],  [[biosphere]] and [[geosphere]]. An especially important driver for this is the links between chemistry and [[climate]] such as the effects of changing climate on the recovery of the ozone hole and vice versa but also interaction of the composition of the atmosphere with the oceans and terrestrial [[ecosystems]].

== Methodology ==
Observations, lab measurements, and modeling are the three central elements in atmospheric chemistry. Progress in atmospheric chemistry is often driven by the interactions between these components and they form an integrated whole. For example, observations may tell us that more of a chemical compound exists than previously thought possible. This will stimulate new modelling and laboratory studies which will increase our scientific understanding to a point where the observations can be explained.

=== Observation ===
Observations of atmospheric chemistry are essential to our understanding. Routine observations of chemical composition tell us about changes in atmospheric composition over time. One important example of this is the [[Keeling Curve]] - a series of measurements from 1958 to today which  show a steady rise in of the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (see also [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere#Ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO2|ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]). Observations of atmospheric chemistry are made in observatories such as that on [[Mauna Loa]] and on mobile platforms such as aircraft (e.g. the UK's [[Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements]]), ships and balloons. Observations of atmospheric composition are increasingly made by [[satellites]] with important instruments such as [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|GOME]] and [[MOPITT]] giving a global picture of air pollution and chemistry. Surface observations have the advantage that they provide long term records at high time resolution but are limited in the vertical and horizontal space they provide observations from. Some surface based instruments e.g. [[LIDAR]] can provide concentration profiles of chemical compounds and aerosol but are still restricted in the horizontal region they can cover. Many observations are available on line in [[Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases]].

=== Laboratory studies ===
Measurements made in the laboratory are essential to our understanding of the sources and sinks of pollutants and naturally occurring compounds. These experiments are performed in controlled environments that allow for the individual evaluation of specific chemical reactions or the assessment of properties of a particular atmospheric constituent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Future of Atmospheric Research: Remembering Yesterday, Understanding Today, Anticipating Tomorrow|vauthors = ((National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine))|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-309-44565-8|location=Washington, DC|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of analysis that are of interest includes both those on gas-phase reactions, as well as [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] reactions that are relevant to the formation and growth of [[aerosol]]s. Also of high importance is the study of atmospheric [[photochemistry]] which quantifies how the rate in which molecules are split apart by sunlight and what resulting products are. In addition, [[thermodynamic]] data such as [[Henry's law]] coefficients can also be obtained.

=== Modeling ===
In order to synthesise and test theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry, computer models (such as [[chemical transport model]]s) are used. Numerical models solve the differential equations governing the concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere. They can be very simple or very complicated. One common trade off in numerical models is between the number of chemical compounds and chemical reactions modelled versus the representation of transport and mixing in the atmosphere. For example, a box model might include hundreds or even thousands of chemical reactions but will only have a very crude representation of mixing in the atmosphere. In contrast, 3D models represent many of the physical processes of the atmosphere but due to constraints on computer resources will have far fewer chemical reactions and compounds. Models can be used to interpret observations, test understanding of chemical reactions and predict future concentrations of chemical compounds in the atmosphere. One important current trend is for atmospheric chemistry modules to become one part of earth system models in which the links between climate, atmospheric composition and the biosphere can be studied.

Some models are constructed by automatic code generators (e.g. [[Autochem]] or [[Kinetic PreProcessor|KPP]]). In this approach a set of constituents are chosen and the automatic code generator will then select the reactions involving those constituents from a set of reaction databases. Once the reactions have been chosen the [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODE) that describe their time evolution can be automatically constructed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15497">'''Attribute substitution''', also known as '''Substitution bias''', is a psychological process thought to underlie a number of [[cognitive bias]]es and [[optical illusion|perceptual illusions]]. It occurs when an individual has to make a judgment (of a ''target attribute'') that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] attribute''.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newell |first=Benjamin R. |first2=David A. |last2=Lagnado |first3=David R. |last3=Shanks  |title=Straight choices: the psychology of decision making |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=71–74 |isbn=978-1-84169-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic ''intuitive'' judgment system, rather than the more self-aware ''reflective'' system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Associative processes in intuitive judgment|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S1364661310001713/abstract|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2010-01-10|issn = 1364-6613|pmid = 20696611|pages = 435–440|volume = 14|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.004|language = English|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Kahneman|pmc = 5378157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

The theory of attribute substitution unifies a number of separate explanations of reasoning errors in terms of [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|cognitive heuristics]].&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt; In turn, the theory is subsumed by an ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K. Shah and [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]], which states that people use a variety of techniques to reduce the effort of making decisions.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
In a 1974 paper, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] argued that a broad family of biases (systematic errors in judgment and decision) were explainable in terms of a few heuristics (information-processing shortcuts), including [[availability heuristic|availability]] and [[representativeness heuristic|representativeness]]. In a 2002 revision of the theory, Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed attribute substitution as a process underlying these and other effects.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Shane |last2=Frederick  |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g., the brightness of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded neurally in a way that is independent of [[stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be unrelated.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

== Conditions ==
{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450 |width=30% |align=right}}
Kahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;
# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible. Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory ("What is your birthday?") or about current experience ("Do you feel thirsty now?).
# An associated attribute is highly accessible. This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life who is then asked about their happiness might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than answer the question as asked.
# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system. For example, when asked "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |date=December 2003 |title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics |journal= American Economic Review |publisher=American Economic Association |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1449–1475 |doi=10.1257/000282803322655392 |issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.

==Examples==
[[File:Opt taeuschung groesse.jpg|thumb|225px|right|This illusion works because 3D (perspective) size is substituted for 2D size (all pairs are equal in size)]]

===Optical illusions===
Attribute substitution explains the persistence of some illusions. For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] picture, their apparent sizes can be distorted by the 3D context, making a convincing optical illusion. The theory states that the three-dimensional size of the figure (which is accessible because it is automatically computed by the visual system) is substituted for its two-dimensional size on the page. Experienced painters and photographers are less susceptible to this illusion, because the two-dimensional size is more accessible to their perception.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt;

===Valuing insurance===
Kahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. The former group were willing to pay more even though "death of any kind" includes "death in a terrorist attack", Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip.

===Stereotypes===
[[Stereotypes]] can be a source of heuristic attributes.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt; In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a [[stereotype]] about the relative [[intelligence]] of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.

===Morality and fairness===
[[Cass Sunstein|Sunstein]] argued that attribute substitution is pervasive when people reason about [[morality|moral]], [[political]], or [[legal]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2005 |title=Moral Heuristics |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages= 531–542 |issn=0140-525X |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000099 |pmid= 16209802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a difficult, novel problem in these areas, people search for a more familiar, related problem (a "prototypical case") and apply its solution as the solution to the harder problem. According to Sunstein, the opinions of [[Authority bias|trusted]] political or religious [[Argument from authority|authorities]] can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405–434 |url=http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |accessdate=2009-09-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610021623/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics demanded more evidence from Sunstein.&lt;ref name="shah2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author-link2=Daniel M. Oppenheimer|first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer  |date=March 2008 |title=Heuristics Made Easy: An Effort-Reduction Framework |journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=207–222 |issn=1939-1455 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.2.207 |pmid=18298269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beautiful-is-familiar effect===
Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before. It is repeatedly found that attractive faces are more likely to be mistakenly labeled as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monin |first=Benoît |first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer |year=2005 |title=Correlated Averages vs. Averaged Correlations: Demonstrating the Warm Glow Heuristic Beyond Aggregation |journal=Social Cognition |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–278 |issn=0278-016X |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Opp%20Demonstrating%20the%20Warm%20Glow%20Heuristic.pdf |doi=10.1521/soco.2005.23.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monin interprets this result in terms of attribute substitution. The heuristic attribute in this case is a "warm glow"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive. This interpretation has been criticised, because not all the [[variance]] in the familiarity data is accounted for by attractiveness.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==Evidence==
The most direct evidence, according to Kahneman,&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt; is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of Tom&amp;nbsp;W., a fictional graduate student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237–51 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of subjects had to rate Tom's ''similarity'' to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate ''how likely'' it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by [[probability]], then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom is more likely to be a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8400">[[File:Audicom5.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Solidyne's Audicom 5 running on Windows 98]]
'''Audicom''' (from “'''Audi'''o en '''com'''putadora”, Spanish for “Audio in computer”), released in 1989, was the world's first [[personal computer|PC]]-based [[broadcast automation]] system to use [[audio compression (data)|audio data compression]] technology based on [[psychoacoustics]].

The audio card was designed with standard [[CMOS logic]] [[Integrated circuit|ICs]] and used hardware to perform an audio data compression algorithm named ECAM,  based on the critical bands masking principle, a property of the human ear. Today the same principle is used in all major [[lossy audio compression]] [[Audio codec|codecs]]. The audio card was plugged into an [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA slot]] of the PC and worked using [[direct memory access]] to the host memory. The driver and the client application were developed by Gustavo Pesci,&lt;ref name="solidyne4"&gt;[http://www.gustavopesci.com Gustavo Pesci Bio]&lt;/ref&gt; while the hardware was designed by Ricardo Sidoti and Elio Demaria.&lt;ref name="solidyne5"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/187775-la-historia-de-un-pionero-del-audio-digital La historia del Audicom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all the radio stations in the world today are using some similar technology, now manufactured by a lot of companies around the world.&lt;ref name="solidyne3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zD9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=solidyne+audicom&amp;dq=solidyne+audicom&amp;pgis=1 Audicom introduced at LAB]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Audicom's software versions==
[[File:Audicom66.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Solidyne's Audicom 6.6 running on Windows XP]]
Audicom (mid-1980s): first version, included a hardware compression audio card: ADX903

Audicom II (1989): most popular version for DOS systems, exported to more than 30 countries. Introduced the concept of [[Playlist]] for computer systems, and created the concept of [[Live Assist]]. When working in automatic mode, the music was selected from several directories with the /RANDOM command allowing the rotate styles along the day.

Audicom III &amp; 4: not released, but developed internally. Audicom 4 was the first version intended to be a Windows version (for 16 bit Windows), but due to problems in the Win16 platform it was canceled in favor of a Win32 system (Audicom 5). The change (including staff change) caused a delay to the project of two years.

Audicom 5 (Introduced at CAPER 96, commercially available at 1997): first Windows system available. There were two versions (both Win32 applications): ECAM and multimedia. The multimedia version included the option of an 'audio co-processor card' (a compressor-expanser for greater dynamic range with conventional sound cards). New ECAM cards allowd to perform the mixing on the same card. Multimedia version used two cards for mixing and 3 cards for mix and cue (which was pretty hard to install on a same PC). The Audicom 5 introduced a novel concept of [[Artificial intelligence]] for selecting music called [[AutoDJ]], which allowed for '1 second precision' to meet the spots schedule on real time (the operator can add or remove titles and the autoDJ will meet the schedule without cut any music). Other novelty was the virtual locator, which announces weather condition and time (based on a text to speech algorithm). A weather station was available as optional (SMT-100).

Audicom 6 (October 2000): Only a multimedia version. It introduced a new play engine based on DirectX, allowing mixing on the same audio card. First broadcasting audio system to support [[MP3]], allowing cross-fade within two different MP3 files and CUE concurrently (all software decoding). The product was partnered with the PCI audio card [[SX46]].

Audicom 7 (August 2002): Included multiuser support, network ready, included autoEdit (automatic editing of MP3's files without recompressing), full MP3 mixing. Also was partnered with an advanced PCI audio card: [[DSP48]].

==Modern systems for radio automation ==
In 1983 Oscar Bonello a radio automation pioneer, and Engineering professor at the University of Buenos Aires and [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies, or speciality training|Fellow]] of the AES (USA) start researching about using the recently developed IBM PC computer. The problems that he faced were: 1) Create an audio PC card of good audio quality; 2) Create a bit compression algorithm; 3) Create the Automation software to be run from the PC.&lt;ref name="solidyne2"&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2384 New Improvements in Audio Signal Processing for AM Broadcasting by Bonello, Oscar]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The audio card was designed with standard CMOS logic ICs and perform by hardware the ECAM bit compression algorithm based on the principle of Critical Bands Masking a property of the ear (see a brief History at MP3 ). Today the same principle as the one used by Bonello is used in all the lossy audio bit compression systems, included MP3. The audio card was designed for the old ISA slots of the PC and works using direct access to PC memory. The driver for this software was developed by Gustavo Pesci, a young software engineer, formerly a pupil of Bonello at University. The card hardware was designed for Ricardo Sidoti and Elio Demaria, both brilliant electronic engineers.

The Radio Automation system was launched in 1987 under the name Audicom The software initially ran on DOS and was further changed by Sebastian Ledesma to Windows, using an Artificial Intelligence concept. Twenty years after the original Bonello invention, almost all the radio stations at the world use the same technology, now manufactured by various companies around the world. Mr Bonello refuses to apply for any type of invention patent. 

Modern systems typically run on [[hard disk]], where all of the [[music]], [[jingle]]s, [[advertisement]]s, [[voice track]]s and other announcements are stored. These [[computer file]]s may be either [[data compression|compressed]] or uncompressed,  often with a minimal compression as a [[compromise]].

[[Scheduling (broadcasting)|Scheduling]] was an important advance of these systems—allowing for exact timing. Some systems use [[GPS]] [[satellite]] [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] to obtain exact [[atomic time]], for perfect [[synchronization]] with [[communications satellite|satellite-delivered]] [[Radio programming|programming]].
	 
Automation systems are now more [[interactive]] than ever with [[Digital data|digital]] [[mixing console]]s and can even [[Sound recording and reproduction|record]] from a [[telephone hybrid]] to play back an edited [[conversation]] with a [[telephone call]]er.

The simplest arrangements can even be done on [[software]] as basic as [[Winamp]].

There is also a trend in radio to use [[voice-tracking]] production techniques which make the live presenter in the studio, less critical in the overall broadcast; a great number of [[Internet radio]] and [[variety hits]] stations use automation software and voice-tracking to completely replace live on-air talent

The Audicom cards are a family of PC audio cards developed by Solidyne. They were intended to the broadcasting market and some models included the Audicom broadcasting system. 
[[File:ADX922 audio card.JPG|thumb|450px|center|Solidyne's PC card model ADX922]]

In the mid-1980s Solidyne, a broadcast manufacturer company, started the project of recording audio in a PC to automate the spots emission (at that time done by cartridges). By that time, the hard disk were very expensive and extremely small (a PC hard drive allowed 10MBytes of storage), so the engineers knew that they needed to develop a system to reduce the required bits as much as possible in order to be successful. The result was the ECAM audio system, the first system was shown to the 'Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica de la Nacion de la Republica Argentina' in 1988.&lt;ref name="solidney1"&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=6674 PC-Controlled Psychoacoustic Audio Processor by Bonello, Oscar Juan]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuculus canorus 1873.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]]'s well-known call is used in music by [[Beethoven]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], [[Handel]], [[Respighi]], [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Saint-Saens]], and [[Vivaldi]]. Engraving by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], 1873]]

'''Birds''' have played a role in Western Classical '''music''' since at least the 14th century, when composers such as [[Jean Vaillant]] quoted [[birdsong]] in some of their compositions. Among the birds whose song is most often used in music are the [[nightingale]] and the [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]].

Composers and musicians have made use of birds in their music in different ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as [[Ottorino Respighi]] first did; or, like the cellist [[Beatrice Harrison]] in 1924 and more recently the [[jazz]] musician [[David Rothenberg]], they can duet with birds.

Authors including Rothenberg have claimed that birds such as the [[hermit thrush]]&lt;!--see body of article--&gt; sing on traditional scales as used in human music, but at least one songbird, the [[nightingale wren]], does not choose notes in this way. However, among birds which habitually borrow phrases or sounds from other species such as the [[European starling|starling]], the way they use variations of rhythm, relationships of [[musical pitch]], and combinations of [[musical note|note]]s can resemble music. The similar motor constraints on human and avian song may have driven these to have similar song structures, including "arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases", long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes, at least in birds with a strong song structure like the [[Certhia familiaris|Eurasian treecreeper]].&lt;ref name=Tierney2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tierney |first=Adam T. |last2=Russo |first2=Frank A. |last3=Patel |first3=Aniruddh D. |date=September 2011 |title=The motor origins of human and avian song structure |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/37/15510|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=108 |issue=37 |pages=15510–15515 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1103882108 |pmid=21876156 |pmc=3174665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on music==
{{further information|Zoomusicology}}

[[Musicologists]] such as Matthew Head and Suzannah Clark believe that [[birdsong]] has had a large though admittedly unquantifiable influence on the development of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthew Head |title=Birdsong and the Origins of Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1093/jrma/122.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Suzannah |year=2001 |title=Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century |journal=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-77191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birdsong has influenced composers in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works; or they can duet with birds.

===Imitations of birdsong===

====Bird models====
In classical music, two especially popular birds are the [[nightingale]] and the [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]].&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt;

The nightingale's song has been used by composers including [[Handel]], who quoted it in the aria "Sweet bird" in ''[[L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato]]'', in the "Nightingale chorus" in ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'', and in his Organ Concerto "No. 13", known as "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale". It appears in Rameau's opera ''Hippolyte'', [[Respighi]]'s ''The Birds'' and [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Third Symphony (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]]''. Nightingales can also be found in works by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Mendelssohn]], [[Liszt]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Grieg]], [[Enrique Granados|Granados]], [[Ravel]], and [[Milhaud]].&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt;

The cuckoo's distinctive call is used by [[Beethoven]] (''[[Pastoral Symphony]]'', 2nd movement), [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] (''[[On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring]]''), [[Handel]] (''The Cuckoo and the Nightingale''), Respighi (''The Birds''), [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] (''Snow Maidens''), [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Saint-Saens]] (''[[Carnival of the Animals]]''), [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] (''Concerto in A'', The Cuckoo), and [[Gustav Mahler]] (''First Symphony'', where the cuckoo sings [[perfect fourth]]s instead of the usual [[major third]] or [[minor third]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sward |first1=Jeffrey |title=Cuckoo and Other Bird Sounds Used in Classical Music |url=http://www.jeffreysward.com/editorials/cuckoo.htm |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less commonly imitated are the [[great tit]] ([[Anton Bruckner]]'s ''Fourth Symphony''), the [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]] (Vivaldi), [[linnet]] ([[Couperin]], [[Haydn]] and [[Rachmaninov]]), [[European robin|robin]] ([[Peter Warlock]]), [[swallow]] (Dvorak and [[Tchaikovsky]]), [[wagtail]] ([[Benjamin Britten]]), and [[magpie]] (in a [[Mussorgsky]] song). Dvorak celebrated many other kinds of bird, including the [[stock dove]], [[skylark]], and [[house sparrow]].&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt;

The imitation of bird song was popular in stage performances in the United States, particularly during the era when [[vaudeville]] and [[Chautauqua]] were popular. Gramophone recordings of whistling performances accompanied by instrumental music were also popular. Some prominent performers included [[Charles Crawford Gorst]], [[Charles Kellogg (naturalist)|Charles Kellogg]], [[Joe Belmont (bird impressionist)|Joe Belmont]], and [[Edward Avis]]. Popular stage performers in Britain included Alec Shaw and [[Percy Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boswall, J. |year=1998 |title=Answering the calls of nature: human mimicry of avian voice |journal=Transactions of Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society |volume=92 |pages=10–11 |url=http://www.leicesterlitandphil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Vol-92-1998.pdf |access-date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034502/http://www.leicesterlitandphil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Vol-92-1998.pdf |archive-date=1 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book |page=62 |author=Smith, Jacob |title=Eco-Sonic Media| publisher=University of California Press |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Composers have a variety of bird sounds to work with, from actual birdsong and calls to the appearance and movements of birds, whether real, fictional (like the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]) or indeed mechanical. They can choose to use these materials literally, imitating their sounds, as when [[Sergei Prokofiev]] uses an [[oboe]] for the quacking of a [[duck]] in ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''; it may represent the birds symbolically; or it may give a general impression, as when Vivaldi paints a picture of birds moving and singing in ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''.&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Bruce |last2=Lack |first2=Elizabeth |title=A Dictionary of Birds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-itJV2-nLeYC&amp;pg=PA369 |year=2011 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4081-3840-3 |pages=369–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a composition that imitates birdsong is the "realistic" cuckoo in [[Janequin]]'s 16th century ''Le Chant Des Oiseaux''.&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt;

====In modern classical music====

Among twentieth-century composers, [[Olivier Messiaen]] used birdsong extensively. His ''[[Catalogue d'oiseaux]]'' is a seven-book set of solo piano pieces based on birdsong. His orchestral piece ''Réveil des Oiseaux'' is composed almost entirely of birdsong. Many of his other compositions, including ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'', similarly integrate birdsong.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, A Technique for the End of Time (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Béla Bartók]] likewise made extensive use of North American birdsong in his [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bartók)|Piano Concerto No. 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harley |first1=Maria Anna |title=Birds in Concert: North American Birdsong in Bartók's Piano Concerto No. 3 |journal=Tempo|date=June 1994 |volume=189 |pages=8–16 |jstor=945149}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Nielsen]] used representations of bird calls in ''Song of the [[Siskin]]'', a rarely imitated bird, ''The First Lark'', and ''Springtime on Fyn'', though much of the effect of birds on his work appears in his orchestral colours and time-patterns.&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt; [[Jean Sibelius]] claimed that the [[crane (bird)|crane]]'s call was the "[[leitmotiv]] of my life": it is imitated by clarinets in "Scene with Cranes" in his incidental music from Kuolema.&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt; Sibelius's ''[[Swan of Tuonela]]'' has a sad melody on the [[cor anglais]].&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt; The music critic Rebecca Franks, listing six of the best pieces inspired by birdsong, praises [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s 1914 ''[[The Lark Ascending]]'', which begins with "A silvery solo violin line flutters and darts, reaching up ever higher above the orchestra's hushed, held chord. There's no other opening quite like it for instant atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Franks |first1=Rebecca |title=Six of the best: pieces inspired by birdsong |url=http://www.classical-music.com/article/six-best-birdsong-pieces |publisher=Classical-Music.com |accessdate=24 April 2016 |date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Cassandra Miller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Reviews.

===Use of recorded birdsong===

The Italian composer [[Ottorino Respighi]], with his ''[[Pini di Roma|The Pines of Rome]]'' (1923–1924), may have been the first to compose a piece of music that calls for pre-recorded birdsong. A few years later, Respighi wrote [[The Birds (Respighi)|''Gli Uccelli'' ("The Birds")]], based on [[Baroque]] pieces imitating four different birds, one to each movement of the work after its prelude:&lt;ref name=Beard&gt;{{cite news |author=Beard, Harry Beard |title=Ottorino Respighi (obituary) |work=The Musical Times |date=June 1936 |volume=77 |issue=1120 |pages=555–556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "La colomba" ("The [[dove]]", based on the music of [[Jacques de Gallot]])&lt;ref name=Beard/&gt;
* "La gallina" ("The [[Chicken|hen]]", based on the music of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]])&lt;ref name=Beard/&gt;
* "L'usignuolo" ("The [[nightingale]]", based on the folksong "Engels Nachtegaeltje" transcribed by recorder virtuoso [[Jacob van Eyck]])&lt;ref name=Beard/&gt;
* "Il cucù" ("The [[cuckoo]]", based on the music of Pasquini)&lt;ref name=Beard/&gt;

In 1972, the Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] wrote the orchestral piece ''[[Cantus Arcticus]]'' (Opus 61, dubbed ''Concerto for Birds and Orchestra''). It makes extensive use of recorded birdsong and bird calls from the [[Arctic]], such as the trumpeting of migrating [[swan]]s.&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cantus-arcticus-concerto-for-birds-orchestra-for-orchestra-taped-bird-songs-op-61-mc0002372291 |accessdate=24 April 2016 |title=Cantus Arcticus (Concerto for Birds &amp; Orchestra) |website=AllMusic |first=Chris |last=Morrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, rock bands started to use [[sound effects]] including birdsong in their albums. The English band [[Pink Floyd]] included bird sound effects in songs from their 1969 albums ''[[More (soundtrack)|More]]'' and ''[[Ummagumma]]'' (for example, "[[Grantchester Meadows (song)|Grantchester Meadows]]"). Similarly, the English singer [[Kate Bush]] used bird calls on her 2005 album, ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Petridis |first1=Alexis |title=Kate Bush, Aerial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/nov/04/popandrock.shopping |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson|first=William Forde |title=Music in the Social and Behavioral Sciences: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfcOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA801 |year=2014 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4522-8302-9 |pages=801–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French composer [[François-Bernard Mâche]] has been credited with the creation of [[zoomusicology]], the study of the music of animals. His 1983 essay "Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion" includes a study of "ornitho-musicology", in which he speaks of "animal musics" and a longing to connect with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=François-Bernard Mâche |author=Mâche, François-Bernard |title=Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion'' (''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion |publisher=Routledge |origyear=1983 |date=1993 |isbn=978-3-718-65322-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It showed that of 243 samples of the [[nightingale wren]]'s song, only 6 matched the intervals used in scales.{{efn|The Araya-Salas study did not investigate the song of any other species, nor other aspects of musicality such as those explored by Adam Tierney.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tierney2011/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;{{cite web |last1=Underwood |first1=Emily |title=Birdsong Not Music, After All |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/08/birdsong-not-music-after-all |publisher=Science |accessdate=24 April 2016 |date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pied Butcherbird.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[pied butcherbird]] has an elaborate song with musical qualities.&lt;ref name=JMRO/&gt;]]

Luis Felipe Baptista and Robin A. Keister argued in a 2005 paper "Why Birdsong is Sometimes Like Music" that the way birds use variations of rhythm, relationships of [[musical pitch]], and combinations of [[musical note|note]]s can resemble music. They consider the theory that birds sometimes exploit variation in song to avoid monotony. They survey bird families that habitually borrow phrases or sounds from other species; the [[European starling]] is a well-studied borrower, and it is possible that the species inspired a [[Mozart]] piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baptista |first1=Luis Felipe |last2=Keister |first2=Robin A. |title=Why Birdsong is Sometimes Like Music |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |date=2005 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=426–443 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2005.0066 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/185549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Tierney and colleagues argued in a 2011 paper that the similar motor constraints on human and avian song drive these to have similar song structures, including "arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases", long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes. They excluded birds like the European starling which use many buzzing or clicking noises that are inharmonic, working instead with birds with a strong pitch structure like the field sparrow ''[[Spizella pusilla]]'' ([[Emberizidae]]), the Eurasian treecreeper ''[[Certhia familiaris]]'' ([[Certhiidae]]) and the summer tanager, ''[[Piranga rubra]]'' ([[Thraupidae]]).&lt;ref name=Tierney2011/&gt;

Hollis Taylor argued in her 2017 book that the vocalizations of the [[pied butcherbird]] are music, rebutting [[musicology|musicological]] objections to this in detail. This was accompanied by birdsong-based "(re)compositions" based on avian transcriptions, paired with field recordings from the Australian outback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.realtime.org.au/is-birdsong-music-ask-the-butcherbird/ |title=Is birdsong music?

In [[computer science]], a '''bridging model''' is an abstract model of a [[computer]] which provides a [[conceptual bridge]] between the physical implementation of the machine and the abstraction available to a [[programmer]] of that machine; in other words, it is intended to provide a common level of understanding between [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] engineers.

A successful bridging model is one which can be efficiently implemented in reality and efficiently targeted by programmers; in particular, it should be possible for a [[compiler]] to produce good code from a typical high-level language. The term was introduced by [[Leslie Valiant]]'s 1990 paper ''A Bridging Model for Parallel Computation'', which argued that the strength of the [[Von Neumann architecture|von Neumann model]] was largely responsible for the success of computing as a whole.&lt;ref name="CACM_Valiant"&gt;Leslie G. Valiant, A bridging model for parallel computation, Communications of the ACM, Volume 33 Issue 8, Aug. 1990 [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=79173.79181]&lt;/ref&gt; The paper goes on to develop the [[bulk synchronous parallel]] model as an analogous model for [[parallel computing]].

'''Bureau-shaping''' is a [[rational choice]] model of [[bureaucracy]] and a response to the [[budget-maximization model]]. It argues that rational officials will not want to maximize their [[budget]]s, but instead to shape their agency so as to maximize their personal utilities from their work. For instance, bureaucrats would prefer to work in small, [[elite]] agencies close to political [[Power centre (retail)|power centre]]s and doing interesting work, rather than to run large-budget agencies with many staff but also many risks and problems. For the same reasons, and to avoid risks, the bureau-shaping model also predicts that senior government bureaucrats will often favour either 'agencification' to other public sector bodies (as in the UK 'Next Steps' programme) or off-loading functions to contractors and privatization. In the health and social work fields, officials will favour 'deinstitutionalization' and 'care in the community'. The model was developed by [[Patrick Dunleavy]] from the [[London School of Economics]] in ''Democracy, Bureaucracy and Public Choice'' (London:  Pearson Education, 1991, reissued 2001).

It was propounded in response to William Niskanen's harsh criticism of Public Bureaucracies in his Budget Maximising Model. The Niskanen model predicts that in representative democracies, public bureaucracies will not only generate allocative inefficiency (by '''oversupplying''' public goods) but also x-inefficiency (by producing public goods inefficiently). It is evident that the Niskanen model is heavily reliant on an American institutional milieu. Patrick Dunleavy, a British political scientist who set out to demolish the public choice arguments on bureaucracy, came instead in the end to develop a public choice model of bureaucratic behaviour which combines elements of Peacock’s insight with the original American model. The Dunleavy (1985, p.&amp;nbsp;300) model of public bureaucracy is built on six basic assumptions. The first three are consistent with Niskanen’s model:

(i) bureau policies are set by bureaucrats interacting with the government;

(ii) governments largely depend on information from bureaus about the costs and value of producing within given ranges of output; and

(iii) bureaucrats maximise their personal utilities (by satisfying "self-regarding, relatively hard-edged preferences") when making official decisions.

Added to these are two 4 assumptions which greatly weaken the budget-maximising conclusion. These are that a bureau’s aggregate policy behaviour is set by some combination of individual decisions made by its officials, although the actual combination that results may be an outcome desired by no bureau member; and that, within broad limits, officials’ influence on bureau policy is always correlated with rank and those nearest the top of bureaus are the most influential. Dunleavy therefore discards Niskanen’s assumption that a bureau’s behaviour will be wholly in line with the preferences of a single senior bureaucrat. In a bureau, where no individual has complete hegemony, budget maximisation is a collective, not an individual good. Rational utility maximising individuals will thus tend to favour strategies that directly advance their personal interests ahead of strategies that advance the collective good. The interaction of the maximising activities of individuals within a bureau will not necessarily lead to budget maximizing.

The '''Canadian Communication Association''' ('''CCA'''; or '''Association canadienne de communication''' '''ACC''' in French) is a national, bilingual association of communications researchers, educators, and private and public sector professionals in Canada. Established in 1979, the CCA/ACC "seeks to advance communication research and studies in the belief that a better understanding of communication is crucial to building a vibrant society."&lt;ref name=Annual&gt;{{cite web|title=CCA Annual Meeting|url=http://www.acc-cca.ca/annualmeeting|website=CCA|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=Christopher|title=The Canadian Communication Tradition|journal=inMedia: The French Journal of Media Studies|date=2013|volume=4|url=https://inmedia.revues.org/696#tocfrom1n2|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1970s===
The creation of the CCA has been considered to be due in part to research that emerged out of the ''Ontario Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry'' ([[Judy LaMarsh|LaMarsh Commission]]) of 1976. This commission drew together a number of scholars who later met at a conference in the University of Windsor in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Canadian Studies|title=The Ontario Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry: Twenty years later|author-last=Tate|author-first=Eugene|year=1998|volume = 1| issue = 13 | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1979 in Philadelphia where the presentations tended to focus on research that came out of the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Canadian Journal of Communication | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | year = 2000 | author-last = Tate | author-first = Eugene | title = The Beginnings of Communication Studies in Canada: Concluding Comments: Canadian Journal of Communication and the LaMarsh Commission | url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/1144/1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this same year, the CCA was established on June 1, 1979 during the ''Learned Societies Conference'' (now the [[Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences|Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences]]) in Saskatoon, Canada.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Eugene|date=1979|title=Canadian Communication Association Founded: Reflections on the Saskatoon Meeting|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/221|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.22230/cjc.1979v6n1a221|issn=1499-6642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Homer|first=Joan|date=1980|title=The Spectrum of Communication: Can it survive the politics of association?|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/236/142|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-existing [[Canadian Journal of Communication]] was voted to be the official journal of the association.&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt; However, discussions over this arrangement led to the absence of any legally binding relationship between the two. The journal exists independently of the association and is owned by its subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Gilbert | editor-first1 = John | editor-last2 = Lorimer | editor-first2 = Rowland |editor-last3 = Patrick | editor-first3 = Ruth J | title = Scholarly communication in the next millennium: Selected papers from Canada's Policy Conference | publisher = Canadian Journal of Communication Corporation | location = Vancouver | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780969898320 | page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Part of the activities of the CCA in its early years was to address the combination of unique Canadian perspectives and the burgeoning theories on the nature and definition of communication. Advancing the debate, especially at early CCA meetings and conferences were "pioneers of Canadian communication studies"&lt;ref name=Fouts&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouts|first=Gregory|date=2000|title=The Beginnings of Communication Studies in Canada: The Canadian Communication Association and the Canadian Journal of Communication: Some Reminiscences and Trends|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/1142|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|issn=1499-6642}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: Earle Beattie, William Gilsdorf, Garth Jowett, Annie Mear, William Melody, Walter Romanow, Paul Rutherford, Liora Salter, Eugene Tate, [[James R.

Indeed, "[t]he politics of the Canadian Communication Association was grounded in the search for an answer to the very definition of communication."&lt;ref name=Fouts/&gt; The creation of the CCA and has been described as a part of the larger trend to establish the interdisciplinary field of [[communication]] as part of emergent scholarly, professional, and corporate activities in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graff | first = Harvey | title = Undisciplining knowledge : interdisciplinarity in the twentieth century | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781421417455|page=84;248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Toby | title = Global Media Studies | publisher = Wiley | location = Chicester | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745693064 |page=Table 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Croucher | first = Stephen | title = Understanding communication theory : a beginner's guide | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781317751373|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, news and discussion about the association was communicated by an [[electronic mailing list]] called CCANet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Association of Research Libraries, Office of Scientific and Academic Publishing | title=Directory of Electronic Journals, Newsletters, and Academic Discussion Lists| year=1991|volume=1-2|ISSN=1057-1337|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KmrgAAAAMAAJ|LCCN=92649836|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later half of the 1990s, the

The twelve volume '''''Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum''''' is the primary reference work for the study of British satirical prints of the 18th and 19th century.  Most of the content  of the catalogue is now available through the [[British Museum]]'s on-line database.

==Description==
The ''BM Satires'' &lt;ref name="DorothyGeorge"&gt; {{cite book|last1=George| first1=M Dorothy |title=Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum |publisher=The British Museum| date=1870-1954| location=London| url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofprint07brituoft/catalogueofprint07brituoft_djvu.tx}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises twelve volumes compiled between 1870 and 1954 and provides a [[catalogue raisonné]] of the 17,000 odd satirical prints assembled in the 19th century by [[Edward Hawkins (numismatist)|Edward Hawkins,]]&lt;Ref name="hawkins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Hawkins (British Museum Biographical details)| url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=51568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeper of Antiquities in the [[British Museum]] from his own and other collections.

It includes works by all the leading artists and makers of satirical prints of the period, as well as lesser known and anonymous designers. Notable artists represented include:   [[Henry Alken]], [[Samuel Alken]], [[William Austin (caricaturist)|William Austin]], [[James Bretherton (artist)|James Bretherton]], [[Charles Bretherton]], [[Henry William Bunbury]],  [[Frederick George Byron]],  [[John Cawse]],  [[John Collett (artist)| John Collet]], [[Thomas Colley]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Isaac Cruikshank]],  [[Robert Cruikshank]], [[Matthew Darly]],  [[William Dickinson (engraver)|William Dickinson]],  [[Robert Dighton]], [[John Dighton]], [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]], [[William Elmes]], [[Francis Jukes]], [[James Gillray]], [[Henry Heath (artist)|Henry Heath]], [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)| John Leech]], [[Lewis Marks]],  [[Richard Newton (caricaturist)|Richard Newton]], [[Piercy Roberts]],  [[Thomas Rowlandson]],  [[F.Sansom]], [[James Sayers]],  [[John Raphael Smith]], [[C.Starck]],  [[Edward Topham]],  [[Henry Wigstead]],  [[Samuel de Wilde]], [[Charles Williams (caricaturist)|Charles Williams]], and  [[George Moutard Woodward |George "Moutard" Woodward]]. Some works by foreign printmakers are also included.

The catalogue allocates a unique identifier to each print which is widely used as a bibliographic reference to specific caricatures in books about caricatures and in sales catalogues. The identifiers are one to five digit numbers, allocated in sequential order of listing within the whole sequence of volumes, each volume covering a monotonically increasing range of numbers. For example; '''BM Satires 10101''' refers to a print listed in Volume VIII (which covers the range 9693 to 11703) that was published in September 1803, titled ''My Ass in a Band Box''. For each print, the catalogue provides a title, publisher, designer and creator if known, image description, lettering and inscriptions, dimensions,  bibliographic references,  and explanatory notes about the historical context and personages and printmaking technique (e.g. [[etching]], [[aquatint]], [[stipple]], hand-coloured, etc.).   The prints are for the most part in historical order of date of publication, though some appear out of chronological order  in  addenda that appear in later volumes. Within each year, Political and Social satire is arranged separately and sequentially.

There is a prefatory essay to each volume by the editor giving a  historical synopsis of printmaking, artists, publishers and events through the period covered by the volume;  including [[Rudolph Ackermann]], [[Bowles &amp; Carver]], [[Thomas Cornell (publisher) | Thomas Cornell]], [[Elizabeth D'Archeray]], [[John Fairburn]],  [[Samuel William Fores]],  [[William Holland (publisher)| William Holland]], [[Hannah Humphrey]], [[ William_Humphrey (engraver)| William Humphrey]], [[Elizabeth Jackson (publisher) |Elizabeth Jackson]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[Thomas Maclean (publisher) | Thomas Maclean]], [[John Raphael Smith]], [[Susan Vivares]] and many others.

==History==
The first five volume of the catalogue were compiled under [[Frederic George Stephens]] between 1870 and 1883, with the assistance of Edward Hawkins, Keeper of Antiquities for the [[British Museum]]. The last seven volumes were the magnum opus of [[Mary Dorothy George]] the distinguished historian of British satire.  In 2008&amp;ndash;12, as part of the British Museum's program to digitalise its collections, all the volumes were scanned and used to form the basis of the entries for the satirical prints in the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx British Museum on-line catalogue].  Digital images are now available for most of the prints.

==Limitations==
The BM Satires does not include prints acquired since the publication of the printed version of the catalogue (i.e. up until 1954). The British Museum online catalogue includes additional entries for more recent acquisitions.   The printed volumes include only a few images, mostly in the introductory essays.

[[File:Dakar University, Senegal, 1967.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cheikh Anta Diop University campus, 1967. The original library building at center.]]
'''Cheikh Anta Diop University''' ({{lang-fr|'''Université Cheikh Anta Diop''' or '''UCAD'''}}), also known as the '''University of Dakar''', is a [[university]] in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. It is named after the [[Senegal]]ese physicist, [[historian]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Cheikh Anta Diop]]&lt;ref&gt;Touré, Maelenn-Kégni, [http://www.blackpast.org/gah/cheikh-anta-diop-university-1957 "Cheikh Anta Diop University (1957--)"], BlackPast.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/place/University-Cheikh-Anta-Diop "University Cheikh Anta Diop"], Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; and has an enrollment of over 60,000.

==History==
Cheikh Anta Diop University predates Senegalese independence and grew out of several French institutions set up by the colonial administration.  In 1918, the French created the "école africaine de médecine" (African medical school), mostly to serve white and [[Métis]] students but also open to the small educated elite of the [[Four Communes (colonial Senegal)|four free towns of Senegal]] with nominal French citizenship.  In 1936, under the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government in France, Dakar became home to the [[Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire]] (IFAN), an institute for the study of African culture.

In 1950s, with [[decolonisation]] already looming, the French administration expanded these schools, added science faculties, and combined the schools into the "Institut des Hautes Etudes de Dakar".  In 1957, a new campus was constructed as the 18th French Public University, attached to the [[University of Paris]] and the [[University of Bordeaux]].  This became the '''University of Dakar''' the largest and most prestigious university in [[French West Africa]]. In 1987, its name was changed to honor the Senegalese philosopher and anthropologist, [[Cheikh Anta Diop]].

===Enrollment growth===
At independence in 1960, enrollment was 1,018 students, only 39% Senegalese, with most of the rest from other former French colonies. By 1976, this number grew to 8,014.

In the 1970s, a time of state financial crisis, funding to higher education was cut, and international agencies stepped in over the next decade. Most of this funding, though, went to meet the needs of primary schools.  In the 1990s and 2000s there was a huge boom in Senegalese primary and secondary education, much of it funded through international projects. In 1984 around 50% of Senegalese children received primary education and by 2004 more than 90% did.

In the mid-1980s around 20% of World Bank funding to Senegalese education went to higher education, but this figure dropped to 7% by the mid-1990s.  With these projects came severe [[World Bank]] restrictions, dramatically cutting domestic funding available to university programs. As students who have benefited from primary and secondary education age, Cheikh Anta Diop University has had its already stretched resources stretched further.  Nine thousand Senegalese students received a Baccalaureate degree in 2000, while total registration shot above 40,000, for a campus built with only 5,000 dorm rooms.&lt;ref&gt;"Africa's Storied Colleges, Jammed and Crumbling," By Lydia Polgreen, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Andrew Francis; Phillips, Lucie Colvin; Phillips, Lucie Colvin. ''Historical Dictionary of Senegal''. p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these pressures Cheikh Anta Diop University maintains a reputation as one of Africa's most prestigious institutions.  Most of the post-independence generation of Senegalese leaders are graduates of the university, and its alumni teach in universities around the world.

==Academics==
The education system follows the French pattern, with oral and/or written final exams administered at the end of the year. All courses at the university are taught in French, except those in language departments other than French.

===Schools and institutes===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
UCAD offers courses of study in Humanities, Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, Finance, Accounting, and Law. The university awards the following degrees: B.A., B.S., Ph.D., and D.M.A.

The School of Medicine includes departments of Pharmacy, Research, and Surgery.&lt;ref name="Ucad"&gt;University Cheikh Anta Diop. (2004). University Cheikh Anta Diop's Background. Retrieved March 27, 2004, from http://www.ucad.sn&lt;/ref&gt; The university also encompasses the Institute of Sciences of the Environment (ISE) and the Institute of Sciences of Earth (ISE).

The [[Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire]] (IFAN), founded in 1936, remains one of the world centers of [[African Studies]]. The [[IFAN Museum of African Arts]]' ''Musée d'Art africain'', attached to IFAN, displays and conserves a world-renowned collection of African arts.

The [[Centre de linguistique appliquée de Dakar]] (Center of Applied Linguistics of Dakar) at CADU is the regulatory body for the [[Wolof language]].

Language studies are divided into the following disciplines: [[Philosophy]], [[Sociology]], [[History]], [[Geography]], Letters, Arabic, Russian, Languages and Civilizations, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Latin, German and Linguistics.

The university oversees a language school: Institut de Français pour Etrangers (IFE). The IFE specializes in French language studies aimed at foreign students in preparation for regular courses taught in French.

===Foreign programs===
UCAD hosts a number of foreign study abroad programs, including ones administered by [[Wells College]], [[Indiana University]], and the [[University of Oregon]] in the [[United States]] and numerous European universities. Participants in the program typically take a required course in Introductory Wolof and a French language (if applicable) course through the IFE in addition to regular university courses taught in French.&lt;ref name="WELL"&gt;Wells Program. (2005). Dakar Program for foreigners. Retrieved April 10, 2005, from {{cite web |url=http://www.wells.edu/academic/dakar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618181652/http://www.wells.edu/academic/dakar.htm |archivedate=2006-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A division of the university offers courses for foreign students in Senegalese and African studies, including African literature, history, politics, philosophy, and sociology.
[[File:BibliothèqueCheikhAntaDiop.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Cheikh Anta Diop University library building, showing additions, 2005.]]

CADU is a member of the [[Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World]].

====Special requirements====
For foreign students, UCAD requires a minimum age of 18 to enroll in studies in Pharmacy and a minimum age of 22 to enroll in studies relating to oral surgery.

==Student life==
UCAD has a diverse student body drawn from many countries including Senegal, [[Chad]], [[Burkina-Faso]], [[Ivory Coast]], France, [[Togo]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], the United States, [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], [[Morocco]], [[Rwanda]], [[Cameroon]], Belgium, and the United Kingdom.

As with a number of other African universities, UCAD occasionally experiences student strikes protesting government or university policies. These strikes generally last not more than one or two weeks but may be longer, as occurred during the 1993 presidential election.

With over 60,000 students and only 5,000 dormitory rooms, most students from outside Dakar must look for other accommodations.  Many students live in the [[Cité Aline Sitoe Diatta]], near the university campus, and those who can't afford Dakar's often high rents often share rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polgreen|first1=Lydia|title=Africa’s Storied Colleges, Jammed and Crumbling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/world/africa/20senegal.html|accessdate=15 November 2016|work=The New York Times|date=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence==

The university has had a number of notable incidents of violence. A Senegalese LGBT organization noted in 2016 that ten cases of homophobic mob violence had occurred at the university since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbt-education.info/en/news/local_news/160323-senegalese-student-mob-try-to-lynch-student-thought-to-be-gay|title=Senegalese student mob try to lynch student thought to be gay - GALE|website=www.lgbt-education.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these, following a riot at the university, resulted in the death of the student who was suspected to be gay. The riot followed an attempt to apprehend the student, who had sought refugee in the university's bank and security office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi0T3H6nB6E&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=SeneNews TV:  Ucad, un présumé homosexuel lynché par une foule d'étudiants|first=|last=SeneNews TV|date=15 March 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, self-immolations and clashes between students and police have been reported after students unsuccessfully demanded scholarships or challenged grading schemes.

[[Image:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|Building a CEB project in Midland, Texas in August 2006]]
A '''compressed earth block''' ('''CEB'''), also known as a ''pressed earth block'' or a ''compressed soil block'', is a [[building material]] made primarily from damp [[soil]] compressed at high pressure to form blocks. Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press to form blocks out of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic [[subsoil]], non-expansive [[clay]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as [[Portland cement]] they are called ''compressed stabilized earth block'' (CSEB) or ''stabilized earth block'' (SEB). Typically, around {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.

Creating CEBs differs from [[rammed earth]] in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from [[mud brick]]s in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB can meet or exceed that of typical cement or mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB.

CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard [[bricklaying]] and [[masonry]] techniques. The [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may be a simple [[slurry]] made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues. [[Hydraform block]]s are shaped to be interlocking.

==Development==
CEB technology has been developed  for low-cost construction, as an alternative to adobe, and with some advantages.  A commercial industry has been advanced by eco-friendly contractors, manufacturers of the mechanical presses, and by cultural acceptance of the method.  In the [[United States]], most general contractors building with CEB are in the Southwestern states: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], and to a lesser extent in [[Texas]].  The methods and presses have been used for many years in [[Mexico]], and in [[developing countries]].

The [[South Africa]]n Department of Water Affairs and Forestry considers that CEB, locally called "'''Dutch brick'''" is an appropriate technology for a developing country, as are adobe, rammed earth and cob. All use natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=6|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Masibambane/documents/civil/CrossCuttingFeb08.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Critical Sustainability Pillars for service delivery in the Water Sector|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the International Institute for Energy Conservation was one of the winners of a [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]] for a project to make an energy-efficient Dutch brick-making machine for home construction in South Africa. By making cheaper bricks that use earth, the project would reduce housing costs while stimulating the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/29725/south-africa-poverty-reduction-winners|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Poverty reduction winners|publisher=IRIN|date=11 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would be mobile, allowing bricks to be made locally from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbdm/idea/housing-and-jobs-better-future|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Housing and Jobs for a Better Future|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of CEB production machines exist, from manual to semi-automated and fully automated,  with increasing capital-investment and production rates, and decreased labor.  Automated machines are more common in the developed world, and manual machines in the developing world.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages of the CEB system.   On-site materials can be used, which reduces cost, minimizes shipping costs for materials, and increases efficiency and sustainability.  The wait-time required to obtain materials is minimal, because after the blocks are pressed, materials are available very soon after a short drying period.  The uniformity of the blocks simplifies construction, and minimizes or eliminates the need for mortar, thus reducing both the labor and materials costs.  The blocks are strong, stable, water-resistant and long-lasting.
* CEB can be pressed from damp earth. Because it is not wet, the drying time is much shorter. Some soil conditions permit the blocks to go straight from the press onto the wall. A single mechanical press can produce from 800 to over 5,000 blocks per day, enough to build a {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} house in one day.   A high performance CEB press, of [[open source]] design, named "The Liberator", can produce from 8,000 to 17,000 or more blocks per day.  The production rate is limited more by the ability to get material into the machine, than the machine itself.
* Shipping cost: Suitable soils are often available at or near the construction site. [[Adobe]] and CEB are of similar weight, but distance from a source supply gives CEB an advantage.  Also, CEB can be made available in places where adobe manufacturing operations are non-existent.
* Uniformity: CEB can be manufactured to a predictable size and has true flat sides and 90-degree angle edges.  This makes design and costing easier.  This also provides the contractor the option of making the exteriors look like conventional [[stucco]] houses. 
* Presses allow blocks to be consistently made of uniform size, while also obtaining strengths that exceed the ASTM standard for concrete blocks (1900 psi).
* Non-toxic:  materials are completely natural, non-toxic, and do not out-gas
* Sound resistant:  an important feature in high-density neighborhoods, residential areas adjacent to industrial zones
* Fire resistant:  earthen walls do not burn
* Insect resistant: Insects are discouraged because the walls are solid and very dense, and have no food value
* [[Mold]] resistant:  there is no cellulose material - such as in wood, [[Oriented Strand Board]] or [[drywall]] - that can host [[mold]] or rot
* In India, CSEB's with cement stabilization have shown to be very beneficial. The observed compressive strength, flexural strength at 28 days of aging with 9% cement stabilization has been observed to be 3.2 MPa and 1 MPa respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267637559|accessdate=2014-11-11|title=Effect Of Varying Cement Proportions On Properties Of Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) - A Sustainable Low-Cost Housing Material|publisher=DOI: 10.13140/2.1.4966.4963 Conference: International Conference on Sustainable Civil Infrastructure, ASCE India Section 17–18 October 2014, At Hyderabad, India, Volume: pg 1000-1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presses==
CEB had very limited use prior to the 1980s. It was known in the 1950s in [[South America]], where one of the most well-known presses, the [[Cinva Ram]], was developed by Raul Ramirez in the Inter-American Housing Center (CINVA) in Bogota, Colombia.  The Cinva Ram is a single-block, manual-press that uses a long, hand-operated lever to drive a [[cam]], generating high pressure.

Industrial manufacturers produce much larger machines that run with diesel or gasoline engines and hydraulic presses that receive the soil/aggregate mixture through a hopper. This is fed into a chamber to create a block that is then ejected onto a conveyor.

During the 1980s, soil-pressing technology became widespread. [[France]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]] began to write standards. The [[Peace Corps]], [[USAID]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other programs began to implement it into housing projects.

==Finishing==
Completed walls require either a reinforced bond beam or a ring beam on top or between floors and if the blocks are not stabilized, a plaster finish, usually stucco wire/stucco cement and/or lime plaster. Stabilized blocks can be left exposed with no outer plaster finish. In tropical environments, polycarbonate varnish is often used to provide an additional layer of wet-weather protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Foundations==
Standards for foundations are similar to those for brick walls. A CEB wall is heavy. Footings must be at least 10&amp;nbsp;inches thick, with a minimum width that is 33 percent greater than the wall width. If a stem wall is used, it shall extend to an elevation not less than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  above the exterior finish grade. Rubble-filled foundation trench designs with a reinforced concrete grade beam above are allowed to support CEB construction.

==Strength==
Using the [[ASTM]] D1633-00 stabilization standard, a pressed and cured block must be submerged in water for four hours. It is then pulled from the water and immediately subjected to a compression test. The blocks must score at least a 300 [[pound-force per square inch]] (p.s.i) (2 MPa) minimum.  This is a higher standard than for adobe, which must score an ''average'' of at least 300 p.s.i. (2 MPa)

uses [[bioinformatic]] methods{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} to complement experimental research in [[epigenetics]]. Due to the recent explosion of epigenome datasets, computational methods play an increasing role in all areas of epigenetic research.

==Definition==
Research in computational epigenetics comprises the development and application of bioinformatics methods for solving epigenetic questions, as well as computational data analysis and theoretical modeling in the context of epigenetics. This includes modelling of the effects of histone and DNA CpG island methylation.

==Current research areas==

===Epigenetic data processing and analysis===
[[File:ChIP-on-chip wet-lab.png|thumb|428x428px|ChIP-on-chip technique]]
Various experimental techniques have been developed for genome-wide mapping of epigenetic information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madrigal|first=P|author2=Krajewski, P|title=Uncovering correlated variability in epigenomic datasets using the Karhunen-Loeve transform.|journal=BioData Mining|date=July 2015|volume=8|pages=20|doi=10.1186/s13040-015-0051-7|pmid=26140054|pmc=4488123}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most widely used being [[ChIP-on-chip]], [[ChIP-seq]] and [[bisulfite sequencing]]. All of these methods generate large amounts of data and require efficient ways of data processing and quality control by bioinformatic methods.

===Epigenome prediction===
A substantial amount of bioinformatic research has been devoted to the [[prediction]] of epigenetic information from characteristics of the [[genome sequence]]. Such predictions serve a dual purpose. First, accurate epigenome predictions can substitute for experimental data, to some degree, which is particularly relevant for newly discovered epigenetic mechanisms and for species other than human and mouse. Second, prediction algorithms build statistical models of epigenetic information from training data and can therefore act as a first step toward quantitative modeling of an epigenetic mechanism. Successful computational prediction of DNA and lysine methylation and acetylation has been achieved by combinations of various features.&lt;ref name="Shi2012"&gt;{{cite journal

===Applications in cancer epigenetics===
The important role of epigenetic defects for [[cancer]] opens up new opportunities for improved diagnosis and therapy. These active areas of research give rise to two questions that are particularly amenable to bioinformatic analysis. First, given a list of genomic regions exhibiting epigenetic differences between tumor cells and controls (or between different disease subtypes), can we detect common patterns or find evidence of a functional relationship of these regions to cancer? Second, can we use bioinformatic methods in order to improve diagnosis and therapy by detecting and classifying important disease subtypes?

==Emerging topics==
The first wave of research in the field of computational epigenetics was driven by rapid progress of experimental methods for data generation, which required adequate computational methods for data processing and quality control, prompted epigenome prediction studies as a means of understanding the genomic distribution of epigenetic information, and provided the foundation for initial projects on [[cancer epigenetics]]. While these topics will continue to be major areas of research and the mere quantity of epigenetic data arising from epigenome projects poses a significant bioinformatic challenge, several additional topics are currently emerging.
* Epigenetic regulatory circuitry: Reverse engineering the regulatory networks that read, write and execute epigenetic codes.
* [[Population epigenetics]]: Distilling regulatory mechanisms from the integration of epigenome data with [[gene expression]] profiles and [[haplotype]] maps for a large sample from a heterogeneous population.''
* [[Evolutionary epigenetics]]: Learning about epigenome regulation in human (and its medical consequences) by cross-species comparisons.
* Theoretical modeling: Testing our mechanistic and quantitative understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by [[in silico]] simulation.&lt;ref name="roznovat2013computational"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">{{Disputed|date=January 2015}} In [[solid mechanics]], in the field of [[rotordynamics]], the '''critical speed''' is the theoretical [[angular velocity]] that excites the [[natural frequency]] of a rotating object, such as a shaft, propeller, [[leadscrew#Running_speed | leadscrew]], or gear. As the speed of rotation approaches the object's natural frequency, the object begins to [[resonate]], which dramatically increases system [[vibration]]. The resulting resonance occurs regardless of orientation. When the rotational speed is equal to the numerical value of the natural vibration, then that speed is referred to as critical speed.

==Critical speed of shafts==
All rotating shafts, even in the absence of external load, will deflect during rotation. The unbalanced mass of the rotating object causes deflection that will create resonant vibration at certain speeds, known as the critical speeds. The magnitude of deflection depends upon the following:
:(a) stiffness of the shaft and its support
:(b) total mass of shaft and attached parts
:(c) unbalance of the mass with respect to the axis of rotation
:(d) the amount of damping in the system

In general, it is necessary to calculate the critical speed of a rotating shaft, such as a fan shaft, in order to avoid issues with noise and vibration.

==Critical speed equation==
Like vibrating [[Vibrating_string|strings]] and other elastic structures, shafts and beams can vibrate in different mode shapes, with corresponding natural frequencies. The first vibrational mode corresponds to the lowest natural frequency. Higher modes of vibration correspond to higher natural frequencies. Often when considering rotating shafts, only the first natural frequency is needed. 

There are two main methods used to calculate critical speed—the [[Rayleigh–Ritz method]] and [[Dunkerley's method]]. Both calculate an approximation of the first natural frequency of vibration, which is assumed to be nearly equal to the critical speed of rotation. The Rayleigh–Ritz method is discussed here. For a shaft that is divided into ''n'' segments, the first natural frequency for a given beam, in ''rad/s'', can be approximated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{1} \approx \sqrt{\frac {g \sum_ {i = 1}^n {w_ {i} y_ {i}}} {\sum_ {i = 1}^n {w_ {i} y_ {i}^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity, and the &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; are the weights of each segment, and the &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; are the static deflections (under gravitational loading only) of the center of each segment. Generally speaking, if ''n'' is 2 or higher, this method tends to slightly overestimate the first natural frequency, with the estimate becoming better the higher ''n'' is. If ''n'' is only 1, this method tends to underestimate the first natural frequency, but the equation simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{1} \approx \sqrt{\frac {g} {y_{max}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the max static deflection of the shaft. These speeds are in [[radians|''rad'']]/''s'', but can be converted to [[Revolutions_per_minute|''RPM'']] by multiplying by &lt;math&gt;\frac{60}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; .

Static deflections for several types of uniform-cross-section beams can be found [[Deflection_(engineering)#Beam_deflection_for_various_loads_and_supports|here]]. If a beam has multiple types of loading, deflections can be found for each, and then summed. If the shaft diameter changes along its length, deflection calculations become much more difficult.

The static deflection expresses the relationship between rigidity of the shaft and inertial forces; it includes all the loads applied to the shaft when placed horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Bulletin, [http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~ernesto/F2013/SRDD/Readings/Kruger-CriticalSpeeds-Shafts.pdf], ''Krueger''. Retrieved on 18 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship is valid no matter what the orientation of the shaft is. 

Critical speed depends upon the magnitude and location of the shaft unbalance, the length of the shaft, its diameter, and the kind of bearing support. Many practical applications suggest as good practice that the maximum operating speed should not exceed 75% of the critical speed; however, there are cases that require speeds above the critical speed to work correctly. In such cases, it is important to accelerate the shaft through the first natural frequency quickly so that large deflections don't develop.

'''Decision field theory''' ('''DFT''') is a dynamic-cognitive approach to human decision making. It is a [[cognitive model]] that describes how people actually make decisions rather than a [[rational]] or [[normative theory]] that prescribes what people should or ought to do. It is also a [[dynamic model]] of [[decision making]] rather than a static model, because it describes how a person's preferences evolve across time until a decision is reached rather than assuming a fixed state of preference. The preference evolution process is mathematically represented as a stochastic process called a [[diffusion process]]. It is used to predict how humans make decisions under uncertainty, how decisions change under time pressure, and how choice context changes preferences. This model can be used to predict not only the choices that are made but also decision or [[Mental chronometry|response times]].

Neural Networks, 19(8), 1047-1058.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, the authors of decision field theory also have begun exploring a new theoretical direction called [[Quantum Cognition]].

==Introduction==
The name ''decision field theory'' was chosen to reflect the fact that the inspiration for this theory comes from an earlier approach - avoidance conflict model contained in [[Kurt Lewin]]'s general psychological theory, which he called ''field'' theory. DFT is a member of a general class of sequential sampling models that are commonly used in a variety of fields in cognition.&lt;ref name=ashby2000&gt;Ashby, F. G. (2000). A stochastic version of general recognition theory. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 44, 310–329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nosofsky1997&gt;Nosofsky, R. M., &amp; Palmeri, T. J. (1997).

The basic ideas underlying the decision process for sequential sampling models is illustrated in Figure 1 below. Suppose the decision maker is initially presented with a choice between three risky prospects, A, B, C, at time t = 0. The horizontal axis on the figure represents deliberation time (in seconds), and the vertical axis represents preference strength. Each trajectory in the figure represents the preference state for one of the risky prospects at each moment in time.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;[[File:SamplePathsDiffusionProcess.jpg|frame|center|Figure 1 — Sample paths for a diffusion process]]

Intuitively, at each moment in time, the decision maker thinks about various payoffs of each prospect, which produces an affective reaction, or valence, to each prospect. These valences are integrated across time to produce the preference state at each moment. In this example, during the early stages of processing (between 200 and 300 ms), attention is focused on advantages favoring prospect C, but later (after 600 ms) attention is shifted toward advantages favoring prospect A. The stopping rule for this process is controlled by a threshold (which is set equal to 1.0 in this example): the first prospect to reach the top threshold is accepted, which in this case is prospect A after about two seconds. Choice probability is determined by the first option to win the race and cross the upper threshold, and decision time is equal to the deliberation time required by one of the prospects to reach this threshold.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

The threshold is an important parameter for controlling speed–accuracy tradeoffs. If the threshold is set to a lower value (about .30) in Figure 1, then prospect C would be chosen instead of prospect A (and done so earlier). Thus decisions can reverse under time pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, A. (2003). MDFT account of decision making under time pressure. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 10(1), 157–166.&lt;/ref&gt; High thresholds require a strong preference state to be reached, which allows more information about the prospects to be sampled, prolonging the deliberation process, and increasing accuracy. Low thresholds allow a weak preference state to determine the decision, which cuts off sampling information about the prospects, shortening the deliberation process, and decreasing accuracy. Under high time pressure, decision makers must choose a low threshold; but under low time pressure, a higher threshold can be used to increase accuracy. Very careful and deliberative decision makers tend to use a high threshold, and impulsive and careless decision makers use a low threshold.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;
To provide a bit more formal description of the theory, assume that the decision maker has a choice among three actions, and also suppose for simplicity that there are only four possible final outcomes. Thus each action is defined by a probability distribution across these four outcomes. The affective values produced by each payoff are represented by the values m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. At any moment in time, the decision maker anticipates the payoff of each action, which produces a momentary evaluation, U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t), for action i. This momentary evaluation is an attention-weighted average of the affective evaluation of each payoff: U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = Σ W&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(t)m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. The attention weight at time t, W&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(t), for payoff j offered by action i, is assumed to fluctuate according to a stationary stochastic process. This reflects the idea that attention is shifting from moment to moment, causing changes in the anticipated payoff of each action across time. The momentary evaluation of each action is compared with other actions to form a valence for each action at each moment, v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) – U.(t), where U.(t) equals the average across all the momentary actions. The valence represents the momentary advantage or disadvantage of each action. The total valence balances out to zero so that all the options cannot become attractive simultaneously. Finally, the valences are the inputs to a dynamic system that integrates the valences over time to generate the output preference states. The output preference state for action i at time t is symbolized as P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t). The dynamic system is described by the following linear stochastic difference equation for a small time step h in the deliberation process: P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t+h) = Σ s&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;(t)+v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t+h).The positive self feedback coefficient, s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; = s &gt; 0, controls the memory for past input valences for a preference state. Values of s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 suggest decay in the memory or impact of previous valences over time, whereas values of s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 suggest growth in impact over time (primacy effects). The negative lateral feedback coefficients, s&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = s&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 for i not equal to j, produce competition among actions so that the strong inhibit the weak. In other words, as preference for one action grows stronger, then this moderates the preference for other actions. The magnitudes of the lateral inhibitory coefficients are assumed to be an increasing function of the similarity between choice options. These lateral inhibitory coefficients are important for explaining context effects on preference described later. Formally, this is a Markov process; matrix formulas have been mathematically derived for computing the choice probabilities and distribution of choice response times.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

The decision field theory can also be seen as a dynamic and stochastic random walk theory of decision making, presented as a model positioned between lower-level neural activation patterns and more complex notions of decision making found in psychology and economics.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

==Explaining context effects==
The DFT is capable of explaining context effects that many decision making theories are unable to explain.&lt;ref&gt;Roe, R. M., Busemeyer, J. R., &amp; Townsend, J. T. (2001). Multi-alternative decision field theory: A dynamic connectionist model of decision-making. Psychological Review, 108, 370–392.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many classic probabilistic models of choice satisfy two rational types of choice principles. One principle is called [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], and according to this principle, if the probability of choosing option X is greater than option Y when only X,Y are available, then option X should remain more likely to be chosen over Y even when a new option Z is added to the choice set. In other words, adding an option should not change the preference relation between the original pair of options. A second principle is called regularity, and according to this principle, the probability of choosing option X from a set containing only X and Y should be greater than or equal to the probability of choosing option X from a larger set containing options X, Y, and a new option Z. In other words, adding an option should only decrease the probability of choosing one of the original pair of options. However, empirical findings obtained by consumer researchers studying human choice behavior have found systematic context effects that systematically violate both of these principles.

The first context effect is the similarity effect. This effect occurs with the introduction of a third option S that is similar to X but it is not dominated by X. For example, suppose X is a BMW, Y is a Ford focus, and S is an Audi. The Audi is similar to the BMW because both are not very economical but they are both high quality and sporty. The Ford focus is different from the BMW and Audi because it is more economical but lower quality. Suppose in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y. Next suppose a new choice set is formed by adding an option S that is similar to X. If X is similar to S, and both are very different from Y, the people tend to view X and S as one group and Y as another option. Thus the probability of Y remains the same whether S is presented as an option or not. However, the probability of X will decrease by approximately half with the introduction of S. This causes the probability of choosing X to drop below Y when S is added to the choice set. This violates the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y, but when S is added, then Y is chosen more frequently than X.

The second context effect is the compromise effect. This effect occurs when an option C is added that is a compromise between X and Y. For example, when choosing between C = Honda and X = BMW, the latter is less economical but higher quality. However, if another option Y = Ford Focus is added to the choice set, then C = Honda becomes a compromise between X = BMW and Y = Ford Focus. Suppose in a binary choice, X (BMW) is chosen more often than C (Honda). But when option Y (Ford Focus) is added to the choice set, then option C (Honda) becomes the compromise between X (BMW) and Y (Ford Focus), and C is then chosen more frequently than X. This is another violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because X is chosen more often than C in a binary choice, but C when option Y is added to the choice set, then C is chosen more often than X.

The third effect is called the attraction effect. This effect occurs when the third option D is very similar to X but D is defective compared to X. For example D may be a new sporty car developed by a new manufacturer that is similar to option X = BMW, but costs more than the BMW. Therefore, there is little or no reason to choose D over X, and in this situation D is rarely ever chosen over X. However, adding D to a choice set boosts the probability of choosing X. In particular, the probability of choosing X from a set containing X,Y,D is larger than the probability of choosing X from a set containing only X and Y. The defective option D makes X shine, and this attraction effect violates the principle of regularity, which says that adding another option cannot increase the popularity of an option over the original subset.

DFT accounts for all three effects using the same principles and same parameters across all three findings. According to DFT, the attention switching mechanism is crucial for producing the similarity effect, but the lateral inhibitory connections are critical for explaining the compromise and attraction effects. If the attention switching process is eliminated, then the similarity effect disappears, and if the lateral connections are all set to zero, then the attraction and compromise effects disappear. This property of the theory entails an interesting prediction about the effects of time pressure on preferences. The contrast effects produced by lateral inhibition require time to build up, which implies that the attraction and compromise effects should become larger under prolonged deliberation (see Roe et al.2001). Alternatively, if context effects are produced by switching from a weighted average rule under binary choice to a quick heuristic strategy for the triadic choice, then these effects should get larger under time pressure. Empirical tests show that prolonging the decision process increases the effects &lt;ref&gt;Pettibone, J. C. (2012). Testing the effect of time pressure on asymmetric dominance and compromise decoys in choice. Judgment and Decision Making, 7(4), 513-523.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, I. (1989). Choice based on reasons: The case of attraction and compromise effects. Journal of Consumer Research, 16, 158–174.&lt;/ref&gt; and time pressure decreases the effects.&lt;ref&gt;Dhar, R., Nowlis, S. M., &amp; Sherman, S. J. (2000). Trying hard or hardly trying: An analysis of context effects in choice. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 9, 189–200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
The Decision Field Theory has demonstrated an ability to account for a wide range of findings from behavioral decision making for which the purely algebraic and deterministic models often used in economics and psychology cannot account. Recent studies that record neural activations in non-human primates during perceptual decision making tasks have revealed that neural firing rates closely mimic the accumulation of preference theorized by behaviorally-derived diffusion models of decision making.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b"&gt;Busemeyer, J. R., R. K. Jessup, Joseph G. Johnson, James T. Townsend. (2006). [http://mypage.iu.edu/~jbusemey/NeuralNet.pdf Building bridges between neural models and complex decision making behavior]. Neural Networks 19(8): 1047-1058.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision processes of sensory-motor decisions are beginning to be fairly well understood both at the behavioral and neural levels. Typical findings indicate that neural activation regarding stimulus movement information is accumulated across time up to a threshold, and a behavioral response is made as soon as the activation in the recorded area exceeds the threshold&lt;ref&gt;Schall, J. D. (2003). Neural correlates of decision processes: neural and mental chronometry. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 13(2), 182–186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, J. I., &amp; Shadlen, M. N. (2000). Representation of a perceptual decision in developing oculomotor commands. Nature, 404(6776), 390–394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazurek, M. E., Roitman, J. D., Ditterich, J., &amp; Shadlen, M. N. (2003). A role for neural integrators in perceptual decision making. Cerebral Cortex, 13(11), 1257–1269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, R., Cherian, A., &amp; Segraves, M. (2003). A comparison of macaque behavior and superior colliculus neuronal activity to predictions from models of two-choice decisions. Journal of Neurophysiology, 90(3), 1392–1407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shadlen, M. N., &amp; Newsome, W. T. (2001). Neural basis of a perceptual decision in the parietal cortex (area LIP) of the rhesus monkey. Journal of Neurophysiology, 86(4), 1916–1936.&lt;/ref&gt; for examples). A conclusion that one can draw is that the neural areas responsible for planning or carrying out certain actions are also responsible for deciding the action to carry out, a decidedly embodied notion.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b" /&gt;

Mathematically, the spike activation pattern, as well as the choice and response time distributions, can be well described by what are known as diffusion models - especially in [[Two-alternative forced choice]] tasks(see Smith &amp; Ratcliff&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. L., &amp; Ratcliff, R. (2004). Psychology and neurobiology of simple decisions. Trends in Neurosciences, 27(3), 161–168.&lt;/ref&gt; for a summary). Diffusion models, such as the decision field theory, can be viewed as stochastic recurrent neural network models, except that the dynamics are approximated by linear systems. The linear approximation is important for maintaining a mathematically tractable analysis of systems perturbed by noisy inputs. In addition to these neuroscience applications, diffusion models (or their discrete time, random walk, analogues) have been used by cognitive scientists to model performance in a variety of tasks ranging from sensory detection,&lt;ref name=smith1995/&gt; and perceptual discrimination,&lt;ref name=laming1968/&gt;&lt;ref name=link1975/&gt;&lt;ref name=usher2001/&gt; to memory recognition,&lt;ref name=ratcliff1978/&gt; and categorization.&lt;ref name=ashby2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=nosofsky1997/&gt; Thus, diffusion models provide the potential to form a theoretical bridge between neural models of sensory-motor tasks and behavioral models of complex-cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7523">'''Demonization''' is the reinterpretation of [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities as [[evil]], lying [[demon]]s by other [[religion]]s, generally [[monotheism|monotheistic]] and [[henotheistic]] ones. The term has since been expanded to refer to any characterization of individuals, groups, or political bodies as evil.

== Religion ==
Religions, even those that are radically monotheistic, do not necessarily deny the existence of other gods or spiritual beings. On the contrary, they claim other [[deity|gods]] are not worthy of worship and in actuality are demons who mislead followers from proper belief or practice. [[Christian]] [[missionaries]] often employed demonization tactics when converting [[pagan]]s, although [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and other religions have similar histories. Demonization is not limited to focusing on other religions but can also be directed inward to condemn various schools of thought or movements. 

From a secular viewpoint, demonization can be used to denigrate an opposed individual or group, making adherents to your own religion or viewpoint less inclined to do business with them (and possibly convert) and more inclined to fight against them. If foreigners are evil and corrupted by demonic influence, then any means of self-defense is easily portrayed as legitimate. The portrayal of almost all pagans in the Middle East as [[Baal]]-worshippers in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;"Ye shall destroy their [[altar]]s, and break in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their groves, and the [[Idolatry|graven images]] of their gods ye shall burn with fire." [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and [[donkey|ass]], with the edge of the sword." [[Joshua]] 6:21&lt;/ref&gt; If pagans are corrupted by the demon-"god" Baal, then clearly they must be fought or at least oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;"Demons in the Old Testament", Dennis Bratcher, 2006, retrieved 6 May 207.[http://www.crivoice.org/demonsot.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the earlier books of the Hebrew Bible, foreign deities are portrayed as existing and corrupting entities rather than being mere powerless [[idolatry|idols]]. Some would argue this later transferred to Christianity after [[Constantine I]]'s ascension in its [[persecution of Ancient Roman religion|suppression of Roman paganism]].&lt;ref name="jerome"/&gt; Some of the most known of these demonizations are [[Lucifer]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Baphomet]] up to the extend that they became [[synonym]] for the [[devil]]/[[satan]] of [[Abrahamic religions]]. Later, the language of demonization would be invoked during the [[Spanish Inquisition]], leading to the expulsion of [[Jews]] and [[Morisco]]s from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;"Edict of the Expulsion of the Jews", 1492, Translated from the Castilian by Edward Peters, retrieved 6 May 2007.[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/decree.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of early Judaism treating foreign deities as devils and later Judaism treating them as non-existent is not universal. Psalms 96:5, for example, is alternately translated as, "For all the Gods of the gentiles are nothing," "For all the Gods of the gentiles are devils" ([[Vulgate]]), and "For all the gods of the peoples are idols."([[NRSV]]) The Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of that passage, used by the early Christian Church, used the "devils" version.&lt;ref name="jerome"&gt;"The Greek [[Septuagint]] translated into English", Psalm 95:5, translated by Sir Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton, 1851.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] would follow the Greek text rather than the Hebrew when he translated the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] edition of the Bible. The "devils" epithet would still appear in Bibles up until the end of the 20th century when the consensus reverted to the original Hebrew text for modern translations.

Analogs to demonization exist outside monotheistic religions, as well. [[Polytheism]] easily accepts foreign gods in general, and in times of conflict, a foreign nation's gods would sometimes be portrayed as evil. Less commonly, it would be applied to other religions as well. For example, Buddha's portrayal in Hinduism varies: Some strains of [[Hinduism]] consider the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] an [[Buddha from the Hindu perspective|incarnation of Vishnu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cuhcs/info.faq.php Cambridge University Hindu Cultural Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203192324/http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cuhcs/info.faq.php |date=3 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in some texts such as the [[Puranas]], he is portrayed as an avatar born to mislead those who deny the Vedic knowledge.&lt;ref name="Holt2008p18"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Clifford Holt|title=The Buddhist Viṣṇu: Religious Transformation, Politics, and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvuDlhpvvHwC&amp;pg=PA18 |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-3269-5|pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p96"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

According to Alf Hiltebeitel and other scholars, some of the stories in Buddha-related Jataka tales found in Pali texts seem slanderous distortions of Hindu legends, but these may reflect the ancient local traditions and the complexities of early interaction between the two Indian religions.&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel1990p64"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=The Ritual of Battle: Krishna in the Mahabharata|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vwWGX08JAx8C|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0250-4|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In a certain way, the demonization had sometimes a positive side. For example, during [[Catholic missions]] in [[South America]], the demonization of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] beliefs or acts make those peoples be regarded as so [[Human nature|human]] as the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Puls, M. (2015). Cristianismo negociado. ''Pesquisa FAPESP'' 237: 86-89 (in Portuguese), [http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/2015/11/17/cristianismo-negociado/].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political conflicts ===
Demonization is sometimes used against what are arguably political opponents rather than religious ones. The [[Knights Templar]] were destroyed by accusations that they worshipped [[Baphomet]] from King [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Baphomet, often thought to be [[Beelzebub]], may have been used because of the likeness of this [[horn (anatomy)|horned]] deity with the Christian images of [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_pent.htm " Pentacles and Pentagrams", Religious Tolerance, retrieved 6 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Baphomet |volume=3 |page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
In colloquial usage, the term demonization is used metaphorically to refer to [[propaganda]] or [[moral panic]] directed against any individual or group.

'''Divine command theory''' (also known as '''theological voluntarism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/ Theological Voluntarism]&amp;nbsp;— [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[medieval theological voluntarism]] and [[theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory which proposes that an action's status as [[Morality|morally]] [[good]] is equivalent to whether it is commanded by [[God]]. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that for a person to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.

Numerous variants of the theory have been presented: historically, figures including [[Saint Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] have presented various versions of divine command theory; more recently, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] has proposed a "modified divine command theory" based on the [[omnibenevolence]] of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong. [[Paul Copan]] has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint, and [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski]]'s divine motivation theory proposes that God's motivations, rather than commands, are the source of morality.

Semantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostics]] could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on [[Modal logic|modal]] grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], first proposed by [[Plato]] (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral [[autonomy]] and [[religious pluralism]], although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.

==General form==
Various forms of divine command theory have been presented by philosophers including [[William of Ockham]], [[St Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[John Calvin]]. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of [[God]] and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the only reason that a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin 1993, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of their being commanded by God, and many [[religious belief|religious believers]] subscribe to some form of divine command theory.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson, Holmgren 2010, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/ | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine command theory features in the ethics of many modern religions, including [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and [[Christianity]], as well as being a part of numerous older [[polytheism|polytheistic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Rae 2009, ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Athens]], it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 2011, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

===Augustine===
[[Saint Augustine]] offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good, which delivers human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment.&lt;ref name=IEP-2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H2 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=15 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine supported [[Plato|Plato's]] view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting [[autonomy#Philosophy|autonomously]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Keller, Leever &amp; White 2009, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Duns Scotus===
[[File:JohnDunsScotus.jpg|thumb|John Duns Scotus, who proposed a variant of divine command theory]]
[[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher [[John Duns Scotus]] argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Swinburne, Richard | year=2007 | pages=358–359 | isbn=978-0-19-921246-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus argued that the [[natural law]], in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently [[logical truth|analytically true]] and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the [[Ten Commandments]]. The last seven of the [[Ten Commandments]] do not belong to the natural law in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst our duties to God are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without. Hence, the last seven commandments do belong to the natural law, but not in the strictest sense, as they belong to the natural law by rectitude rather than by definition.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

Whilst Aquinas, as a natural law theorist, is generally seen as holding that morality is not willed by God,&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#NatLaw&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly James Clark and Anne Poortenga have presented a defence of divine command theory based on [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas']] moral theory. Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence, and so human nature can determine what is moral. Clark and Poortenga argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
The [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures, among whom is ethicist [[R. M. Hare]]. Kant's view that morality should be determined by the [[categorical imperative]]&amp;nbsp;– duty to the moral law, rather than acting for a specific end&amp;nbsp;– has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory. Philosopher and theologian [[John E. Hare]] has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant's [[heteronomy|heteronomous will]]&amp;nbsp;– motives besides the moral law, which Kant regarded as non-moral.&lt;ref name=PT263&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher [[Lewis White Beck]] takes Kant's argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends of divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Hare challenges this view, arguing that [[Kantian ethics]] should be seen as compatible with divine command theory.&lt;ref name=PT263/&gt;

===Robert Adams===
[[File:RobertMerrihewAdams20060625.jpg|thumb|Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory"]]
American philosopher [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory".&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent:
#It is wrong to do X.
#It is contrary to God's commands to do X.&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008/&gt;
He proposes that God's commands precurse moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths, not the other way around. Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically 'wrong' consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a [[Judeo-Christian]] context. In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it, he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake. Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty, rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature. Adams emphasises the importance of [[faith]] in God, specifically faith in God's goodness, as well as his existence.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams proposes that an action is morally wrong [[if and only if]] it defies the commands of a loving God. If cruelty was commanded, he would not be loving; Adams argued that, in this instance, God's commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2003, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his [[omnibenevolence]]. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"/&gt;

Adams proposes that in many Judeo-Christian contexts, the term 'wrong' is used to mean being contrary to God's commands. In ethical contexts, he believes that 'wrong' [[logical consequence|entails]] an [[emotivism|emotional]] attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 561-2&lt;/ref&gt; Adams suggests that a believer's concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right. If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong, the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him; rather their concept of morality would break down.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God's omnipotence. Thomas Aquinas argued that God's omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible: he attempted to refute the idea that God's inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence. Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical, so is not covered by Aquinas' defence, although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7a | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
[[Paul Copan]] argues from a Christian viewpoint that man, made in God's image, conforms to God's sense of morality. The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God; a person's sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God's.&lt;ref name=Copan&gt;Copan, Paul, and William Lane Craig. ''Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics.'' Nashville, Tennessee: B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2007. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|We would not know goodness without God's endowing us with a moral constitution. We have rights, dignity, freedom, and responsibility because God has designed us this way. In this, we reflect God's moral goodness as His image-bearers.|Paul Copan|Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics&lt;ref name="Copan" /&gt;}}

As an alternative to divine command theory, Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory, which still fits into a monotheistic framework. According to this theory, goodness is determined by God's motives, rather than by what he commands. Divine motivation theory is similar to [[virtue ethics]] because it considers the character of an agent, and whether they are in accordance with God's, as the standard for moral value.&lt;ref&gt;Baggett &amp; Walls 2011, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties, such as being lovable, which are given to them through God's perception of them. God's attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-238093747.html | title=Zagzebski, Linda Trinkaus. Divine Motivation Theory.(Book review) | publisher=The Review of Metaphysics | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=25 August 2012 | author=Toner, Christopher |via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory casts God as a good example for morality, and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite, imperfect beings.&lt;ref&gt;Langermann 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==

===Semantic objections===
Philosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds, arguing that "being commanded by God" and "being obligatory" do not mean the same thing, contrary to what the theory suggests. He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to propose that "being commanded by God" does not have an identical meaning to "being obligatory". This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on [[modal logic|modal]] ideas of what might exist in different worlds. He suggested that, even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same, they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral motivation===
Michael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations. He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued, rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward. This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate.&lt;ref name=IEP-2 /&gt;

===Euthyphro dilemma===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato presents the Euthyphro dilemma in one of his dialogues.]]
{{Main|Euthyphro dilemma}}
The [[Euthyphro dilemma]] was proposed in [[Plato|Plato's]] dialogue between [[Socrates]] and [[Euthyphro]]. In the scene, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma, which can be presented as the question 'Is X good because God commands it, or does God command X because it is good?'&lt;ref name=IEPPlato&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H3 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?|Plato|Euthyphro&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;}}
The Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action, or that God commands an action because it is good. If the first is chosen, it would imply that whatever God commands must be good: even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering, then inflicting suffering must be moral. If the latter is chosen, then morality is no longer dependent on God, defeating the divine command theory. Additionally, if God is subject to an external law, he is not sovereign or [[omnipotent]], which would challenge the orthodox conception of God. Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws.&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;

[[William of Ockham]] responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by '[[bite the bullet|biting the bullet]]'. He argued that, if God did command people to be cruel, then that would be morally obligatory, proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the [[principle of non-contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Moral Dilemmas in Medieval Thought: From Gratian to Aquinas | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Dougherty, M. V. | year=2011 | pages=163–164 | isbn=978-1-107-00707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] defended Ockham's view, noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what we consider to be immoral, not an actuality. Even if God could logically command these actions, he would not because that is not his character.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH4 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonore Stump and [[Norman Kretzmann]] have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of [[divine simplicity]], a concept associated with Aquinas and [[Aristotle]] which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical. They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=God, Goodness and Philosophy | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Harris, Harriet | year=2011 | pages=101 | isbn=978-1-4094-2852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American philosopher [[William Alston]] responded to the [[Euthyphro dilemma]] by considering what it means for God to be morally good. If divine command theory is accepted, it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God's goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations. He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God, so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands. Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character, which is necessarily good. There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Omnibenevolence===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and some more recent philosophers, challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God's goodness consists of his following his own commands. It is argued that, if divine command theory is accepted, God's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent. Neither could God hold any virtues, as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands&amp;nbsp;– if he cannot logically command himself, then he cannot logically have any virtues. Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good, but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy. William Wainwright argues that, although God does not act because of his commands, it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions. He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and, when he commands what is morally good, it becomes morally obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7b | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomy===
Michael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy, which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by. This challenges the view of divine command theory that God's will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous, but followers of an imposed moral law, making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory. Robert Adams challenges this criticism, arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God's commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7c | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Austin considers the view that, in a world of [[religious pluralism]], it is impossible to know which god's or religion's commands should be followed, especially because some religions contradict others, leaving it impossible to accept all of them. Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded. Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant, as an agent must choose whichever [[religion and morality]] they judge to be correct. He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that [[Ethics in religion|moral truths can be found in all religions]] and that moral revelation can be found [[Morality without religion|apart from religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7d | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heimir Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other (monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity, for example, and some Greek or Norse gods magnified human weaknesses). They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that, even within a religion, contrasting views of God exist&amp;nbsp;– the commands of God in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s could seem to contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson &amp; Holmgren 2010, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental health''' is the branch of [[public health]] concerned with all aspects of the [[natural environment|natural]] and [[built environment]] affecting human health. Other terms referring to or concerning environmental health are '''environmental public health''', and '''public health protection/''' '''environmental health protection'''. Environmental health is focused on the natural and built environments for the benefit of human health, whereas [[environmental protection]] is concerned with protecting the natural environment for the benefit of human health and the ecosystem.

==Definitions==
Environmental health has been defined in a 1999 document by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as:
:Those aspects of the [[human health]] and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially affect health.

:Environmental health as used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, includes both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation and some biological agents, and the effects (often indirect) on health and well being of the broad physical, psychological, social and cultural environment, which includes housing, urban development, land use and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Novice| first = Robert (editor) | title = Overview of the environment and health in Europe in the 1990s| work = | publisher = World Health Organization| date =  1999-03-29| url = http://www.euro.who.int/document/e66792.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 the WHO website on environmental health states "Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviours. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. This definition excludes behaviour not related to environment, as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment, as well as genetics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Health topics: Environmental health| url = http://www.who.int/topics/environmental_health/en/|author=WHO|date=n.d.|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO has also defined environmental health services as "those services which implement environmental health policies through monitoring and control activities. They also carry out that role by promoting the improvement of environmental parameters and by encouraging the use of environmentally friendly and healthy technologies and behaviors. They also have a leading role in developing and suggesting new policy areas."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The term [[environmental medicine]] may be seen as a medical specialty, or branch of the broader field of environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Terminology is not fully established, and in many European countries they are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Environmental health profession==
Environmental health professionals may be known as [[environmental health officer]]s, public health inspectors, environmental health specialists, environmental health practitioners, or sanitarians. Researchers and policy-makers also play important roles in how environmental health is practiced in the field. In many European countries, physicians and veterinarians are involved in environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the [[United Kingdom]], practitioners must have a graduate degree in environmental health and be certified and registered with the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health or the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/environmentalhealthofficer.aspx |title=Job Profiles: Environmental health officer| publisher=National Careers Service (UK) |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, practitioners in environmental health are required to obtain an approved bachelor's degree in environmental health along with the national professional certificate, the Certificate in Public Health Inspection (Canada) [[CPHI(C)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciphi.ca |title=Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many states in the [[United States]] also require that individuals have a bachelor's degree and professional [[license]]s in order to practice environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[California]] state law defines the scope of practice of environmental health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code, section 106615(e)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Scope of practice in environmental health" means the practice of environmental health by registered environmental health specialists in the public and private sector within the meaning of this article and includes, but is not limited to, organization, management, education, enforcement, consultation, and emergency response for the purpose of prevention of environmental health hazards and the promotion and protection of the public health and the environment in the following areas: food protection; housing; institutional environmental health; land use; community noise control; recreational swimming areas and waters; electromagnetic radiation control; solid, liquid, and hazardous materials management; underground storage tank control; onsite septic systems; vector control; drinking water quality; water sanitation; emergency preparedness; and milk and dairy sanitation pursuant to Section 33113 of the Food and Agricultural Code.

The environmental health [[profession]] had its modern-day roots in the sanitary and public health movement of the United Kingdom. This was epitomized by [[Edwin Chadwick|Sir Edwin Chadwick]], who was instrumental in the repeal of the [[poor law]]s, and in 1884 was the founding president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now called the [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Disciplines ==

Five basic disciplines generally contribute to the field of environmental health: environmental epidemiology, toxicology, exposure science, environmental engineering, and environmental law. Each of these disciplines contributes different information to describe problems and solutions in environmental health, but there is some overlap among them.
:*[[Environmental epidemiology]] studies the relationship between environmental exposures (including exposure to chemicals, radiation, microbiological agents, etc.) and human health. Observational studies, which simply observe exposures that people have already experienced, are common in environmental epidemiology because humans cannot ethically be exposed to agents that are known or suspected to cause disease. While the inability to use experimental study designs is a limitation of environmental epidemiology, this discipline directly observes effects on human health rather than estimating effects from animal studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Toxicology]] studies how environmental exposures lead to specific health outcomes, generally in animals, as a means to understand possible health outcomes in humans. Toxicology has the advantage of being able to conduct randomized controlled trials and other experimental studies because they can use animal subjects. However there are many differences in animal and human biology, and there can be a lot of uncertainty when interpreting the results of [[animal studies]] for their implications for human health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Exposure science]] studies human exposure to environmental contaminants by both identifying and quantifying exposures. Exposure science can be used to support environmental epidemiology by better describing environmental exposures that may lead to a particular health outcome,identify common exposures whose health outcomes may be better understood through a toxicology study, or can be used in a risk assessment to determine whether current levels of exposure might exceed recommended levels. Exposure science has the advantage of being able to very accurately quantify exposures to specific chemicals, but it does not generate any information about health outcomes like environmental epidemiology or toxicology.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Environmental engineering]] applies scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments from potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and general improvement of environmental quality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
:*[[Environmental law]] includes the network of treaties, statutes, regulations, common and customary laws addressing the effects of human activity on the natural environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Information from epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science can be combined to conduct a [[risk assessment]] for specific chemicals, mixtures of chemicals or other risk factors to determine whether an exposure poses significant risk to human health (exposure would likely result in the development of [[List_of_pollution-related_diseases|pollution-related diseases]]). This can in turn be used to develop and implement environmental health policy that, for example, regulates chemical emissions, or imposes standards for proper [[sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTgSBW8jE8QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=environmental%20health%20from%20global%20to%20local%20by%20howard%20frumkin&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=environmental%20health%20from%20global%20to%20local%20by%20howard%20frumkin&amp;f=false|title= Environmental Health: from Global to Local|edition=2 Editor= Howard Frumkin|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|location= San Francisco|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Actions of engineering and law can be combined to provide [[risk management]] to minimize, monitor, and otherwise manage the impact of exposure to protect human health to achieve the objectives of environmental health policy.

==Concerns==
{{prose|date=January 2015}}
Environmental health addresses all human-health-related aspects of the natural environment and the built environment. Environmental health concerns include:

* [[Air quality]], including both ambient outdoor air and [[indoor air quality]], which also comprises concerns about [[environmental tobacco smoke]].
* [[Biosafety]]
* [[Effects of climate change on human health|Climate change and its effects on health]].
* [[Disaster preparedness]] and response.
* [[Food safety]], including in [[agriculture]], [[transportation]], [[food processing]], [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] distribution and sale.
* [[Hazardous materials]] management, including [[hazardous waste]] management, contaminated site remediation, the prevention of leaks from [[underground storage tank]]s and the prevention of hazardous materials releases to the environment and responses to emergency situations resulting from such releases.
* [[House|Housing]], including [[substandard housing]] abatement and the inspection of [[jails]] and [[prisons]].
* Childhood [[lead poisoning]] prevention.
* [[Land use planning]], including [[smart growth]].
* Liquid waste disposal, including city [[waste water treatment]] plants and on-site waste water disposal systems, such as [[septic tank]] systems and [[chemical toilet]]s.
* [[Medical waste]] management and disposal.
* [[Noise pollution]] control.
* [[Occupational health]] and [[industrial hygiene]].
* Radiological health, including exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] from [[X-rays]] or [[radioactive isotopes]].
* Recreational water illness prevention, including from [[swimming pools]], spas and [[ocean]] and [[freshwater]] bathing places.
* Safe [[drinking water]].
* [[Solid waste management]], including [[landfill]]s, [[recycling]] facilities, [[composting]] and solid waste transfer stations.
* [[Toxic]] chemical exposure whether in [[consumer products]], housing, workplaces, air, water or soil.
* [[Vector control]], including the control of [[mosquitoes]], [[rodents]], [[flies]], [[cockroach]]es and other animals that may transmit [[pathogens]].

According to recent estimates, about 5 to 10% of [[Disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs) lost are due to environmental causes in Europe. By far the most important factor is fine [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] pollution in urban air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/nl/national-and-regional-story-netherlands-1 National and regional story (Netherlands) - Environmental burden of disease in Europe: the Abode project]. EEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, environmental exposures have been estimated to contribute to 4.9 million (8.7%) deaths and 86 million (5.7%) [[DALYs]] globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehjournal.net/content/10/1/9 Knows and unknowns on burden of disease due to chemicals: a systematic review]. Press-Ustinov, A., et al. 2011. Environmental Health 10:9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Superfund sites created by various companies have been found to be hazardous to human and environmental health in nearby communities. It was this perceived threat, raising the specter of miscarriages, mutations, birth defects, and cancers that most frightened the public.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher, D. (1995). Superfund’s Abandoned Hazardous Waste Sites. In A. Wildavsky (Ed.), But Is it True?: A Citizen’s Guide to Environmental Health and Safety Issues (153-184) . Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html |title=TEHIP|publisher= United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site, that includes open access to resources produced by US government agencies and organizations, and is maintained under the umbrella of the Specialized Information Service at the [[United States National Library of Medicine]]. TEHIP includes links to technical databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and consumer-oriented resources. 
TEHIP is responsible for the [[Toxicology Data Network]] (TOXNET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/|title=TOXNET|publisher= United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases including the [[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]], that are open access, i.e. available free of charge.

==Mapping==

There are many environmental health mapping tools. [[TOXMAP]] is a geographic information system (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;[http://sis.nlm.nih.gov sis.nlm.nih.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23372">'''Garden waste''', or '''[[green waste]] dumping''' is the act of discarding or depositing garden waste somewhere it does not belong.    
 
[[Green waste|Garden waste]] is the accumulated plant matter from gardening activities which involve cutting or removing vegetation, i.e. cutting the lawn, weed removal, hedge trimming or pruning consisting of lawn clippings. leaf matter, wood and soil.&lt;ref name="Aarhus 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boldrin | first1 = A. | last2 = Christensen | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Seasonal generation and composition of garden waste in Aarhus (Denmark) | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2009.11.031 | pmid = 20042325 | journal = Waste Management | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 551–557 | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/seasonal-generation-and-composition-of-garden-waste-in-aarhus-denmark(4b0d9f5e-3ce8-4e63-ac0a-97fdd557b784).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition and volume of garden waste can vary from season to season and location to location. A study in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], found that on average, garden waste generation per person ranged between 122&amp;nbsp;kg to 155&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name="Aarhus 2009"/&gt;

Garden waste may be used to create [[compost]] or [[mulch]], which can be used as a soil conditioner, adding valuable nutrients and building [[humus]]. The creation of compost requires a balance between, nitrogen, carbon, moisture and oxygen. Without the ideal balance, plant matter may take a long time to break down, drawing nitrogen from other sources, reducing nitrogen availability to existing vegetation which requires it for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Bertoldi | first1 = M. | last2 = Vallini | first2 = G. | last3 = Pera | first3 = A. | year = 1983 | title = The Biology of Composting: a Review | doi = 10.1177/0734242x8300100118 | journal = Waste Management &amp; Research | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 157–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of dumping garden waste is that it may contain seeds and plant parts that may grow ([[propagules]]), as well as increase fire fuel loads, disrupt visual amenity, accrue economic costs associated with the removal of waste as well as costs associated with the mitigation of associated impacts such as [[weed control]], forest fire.

==Cause==
There are strong links between weed invasion of natural areas and the proximity and density of housing.&lt;ref name="Another way forward"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = T | year = 2005 | title = Another way forward | doi = 10.1038/vital306-2c | journal = Vital | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The size and duration of the community have a direct relation to the density of weed infestation.&lt;ref name="Another way forward"/&gt; Of the various means in which migration of exotic species from gardens take place, such as vegetative dispersal of runners, wind born and fallen seed, garden waste dumping can play a significant role.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakayama | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = ChemInform Abstract: Chemistry of Inner Salts which Are Composed of (R2N)2C+- and -CX2- (X: S, Se) Ions | doi = 10.1002/chin.200226261 | journal = ChemInform | volume = 33 | issue = 26| pages = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of one North German study found that of the problematic population of [[Fallopia]], app. 29% originated from garden waste. Of a population of [[Heracleum mantegazzianum]], 18% was found by Schepker to be generated by garden waste (as cited by Kowarik &amp; von der Lippe, 2008) pg 24-25.

An Australia government publication suggest that some of the main reasons for the dumping of garden waste can be attributed to lack of care for the environment, convenience, or a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. 2013). People dump garden waste to avoid disposal fees at [[landfill]] sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly. This activity is carried out by people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses, such as professional landscapers and gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fabricius | first1 = K. | last2 = Logan | first2 = M. | last3 = Weeks | first3 = S. | last4 = Lewis | first4 = S. | last5 = Brodie | first5 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Changes in water clarity in response to river discharges on the Great Barrier Reef continental shelf: 2002–2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecss.2016.03.001 | journal = Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science | volume = 173 | issue = | pages = A1–A15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spread of exotic vegetation can out-compete locally endemic vegetation, altering the composition and structure of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qvenild | first1 = M. | last2 = Setten | first2 = G. | last3 = Skår | first3 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Politicising plants: Dwelling and invasive alien species in domestic gardens in Norway | doi = 10.1080/00291951.2013.870599 | journal = [[Norwegian Journal of Geography|Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift - Norwegian Journal of Geography]] | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 22–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumping of garden waste in particular facilitates the spread of exotic vegetation into forest remnants via the introduction of seeds and propagules contained within the garden waste.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Common selection criteria for home gardeners when choosing plants are often based on ease of propagation, suitability to local environmental conditions and novelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rusterholz | first1 = H. | last2 = Wirz | first2 = D. | last3 = Baur | first3 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Garden waste deposits as a source for non-native plants in mixed deciduous forests | doi = 10.1111/j.1654-109x.2011.01175.x | journal = Applied Vegetation Science | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 329–337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific chosen characteristics increase the chance of plant parts and seeds that are introduced into forested areas becoming a problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The three major causes of animal habitat degradation are; the disruption or loss of ecosystem functions, the loss of food resources and loss of resident species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Airoldi | first1 = L. | last2 = Balata | first2 = D. | last3 = Beck | first3 = M.W. | year = 2008 | title = The Gray Zone: Relationships between habitat loss and marine diversity and their applications in conservation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology | volume = 366 | issue = | pages = 8–15 | doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2008.07.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-native invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through competition, pest and disease transportation and habitat and ecosystem alteration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = R.N. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D. | last3 = Lonsdale | first3 = W.M. | last4 = Evans | first4 = H. | last5 = Clout | first5 = M. | last6 = Bazzaz | first6 = F.A. | year = 2000 | title = Biotic invasions: causes, epidemiology, global consequences, and control | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 689–710 | doi=10.2307/2641039| jstor = 2641039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The dumping of garden waste in nature reserves surrounding and near urban areas increases the risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dumped garden waste will eventually dry out creating fuel adding to already fallen debris fuel load on which a fire can thrive and spread on.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/threatenedspecies/08450krp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds build fuel for fires.
Dumped garden waste can facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.&lt;ref name="ehp.qld.gov.au"&gt;Department of Environment and Heritage Protection. (2016). Ehp.qld.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;
With no root systems for stabilisation the top soil is vulnerable to erosion (Ritter, J. 2015), This can add higher  levels of sediments, contributing to the siltation of creeks and waterways.&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"&gt;Home - Maroondah City Council. (2016). Maroondah.vic.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

If plant matter gets into waterways it can create reduced oxygen levels through the process of decomposition of green waste such as lawn clippings. This directly upsets the quality of water, affecting fish and aquatic wildlife.&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"/&gt;
This dumping of green waste can also lead to the blocking of drainage systems; directly through the build-up of plant debris, and indirectly through the spread of invasive plant species that colonise wet areas, reducing and or changing the flow of waterways. This change in flow, including path and velocity, can alter hydrological cycles, affecting frequency and intensity of floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gordon | first1 = D | year = 1998 | title = Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida | doi = 10.2307/2640955 | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = 975 | jstor = 2640955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Green and garden waste has a direct impact to the visual aesthetics of land and can often attract further [[illegal dumping]].

===Increased fire risk===
Dumping garden waste in [[nature reserves]] and parks surrounding and near [[urban areas]] can effect directly and indirectly the existing [[flora]] and [[fauna]], as well as human life through the  increased risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dumped garden waste will eventually dry, creating additional  fuel, adding to already fallen debris on which a fire can thrive and spread. Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds also build fuel for fires. Fires may also spread to the suburban areas where humans can also be impacted by losing their homes from fire, incur injury or death from smoke or burns, and suffer economic loses such as income loss and clean-up costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scorza | first1 = C. | last2 = Cavalheiro | first2 = E. | last3 = Scorza | first3 = F. | year = 2008 | title = Myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2C (MEF2C) expression in the dentate gyrus during development and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus: a preliminary report | doi = 10.1590/s0004-282x2008000500024 | journal = Arq. Neuro-Psiquiatr | volume = 66 | issue = 3b| pages = 731–735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fires can lead to an overall loss of [[habitat]] and biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threat to biodiversity===
The invasion of exotic plant [[species]] into remnant native forests is a threat to biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allison | first1 = H. | last2 = Hobbs | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Natural Resource Management at Four Social Scales: Psychological Type Matters | doi = 10.1007/s00267-010-9442-1 | pmid = 20148248 | journal = Environmental Management | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 590–602 | url = http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/1435/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some impacts of habitat degradation include; when native animals, insects and birds become vulnerable and put at risk; loss of food source for native wildlife; disruption of native plant-animal relationships ie pollination and seed dispersal and disconnection of plant-host relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = A. | last2 = Singhal | first2 = G. | year = 1999 | title = Journal search results - Cite This For Me. | doi = 10.1023/a:1007095426376 | journal = Photosynthetica | volume = 36 | issue = 1/2| pages = 213–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly adaptive plants chosen for their ease of cultivation out compete more specialised species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Weed invasion of a forest system can change the processes of plant succession (the system of one species replacing another due to disturbance factors), the composition of the [[plant community]] and the composition and availability of nutrients. The change in forest composition can lead to loss of unique plant species.
When a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other [[organisms]] that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/mahc.2004.35 | volume=26 | issue=4 | title=Table of Contents | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | pages=c2| year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem. The term 'hotspot' is used to describe areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and facing high potential of habitat degradation. The 25 most significant hotspots contain the habitats of 133,149 plant species (44% of all plant species worldwide; table 1) and 9,645 vertebrate species (35% of all vertebrate worldwide; table 2). These endemics are confined to an expanse of 2.1 million square kilometers (1.4% of land surface). Having lost 88% of their primary vegetation, they formerly occupied 17.4 million square kilometers or 11.8% of land surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The surface of α-subunit loop 1 distant from the subunit interface is exposed in the hCG lutropin receptor complex | doi = 10.1016/s0304-4165(00)00097-0 | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects | volume = 1475 | issue = 3| pages = 390–394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The recruitment of alien invasive species may lead to a homogenisation of landscapes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Although increased bio diversity in subregions created by newly [[introduced species]] may occur, the displacement of the existing plant species may lead to reduced biodiversity on a global scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

When population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13–24 (42–77%) of the species are included, with the majority of species showing traits capable of modifying natural systems at both ecosystem and community/population scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Doria R.|date=1998-01-01|title=Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida|jstor=2640955|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=4|pages=975–989|doi=10.2307/2640955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waterways quality===
The dumping of green waste such as lawn clippings can block drainage systems which pollutes water therefore effecting water quality and the health of aquatic plants and animals. Dumped garden waste can add high levels of sediments, reducing the light available for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Water quality"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au/WaterQuality.aspx|title=Water quality|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"/&gt;  Dumping also block waterways and roads, cause flooding and facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.&lt;ref name="ehp.qld.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Water quality"/&gt;

==Causes / stakeholders==
Illegal dumping is carried out by all types of people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses and other organizations. Addressing these motivations will enable strategies to be developed that deal with the root causes, rather than the results, of illegal dumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=164054495563058;res=IELAPA |title=Tougher penalties for illegal waste in NSW [online]|journal=Waste Management and Environment |volume=25|issue=2|pages=14|date=March 2014|last1=Parrino|first1=Maysaa|last2=Kaoutarani|first2=Salam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main reasons for this careless disregard for waste can be put down to sheer convenience, lack of care for the environment and also a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. The monitoring of illegally dumped garden waste by the community and industries will drive effectual tactics to battle illegal depositing. People dump waste illegally to avoid disposal fees at landfill sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly.&lt;ref name="Water quality"/&gt; Alligator weed (''Alternanthera philoxeroides'' (Mart.) Griseb.) is an introduced weed originating from Sri Lanka and is creating major issues throughout the Australia since its introduction into the country. Alligator weed has the potential to affect aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity severely and to cause considerable social and economic costs, particularly in aquatic situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panetta|first=F. Dane|last2=Lawes|first2=Roger|date=2005-09-01|title=Evaluation of weed eradication programs: the delimitation of extent|journal=Diversity and Distributions|language=en|volume=11|issue=5|pages=435–442|doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2005.00179.x|issn=1472-4642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==
Education on the value of biodiversity and the negative effects of weed invasion have been identified as key items in changing current trends. Specific education campaigns on the risks of dumping garden waste could be targeted at high-risk societal groups such as residents of housing in close proximity to reserves as well as members of gardening communities and plant sellers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Restricting the selection of garden species in new housing developments adjacent to reserves may reduce the effects of [[illegal dumping]], thereby reducing requirement and associated cost of weed management. Creating habitat for wildlife by planting native plants, making a water source available, provide shelter and places to raise young.&lt;ref&gt;National Wildlife Federation. (2016). Nwf.org. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.nwf.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy ecosystems are necessary for the survival and health of all organisms, and there are a number of ways to reduce negative impact on the environment. Cultivation of native plant species may benefit not only native plant populations but also native animal populations. For example, Sears &amp; Anderson suggest&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Biodiversity 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinney | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Urbanization, Biodiversity, and Conservation | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0883:ubac]2.0.co;2 | journal = BioScience | volume = 52 | issue = 10| page = 883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that native bird species diversity in Australia and North America tend to match the volume and diversity of native vegetation. Crisp also explains&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Biodiversity 2002"/&gt; the percentage of native insect species in a fauna has been found to be consistent with the percentage of native plant species.

Composting is a great way to recycle nutrients back into soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 0 | last1 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Dr. Reynolds, ''et al.'' reply | doi = 10.3899/jrheum.080694 | pmid = 19208581 | journal = The Journal of Rheumatology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 454–5; author reply 455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulching the garden with leaves and clippings (BMCC, n.d). 
Fostering an appreciation of local natural environmental features and plant species may also help mitigate the issue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as well as the restriction of highly invasive plant species through international policy.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN. 2000. Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species. http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Policy&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Utilization of green waste bins that are provided by some councils or shires that are emptied via curbside collection (BMCC. n.d). The addition of facilities for waste disposal could also improve the issue (DECC. 2008).
Mitigation may involve governments holding campaigns that show people disposing legally and reporting the consequences for disposing illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste-landfills.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A way Australian governments are addressing the problem is through the increase of fines in conjunction with better law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste-landfills.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia, fines can be up to $1,000,000 and can also incur imprisonment. The Protection of the Environment Operations Act imposes penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility.&lt;ref&gt;Increased penalties for illegal waste dumping in NSW - Colin Biggers &amp; Paisley.

The new section of the ''POEO Act'' (The Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997) now imposes further penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/waste/illegal_dumping.html|title=Illegal dumping|last=Protection|first=jurisdiction=Queensland; sector=government; corporateName=Department of Environment and Heritage|website=www.ehp.qld.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Parrino, Maysaa, Kaoutarani &amp; Salam, 2014). Communities are encouraged to report illegal dumping. In accordance with NSW Illegal Dumping Strategy 2014-16, hefty fines and a maximum jail sentence of 2 years can be handed down to repeat offenders.

In [[eukaryotes]], most genes found in the cell are expressed as autosomal genes (see [[autosome]]) and are found in two copies, alterations to this two-copy gene dosage is significantly associated with quantitative or qualitative phenotype traits and is linked to many genetic health problems such as those associated with spinal muscular atrophy and [[Down syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Thompson and Thompson Genetics in Medicine|last = Nussbaum|first = Robert, L.|publisher = Elsevier|year = 2016|isbn = 978-1-4377-0696-3|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 64–67|last2 = McInnes|first2 = Roderick, R.|last3 = Willard|first3 = Huntington, F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Down syndrome, the gene expression on chromosome 21 has increased 50%, and this results in significant health and mental disabilities (1 in 800 human live births have Down syndrome).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gene-dosage effects in Down syndrome and trisomic mouse models|journal = Genome Biology|date = 2004-01-01|issn = 1465-6906|pmc = 545589|pmid = 15461808|pages = 244|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1186/gb-2004-5-10-244|first = Katheleen|last = Gardiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokaryotes]] reproduce through [[asexual reproduction]], usually by [[binary fission]]. The bacterial chromosome is present only in one copy per cell, but there can still be variation in gene dosage due to [[DNA replication]] which starts at the [[origin of replication]] and ends at the termination site. The genes that are closer to the origin site would be replicated first and would consequently be present in two copies in the cell for a longer time than the genes that are closer to the termination site. These slight gene dosage differences are responsible for variation in gene expression depending on the position on the chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chromosome position effects on gene expression in ''Escherichia coli'' K-12|journal = Nucleic Acids Research|date = 2014|pages = 11383–11392|volume = 42|issue = 18|doi = 10.1093/nar/gku828|author = Bryant|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}} 
'''Gracility''' is slenderness, the condition of being '''gracile''', which means slender.

It derives from the Latin adjective ''gracilis'' ([[Masculine (grammar)|masculine]] or [[Feminine (grammar)|feminine]]), or ''gracile'' ([[Grammatical gender|neuter]])&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Mason D., Jenkins, Thornton; “Latin for Today, Book 2”; Pub: Ginn and Co., Ltd. (1934) &lt;/ref&gt; which in either form means slender, and when transferred for example to discourse, takes the sense of "without ornament", "simple", or various similar [[connotation]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-02-522580-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, D. G. |title=Cassell's Latin dictionary: Latin-English, English-Latin |publisher=Cassell |location=London |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-02-522580-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his famous "Glossary of Botanic Terms", B. D. Jackson speaks dismissively&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Benjamin Daydon; "A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent" 4th Ed. 1928; Pub: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, W.C.2&lt;/ref&gt; of an entry in earlier dictionary of A. A. Crozier&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, Arthur Alger; “A Dictionary of Botanical Terms”, Pub.: Henry Holt &amp; Co  1893. &lt;/ref&gt; as follows: ''Gracilis (Lat.), slender. Crozier has the needless word "gracile"''. However, his objection would be hard to sustain in current usage; apart from the fact that "gracile" is a natural and convenient term, it is hardly a [[neologism]]; the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;ref name=OED&gt;Little, William; Fowler H.W.; Coulson J.; Onions, C.T. (Ed.):  "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principals". Pub.: Oxford at the Clarendon Press (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; gives the source date for that usage as 1623. 

In the same entry for ''Gracile'', the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary remarks: ''Recently misused (through association with '''grace''') for Gracefully slender.'' This misuse is unfortunate at least, because the terms ''gracile'' and ''grace'' are completely unrelated: the etymological root of ''grace'' is the Latin word ''gratia'' from ''gratus'', meaning pleasing&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; and nothing to do with slenderness or thinness.    

== In biology ==
In biology, the term is in common use, whether as English or Latin:
* The term ''gracile''&amp;mdash;and its opposite, [[Robustness (morphology)|''robust'']]&amp;mdash;occur in discussion of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of various [[hominids]] for example.
* The ''[[gracile fasciculus]]'' is a particular bundle of axon fibres in the spinal cord 
* The [[gracile nucleus]] is a particular structure of [[neuron]]s in the [[medulla oblongata]] 
* "[[GRACILE syndrome]]", is associated with a [[BCS1L]] [[mutation]] 

In [[Biological classification|biological taxonomy]], '''''gracile''''' is the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] or [[Specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] for various species. Where the gender is appropriate, the form is '''''gracilis'''''. Examples include:
* ''[[Campylobacter]] gracilis, a species of bacterium implicated in foodborne disease
* ''[[Ctenochasma]] gracile'', a late [[Jurassic]] [[pterosaur]]
* ''[[Eriophorum gracile]]'', a species of [[sedge]], [[Cyperaceae]]
* ''[[Euglena gracilis]]'', a unicellular flagellate protist
* ''[[Hydrophis]] gracilis'', a species of sea snakes
* ''[[Melampodium]] gracile'', a flowering plant species
* ''[[Moeritherium]] gracile'', an [[Eocene]] [[mammal]] species 

The same root appears in the names of some genera and higher [[Taxon|taxa]]:
* ''[[Gracilaria]]''  is a genus of red algae in the order ''Gracilariales''
* ''[[Gracillaria]]'' is a genus of [[leaf miner]] moths in the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] ''[[Gracillarioidea]]''

==See also==
* [[Buckling]], for the slenderness ratio in engineering
* [[Grace (disambiguation)]]
* [[Gracilis (disambiguation)]], a Latin adjective in several species names{{spaced ndash}} as remarked above, the meanings are the same as for gracile, except for their grammatical gender

'''Hexazinone''' is an [[organic compound]] that is used as a broad spectrum [[herbicide]].  It is a colorless solid.  It exhibits some solubility in water but is highly soluble in most organic solvents except alkanes.  A member  of the [[triazine]] class herbicides, it is manufactured by [[DuPont]] and sold under the trade name '''Velpar'''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold P. Appleby, Franz Müller, Serge Carpy "Weed Control" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It functions by inhibiting photosynthesis and thus is a nonselective herbicide.  It is used to control grasses, broadleaf, and woody plants. Approximately 33% is used on alfalfa, 31% in forestry, 29% in industrial areas, 4% on rangeland and pastures, and &lt; 2% on sugarcane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/herb-growthreg/fatty-alcohol-monuron/hexazinone/herb-prof-hexazinone.html Hexazinone], Herbicide Profile, Pesticide Management Education Program, [[Cornell University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexazinone is a pervasive groundwater contaminant, due to its high water solubility

== History ==
Hexazinone is widely used as a herbicide. It is a non-selective herbicide from the triazine family. It's is used among a broad range of places. It is used to control weeds within all sort of applications. From sugarcane plantations, forestry field nurseries, pineapple plantations to high- and railway grasses and industrial plant sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Huili|last2=Xu|first2=Shuxia|last3=Tan|first3=Chengxia|last4=Wang|first4=Xuedong|date=2009-05-30|title=Anaerobic biodegradation of hexazinone in four sediments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389408012752|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=164|issue=2–3|pages=806–811|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexazinone was first registered in 1975 for the overall control of weeds and later for uses in crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/0266fact.pdf|title=Hexazinone: Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and reactivity ==
Triazines like hexazinone can bind to the D-1 quinone protein of the electron transport chain in photosystem II to inhibit the photosynthesis. These diverted electrons can thereby damage membranes and destroy cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agron-www.agron.iastate.edu/Courses/Agron317/Photosynthesis_Inhibitors.htm|title=Agronomy 317 - Iowa State University|website=agron-www.agron.iastate.edu|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
Hexazinone can be synthesized in two different reaction processes. One process starts with a reaction of [[methyl chloroformate]] with [[cyanamide]], forming hexazinone after a five-step pathway:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470787466|title=Ullmann's agrochemicals.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527316045|oclc=470787466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hexazinon1.svg|border|frameless|520x520px]]

A second synthesis starts with methyl[[thiourea]].:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Hexazinon2.svg|border|frameless|618x818px]]

== Degradation ==
The degradation of hexazinone has long been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helling|first=C. S.|last2=Kearney|first2=P. C.|last3=Alexander|first3=M.|year=1971|title=Behavior of pesticides in soil|url=|journal=Adv. Agron.|volume=23|pages=147–240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It degrades approximately 10% in five weeks, when exposed to artificial sunlight in distilled water. However, degradation in natural waters can be three to seven times greater. Surprisingly, the [[pH]] and the temperature of the water do not affect the [[photodegradation]] significantly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R. C.|year=1980b|title=Studies with 14C-labeled hexazinone in water and bluegill sunfish|url=|journal=J. Agric. Food Chem.|volume=28|pages=306–310|via=|doi=10.1021/jf60228a002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is mainly degraded by aerobic microorganisms in soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R. C.|year=1980a|title=Soil Studies with 14C-labeled hexazinone|url=|journal=J. Agric. Food Chem.|volume=28|pages=311–315|via=|doi=10.1021/jf60228a012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Hexazinone is a broad-spectrum residual and contact [[herbicide]], rapidly absorbed by the leaves and roots. It is tolerated by conifers, and therefore it is a very effective [[herbicide]] for the control for [[Annual plant|annual]] and [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[Broad-leaved tree|broadleaf]] weeds, some grasses, and some woody species. Hexazinone works as rain or snowmelt makes it possible for the [[herbicide]] to move downward into the soil. There the hexazinone is absorbed from the soil by the roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental fates and impacts of major forest use pesticides|last=Ghassemi|first=M., et al.|publisher=|year=1981|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=169–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moves through the conductive tissues to the leaves, where it blocks the [[photosynthesis]] of the plant within the [[chloroplast]]s. Hexazinone binds to a protein of the [[photosystem II]] complex, which blocks the electron transport. The result are multiple following reactions. First triplet-state [[chlorophyll]] reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[singlet oxygen]]. Both [[chlorophyll]] and [[singlet oxygen]] then remove [[hydrogen ion]]s from the unsaturated [[lipid]]s present in de cells and the organelle membranes, forming lipid radicals. These radicals will oxydize other lipids and proteins, eventually resulting in loss of the membrane integrity of the cells and organelles. This will result in a loss of [[chlorophyll]], leakage of cellular contents, cell death, and eventually death of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wssa.net/|title=Weed Science Society of America|website=wssa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody plants first show yellowing of the leaves before they start to defoliate, eventually they will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidhu|first=S. S.|last2=Feng.|first2=J. C.|year=1993|title=Hexazinone and its metabolites in boreal forest vegetation.|url=|journal=Weed Sci.|volume=41|pages=281–287|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes plants are able to refoliate and defoliate again during the growing season.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Hindu art''' encompasses the artistic traditions and styles culturally connected to [[Hinduism]] and have a long history of religious association with Hindu scriptures, rituals and worship.

==Background==
[[Hinduism]], with its [[Hinduism by country|1 billion followers]], it makes up about 15% of the world’s population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape - Hinduism|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-hindu.aspx|work=A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Major Religious Groups as of 2010|publisher=The pew foundation|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the culture that ensues it is full of different aspects of life that are effected by art.  There are 64 traditional arts that are followed that start with the classics of music and range all the way to the application and adornment of jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;”Heart of Hinduism: Sanskrit and Sanskriti (Culture).” 2004, 30 Mar 2009. &lt; http://hinduism.iskcon.com/lifestyle/801.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since religion and culture are inseparable with Hinduism recurring symbols such as the gods and their reincarnations, the [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] flower, extra limbs, and even the traditional arts make their appearances in many sculptures, paintings, music, and dance.

*Singing
*Instrumental music
**Learning music in [[Hindu culture]] was a difficult task before the 20th century because of a necessary birth into a [[gharana]]. After the early 1920s integration of anyone wanting to learn classical Hindustani music could. An average ensemble normally includes a harmonium (which was brought to India by westerners), flute, [[veena]], [[sitar]], swaramandala, and a tabla. Many of the songs have strong themes that are related to theology such as a god’s favorite pastimes, praise of any god whether they be in their original form from “the trinity” or the god's reincarnation, even stories of the creation of earth. Since instrumental music is a performance art it must follow strict guidelines that come from the treatise Natya Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Beck, Guy. “Hindu music, now and into the future.” Hinduism Today October/November/December 2007. 28-31. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1515&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dancing
*Painting
**Indian variety - the different types of folk paintings are proud for Indian culture which reflects beauty, tradition and heritage of India. There are many types of traditional paintings like [[Madhubani art|Madhubani]], Rajsthani, [[Batik|Batik-Art]], Patachitra, Gond, Mandala, [[Warli|Tribal Art Warli]], [[Pithora (painting)|Pithora]], Bengali, Nirmal, [[Mysore painting|Mysore]], [[Tanjore]] paintings etc. which are the expressions of love, almighty, beauty, truth, tradition and art of each and every region of the India.

At one point both men and women wore dhotis but around the 14th century that changed and women’s fashion became more intricate thus creating the sari. The drapery involved distinguishes the wearer’s taste, occupation, and social status. The fabrics chosen range from cotton and synthetic fabrics all the way to silk. The fabric chosen depends on what occasion the wearer is going to use the item of clothing for. The draping of the sari comes in four different families: [[Marvari]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], Tribal, and Nivi. The family that the wearer chooses depends on the wearer’s personal taste. The way an item of clothing is draped tells a lot about the wearer such as expression of creativity, progression of fashion, and where the user comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Boulanger, Chantal. “The Remarkable Indian Art of Draping.” Hinduism Today.

==Historic Texts on Art Practices==

*Natya Shastra
**The Natya Shastra is the leading guide to the Hindu performing arts. It is based on the Natya Veda, which no longer exists, and is roughly 37 chapters long with 6,000 [[slokas]].&lt;ref&gt;“Natya Shastra: Encyclopedia II.” 29 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Natya_Shastra_-_Text_and_title/id/1793036&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities Dedicated to the Production of Art==

*Raghupajpur
**This city is solely dedicated to the production of artwork that is driven by the divine forces of Hinduism and these artworks are produced in a traditional fashion. The city is located in Eastern India (Orissa) and at one point this city was at risk of being completely destroyed due to British rule{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. During this time religion and the power of the kings were being overthrown and as such there was no reason for a city to exist whose main purpose is to supply traditional art. After this crisis occurred the city began to exclusively base itself on agriculture until a man named Jacnnath Mopatra led a training center for chitrakars. This revolution began production of the traditional art works once again in the 1950s and since the work being produced is known internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mohanty, M.P. “Living, Painting, Worshipping Art.” Hinduism Today. July/August/September 2007. 54-59. &lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Symbols==

*Extra Limbs-Extra limbs are seen on many of the Hindu deities in paintings and sculptures. The extra limbs show how much power the god is capable of because of their ability to perform many tasks at once. Such as the goddess [[Sarasvati]] always has a minimum of four arms. Two of the arms will be playing a vina, representing the tuning of her knowledge, prayer beads in another hand and a scripture in another, both of these items are used to represent her devotion to her spirituality. Since she is the goddess of learning and art we see that she is very capable and very powerful in her area of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp. “Saravasti, the Goddess of Learning.” 20 Mar 2009. &lt; http://www.stephen-knapp.com/sarasvati_goddess_of_learning.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lotus Flower-The lotus flower is another common item seen constantly throughout the arts. The lotus flower represents purity, beauty, prosperity, fertility, and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Anil K. Goel, Lucknow. “God’s Favorite Flower.” Hinduism Today. 1999. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4411&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason the flower shows these attributes is due to the process in which the lotus flower goes through in order to blossom. The flower grows out of mud and rests atop the water in which it grows showing the hardship it must endure in order to achieve maximum beauty. Many deities have their name based on the Sanskrit word for lotus such as Lakshimi.&lt;ref&gt;“Lotus-Hindu Symbols” Religion Facts. 2007. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/lotus.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balancer with wine 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Balancing cart, a simple robotics system 1976. The cart contains a [[servo system]] which monitors the angle of the rod and moves the cart back and forth to keep it upright.]]

An '''inverted pendulum''' is a [[pendulum]] that has its [[center of mass]] above its [[Lever|pivot]] point.  It is [[unstable equilibrium|unstable]] and without additional help will fall over. It can be suspended stably in this inverted position by using a [[control system]] to monitor the angle of the pole and move the pivot point horizontally back under the center of mass when it starts to fall over, keeping it balanced.  The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[control theory]] and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.  It is often implemented with the pivot point mounted on a cart that can move horizontally under control of an electronic servo system as shown in the photo; this is called a '''cart and pole''' apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Hamilton Union College Senior Project 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] by affixing the pole to an [[axis of rotation]]. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a [[torque]] at the pivot point, by moving the pivot point horizontally as part of a [[feedback]] system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the pivot point vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the pivot point in a feedback system is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger.  

A second type of inverted pendulum is a [[tiltmeter]] for tall structures, which consists of a wire anchored to the bottom of the foundation and attached to a float in a pool of oil at the top of the structure that has devices for measuring movement of the neutral position of the float away from its original position.

== Overview ==
A pendulum with its bob hanging directly below the support [[Lever|pivot]] is at a [[Mechanical equilibrium|stable equilibrium]] point; there is no torque on the pendulum so it will remain motionless, and if displaced from this position will experience a restoring torque which returns it toward the equilibrium position.  A pendulum with its bob in an inverted position, supported on a rigid rod directly above the pivot, 180° from its stable equilibrium position, is at an [[unstable equilibrium]] point.  At this point again there is no torque on the pendulum, but the slightest displacement away from this position will cause a gravitation torque on the pendulum which will accelerate it away from equilibrium, and it will fall over.  
  
In order to stabilize a pendulum in this inverted position, a [[feedback controller|feedback control system]] can be used, which monitors the pendulum's angle and moves the position of the pivot point sideways when the pendulum starts to fall over, to keep it balanced.   The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[control theory]] and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms ([[PID controller]]s, [[state space representation]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy control]], [[genetic algorithm]]s, etc.). Variations on this problem include multiple links, allowing the motion of the cart to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum, and balancing the cart-pendulum system on a see-saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where the center of gravity is located behind the center of drag causing aerodynamic instability.&lt;ref&gt;http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstab.html&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of a similar problem can be shown by simple robotics in the form of a balancing cart. Balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger is a simple demonstration, and the problem is solved by self-balancing [[personal transporter]]s such as the [[Segway PT]], the [[self-balancing scooter|self-balancing hoverboard]] and the [[self-balancing unicycle]].

Another way that an inverted pendulum may be stabilized, without any feedback or control mechanism, is by oscillating the pivot rapidly up and down.  This is called [[Kapitza's pendulum]].  If the [[oscillation]] is sufficiently strong (in terms of its acceleration and amplitude) then the inverted pendulum  can recover from perturbations in a strikingly counterintuitive manner. If the driving point moves in [[simple harmonic motion]],  the pendulum's motion is described by the [[Mathieu equation]].

==Equations of motion==

The [[equations of motion]] of inverted pendulums are dependent on what constraints are placed on the motion of the pendulum.  Inverted pendulums can be created in various configurations resulting in a number of Equations of Motion describing the behavior of the pendulum.

===Stationary pivot point===
In a configuration where the pivot point of the pendulum is fixed in space, the equation of motion is similar to that for an [[Pendulum (mathematics)|uninverted pendulum]].  The equation of motion below assumes no friction or any other resistance to movement, a rigid massless rod, and the restriction to [[2-dimensional]] movement.

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta - {g \over \ell} \sin \theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular acceleration]] of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravity]] on the surface of the Earth, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular displacement measured from the equilibrium position.

When added to both sides, it will have the same sign as the angular acceleration term:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta = {g \over \ell} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the inverted pendulum will accelerate away from the vertical unstable equilibrium in the direction initially displaced, and the acceleration is inversely proportional to the length. Tall pendulums fall more slowly than short ones.

'''Derivation using torque and moment of inertia:'''
[[Image:cart-pendulum.svg|thumb|300px| A schematic drawing of the inverted pendulum on a cart. The rod is considered massless. The mass of the cart and the point mass at the end of the rod are denoted by M and m. The rod has a length l.]]

The pendulum is assumed to consist of a point mass, of mass &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt;, affixed to the end of a massless rigid rod, of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, attached to a pivot point at the end opposite the point mass.

The net [[torque]] of the system must equal the [[moment of inertia]] times the angular acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}}=I \ddot \theta&lt;/math&gt;
The torque due to gravity providing the net torque:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}}= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt; \theta\ &lt;/math&gt; is the angle measured from the inverted equilibrium position.

The resulting equation:
:&lt;math&gt; I \ddot \theta= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The moment of inertia for a point mass:
:&lt;math&gt;I = m R^2&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of the inverted pendulum the radius is the length of the rod, &lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting in &lt;math&gt;I = m \ell ^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m \ell ^2 \ddot \theta= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Mass and &lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt; is divided from each side resulting in:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta = {g \over \ell} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverted pendulum on a cart===
An inverted pendulum on a cart consists of a mass &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; at the top of a pole of length &lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt; pivoted on a horizontally moving base as shown in the adjacent image.  The cart is restricted to [[linear motion]] and is subject to forces resulting in or hindering motion.

===Essentials of stabilization===
The essentials of stabilizing the inverted pendulum can be summarized qualitatively in three steps.
[[Image:Inverted Pendulum control essentials.JPG|thumb|600px| The simple stabilizing control system used on the cart with wine glass above.]]

1.	If the tilt angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is to the right, the cart must accelerate to the right and vice versa.

2.	The position of the cart &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; relative to track center is stabilized by slightly modulating the null angle (the angle error that the control system tries to null) by the position of the cart, that is, null angle &lt;math&gt; = \theta + k x &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is small.  This makes the pole want to lean slightly toward track center and stabilize at track center where the tilt angle is exactly vertical.  Any offset in the tilt sensor or track slope that would otherwise cause instability translates into a stable position offset.  A further added offset gives position control.

3.	A normal pendulum subject to a moving pivot point such as a load lifted by a crane, has a peaked response at the pendulum radian frequency of &lt;math&gt; \omega_p = \sqrt {g/\ell} &lt;/math&gt;.  To prevent uncontrolled swinging, the frequency spectrum of the pivot motion should be suppressed near &lt;math&gt; \omega_p &lt;/math&gt;.  The inverted pendulum requires the same suppression filter to achieve stability.

Note that, as a consequence of the null angle modulation strategy, the position feedback is positive, that is, a sudden command to move right will produce an initial cart motion to the left followed by a move right to rebalance the pendulum.  The interaction of the pendulum instability and the positive position feedback instability to produce a stable system is a feature that makes the mathematical analysis an interesting and challenging problem.

=== Lagrange's Equations ===
The equations of motion can be derived using  [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]].  We refer to the drawing to the right where &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the vertical direction and the acting forces are gravity and an external force ''F'' in the x-direction. Define &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be the position of the cart. The [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L = T - V&lt;/math&gt; of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \frac{1}{2} M v_1^2  + \frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 - m g \ell\cos\theta 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the cart and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of x and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; by writing the velocity as the first derivative of the position;
:&lt;math&gt;
v_1^2=\dot x^2
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
v_2^2=\left({\frac{d}{dt}}{\left(x- \ell\sin\theta\right)}\right)^2 + \left({\frac{d}{dt}}{\left( \ell\cos\theta \right)}\right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Simplifying the expression for &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;
v_2^2= \dot x^2 -2 \ell \dot x \dot \theta\cos \theta + \ell^2\dot \theta^2

&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian is now given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
L = \frac{1}{2} \left(M+m \right ) \dot x^2 -m \ell \dot x \dot\theta\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 \dot \theta^2-m g \ell\cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;
and the equations of motion are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot x}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial x} = F
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot \theta}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial \theta} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
substituting &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in these equations and simplifying leads to the equations that describe the motion of the inverted pendulum:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left ( M + m \right ) \ddot x - m \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta + m \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta = F
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - g \sin \theta = \ddot x \cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;
These equations are nonlinear, but since the goal of a control system would be to keep the pendulum upright the equations can be linearized around &lt;math&gt;\theta \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Newton's Second Law===

Oftentimes it is beneficial to use [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law]] instead of [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]] because Newton's equations give the reaction forces at the joint between the pendulum and the cart. These equations give rise to two equations for each body one in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction. The equations of motion of the cart are shown below where the LHS is the sum of the forces on the body and the RHS is the acceleration.

:&lt;math&gt;
F-R_x = M \ddot x
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
F_N - R_y - M g = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

In the equations above &lt;math&gt;R_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_y&lt;/math&gt; are reaction forces at the joint. &lt;math&gt;F_N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force applied to the cart. This second equation only depends on the vertical reaction force thus the equation can be used to solve for the normal force. The first equation can be used to solve for the horizontal reaction force. In order to complete the equations of motion, the acceleration of the point mass attached to the pendulum must be computed. The position of the point mass can be given in inertial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec r_P = (x-\ell \sin \theta) \hat x_I + \ell \cos \theta \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking two derivatives yields the acceleration vector in the inertial reference frame.

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec a_{P/I} = (\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta ) \hat x_I + (-\ell \dot \theta^2 \cos \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \sin \theta) \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, using Newton's second law, two equations can be written in the x-direction and the y-direction. Note that the reaction forces are positive as applied to the pendulum and negative when applied to the cart. This is due to Newton's Third Law.

:&lt;math&gt;
R_x = m(\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta )
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
R_y - m g = m (-\ell \dot \theta^2 \cos \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \sin \theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

The first equation allows yet another way to compute the horizontal reaction force in the event the applied force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is not known. The second equation can be used to solve for the vertical reaction force. The first equation of motion is derived by substituting &lt;math&gt;F-R_x = M \ddot x&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;R_x = m(\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta )&lt;/math&gt; which yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\left (M+m \right) \ddot x  - m \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta  + m \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  = F
&lt;/math&gt;

By inspection this equation is identical to the result from Lagrange's Method. In order to obtain the second equation the pendulum equation of motion must be dotted with a unit vector which runs perpendicular to the pendulum at all times and is typically noted as the x-coordinate of the body frame. In inertial coordinates this vector can be written using a simple 2-D coordinate transformation

:&lt;math&gt; 
\hat x_B = \cos \theta \hat x_I + \sin \theta \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

The pendulum equation of motion written in vector form is &lt;math&gt;\sum \vec F = m \vec a_{P/I}&lt;/math&gt;. Dotting &lt;math&gt;\hat x_B&lt;/math&gt; with both sides yields the following on the LHS (note that a transpose is the same as a dot product)

:&lt;math&gt;
(\hat x_B)^T\sum \vec F = (\hat x_B)^T (R_x \hat x_I + R_y \hat y_I - m g \hat y_I) = (\hat x_B)^T(R_p \hat y_B - m g \hat y_I) = -m g \sin \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation the relationship between body frame components of the reaction forces and inertial frame components of reaction forces is used. The assumption that the bar connecting the point mass to the cart is massless implies that this bar cannot transfer any load perpendicular to the bar. Thus, the inertial frame components of the reaction forces can be written simply as &lt;math&gt;R_p \hat y_B&lt;/math&gt; which signifies that the bar can only transfer loads along the axis of the bar itself. This gives rise to another equation which can be used to solve for the tension in the rod itself

:&lt;math&gt;
R_p = \sqrt{ R_x^2 + R_y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The RHS of the equation is computed similarly by dotting &lt;math&gt;\hat x_B&lt;/math&gt; with the acceleration of the pendulum. The result (after some simplification) is shown below.

:&lt;math&gt;
m(\hat x_B)^T(\vec a_{P/I}) = m(\ddot x \cos \theta - \ell \ddot \theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the LHS with the RHS and dividing through by m yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - g \sin \theta = \ddot x \cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

which again is identical to the result of Lagrange's method. The benefit of using Newton's method is that all reaction forces are revealed to ensure that nothing will be damaged.

==Kapitza's pendulum==
{{main|Kapitza's pendulum}}

An inverted pendulum in which the pivot is oscillated rapidly up and down can be stable in the inverted position.  This is called [[Kapitza's pendulum]], after Russian physicist [[Pyotr Kapitza]] who first analysed it.  The equation of motion for a pendulum connected to a massless, oscillating base is derived the same way as with the pendulum on the cart. The position of the point mass is now given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\left( -\ell \sin \theta , y + \ell \cos \theta    \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the velocity is found by taking the first derivative of the position:
:&lt;math&gt;v^2=\dot y^2-2 \ell \dot y \dot \theta \sin \theta  + \ell^2\dot \theta ^2.&lt;/math&gt;[[Image:Inverted pendulum oscillatory base.svg|thumb|right|500px|Plots for the inverted pendulum on an oscillatory base. The first plot shows the response of the pendulum on a slow oscillation, the second the response on a fast oscillation]]

The [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
 L = \frac{1 }{2} m \left ( \dot y^2-2 \ell \dot y \dot \theta \sin \theta  + \ell^2\dot \theta ^2   \right) - m g \left( y + \ell \cos \theta  \right )
&lt;/math&gt;
and the equation of motion follows from:
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathrm{d} \over \mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot \theta}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial \theta} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
resulting in:
:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - \ddot y \sin \theta = g \sin \theta.
&lt;/math&gt;
If ''y'' represents a [[simple harmonic motion]], &lt;math&gt;y = A \sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;, the following [[differential equation]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\ddot \theta - {g \over \ell} \sin \theta = -{A \over \ell} \omega^2 \sin \omega t \sin \theta.
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation does not have elementary closed-form solutions, but can be explored in a variety of ways.  It is closely approximated by the [[Mathieu equation]], for instance, when the amplitude of oscillations are small. Analyses show that the pendulum stays upright for fast oscillations. The first plot shows that when &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a slow oscillation, the pendulum quickly falls over when disturbed from the upright position. The angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; exceeds 90° after a short time, which means the pendulum has fallen on the ground. If  &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a fast oscillation the pendulum can be kept stable around the vertical position.  The second plot shows that when disturbed from the vertical position, the pendulum now starts an oscillation around the vertical position (&lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;). The deviation from the vertical position stays small, and the pendulum doesn't fall over.
{{breakafterimages}}

==Types of inverted pendulums==
Achieving stability of an inverted pendulum has become a common engineering challenge for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://robotics.ee.uwa.edu.au/theses/2003-Balance-Ooi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are different variations of the inverted pendulum on a cart ranging from a rod on a cart to a multiple segmented inverted pendulum on a cart. Another variation places the inverted pendulum's rod or segmented rod on the end of a rotating assembly. In both, (the cart and rotating system) the inverted pendulum can only fall in a plane. The inverted pendulums in these projects can either be required to only maintain balance after an equilibrium position is achieved or be able to achieve equilibrium by itself. Another platform is a two-wheeled balancing inverted pendulum. The two wheeled platform has the ability to spin on the spot offering a great deal of maneuverability.&lt;ref&gt;http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another variation balances on a single point.  A [[spinning top]], a [[unicycle]], or an inverted pendulum atop a spherical ball all balance on a single point. As derived above the inverted pendulum can also be achieved by having a vertically oscillating base.

==Examples of inverted pendulums==
Arguably the most prevalent example of a stabilized inverted pendulum is a [[human being]].  A person standing upright acts as an inverted pendulum with his feet as the pivot, and without constant small muscular adjustments would fall over.  The human nervous system contains an unconscious [[feedback]] [[control system]], the [[sense of balance]] or [[righting reflex]], that uses [[proprioceptive]] input from the eyes, muscles and joints, and orientation input from the [[vestibular system]] consisting of the three [[semicircular canals]] in the [[inner ear]], and two [[otolith]] organs, to make continual small adjustments to the skeletal muscles to keep us standing upright.  Walking, running, or balancing on one leg puts additional demands on this system.  Certain diseases and alcohol or drug intoxication can interfere with this reflex, causing [[dizziness]] and [[disequilibrium (medicine)|disequilibration]], an inability to stand upright.  A [[field sobriety test]] used by police to test drivers for the influence of alcohol or drugs, tests this reflex for impairment.     

Some simple examples include balancing brooms or meter sticks by hand. 
 
The inverted pendulum has been employed in various devices and trying to balance an inverted pendulum presents a unique engineering problem for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The inverted pendulum was a central component in the design of several early [[seismometer]]s due to its inherent instability resulting in a measurable response to any disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/seismology/history/part12.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverted pendulum model has been used in some recent [[personal transporter]]s, such as the two-wheeled [[self-balancing scooter]]s and single-wheeled [[electric unicycle]]s. These devices are kinematically unstable and use an electronic feedback [[servo system]] to keep them upright.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5255">'''Land restoration''' is the process of [[ecological restoration]] of a site to a [[natural landscape]] and [[habitat]], safe for humans, wildlife, and [[plant community|plant communities]].  Ecological destruction is usually the consequence of [[pollution]], [[deforestation]], [[salination]] or natural disasters. Land restoration is not the same as [[land reclamation]], where existing [[ecosystems]] are altered or destroyed to give way for cultivation or construction. Land restoration can enhance the supply of valuable [[ecosystem services]] that benefit people.

==Repairing damaged land==
Land restoration can include the process of cleaning up and rehabilitating a site that has sustained [[environmental degradation]], such as those by natural cause ([[desertification]]) and those caused by human activity ([[strip mining]]), to restore that area back to its natural state as a [[wildlife]] home and balanced [[habitat]].

==Countering desertification==
[[File:GreeningdesertTharIndia.jpg|thumb|Jojoba ([[Simmondsia chinensis]]) plantations, such as those shown, have played a role in combating edge effects of desertification in the [[Thar desert]], India.]]
{{further|Desertification#Countermeasures_and_prevention{{!}}Countering desertification}}
Land reclamation in deserts involves
*setting up reliable water provisioning (e.g. by digging [[Water well|well]]s or placing long-distance water pipes)
*stabilizing and fixating the soil
Stabilizing and fixating the soil is usually done in several phases. 

The first phase is fixating the soil to such extent that dune movement is ceased. This is done by grasses, and plants providing wind protection such as [[shelterbelt]]s, [[windbreak]]s and [[woodlot]]s. Shelterbelts are wind protections composed of rows of trees, arranged perpendicular to the prevailing wind, while woodlots are more extensive areas of woodland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timtyler.org/desert_reclamation/ Desert reclamation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase involves improving/enriching the soil by planting nitrogen-fixating plants and using the soil immediately to grow crops. [[Nitrogen fixating]] plants used include [[clover]], yellow mustard, beans, etc., and food crops include [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[peas]], [[sweet potatoes]], [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]], [[olive]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], [[ficus|fig]]s, [[apricot]], [[guava]], [[tomato]], certain [[herb]]s, etc. Regardless of the cover crop used, the crops (not including any trees) are each year harvested and/or plowed into the soil (e.g. with clover). In addition, each year the plots are used for  another type of crop (known as [[crop rotation]]) to prevent depleting the soil on specific trace elements.

A recent development is the [[Seawater Greenhouse]] and Seawater Forest. This proposal is to construct these devices on coastal deserts in order to create freshwater and grow food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/54/ The Sahara Project a new source of freshwater food and energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar approach is the Desert Rose concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/desert-rose-project-trees-water-and-food-and-fuel-maybe-from-the-desert.html Desert Rose - Claverton Group Energy Conference, Bath October] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

These approaches are of widespread applicability, since the relative costs of pumping large quantities of seawater inland are low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.claverton-energy.com/pipe-headloss-power-calculator-calculate-how-much-energy-to-pump-seawater-to-the-middle-of-the-sahara-or-gobi-desert-for-desalination-in-the-seawater-greenhouse-answer-not-a-lot.html|title= what power is needed to pump seawater to the middle of the Gobi Desert for desalination in the SeaWater Greenhouse? }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another related concept is ADRECS – a proposed system for rapidly delivering soil stabilisation and re-forestation techniques coupled with renewable energy generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/320/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''leaf''' is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] of a [[vascular plant]] and is the principal lateral appendage of the [[plant stem|stem]].{{sfn|Esau|2006}} The leaves and stem together form the [[shoot]].{{sfn|Cutter|1969}} Leaves are collectively referred to as '''foliage,''' as in "autumn foliage".{{sfn|Haupt|1953}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2009}}

A leaf is a thin, [[dorsiventral|dorsiventrally flattened]] [[organ (biology)|organ]], usually borne above ground and specialized for [[photosynthesis]]. In most leaves, the primary [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] tissue, the [[palisade mesophyll]], is located on the upper side of the blade or lamina of the leaf{{sfn|Esau|2006}} but in some species, including the mature foliage of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'',{{sfn|James et al|1999}} palisade mesophyll is present on both sides and the leaves are said to be isobilateral. Most leaves have distinct upper surface (''{{vanchor|adaxial}}'') and lower surface (''{{vanchor|abaxial}}'') that differ in colour, hairiness, the number of [[stomata]] (pores that intake and output gases), the amount and structure of [[epicuticular wax]] and other features.

Leaves can have many different shapes, sizes and textures. The broad, flat leaves with complex [[Venation (botany)|venation]] of [[flowering plants]] are known as ''megaphylls'' and the species that bear them, the majority, as broad-leaved or megaphyllous plants. In the [[clubmosses]], with different evolutionary origins, the leaves are simple (with only a single vein) and are known as microphylls.{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}} Some leaves, such as [[bulb]] scales, are not above ground. In many aquatic species the leaves are submerged in water. Succulent plants often have thick juicy leaves, but some leaves are without major photosynthetic function and may be dead at maturity, as in some [[cataphyll]]s and [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]]. Furthermore, several kinds of leaf-like structures found in vascular plants are not totally homologous with them. Examples include flattened plant stems called [[phylloclade]]s and [[wikt:cladode|cladodes]], and flattened leaf stems called [[Petiole (botany)|phyllodes]] which differ from leaves both in their structure and origin.{{sfn|Mauseth|2009}}{{sfn|Cooney-Sovetts|Sattler|1987}} Many structures of non-vascular plants, such as the [[Glossary of botanical terms#phyllid|phyllids]] of [[mosses]] and [[liverworts]] and even of some [[foliose lichen]]s, which are not [[plant]]s at all (in the sense of being members of the kingdom [[Plant]]ae), look and function much like leaves.

==General characteristics==
[[File:3D rendering of a micro CT scan of a piece of dried leaf..ogv|thumb|3D rendering of a [[computed tomography]] scan of a leaf ]]
Leaves are the most important organs of most vascular plants.{{sfn|Tsukaya|2013}} Green plants are [[autotrophic]], meaning that they do not obtain food from other living things but instead create their own by [[photosynthesis]]. They capture the energy in sun[[light]] and use it to make simple [[sugars]], such as [[glucose]] and [[sucrose]], from [[carbon dioxide]] and water. The sugars are then stored as [[starch]], further processed by [[chemical synthesis]] into more complex organic molecules such as [[Protein|proteins]] or [[cellulose]], the basic structural material in plant cell walls, or [[Metabolism|metabolised]] by [[cellular respiration]] to provide chemical energy to run cellular processes. The leaves draw water from the ground in the [[transpiration stream]] through a [[Vascular tissue|vascular conducting system]] known as [[xylem]] and obtain carbon dioxide from the [[atmosphere]] by diffusion through openings called [[stomata]] in the outer covering layer of the leaf ([[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]), while leaves are orientated to maximise their exposure to sunlight. Once sugar has been synthesized, it needs to be transported to areas of active growth such as the [[plant shoots]] and [[Root|roots]]. Vascular plants transport sucrose in a special tissue called the [[phloem]]. The phloem and xylem are parallel to each other but the transport of materials is usually in opposite directions. Within the leaf these vascular systems branch (ramify) to form veins which supply as much of the leaf as possible, ensuring that [[cells]] carrying out photosynthesis are close to the transportation system.{{sfn|Feugier|2006}}

Typically leaves are broad, flat and thin (dorsiventrally flattened), thereby maximising the surface area directly exposed to light and enabling the light to penetrate the [[Plant cell#Types of plant cells and tissues|tissues]] and reach the [[chloroplast]]s, thus promoting photosynthesis. They are arranged on the plant so as to expose their surfaces to light as efficiently as possible without shading each other, but there are many exceptions and complications. For instance plants adapted to windy conditions may have [[pendent]] leaves, such as in many [[willow]]s and [[eucalypts]]s. The flat, or laminar, shape also maximises [[thermal conduction|thermal]] contact with the surrounding [[air]], promoting cooling. Functionally, in addition to carrying out photosynthesis, the leaf is the principal site of [[transpiration]], providing the energy required to draw the transpiration stream up from the roots, and [[guttation]].

Many gymnosperms have thin needle-like or scale-like leaves that can be advantageous in cold climates with frequent snow and frost.{{sfn|Purcell|2016}} These are interpreted as reduced from megaphyllous leaves of their [[Devonian]] ancestors.{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}} Some leaf forms are adapted to modulate the amount of light they absorb to avoid or mitigate excessive heat, [[ultraviolet]] damage, or desiccation, or to sacrifice light-absorption efficiency in favour of protection from herbivory. For [[xerophyte]]s the major constraint is not light [[Radiant flux|flux]] or [[irradiance|intensity]], but drought.{{sfn|Willert et al|1992}} Some [[leaf window|window plants]] such as ''[[Fenestraria]]'' species and some ''[[Haworthia]]'' species such as ''Haworthia tesselata'' and ''[[Haworthia truncata]]'' are examples of xerophytes.{{sfn|Bayer|1982}} and ''[[Bulbine]] mesembryanthemoides''.{{sfn|Marloth|1913–1932}}

Leaves also function to store chemical [[energy]] and water (especially in [[succulents]]) and may become specialised organs serving other functions, such as tendrils of [[pea]]s and other legumes, the protective spines of cacti and the insect traps in carnivorous plants such as ''[[Nepenthes]]'' and ''Sarracenia''.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;356}} Leaves are the fundamental structural units from which cones are constructed in gymnosperms (each cone scale is a modified megaphyll leaf known as a sporophyll){{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}}{{rp|408}}  and from which flowers are constructed in [[flowering plant]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}}{{rp|445}}
[[File:Vein skeleton of a leaf (de-ghosted).jpg|thumb|Vein skeleton of a leaf. Veins contain lignin that make them harder to degrade for microorganisms.]]

The internal organisation of most kinds of leaves has evolved to maximise exposure of the photosynthetic [[organelles]], the [[chloroplast]]s, to [[light]] and to increase the absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] while at the same time controlling water loss. Their surfaces are waterproofed by the [[plant cuticle]] and gas exchange between the mesophyll cells and the atmosphere is controlled by minute (length and width measured in tens of µm) openings called [[stomata]] which open or close to regulate the rate exchange of carbon dioxide, [[oxygen]], and [[water vapour]] into and out of the internal intercellular space system. Stomatal opening is controlled by the [[turgor pressure]] in a pair of [[guard cell]]s that surround the stomatal aperture. In any square centimeter of a plant leaf there may be from 1,000 to 100,000 stomata.{{sfn|Krogh|2010}}

[[File:Eucalyptus foliage isobilateral dorsiventral IMG 0588e.JPG|thumb|Near the ground these ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' saplings have juvenile dorsiventral foliage from the previous year, but this season their newly sprouting foliage is isobilateral, like the mature foliage on the adult trees above]]
The shape and structure of leaves vary considerably from species to species of plant, depending largely on their adaptation to climate and available light, but also to other factors such as grazing animals (such as deer), available nutrients, and ecological competition from other plants. Considerable changes in leaf type occur within species too, for example as a plant matures; as a case in point ''Eucalyptus'' species commonly have [[Bilateral symmetry|isobilateral]], pendent leaves when mature and dominating their neighbours; however, such trees tend to have erect or horizontal [[dorsiventral]] leaves as seedlings, when their growth is limited by the available light.{{sfn|James |Bell|2000}} Other factors include the need to balance water loss at high temperature and low humidity against the need to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide. In most plants leaves also are the primary organs responsible for [[transpiration]] and [[guttation]] (beads of fluid forming at leaf margins).

Leaves can also store [[food]] and [[water]], and are modified accordingly to meet these functions, for example in the leaves of succulent plants and in [[bulb]] scales. The concentration of photosynthetic structures in leaves requires that they be richer in [[protein]], [[minerals]], and [[sugars]] than, say, woody stem tissues. Accordingly, leaves are prominent in the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of many [[animal]]s.

[[File:Eenbruinigherfstblad.jpg|thumb|A leaf shed in [[autumn]].]]
Correspondingly, leaves represent heavy investment on the part of the plants bearing them, and their retention or disposition are the subject of elaborate strategies for dealing with pest pressures, seasonal conditions, and protective measures such as the growth of thorns and the production of [[phytolith]]s, [[lignin]]s, [[tannin]]s and [[poison]]s.

[[Deciduous#Botany|Deciduous]] plants in frigid or cold temperate regions typically shed their leaves in autumn, whereas in areas with a severe dry season, some plants may shed their leaves until the dry season ends. In either case the shed leaves may be expected to contribute their retained nutrients to the soil where they fall.

In contrast, many other non-seasonal plants, such as palms and conifers, retain their leaves for long periods; ''[[Welwitschia]]'' retains its two main leaves throughout a lifetime that may exceed a thousand years.

The leaf-like organs of [[Bryophyte]]s (e.g., [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]), known as [[Glossary of botanical terms#phyllid|phyllids]], differ morphologically from the leaves of vascular plants in that they lack vascular tissue, are usually only a single cell thick and have no [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] stomata or internal system of intercellular spaces.

Simple, vascularised leaves ([[microphylls]])  first evolved as enations, extensions of the stem, in clubmosses such as ''[[Baragwanathia]]'' during the [[Silurian period]]. True leaves or euphylls of larger size and with more complex venation did not become widespread in other groups until the [[Devonian period]], by which time the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere had dropped significantly. This occurred independently in several separate lineages of vascular plants, in [[progymnosperm]]s like ''[[Archaeopteris]]'', in [[Sphenopsida]], [[fern]]s and later in the  [[gymnosperms]] and [[angiosperm]]s.  Euphylls are also referred to as [[Microphyll|macrophylls]] or megaphylls (large leaves).{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}}

== {{vanchor|Morphology (large-scale features)}} ==
{{see also|Glossary of leaf morphology}}
A structurally complete leaf of an [[angiosperm]] consists of a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (leaf stalk), a lamina (leaf blade), and [[stipule]]s (small structures located to either side of the base of the petiole). Not every species produces leaves with all of these structural components. Stipules may be conspicuous (e.g. [[beans]] and [[roses]]), soon falling or otherwise not obvious as in [[Moraceae]] or absent altogether as in the [[Magnoliaceae]]. A petiole may be absent, or the blade may not be laminar (flattened). The tremendous variety shown in leaf structure (anatomy) from species to species is presented in detail below under [[#Morphology|morphology]]. The petiole mechanically links the leaf to the plant and provides the route for transfer of water and sugars to and from the leaf. The lamina is typically the location of the majority of photosynthesis. The upper ([[Glossary of botanical terms#A|adaxial]]) angle between a leaf and a stem is known as the axil of the leaf. It is often the location of a [[bud]]. Structures located there are called "axillary".

[[File:Citrus leaf(crop).jpg|thumb|150px|Translucent glands in ''[[Citrus]]'' leaves{{sfn|Heywood et al|2007}}]]
External leaf characteristics, such as shape, margin, hairs, the petiole, and the presence of stipules and glands, are frequently important for identifying plants to family, genus or [[species]] levels, and botanists have developed a rich [[terminology]] for describing leaf characteristics. Leaves almost always have determinate growth. They grow to a specific pattern and shape and then stop. Other plant parts like stems or roots have non-determinate growth, and will usually continue to grow as long as they have the resources to do so.

The type of leaf is usually characteristic of a species (monomorphic), although some species produce more than one type of leaf (dimorphic or [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]]). The longest leaves are those of the [[Raffia palm]], ''R. regalis'' which may be up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide.{{sfn|Hallé|1977}} The terminology associated with the description of leaf morphology is presented, in illustrated form, at [http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Botany/Leaves_(forms) Wikibooks].

===Basic leaf types===
{{anchor|Basic leaf types}}
[[File:Fichtennadel (crop).jpg|thumb|150px|Leaves of the White Spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]'') are needle-shaped and their arrangement is spiral]]
* [[Fern]]s have [[fronds]]
* [[Conifer]] leaves are typically needle- or awl-shaped or scale-like
* [[Angiosperm]] (flowering plant) leaves: the standard form includes [[stipules]], a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]], and a [[glossary of botanical terms#lamina|lamina]]
* [[Lycopodiophyta|Lycophytes]] have [[microphyll]] leaves.
* [[Monocotyledon|Sheath]] leaves (type found in most [[Poaceae|grasses]] and many other monocots)
* Other specialized leaves (such as those of ''[[Nepenthes]]'', a pitcher plant)

===Arrangement on the stem===
{{main article|Phyllotaxis}}
Different terms are usually used to describe the arrangement of leaves on the stem ([[phyllotaxis]]):
[[File:Leaves opposite.jpg|thumb|150px|The leaves on this plant are arranged in pairs [[opposite leaves|opposite]] one another, with successive pairs at right angles to each other (''decussate'') along the red stem. Note the developing buds in the axils of these leaves.]]
;Alternate: One leaf, branch, or flower part attaches at each point or node on the stem, and leaves alternate direction, to a greater or lesser degree, along the stem.
;Basal: Arising from the base of the stem.
;Cauline: Arising from the aerial stem.
;Opposite: Two leaves, branches, or flower parts attach at each point or node on the stem. Leaf attachments are paired at each node and [[decussate]] if, as typical, each successive pair is rotated 90° progressing along the stem.
;Whorled, or verticillate: Three or more leaves, branches, or flower parts attach at each point or node on the stem. As with opposite leaves, successive whorls may or may not be decussate, rotated by half the angle between the leaves in the whorl (i.e., successive whorls of three rotated 60°, whorls of four rotated 45°, etc.). Opposite leaves may appear whorled near the tip of the stem. '''Pseudoverticillate''' describes an arrangement only appearing whorled, but not actually so.
;Rosulate: Leaves form a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]].
;Rows: The term, ''distichous'', literally means ''two rows''. Leaves in this arrangement may be alternate or opposite in their attachment. The term, ''2-ranked'', is equivalent. The terms, ''tristichous'' and ''tetrastichous'', are sometimes encountered. For example, the "leaves" (actually [[microphyll]]s) of most species of ''[[Selaginella]]'' are tetrastichous, but not decussate.

As a ''stem'' grows, leaves tend to appear arranged around the stem in a way that optimizes yield of light. In essence, leaves form a [[helix]] pattern centered around the stem, either [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise or counterclockwise]], with (depending upon the species) the same angle of divergence. There is a regularity in these angles and they follow the numbers in a [[Fibonacci sequence]]: 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, 13/21, 21/34, 34/55, 55/89. This series tends to the [[golden angle]], which is approximately 360° × 34/89 ≈ 137.52° ≈ 137°&amp;nbsp;30′. In the series, the [[numerator]] indicates the number of complete turns or "gyres" until a leaf arrives at the initial position and the denominator indicates the number of leaves in the arrangement. This can be demonstrated by the following:
* Alternate leaves have an angle of 180° (or 1/2)
* 120° (or 1/3): 3 leaves in 1 circle
* 144° (or 2/5): 5 leaves in 2 gyres
* 135° (or 3/8): 8 leaves in 3 gyres.

===Divisions of the blade===
{{anchor|Divisions of the lamina (blade)}}
[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|thumb|150px|A leaf with laminar structure and [[pinnate]] venation]]
Two basic forms of leaves can be described considering the way the blade (lamina) is divided. A '''simple leaf''' has an undivided blade. However, the leaf may be ''dissected'' to form lobes, but the gaps between lobes do not reach to the main vein. A '''compound leaf''' has a fully subdivided blade, each [[leaflet (botany)|leaflet]] of the blade being separated along a main or secondary vein. The leaflets may have petiolules and stipels, the equivalents of the petioles and stipules of leaves. Because each leaflet can appear to be a simple leaf, it is important to recognize where the petiole occurs to identify a compound leaf. Compound leaves are a characteristic of some families of higher plants, such as the [[Fabaceae]]. The middle vein of a compound leaf or a [[frond]], when it is present, is called a [[rachis]].
;Palmately compound: Leaves have the leaflets radiating from the end of the petiole, like fingers of the palm of a hand; e.g., ''[[Cannabis]]'' (hemp) and ''[[Aesculus]]'' (buckeyes).
;Pinnately compound: Leaves have the leaflets arranged along the main or mid-vein.{{glossary}}
{{term|Odd pinnate}}{{defn|With a terminal leaflet; e.g., ''[[ash tree|Fraxinus]]'' (ash).}}
{{term|Even pinnate}}{{defn|Lacking a terminal leaflet; e.g., ''[[Swietenia]]'' (mahogany). A specific type of even pinnate is bipinnate, where leaves only consist of two leaflets; e.g. ''[[Hymenaea]]''.}}{{glossary end}}
;Bipinnately compound: Leaves are twice divided: the leaflets are arranged along a secondary vein that is one of several branching off the rachis. Each leaflet is called a ''pinnule''. The group of pinnules on each secondary vein forms a ''pinna''; e.g., ''[[Albizia]]'' (silk tree).
;Trifoliate (or trifoliolate): A pinnate leaf with just three leaflets; e.g., ''[[clover|Trifolium]]'' (clover), ''[[Laburnum]]'' (laburnum).
;Pinnatifid: Pinnately dissected to the central vein, but with the leaflets not entirely separate; e.g., ''[[Polypodium]]'', some ''[[Sorbus]]'' (whitebeams). In pinnately veined leaves the central vein in known as the ''midrib''.

===Characteristics of the petiole===
[[File:Rabarber stelen.jpg|thumb|150px|The overgrown petioles of [[rhubarb]] (''Rheum rhabarbarum'') are edible.]]
Petiolated leaves have a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (leaf stalk), and are said to be petiolate.

[[Sessility (botany)|Sessile]] (epetiolate) leaves have no petiole and the blade attaches directly to the stem. Subpetiolate leaves are nearly petiolate or have an extremely short petiole and may appear to be sessile.

In '''clasping''' or [[decurrent]] leaves, the blade partially surrounds the stem.

When the leaf base completely surrounds the stem, the leaves are said to be '''perfoliate''', such as in ''[[Eupatorium perfoliatum]]''.

In peltate leaves, the petiole attaches to the blade inside the blade margin.

In some ''[[Acacia]]'' species, such as the koa tree (''[[Acacia koa]]''), the petioles are expanded or broadened and function like leaf blades; these are called [[phyllode]]s. There may or may not be normal pinnate leaves at the tip of the phyllode.

A [[stipule]], present on the leaves of many [[dicotyledon]]s, is an appendage on each side at the base of the petiole, resembling a small leaf. Stipules may be lasting and not be shed (a stipulate leaf, such as in [[rose]]s and [[bean]]s), or be shed as the leaf expands, leaving a stipule scar on the twig (an exstipulate leaf).
The situation, arrangement, and structure of the stipules is called the "stipulation".
;Free, lateral: As in ''[[Hibiscus]]''.
;Adnate: Fused to the petiole base, as in ''[[Rose|Rosa]]''.
;Ochreate: Provided with [[ochrea]], or sheath-formed stipules, as in [[Polygonaceae]]; e.g., [[rhubarb]].
;Encircling the petiole base:{{glossary}}{{term|[[wikt:interpetiolar stipule|Interpetiolar]]}}{{defn|Between the petioles of two opposite leaves, as in [[Rubiaceae]].}}{{term|[[wikt:intrapetiolar stipule|Intrapetiolar]]}}{{defn|Between the petiole and the subtending stem, as in [[Malpighiaceae]].}}

===Veins===
{{see also|#Venation|#Vascular tissue}}
[[File:Taro leaf underside, backlit by sun.jpg|thumb|150px|Branching veins on underside of [[taro]] leaf]]
[[File:Tilia x cordata flower veination.JPG|thumb|150px|The venation within the bract of a [[lime tree]]]]
[[File:Leaf Skeleton negative (like photogram).jpg|150px|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a leaf skeleton]]
Veins (sometimes referred to as nerves) constitute one of the more visible leaf traits or characteristics. The veins in a leaf represent the vascular structure of the organ, extending into the leaf via the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] and provide transportation of water and nutrients between leaf and stem, and play a crucial role in the maintenance of leaf water status and photosynthetic capacity.They also play a role in the mechanical support of the leaf.{{sfn|Rolland-Lagan et al|2009}}{{sfn|Walls|2011}} Within the lamina of the leaf, while some vascular plants possess only a single vein, in most this vasculature generally divides (ramifies) according to a variety of patterns (venation) and form cylindrical bundles, usually lying in the median plane of the [[#Mesophyll|mesophyll]], between the two layers of [[#Epidermis|epidermis]].{{sfn|Dickison|2000}} This pattern is often specific to taxa, and of which angiosperms possess two main types, [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] and [[reticulate]] (net like). In general, parallel venation is typical of monocots, while reticulate is more typical of [[eudicots]] and [[magnoliids]] ("[[dicots]]"), though there are many exceptions.{{sfn|Rudall|2007}}{{sfn|Dickison|2000}}&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt;

The vein or veins entering the leaf from the petiole are called primary or first order veins. The veins branching from these are secondary or second order veins. These primary and secondary veins are considered major veins or lower order veins, though some authors include third order.{{sfn|Sack|Scoffoni|2013}} Each subsequent branching is sequentially numbered, and these are the higher order veins, each branching being associated with a narrower vein diameter.{{sfn|Roth-Nebelsick et al|2001}} In parallel veined leaves, the primary veins run parallel and equidistant to each other for most of the length of the leaf and then converge or fuse (anastomose) towards the apex. Usually many smaller minor veins interconnect these primary veins, but may terminate with very fine vein endings in the mesophyll. Minor veins are more typical of angiosperms, which may have as many as four higher orders.{{sfn|Sack|Scoffoni|2013}} In contrast, leaves with reticulate venation there is a single (sometimes more) primary vein in the centre of the leaf, referred to as the midrib or costa and is continuous with the vasculature of the petiole more proximally. The midrib then branches to a number of smaller secondary veins, also known as second order veins, that extend toward the leaf margins. These often terminate in a [[hydathode]], a secretory organ, at the margin. In turn, smaller veins branch from the secondary veins, known as tertiary or third order (or higher order) veins, forming  a dense reticulate pattern. The areas or islands of mesophyll lying between the higher order veins, are called [[wikt:areola|areoles]]. Some of the smallest veins (veinlets) may have their endings in the areoles, a process known as areolation.{{sfn|Roth-Nebelsick et al|2001}} These minor veins act as the sites of exchange between the mesophyll and the plant's vascular system.{{sfn|Walls|2011}} Thus minor veins collect the products of photosynthesis (photosynthate) from the cells where it takes place, while major veins are responsible for its transport outside of the leaf. At the same time water is being transported in the opposite direction.{{sfn|Ueno et al|2006}}{{sfn|Rudall|2007}}{{sfn|Dickison|2000}}

The number of vein endings is very variable, as is whether second order veins end at the margin, or link back to other veins.&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; There are many elaborate variations on the patterns that the leaf veins form, and these have functional implications. Of these, angiosperms have the greatest diversity.{{sfn|Sack|Scoffoni|2013}} Within these the major veins function as the support and distribution network for leaves and are correlated with leaf shape. For instance the parallel venation found in most monocots correlates with their  elongated leaf shape and wide leaf base, while reticulate venation is seen in simple entire leaves, while  digitate leaves typically have venation in which three or more primary veins diverge radially from a single point.{{sfn|Runions et al|2005}}{{sfn|Walls|2011}}{{sfn|Roth-Nebelsick et al|2001}}&lt;ref name=MMsvt/&gt;

In evolutionary terms, early emerging taxa tend to have [[dichotomous]] branching with reticulate systems emerging later. Veins appeared in the [[Permian]] period (299–252&amp;nbsp;mya), prior to the appearance of angiosperms in the [[Triassic]] (252–201&amp;nbsp;mya), during which vein hierarchy appeared enabling higher function, larger leaf size and adaption to a wider vaiety of climatic conditions.{{sfn|Sack|Scoffoni|2013}} Although it is the more complex pattern, branching veins appear to be [[plesiomorph]]ic and in some form were present in ancient [[seed plant]]s as long as 250 million years ago. A pseudo-reticulate venation that is actually a highly modified penniparallel one is an [[autapomorph]]y of some [[Melanthiaceae]], which are monocots; e.g., ''[[Paris quadrifolia]]'' (True-lover's Knot). In leaves with reticulate venation, veins form a scaffolding matrix imparting mechanical rigidity to leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.1141.57|title = Insights from the Plant World: A Fractal Analysis Approach to Tune Mechanical Rigidity of Scaffolding Matrix in Thin Films| journal=Advanced Materials Research| volume=1141| pages=57–64|year = 2016|last1 = Bagchi|first1 = Debjani| last2=Dasgupta| first2=Avik| last3=Gondaliya| first3=Amit D.| last4=Rajput| first4=Kishore S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology changes within a single plant===

;[[Homoblasty]]: Characteristic in which a plant has small changes in leaf size, shape, and growth habit between juvenile and adult stages, in contrast to;

;Heteroblasty: Characteristic in which a plant has marked changes in leaf size, shape, and growth habit between juvenile and adult stages.

==Anatomy (medium and small scale)==

===Medium-scale features===

Leaves are normally extensively vascularised and typically have networks of [[vascular bundles]] containing [[xylem]], which supplies water for [[photosynthesis]], and [[phloem]], which transports the sugars produced by photosynthesis. Many leaves are covered in [[trichome]]s (small hairs) which have diverse  structures and functions.
[[File:Leaf Structure.svg|center|600px|Medium scale diagram of leaf internal anatomy]]

===Small-scale features===

The major tissue systems present are
* The '''[[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]''', which covers the upper and lower surfaces
* The '''[[leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll tissue]]''' inside the leaf, which is rich in chloroplasts (also called '''chlorenchyma''')
* The arrangement of '''veins''' (the [[vascular tissue]])

These three tissue systems typically form a regular organisation at the cellular scale. Specialised cells that differ markedly from surrounding cells, and which often synthesise specialised products such as crystals, are termed '''idioblasts'''.{{sfn|Cote|2009}}
[[File:Leaf Tissue Structure.svg|center|600px|Fine scale diagram of leaf structure]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

====Epidermis====
[[File:Leaf epidermis w scale.jpg|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of the leaf epidermis of ''[[Nicotiana alata]]'', showing [[trichome]]s (hair-like appendages) and [[stoma]]ta (eye-shaped slits, visible at full resolution).]]
The [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] is the outer layer of [[cell (biology)|cells]] covering the leaf. It is covered with a waxy [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] which is impermeable to liquid water and water vapor and forms the boundary separating the plant's inner cells from the external world. The cuticle is in some cases thinner on the lower epidermis than on the upper epidermis, and is generally thicker on leaves from dry climates as compared with those from wet climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3220956|title = The Relation of Leaf Structure to Physical Factors|journal = Transactions of the American Microscopical Society|volume = 26|pages = 19–98|last1 = Clements|first1 = Edith Schwartz|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epidermis serves several functions: protection against water loss by way of [[transpiration]], regulation of gas exchange and secretion of [[secondary metabolite|metabolic]] compounds. Most leaves show dorsoventral anatomy: The upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions.

The epidermis tissue includes several differentiated cell types; epidermal cells, epidermal hair cells ([[trichome]]s), cells in the stomatal complex; guard cells and subsidiary cells. The epidermal cells are the most numerous, largest, and least specialized and form the majority of the epidermis. They are typically more elongated in the leaves of [[monocot]]s than in those of [[dicot]]s.

Chloroplasts are generally absent in epidermal cells, the exception being the guard cells of the [[stomata]]. The stomatal pores perforate the epidermis and are surrounded on each side by chloroplast-containing guard cells, and two to four subsidiary cells that lack chloroplasts, forming a specialized cell group known as the stomatal complex. The opening and closing of the stomatal aperture is controlled by the stomatal complex and regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf. Stomata therefore play the important role in allowing photosynthesis without letting the leaf dry out. In a typical leaf, the stomata are more numerous over the abaxial (lower) epidermis than the adaxial (upper) epidermis and are more numerous in plants from cooler climates.

====Mesophyll====
{{for|the term ''Mesophyll'' in the size classification of leaves|Leaf size}}
Most of the interior of the leaf between the upper and lower layers of epidermis is a ''[[parenchyma]]'' (ground tissue)  or ''[[chlorenchyma]]'' tissue called the '''mesophyll''' (Greek for "middle leaf"). This [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] tissue is the primary location of photosynthesis in the plant. The products of photosynthesis are called "assimilates".

In ferns and most flowering plants, the mesophyll is divided into two layers:
* An upper '''[[palisade cell|palisade layer]]''' of vertically elongated cells, one to two cells thick, directly beneath the adaxial epidermis, with intercellular air spaces between them. Its cells contain many more chloroplasts than the spongy layer. These long cylindrical cells are regularly arranged in one to five rows. Cylindrical cells, with the ''[[chloroplasts]]'' close to the walls of the cell, can take optimal advantage of light. The slight separation of the cells provides maximum [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of carbon dioxide. Sun leaves have a multi-layered palisade layer, while shade leaves or older leaves closer to the soil are single-layered.
* Beneath the palisade layer is the '''spongy layer'''. The cells of the spongy layer are more branched and not so tightly packed, so that there are large intercellular air spaces between them for oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse in and out of during respiration and photosynthesis. These cells contain fewer chloroplasts than those of the palisade layer. The pores or ''stomata'' of the epidermis open into substomatal chambers, which are connected to the intercellular air spaces between the spongy and palisade mesophyll cells.

Leaves are normally [[green]], due to [[chlorophyll]] in [[chloroplast]]s in the mesophyll cells.  Plants that lack chlorophyll cannot [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]].

====Vascular tissue====
[[File:BrambleLeaf CrossPolarisedLight Diagram.jpg|thumb|The veins of a [[bramble]] leaf]]
The '''veins''' are the [[vascular tissue]] of the leaf and are located in the spongy layer of the mesophyll. The pattern of the veins is called [[#Venation (arrangement of the veins)|venation]]. In [[angiosperms]] the venation is typically parallel in [[monocotyledons]] and forms an interconnecting network in [[dicotyledon|broad-leaved plants]]. They were once thought to be typical examples of [[pattern formation]] through [[ramification (botany)|ramification]], but they may instead exemplify a pattern formed in a stress [[tensor field]].{{sfn|Couder et al|2002}}{{sfn|Corson et al|2009}}{{sfn|Laguna et al|2008}}

A vein is made up of a [[vascular bundle]]. At the core of each bundle are clusters of two
distinct types of conducting cells:
; [[Xylem]]: Cells that bring water and minerals from the roots into the leaf.
; [[Phloem]]: Cells that usually move [[sap]], with dissolved [[sucrose]]([[glucose]] to sucrose) produced by photosynthesis in the leaf, out of the leaf.

The xylem typically lies on the adaxial side of the vascular bundle and the phloem typically lies on the abaxial side. Both are embedded in a dense parenchyma tissue, called the sheath, which usually includes some structural collenchyma tissue.

==Leaf development==

According to [[Agnes Arber]]'s partial-shoot theory of the leaf, leaves are partial shoots,{{sfn|Arber|1950}} being derived from leaf [[primordia]] of the shoot apex.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;356}} Compound leaves are closer to shoots than simple leaves. Developmental studies have shown that compound leaves, like shoots, may branch in three dimensions.{{sfn|Rutishauser|Sattler|1997}}{{sfn|Lacroix et al|2003}} On the basis of molecular genetics, Eckardt and Baum (2010) concluded that "it is now generally accepted that compound leaves express both leaf and shoot properties."{{sfn|Eckardt|Baum|2010}}

== Ecology ==

=== Biomechanics ===
Plants respond and adapt to environmental factors, such as light and mechanical stress from wind. Leaves need to support their own mass and align themselves in such a way as to optimise their exposure to the sun, generally more or less horizontally. However horizontal alignment maximises exposure to bending forces and failure from stresses such as wind, snow, hail, falling debris, animals, and abrasion from surrounding foliage and plant structures. Overall leaves are relatively flimsy with regard to other plant structures such as stems, branches and roots.{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}}

Both leaf blade and petiole structure influence the leaf's response to forces such as wind, allowing a degree of repositioning to minimise [[drag (physics)|drag]] and damage, as opposed to resistance. Leaf movement like this may also increase [[turbulence]] of the air close to the surface of the leaf, which thins the [[boundary layer]] of air immediately adjacent to the surface, increasing the capacity for gas and heat exchange, as well as photosynthesis. Strong wind forces may result in diminished leaf number and surface area, which while reducing drag, involves a [[trade off]] of also reduces photosynthesis. Thus, leaf design may involve compromise between carbon gain, thermoregulation and water loss on the one hand, and the cost of sustaining both static and dynamic loads. In vascular plants, perpendicular forces are spread over a larger area and are relatively flexible in both bending and [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]], enabling elastic deforming without damage.{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}}

Many leaves rely on [[hydrostatic]] support arranged around a skeleton of vascular tissue for their strength, which depends on maintaining leaf water status. Both the mechanics and architecture of the leaf reflect the need for transportation and support. Read and Stokes (2006) consider two basic models, the "hydrostatic" and "I-beam leaf" form (see Fig 1).{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}} Hydrostatic leaves such as in ''[[Prostanthera lasianthos]]'' are large and thin, and may involve the need for multiple leaves rather single large leaves because of the amount of veins needed to support the periphery of large leaves. But large leaf size favours efficiency in photosynthesis and water conservation, involving further trade offs. On the other hand, I-beam leaves such as ''[[Banksia marginata]]'' involve specialised structures to stiffen them. These I-beams are formed from bundle sheath extensions of [[sclerenchyma]] meeting stiffened sub-epidermal layers. This shifts the balance from reliance on hydrostatic pressure to structural support, an obvious advantage where water is relatively scarce.
{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}} Long narrow leaves bend more easily than ovate leaf blades of the same area. Monocots typically have such linear leaves that maximise surface area while minimising self-shading. In these a high proportion of longitudinal main veins provide additional support.{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}}

=== Interactions with other organisms ===
[[File:Kallima inachus2.jpg|thumb|Some [[insect]]s, like ''[[Kallima inachus]]'', mimic leaves]]
Although not as nutritious as other organs such as fruit, leaves provide a food source for many organisms. The leaf is a vital source of energy production for the plant, and plants have evolved protection against animals that consume leaves, such as [[tannin]]s, chemicals which hinder the digestion of proteins and have an unpleasant taste. Animals that are specialized to eat leaves are known as [[folivore]]s.

Some species have [[crypsis|cryptic]] adaptations by which they use leaves in avoiding predators.  For example, the caterpillars of [[Tortricidae|some leaf-roller moths]] will create a small home in the leaf by folding it over themselves. Some [[Pamphiliidae|sawflies]] similarly roll the leaves of their food plants into tubes. Females of the [[Attelabidae]], so-called leaf-rolling weevils, lay their eggs into leaves that they then roll up as means of protection. Other herbivores and their predators [[mimicry|mimic]] the appearance of the leaf. Reptiles such as some chameleons, and insects such as some [[katydid]]s, also mimic the oscillating movements of leaves in the wind, moving from side to side or back and forth while evading a possible threat.

===Seasonal leaf loss===
[[File:Leaves in autumn.jpg|thumb|Leaves shifting color in autumn (fall)]]
Leaves in [[temperate]], [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]], and seasonally dry zones may be seasonally [[deciduous]] (falling off or dying for the inclement season). This mechanism to shed leaves is called [[abscission]]. When the leaf is shed, it leaves a leaf scar on the twig. In cold autumns, they sometimes [[autumn leaf color|change color]], and turn [[yellow]], bright-[[orange (colour)|orange]], or [[red]], as various accessory pigments ([[carotenoid]]s and [[xanthophyll]]s) are revealed when the tree responds to cold and reduced [[sunlight]] by curtailing chlorophyll production. Red [[anthocyanin]] pigments are now thought to be produced in the leaf as it dies, possibly to mask the yellow hue left when the chlorophyll is lost—yellow leaves appear to attract herbivores such as [[aphids]].{{sfn|Doring et al|2009}} Optical masking of chlorophyll by anthocyanins reduces risk of photo-oxidative damage to leaf cells as they senesce, which otherwise may lower the efficiency of nutrient retrieval from senescing autumn leaves.{{sfn|Feild et al|2001}}

==Evolutionary adaptation==
[[File:Inflorescence 1.jpg|thumb|[[Poinsettia]] [[bract]]s are leaves which have evolved red pigmentation in order to attract insects and birds to the central flowers, an adaptive function normally served by [[petal]]s (which are themselves leaves highly modified by evolution).]]

In the course of [[evolution]], leaves have adapted to different [[environment (biophysical)|environments]] in the following ways:
* [[Epicuticular wax|Waxy]] micro- and nanostructures on the surface reduce wetting by rain and adhesion of contamination (''See [[Lotus effect]]'').
* Divided and compound leaves reduce wind resistance and promote cooling.
* Hairs on the leaf surface trap humidity in dry climates and create a [[boundary layer]] reducing water loss.
* [[Wax]]y plant cuticles reduce water loss.
* Large surface area provides a large area for capture of sunlight.
* In harmful levels of sunlight, specialised leaves, opaque or partly buried, admit light through a translucent [[leaf window]] for photosynthesis at inner leaf surfaces (e.g. ''[[Fenestraria]]'').
* [[Succulent]] leaves store water and organic acids for use in [[CAM photosynthesis]].
* [[Aromatic oil]]s, [[poisons]] or [[pheromones]] produced by leaf borne glands deter herbivores (e.g. [[eucalypts]]).
* Inclusions of crystalline minerals deter herbivores (e.g. [[silica]] [[phytolith]]s in [[grass]]es, [[raphides]] in [[Araceae]]).
* [[Petal]]s attract pollinators.
* [[Spine (botany)|Spines]] protect the plants from herbivores (e.g. [[cacti]]).
* [[Stinging plant|Stinging hairs]] to protect against herbivory, e.g. in ''[[Urtica dioica]]'' and ''[[Dendrocnide moroides]]'' ([[Urticaceae]]).
* Special leaves on carnivorous plants are adapted for trapping food, mainly invertebrate prey, though some species trap small vertebrates as well (see [[carnivorous plant]]s).
* [[Bulb]]s store food and water (e.g. [[onion]]s).
* [[Tendril]]s allow the plant to climb (e.g. peas).
* [[Bract]]s and [[pseudanthium|pseudanthia]] (false flowers) replace normal flower structures when the true flowers are greatly reduced (e.g. [[spurge]]s and [[spathe]]s in the [[Araceae]].

A number of different classification systems of the patterns of leaf veins (venation or veination) have been described,&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; starting with Ettingshausen (1861),{{sfn|Ettingshausen|1861}} together with many different descriptive terms, and the terminology has been described as "formidable".&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; One of the commonest among these is the Hickey system, originally developed for "[[dicotyledons]]" and using a number of Ettingshausen's terms derived from Greek (1973–1979):{{sfn|Hickey|1973}}{{sfn|Hickey|Wolfe|1975}}{{sfn|Hickey|1979}} (''see also'': Simpson Figure 9.12, p.&amp;nbsp;468)&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt;

===== Hickey system =====
;1. [[Pinnate]] (feather-veined, reticulate, pinnate-netted, penniribbed, penninerved, or penniveined): The veins arise [[pinnately]] (feather like) from a single primary vein (mid-vein) and subdivide into secondary veinlets, known as higher order veins. These, in turn, form a complicated network. This type of venation is typical for (but by no means limited to) "[[dicotyledon]]s" (non monocotyledon [[angiosperms]]). E.g., ''[[Ostrya]]''.{{paragraph}} There are three subtypes of pinnate venation:{{glossary}}{{term
 | ''Craspedodromous'' (Greek: ''kraspedon'' - edge, ''dromos'' - running)}}{{defn
 | The major veins reach to the margin of the leaf.}}{{term
 | ''Camptodromous''}}{{defn
 | Major veins extend close to the margin, but bend before they intersect with the margin.}}{{term
 | ''Hyphodromous''}}{{defn
 | All secondary veins are absent, rudimentary or concealed}}{{glossary end}} These in turn have a number of further subtypes such as eucamptodromous, where secondary veins curve near the margin without joining adjacent secondary veins.

}}

;2. Parallelodromous (parallel-veined, parallel-ribbed, parallel-nerved, penniparallel, striate): Two or more primary veins originating beside each other at the leaf base, and running [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other to the apex and then converging there.  Commissural veins (small veins) connect the major parallel veins. Typical for most [[monocotyledon]]s, such as [[Poaceae|grasses]].{{paragraph}} The additional terms marginal (primary veins reach the margin), and reticulate (primary veins do not reach the margin) are also used.

 | float = none
 | image1 = Leaf morphology - venation Hickey 1973 - parallelodromous.svg

;3. Campylodromous (''campylos'' - curve): Several primary veins or branches originating at or close to a single point and running in recurved arches, then converging at apex. E.g. ''[[Maianthemum]]'' .
{{multiple image
 | header = Campylodromous
 | align = center

 | float = none
 | image1 =Leaf morphology - venation Hickey 1973 - campylodromous.svg
}}

;4. Acrodromous: Two or more primary or well developed secondary veins in convergent arches towards apex, without basal recurvature as in Campylodromous. May be basal or suprabasal depending on origin, and perfect or imperfect depending on whether they reach to 2/3 of the way to the apex. E.g., ''[[Miconia]]'' (basal type), ''[[Endlicheria]]'' (suprabasal type).

}}

;5. Actinodromous: Three or more primary veins diverging radially from a single point. E.g., ''[[Menispermaceae|Arcangelisia]]'' (basal type), ''[[Givotia]]'' (suprabasal type).
{{multiple image

;6. Palinactodromous: Primary veins with one or more points of secondary dichotomous branching beyond the primary divergence, either closely or more distantly spaced. E.g., ''[[Platanus]]''.

[[File:PoinsettiaVenation.jpg|alt=Venation of a poinsettia (''Euphorbia pulcherrima'') leaf|thumb|Venation of a Poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) leaf.]]

}}

Types 4–6 may similarly be subclassified as basal (primaries joined at the base of the blade) or suprabasal (diverging above the blade base), and perfect or imperfect, but also flabellate.

At about the same time, Melville (1976) described a system applicable to all Angiosperms and using Latin and English terminology.{{sfn|Melville|1976}} Melville also had six divisions, based on the order in which veins develop.

; Arbuscular (arbuscularis): Branching repeatedly by regular dichotomy to give rise to a three dimensional bush-like structure consisting of linear segment (2 subclasses)
; Flabellate (flabellatus): Primary veins straight or only slightly curved, diverging from the base in a fan-like manner (4 subclasses)
; Palmate (palmatus): Curved primary veins (3 subclasses)
; Pinnate (pinnatus): Single primary vein, the midrib, along which straight or arching secondary veins are arranged at more or less regular intervals (6 subclasses)
; Collimate (collimatus): Numerous longitudinally parallel primary veins arising from a transverse meristem (5 subclasses)
; Conglutinate (conglutinatus): Derived from fused pinnate leaflets (3 subclasses)

A modified form of the Hickey system was later incorporated into the Smithsonian classification (1999) which proposed seven main types of venation, based on the architecture of the primary veins, adding Flabellate as an additional main type. Further classification was then made on the basis of secondary veins, with 12 further types, such as;
; Brochidodromous: Closed form in which the secondaries are joined together in a series of prominent arches, as in ''[[Hildegardia (plant)|Hildegardia]]''.
; Craspedodromous: Open form with secondaries terminating at the margin, in toothed leaves, as in ''[[Celtis]]''.
; Eucamptodromous: Intermediate form with upturned secondaries that gradually diminish apically but inside the margin, and connected by intermediate tertiary veins rather than loops between secondaries, as in ''[[Cornus]]''.
; Cladodromous: Secondaries freely branching toward the margin, as in ''[[Rhus]]''.

Further descriptions included the higher order, or minor veins and the patterns of areoles (''see'' Leaf Architecture Working Group, Figures 28–29).{{sfn|Leaf Architecture Working Group|1999}}

[[File:Adiantum cunninghamii.jpg|thumb|Flabellate venation, ''[[Adiantum cunninghamii]]'']]
;Flabellate: Several to many equal fine basal veins diverging radially at low angles and branching apically. E.g. ''[[Paranomus]]''.

Analyses of vein patterns often fall into consideration of the vein orders, primary vein type, secondary vein type (major veins), and minor vein density. A number of authors have adopted simplified versions of these schemes.{{sfn|Judd et al| 2007}}&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; At its simplest the primary vein types can be considered in three or four groups depending on the plant divisions being considered;
* pinnate
* palmate
* parallel

where palmate refers to multiple primary veins that radiate from the petiole, as opposed to branching from the central main vein in the pinnate form, and encompasses both of Hickey types 4 and 5, which are preserved as subtypes; e.g., palmate-acrodromous (''see'' National Park Service Leaf Guide).{{sfn|Florissant Leaf Key|2016}}

[[File:Acer Truncatum leaf.jpg|thumb|Palmate venation, ''[[Acer truncatum]]'' ]]
;Palmate, Palmate-netted, palmate-veined, fan-veined: Several main veins of approximately equal size [[divergence|diverge]] from a common point near the leaf base where the petiole attaches, and radiate toward the edge of the leaf. Palmately veined leaves are often lobed or divided with lobes radiating from the common point. They may vary in the number of primary veins (3 or more), but always radiate from a common point.&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt; e.g. most [[maple|''Acer'']] (maples).

===== Other systems =====
Alternatively, Simpson uses:&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt;

; Uninervous: Central midrib with no lateral veins ([[microphyllous]]), seen in the non-seed bearing [[tracheophytes]], such as [[horsetails]]
; Dichotomous: Veins successively branching into equally sized veins from a common point, forming a Y junction, fanning out. Amongst temperate woody plants, ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'' is the only species exhibiting dichotomous venation. Also some [[fern|pteridophytes]] (ferns).&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt;
; Parallel: Primary and secondary veins roughly parallel to each other, running the length of the leaf, often connected by short perpendicular links, rather than form networks. In some species, the parallel veins join together at the base and apex, such as needle-type evergreens and grasses. Characteristic of monocotyledons, but exceptions include ''[[Arisaema]]'', and as below, under netted.&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt;
; Netted (reticulate, pinnate): A prominent midvein with secondary veins branching off along both sides of it. The name derives from the ultimate veinlets which form an interconnecting net like pattern or network. (The primary and secondary venation may be referred to as pinnate, while the net like finer veins are referred to as netted or reticulate); most non-monocot angiosperms, exceptions including ''[[Calophyllum]]''. Some monocots have reticulate venation, including ''[[Colocasia]]'', ''[[Dioscorea]]'' and ''[[Smilax]]''.&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt;

However, these simplified systems allow for further division into multiple subtypes. Simpson,&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; (and others){{sfn|Berg|2007}} divides parallel and netted (and some use only these two terms for Angiosperms)&lt;ref name=AMVen/&gt; on the basis of the number of primary veins (costa) as follows;

These complex systems are not used much in morphological descriptions of taxa, but have usefulness in plant identification,
&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; although criticized as being unduly burdened with jargon.&lt;ref name=HLlv/&gt;

An older, even simpler system, used in some flora{{sfn|Cullen et al|2011}} uses only two categories, open and closed.&lt;ref name=BeachLv/&gt;
* Open: Higher order veins have free endings among the cells and are more characteristic of non-monocotyledon angiosperms. They are more likely to be associated with leaf shapes that are toothed, lobed or compound. They may be subdivided as;
** Pinnate (feather-veined) leaves, with a main central vein or rib (midrib), from which the remainder of the vein system arises
** Palmate, in which three or more main ribs rise together at the base of the leaf, and diverge upward.
** Dichotomous, as in ferns, where the veins fork repeatedly
* Closed: Higher order veins are connected in loops without ending freely among the cells. These tend to be in leaves with smooth outlines, and are characteristic of monocotyledons.
** They may be subdivided into whether the veins run parallel, as in grasses, or have other patterns.

==== Other descriptive terms ====

There are also many other descriptive terms, often with very specialised usage and confined to specific taxonomic groups.{{sfn|Neotropikey|2017}} The conspicuousness of veins depends on a number of features. These include the width of the veins, their prominence in relation to the lamina surface and the degree of opacity of the surface, which may hide finer veins. In this regard, veins are called '''obscure''' and the order of veins that are obscured and whether upper, lower or both surfaces, further specified.{{sfn|Oxford herbaria glossary|2017}}&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt;

Terms that describe vein prominence include '''bullate''', '''channelled''', '''flat''', '''guttered''', '''impressed''', '''prominent''' and '''recessed''' (''Fig''.&amp;nbsp;6.1 Hawthorne &amp; Lawrence 2013).&lt;ref name=HLlv/&gt;&lt;ref name=OxHerbVp/&gt; Veins may show different types of prominence in different areas of the leaf. For instance ''[[Pimenta racemosa]]'' has a channelled midrib on the upper surfae, but this is prominent on the lower surface.&lt;ref name=HLlv/&gt;

Describing vein prominence:

;Bullate: Surface of leaf raised in a series of domes between the veins on the upper surface, and therefore also with marked depressions. e.g. ''[[Rytigynia|Rytigynia pauciflora]]'',{{sfn|Verdcourt|Bridson|1991}} ''[[Vitis vinifera]]''
;Channelled (canalicululate): Veins sunken below the surface, resulting in a rounded channel. Sometimes confused with "guttered" because the channels may function as gutters for rain to run off and allow drying, as in many [[Melastomataceae]].&lt;ref name=Hemsley254/&gt; e.g. (''see'') ''[[Pimenta racemosa]]'' (Myrtaceae),&lt;ref name=OxHerbPimrac/&gt; ''[[Clidemia hirta]]'' (Melastomataceae).
;Guttered: Veins partly prominent, the crest above the leaf lamina surface, but with channels running along each side, like gutters
;Impressed: Vein forming raised line or ridge which lies below the plane of the surface which bears it, as if pressed into it, and are often exposed on the lower surface. Tissue near the veins often appears to pucker, giving them a sunken or embossed appearance
;Obscure: Veins not visible, or not at all clear; if unspecified, then not visible with the naked eye. e.g. ''[[Berberis gagnepainii]]''. In this ''Berberis'', the veins are only obscure on the undersurface.&lt;ref name=CullenBgag/&gt;
;Prominent: Vein raised above surrounding surface so to be easily felt when stroked with finger. e.g. (''see'') ''[[Pimenta racemosa]]'',&lt;ref name=OxHerbPimrac/&gt; ''[[Spathiphyllum|Spathiphyllum cannifolium]]''&lt;ref name=KwantlenSpcan/&gt;
;Recessed: Vein is sunk below the surface, more prominent than surrounding tissues but more sunken in channel than with impressed veins. e.g. ''[[Viburnum plicatum]]''.

Describing other features:
;[[wikt:-plinerved|Plinervy]] (plinerved): More than one main vein (nerve) at the base. Lateral secondary veins branching from a point above the base of the leaf. Usually expressed as a [[suffix]], as in 3-plinerved or triplinerved leaf. In a 3-plinerved (triplinerved) leaf three main veins branch above the base of the lamina (two secondary veins and the main vein) and run essentially parallel subsequently, as in ''[[Ceanothus]]'' and in ''[[Celtis occidentalis|Celtis]]''. Similarly a quintuplinerve (five-veined) leaf has four secondary veins and a main vein. A pattern with 3-7 veins is especially conspicuous in [[Melastomataceae]]. The term has also been used in [[Vaccinieae]]. The term has been used as synonymous with acrodromous, palmate-acrodromous or suprabasal acrodromous, and is thought to be too broadly defined.{{sfn|Pedraza-Peñalosa|2013}}{{sfn|Pedraza-Peñalosa|2013}}
;Scalariform: Veins arranged like the rungs of a ladder, particularly higher order veins
;Submarginal: Veins running close to leaf margin
;Trinerved: 2 major basal nerves besides the midrib

===Size===
{{main article|Leaf size}}
The terms '''megaphyll''', '''macrophyll''', '''mesophyll''', '''notophyll''', '''microphyll''', '''nanophyll''' and '''leptophyll''' are used to describe leaf sizes (in descending order), in a classification devised in 1934 by [[Christen C. Raunkiær]] and since modified by others.{{sfn|Whitten et al|1997}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13951">When the Spanish arrived, they divided [[Peru]] into three main regions: the coastal region (11.6% of Peru), that is bounded by the [[Pacific Ocean]]; the highlands (28.1% of Peru), that is located on the [[Andes|Andean Heights]], and the jungle, that is located on the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian Jungle]] ([[Climate of Peru]]). But [[Javier Pulgar Vidal]] ([[:es:Javier Pulgar Vidal|es]]), a geographer who studied the biogeographic reality of the Peruvian territory for a long time, proposed the creation of eight Natural Regions.&lt;ref name="Pulgar Vidal 1979. pp. 145-161"&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: ''Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú''. Edit. Universo S.A., Lima 1979. First Edition (his dissertation of 1940): Las ocho regiones naturales del Perú, ''[[Boletín del Museo de Historia Natural]]'' „Javier Prado“, n° especial, Lima, 1941, 17, pp. 145-161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benavides Estrada, Juan (1999); ''Geografía del Perú 2do año de Secuandaria''. Lima: Escuela Nueva.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, he presented his thesis "Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú" at the III General Assembly of the [[Pan-American Institute of Geography and History]].

These eight Peruvian regions are:
* [[Chala|Chala or Coast]] (subtropical dry and tropical savanna)
* [[Yungas]]
** Fluvial Yunga
** Loma-Vegetation
* [[Quechua (geography)|Quechua]]
* [[Suni (geography)|Suni or Jalca]]

=== Javier Pulgar Vidal's version ===

[[File:Hoehenstufen der anden.en.PNG|thumb|Altitudinal variation in the Andes.]]

The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal divided Peru in 8 regions (traditionally, it was ''costa'', ''sierra'' and ''selva''):

*[[Chala]] (West, Pacific Coast) 0– 500 m
*[[Omagua]] (Lowland jungle or ''Selva baja'', Amazonic rainforest) 80– 400 m
*[[Rupa-Rupa]] (Highland jungle, ''Selva alta'') 400– 1,000 m
*[[Yunga]] ([[Aymaran]] for "Warm Lands", Cloud forest)
**Loma-Vegetation (West, "Yunga costal" at the north of Peru) 450– 600 m
**Fluvial Yungas (East, "Yunga fluvial") 1,000- 2,300 m
*[[Quechua (geography)|Quechua]] (East, High valleys) 2,300– 3,500 m

*[[Puna grassland|Puna]] (means "mountain top") 4,100– 4,800 m
*[[Janca]] (means white) above 4,800 m, permafrost, rocks, snow and ice&lt;ref name="Pulgar Vidal 1979. pp. 145-161"/&gt;

* Peruvian Highland Rainforest (Tropical climate), Cloud forest (Subtropical climate) and Temperate forest (Temperate climate);
* Cusco reference, estimated avg annual temperature (°C, Lowland Rainforest or ''Selva baja'' gets more rain, so it is more cloudy, so it is cooler);
* Snow line reference, [[Humboldt cold current]]/ Pacific climate influence, estimated avg annual temperature (°C).&lt;ref name="klimadiagramme"&gt;[http://www.klimadiagramme.de/ Klimadiagramme weltweit - Europa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25341">'''Multiliteracies''' is a term coined in the mid-1990s by the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School |date=July 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an approach to [[literacy]] theory and [[pedagogy]].  This approach highlights two key aspects of literacy: [[linguistic diversity]], and multimodal forms of linguistic expression and representation. The term was coined in response to two significant changes in [[globalized]] environments: the proliferation of diverse modes of communication through new [[communications technologies]] such as the [[internet]], [[multimedia]], and [[digital media]], and the existence of growing linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] due to increased transnational migration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the way people communicate is changing due to new technologies, and shifts in the usage of the English language within different cultures, a new "literacy" must also be used and developed.
 
==Overview==
There are two major topics that demonstrate the way multiliteracies can be used. The first is due to the world becoming smaller, communication between other cultures/languages is necessary to anyone. The usage of the [[English language]] is also being changed. While it seems that English is the common, [[global language]], there are different dialects and subcultures that all speak different [[Englishes]]. The way English is spoken in Australia,  South Africa, India or any other country is different from how it is spoken in the original English speaking countries in the UK.
 
The second way to incorporate the term multiliteracies is the way technology and multimedia is changing how we communicate.  These days, text and speech are not the only and main ways to communicate. The definition of media is being extended to include text combined with sounds, and images which are being incorporated into movies, billboards, almost any site on the internet, and television. All these ways of communication require the ability to understand a multimedia world.

The formulation of  "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies" by the New London Group expanded the focus of literacy from reading and writing to an understanding of multiple discourses and forms of representation in public and professional domains.  The new literacy pedagogy was developed to meet the learning needs of students to allow them to navigate within these altered technological, cultural, and linguistically diverse communities.  The concept of multiliteracies has been applied within various contexts and includes oral vernacular genres, visual literacies, information literacy, emotional literacy, and scientific multiliteracies and [[numeracy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Application to the real world ==

Due to changes in the world, especially [[globalization]] and an increase in [[immigration]], a debate has arisen about the way students are instructed and learning in school. English, and all subjects, should evolve to incorporate multimodal ways of communication. The New London Group (1996) proposes the teaching of all representations of meaning including, linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural, which are subsumed under the category of multimodal.  A pedagogy of multiliteracies includes a balanced classroom design of Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice.  Students need to draw on their own experiences and [[semiotic]] literacy practices to represent and communicate meaning.

The changes that transpire through the field of education affect learning processes, while the application of learning processes affects the use of multiliteracies (Selber, 2004). These include the functional, critical, and rhetorical skills that are applied in diverse fields and disciplines.

Educational pedagogies, including Purpose Driven Education, integrate the use of multi-literacy by encouraging student learning through exploration of their passions using their senses, technology, [[vernacular]]s, as well as alternative forms of communication. 

== The New London Group ==
The New London Group is a group of ten academics who met at New London, New Hampshire, in the United States in September 1994, to develop a new literacy pedagogy that would serve concerns facing educators as the existing literacy pedagogy did not meet the learning needs of students. Their focus was on replacing the existing monolingual, monocultural, and standardized literacy pedagogy that prioritized reading and writing, with a pedagogy that used multiple modes of meaning making. They emphasised the use of multiple modes of communication, languages, and multiple Englishes to reflect the impact of new technologies and linguistic and cultural diversity, instead of developing competence in a single [[national language]] and [[Standard English|standardized form of English]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ten academics brought to the discussion their expertise and personal experience from different national and professional contexts. Courtney Cazden from the United States has worked in the areas of classroom discourse and multilingual teaching and learning; [[Bill Cope (academic)|Bill Cope]] from Australia, on literacy pedagogy and linguistic diversity, and new technologies of representation and communication; [[Mary Kalantzis]] from Australia, on experimental social education and citizenship education; [[Norman Fairclough]] from the United Kingdom, on critical discourse analysis, social practices and discourse, and the relationship between discursive change and social and cultural change; [[Gunther Kress]] from the United Kingdom, on social semiotics, visual literacy, discourse analysis, and multimodal literacy; [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]] from the United States, on psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language and literacy; [[Allan Luke]] from Australia on critical literacy  and [[applied linguistics]]; Carmen Luke from Australia, on feminism and critical pedagogy; Sarah Michaels from the United States, on classroom discourse; and [http://nuragili.unsw.edu.au/profilemartinnakata.html Martin Nataka] on [[indigenous education]] and [[higher education]] curriculum.

== A pedagogy of multiliteracies ==
The multiliteracies pedagogical approach involves four key aspects: Situated Practice, Critical Framing, Overt Instruction, and Transformed Practice. Situated Practice involves learning that is grounded in students' own life experiences. Critical Framing supports students in questioning common sense assumptions found within discourses. Overt Instruction is the direct teaching of "[[metalanguage]]s" in order to help learners understand the components of expressive forms or grammars. Transformed Practice is where learners engage in situated practices based in new understandings of literacy practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Situated practice ==
Situated Practice, originally formulated by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the related components of Multiliteracies Pedagogy, is constituted by immersion in meaningful practices within a community of learners who are culturally and linguistically diversified. It involves situating meaning making in real-world contexts and taking account of the affective and sociocultural needs of learners. This aspect of the curriculum needs to draw on the lifeworld experiences of students, as well as their out-of-school communities and discourses, as an integral part of the learning experience. In order to apply Situated Practice to curriculum realities, Cope &amp; Kalantzis (2009)&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|date=2009-08-06|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15544800903076044|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044|issn=1554-480X}}&lt;/ref&gt; reframed it as “experiencing” (p.&amp;nbsp;184)''.'' They believe human cognition is situated and contextual, and meanings are grounded in the real world of patterns of experience, action and subjective interest. Experiencing takes two forms.
* Experiencing the known–learners bring their own, invariably diverse knowledge, experiences, interests and life-texts to the learning context. Activities of experiencing the known involve showing or talking about something familiar-listen, view, watch and visit, reflecting on learners' own experiences, interests and perspectives (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title=‘The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.’ pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Experiencing the new–learners are immersed in new situations or information, observing or taking part in something that is new or unfamiliar, but within the zone of intelligibility and close to their own life-worlds. For example, teachers introduce something new but which makes sense by immersion in experiments, field trips and investigations in projects (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

Situated Practice/experiencing connects with a tradition called 'authentic pedagogy'. [http://newlearningonline.com/literacies/chapter-5/kalantzis-and-cope-debating-authentic-pedagogy Authentic pedagogy]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196581.007|title=literacy|last=Kalantzis|first=Mary|last2=Cope|first2=Bill|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|location=Cambridge|publication-place=Cambridge|pages=95–117|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139196581.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first formulated as a direct counterpoint to [http://newlearningonline.com/learning-by-design/glossary/didactic didactic pedagogy] in the twentieth century, initially through the work of [http://www.iep.utm.edu/dewey/ John Dewey] in the United States and [http://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Montessori Maria Montessori]  in Italy. It focuses on the learner's own meanings, the texts that are relevant to them in their everyday lives. When it comes to reading and writing, authentic literacy pedagogy promotes a process of natural language growth that begins when a child learns to speak, with a focus on internalized understanding rather than the formalities of rules. It is learner-centered and aims to provide space for self-expression.

However, the New London Group (1996) points out limitations to Situated Practice. First, while situated learning can lead to mastery in practice, learners immersed in rich and complex practices can vary significantly from each other and Situated Practice does not necessarily lead to conscious control and awareness of what one knows and does. Second, Situated Practice does not necessarily create learners who can critique what they are learning in terms of historical, cultural, political, ideological, or value-centered relations. Third, there is the question of putting knowledge into action. Learners might be incapable of reflexively enacting their knowledge in practice. Therefore, they clarify that Situated Practice must be supplemented by other components and powerful learning arises from weaving between Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice in a purposeful way.

== Critical framing ==
Critical Framing in multiliteracies requires an investigation of the socio-cultural contexts and purposes of learning and designs of meaning. Cope and Kalantzis (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cope, B.  |author2=Kalantzis, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |date = 2001|title = Putting ‘multiliteracies’ to the test|url = https://www.alea.edu.au/documents/item/59|journal = Newsletter of the Australian Literacy Educators Association.|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss this in the context of our increasingly diverse and globally interconnected lives where the forces of migration, multiculturalism, and global economic integration intensify the processes of change. The act of meaning-making is also diversifying as digital interfaces level the playing field.

Mills (2009)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mills|first = Kathy A.|date = 2009|title = Multiliteracies: interrogating competing discourses|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500780802152762|journal = Language and Education, 23:2, 103-116|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses how multiliteracies can help us go beyond heritage print texts that reproduce and sustain dominant cultural values by creating affordances for thinking about textual practices that construct and produce culture. Another dimension of this critical framing may be extended to the diverse types and purposes of literacy in contemporary society. The traditional curricula operates on various rules of inclusion and exclusion in the hierarchical ordering of textual practices, often dismissing text types such as picture books or popular fiction. Similarly, items like blogs, emails, websites, visual literacies, and oral discourses may often be overlooked as "inferior literacies". In excluding them from mainstream literacy practices, we become prone to disenfranchise groups and may lose out on opportunities to sensitize learners to consider underlying issues of power, privilege, and prejudice, both in terms of identifying these in societal practices, as well as in questioning dominant discourses that normalize these. Mills also states how some scholars such as Unsworth (2006a, 2006b) and Mackey (1998) suggest an increased blurring of 'popular culture' and 'quality literature' facilitated by classical literature made available in electronic formats and supported by online communities and forums.

In addition to acknowledging increased socio-cultural contextualization and diversification of text-types, multiliteracies pedagogies also enable us to critically frame and reconceptualize traditional notions of writing, calling into question issues of authority, authorship, power, and knowledge. [http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3084/1/D4Writing_and_Multimodal_social_semiotics.pdf Domingo, Jewitt, &amp; Kress (2014)]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Multimodal social semiotics: Writing in online contexts|last = Domingo, M., Jewitt, C. and Kress, G|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = 1317510607|location = London|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; address these concepts through a study of template designs on websites and blogs that empowers the readers through non-linear readings paths, with the modular layout allowing them to choose their own reading paths. They also discuss the varying affordances of different modes and how writing become just one part of the multimodal ensemble.

Multiliteracies transcend conventional print literacies and the centrality of cultures that have historically extolled it, offering much scope for arts-based approaches in decolonizing initiatives (Flicker et. al., 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Flicker, S., Danforth, J., Wilson, C., Oliver, V., Larkin, J., Restoule, J-P, Mitchell, C., Konsmo, E., Jackson, R. &amp; Prentice, T.|date = 2014|title = "Because we have really unique art": Decolonizing research with Indigenous youth using the arts.|url = http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ijih/article/view/13271|journal = International Journal of Indigenous Health|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reflexive visual methodologies in situated contexts (Mitchell, DeLange, Moletsane, Stuart, &amp; Buthelezi, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mitchell, C., DeLange, N., Moletsane, R., Stuart, J., &amp; Buthelezi, T.|date = 2005|title = Giving a face to HIV and AIDS: On the uses of photo-voice by teachers and community health care workers working with youth in rural South Africa|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1191/1478088705qp042oa|journal = Qualitative Research in Psychology  |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=257–270|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in so far as access to digital tools and infrastructures is concerned, we still need to take into account issues of agency, capital, socioeconomic status, and digital epistemologies (Prinsloo &amp; Rowsell, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Prinsloo, M., &amp; Rowsell, J.|date = 2012|title = Digital literacies as placed resources in the globalised periphery|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500782.2012.691511|journal = Language and Education |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–277|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overt instruction ==
===Original view===
In the original formulation of the New London Group, Overt Instruction was one of the major dimensions of literacy pedagogy that was identified. The original view of overt instruction includes the teachers and other experts' supporting students through scaffolding and focusing the students on the important features of their experiences and activities within the community of learners (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;33). Cope and Kalantiz argue teachers and other experts allow the learner to gain explicit information at times by building on and using what the learner already knows and has achieved. Overt Instruction is not, as it is often misrepresented, direct transmission, drills, and rote learning. It includes the kinds of collaborative efforts between teacher and student in which the student can do a task that is much more complex than the task s/he can do it individually. According to Cope and Kalantzis, "Overt Instruction introduces an often overlooked element-the connection of the element of the importance of contextualization of learning experiences to conscious understanding of elements of language meaning and design" (p.&amp;nbsp;116) Use of metalanguages, Cope and Kalantzis argue, is one of the key features of Overt Instruction. Metalanguages refer to "languages of reflective generalization that describe the form, content, and function of the discourses of practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;34).

===Updated view===
After applying Overt Instruction orientation to curriculum practices for around a decade, this dimension of literacy pedagogy was reframed and translated in the Learning by Design project into the 'Knowledge Process' of conceptualizing (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, 2015).&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; 
Conceptualizing involves "the development of abstract, generalizing concepts and theoretical synthesis of these concepts" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Using these Knowledge Processes, learners can categorize terms, and collect these into the mental models. Conceptualizing, according to Cope and Kalantzis (p.&amp;nbsp;19) occurs in two ways:
Conceptualizing by Naming-categorization is a Knowledge Process by means of which the learner learns to use abstract, generalizing terms. A concept not only names the particular; it also abstracts something general from that particular.

Activity type: define terms, make a glossary, label a diagram, sort or categorize like or unlike things
Conceptualizing with theory-schematization is a Knowledge Process by means of which learners make generalizations and put the key terms together into interpretative framework. They build mental models, abstract frameworks and transferable disciplinary schemas (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;185&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;).  
Activity type: draw a diagram, make a concept map, or write a summary, theory or formula which puts the concepts together

== Transformed practice ==
Transformed Practice, originally framed by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the four components of Multiliteracies pedagogy, is embedded in [[Authentic Learning|authentic learning]], where activities are re-created according to the lifeworld of learners. Transformed Practice is transfer in meaning-making practice, which involves applied learning, real-world meanings, communication in practice, and applying understanding gained from Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, and Critical Framing to a new context. Once learners are aware of how context affects their learning, the "theory becomes [[reflective practice]]" (The New London Group, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;87). In other words, learners can reflect on what they have learned while they engage in reflective practice based on their personal goals and values in new contexts. For instance, learners design a personalized research project on a specific topic.

Transformed Practice subsequently underwent reformation and was renamed "Applying" as part of "Knowledge Processes" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;184),&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; formerly known as Multiliteracy pedagogy. Applying is considered as the typical focus of the tradition of applied or [http://edglossary.org/competency-based-learning/ competency-based learning] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title='The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.' pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While learners actively learn by applying experiential, conceptual or critical knowledge in the real world, learners act on the basis of knowing something of the world, and learning something new from the experience of acting. That is, applying occurs more or less unconsciously or incidentally everyday in the lifeworld, since learners are usually doing things and learning by doing them. Applying can occur in two ways:
* Applying appropriately concerns how knowledge is perceived in a typical or predictable way in a particular situation. For instance, meanings are expressed in a way that corresponds to the conventions of a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] or [[meaning-making]] setting (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015). Applying appropriately also involves the application of knowledge and understanding of the complexity of real-world situations. Learners then examine if they are valid. Examples of activities include writing, drawing, solving a problem, or behaving in the usual and expected manner in a real-world situation/[[simulation]] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).
* Applying creatively involves the way learners transform knowledge they have learned from a familiar context and use it in a different context, unfamiliar to learners. As applying creatively is related to being active in the innovative and creative world, learners’ interests, experiences, and aspirations can be promoted. Examples of activities are taking an intellectual risk, applying knowledge to a different setting, suggesting a new problem, and translating knowledge into a different mix of modes of meaning (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

'''''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World''''' is an academic anthology edited by the British [[religious studies]] scholars  Joanne Pearson, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel which was published by [[Edinburgh University Press]] in 1998. Containing fourteen separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of [[Pagan studies]], the book examines different forms of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] as practiced in Europe and North America.

Divided into three parts, the first, entitled "A Chthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World" contained papers from scholars such as Peter Beyer, Steven Sutcliffe and Wouter J. Hanegraaff and dealt with the relationship between contemporary Paganism and various features of contemporary society, such as [[globalisation]] and the [[secularisation]] of the natural world. The second part, entitled "The Pagan Alternative: the Goddess and Nature", contained papers by Prudence Jones, [[Ronald Hutton]], Susan Greenwood, Elizabeth Puttick and Geoffrey Samuel dealing with the role of goddess figures in the Pagan movement. Finally, the third part of the book, entitled "Nature Religion in Practice", contained articles by Jone Salomonsen, Philip Shallcrass, [[Vivianne Crowley]] and Alastair McIntosh dealing with the various religious practices of Pagans.

==Origins==
The first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies had been held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993, having been organised by the religious studies scholars [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] and Charlotte Hardman.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism then took place at [[Ambleside]] in the [[Lake District]]; organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Lancaster]], North-West England, it was entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference's organisers later described its original intentions, remarking that through it they "sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis."&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Part One: A Cthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World===

====Beyer's "Globalisation and the Religion of Nature"====
The anthology's opening paper was written by Peter Beyer, then an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of Ottawa]], Canada, and the author of the book ''Religion and Globalization'' (1994). In this paper, Beyer delved the definition of "[[nature religion]]" developed by the American religious studies scholar Catherine Albanese, looking at those religious movements whose "devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeding to provide a basic summary of [[globalisation]], he then made a brief discussion of how the two interact, arguing that nature religions had a tendency to develop a counter-structural strategy in dealing with globalising forces. In this manner they emphasise the idea that spiritual authenticity is stronger among the oppressed, such as those indigenous communities who adhere to nature religionist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. pp. 16&amp;ndash;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hanegraaff's "Reflections on New Age and the Secularisation of Nature"====
Beyer's paper was followed by that provided by Wouter J. Hanegraaff, then a Research Associate at the [[University of Utrecht]] and the author of ''New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mind of Secular Thought'' (1996).

'''Neurodegeneration''' is the progressive loss of structure or function of [[neurons]], including death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases – including [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[Huntington's disease]] – occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. Such diseases are incurable, resulting in progressive degeneration and/or death of neuron cells.&lt;ref name=JPND&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Neurodegenerative Disease?|url=http://www.neurodegenerationresearch.eu/about/what/|website=JPND Research|publisher=JPND Research|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As research progresses, many similarities appear that relate these diseases to one another on a [[sub-cellular]] level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as induced cell death.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rubinsztein DC| title = The roles of intracellular protein-degradation pathways in neurodegeneration| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 780–6|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051204| doi = 10.1038/nature05291| bibcode=2006Natur.443..780R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bredesen&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bredesen DE, Rao RV, Mehlen P | title = Cell death in the nervous system| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 796–802|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051206| doi = 10.1038/nature05293| bibcode=2006Natur.443..796B| pmc=3970704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of neuronal circuitry ranging from molecular to systemic.

==Risk factor==
The greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is [[ageing|aging]]. [[Free-radical theory of aging#Mitochondrial theory of aging|Mitochondrial DNA mutations]] as well as [[oxidative stress]] both contribute to aging.&lt;ref name = lin /&gt; Many of these diseases are late-onset, meaning there is some factor that changes as a person ages for each disease.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt; One constant factor is that in each disease, neurons gradually lose function as the disease progresses with age. It has been proposed that [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] accumulation provides the underlying causative link between [[ageing|aging]] and neurodegenerative disease.&lt;ref name= Bernsteinbook&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair. pages 121-139, Academic Press, San Diego.

==Mechanisms==

===Genetics===
{{see also|Epigenetics of neurodegenerative diseases}}
Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by [[genetic mutation]]s, most of which are located in completely unrelated genes. In many of the different diseases, the mutated gene has a common feature: a repeat of the CAG nucleotide triplet. CAG encodes for the amino acid [[glutamine]]. A repeat of CAG results in a [[polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine (polyQ) tract]]. Diseases showing this are known as [[polyglutamine disease]]s.&lt;ref name = thompson&gt;{{cite journal| author = Thompson LM| title = Neurodegeneration: a question of balance| journal = Nature| volume = 452| issue = 7188| pages = 707–8|date=April 2008| pmid = 18401401| doi = 10.1038/452707a|bibcode = 2008Natur.452..707T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = marsh&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Marsh JL, Lukacsovich T, Thompson LM | title = Animal Models of Polyglutamine Diseases and Therapeutic Approaches| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7431–5|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957429| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800065200| pmc = 2658038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Polyglutamine:''' A repeat in this causes dominant pathogenesis. Extra glutamine residues can acquire toxic properties through a variety of ways, including irregular protein folding and degradation pathways, altered subcellular localization, and abnormal interactions with other cellular proteins.&lt;ref name = thompson /&gt; PolyQ studies often use a variety of animal models because there is such a clearly defined trigger – repeat expansion. Extensive research has been done using the [[model organism|models]] of [[nematode]] (''C. elegans''), and fruit fly (''Drosophila''), mice, and non-human primates. Mammalian data is often needed for FDA approval of drugs, which means that the bulk of the research is done using mice. Using data from the other animals (''C. elegans'' and ''Drosophila'' primarily) is often a precursor to finding the equivalent mammalian gene.&lt;ref name = marsh /&gt;&lt;ref name = orr&gt;{{cite journal| author = Orr HT| title = Unstable Nucleotide Repeat Minireview Series: A Molecular Biography of Unstable Repeat Disorders| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7405|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957428| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800067200| pmc = 2658033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Nine inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the expansion of the CAG trinucleotide and polyQ tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zoghbi HY, Orr HT | title = Pathogenic Mechanisms of a Polyglutamine-mediated Neurodegenerative Disease, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7425–9|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957430| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800041200| pmc = 2658037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples are [[Huntington's disease]] and the [[spinocerebellar ataxia]]s. For a complete list, see the table under '''Polyglutamine (PolyQ) Diseases''' in the article [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder]]. While polyglutamine-repeat diseases encompass many different neurodegenerative disorders, there are many more it does not apply to. The genetics behind each disease are different and often unknown.

===Protein misfolding===
Several neurodegenerative diseases are classified as [[proteopathy|proteopathies]] as they are associated with the [[protein aggregation|aggregation]] of [[protein folding|misfolded proteins]].
*'''[[alpha-synuclein]]:''' can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by [[Lewy bodies]], such as Parkinson's disease, [[dementia with Lewy bodies]], and multiple system atrophy. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. In addition, an alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-Abeta component (NAC), is found in amyloid plaques in [[Alzheimer's disease]].
*'''tau:''' hyperphosphorylated [[tau protein]] is the main component of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] in Alzheimer's disease.
*'''[[beta amyloid]]:''' the major component of [[senile plaques]] in Alzheimer's disease.
*'''[[prion]]:''' main component of prion diseases and [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]].

===Intracellular mechanisms===

====Protein degradation pathways====
[[Parkinson's]] disease and [[Huntington's]] disease are both late-onset and associated with the accumulation of intracellular toxic proteins. Diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins are known as proteinopathies, and they are primarily caused by aggregates in the following structures:&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

* cytosol, e.g. [[Parkinson's]] &amp; [[Huntington's]]
* nucleus, e.g. [[Spinocerebellar ataxia]] type 1 (SCA1)
* endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (as seen with neuroserpin mutations that cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies)
* extracellularly excreted proteins, amyloid-β in Alzheimer's disease

There are two main avenues eukaryotic cells use to remove troublesome proteins or organelles:

*'''ubiquitin–proteasome:''' protein [[ubiquitin]] along with enzymes is key for the degradation of many proteins that cause proteinopathies including polyQ expansions and alpha-synucleins. Research indicates proteasome enzymes may not be able to correctly cleave these irregular proteins, which could possibly result in a more toxic species. This is the primary route cells use to degrade proteins.&lt;ref name ="rubinsztein"/&gt;
** Decreased proteasome activity is consistent with models in which intracellular protein aggregates form. It is still unknown whether or not these aggregates are a cause or a result of neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;
*'''autophagy–lysosome pathways:''' a form of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD), this becomes the favorable route when a protein is aggregate-prone meaning it is a poor proteasome substrate. This can be split into two forms of autophagy: '''[[macroautophagy]]''' and '''chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)'''.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;
**'''macroautophagy''' is involved with nutrient recycling of macromolecules under conditions of starvation, certain apoptotic pathways, and if absent, leads to the formation of ubiquinated inclusions. Experiments in mice with neuronally confined macroautophagy-gene knockouts develop intraneuronal aggregates leading to neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name ="rubinsztein"/&gt;
**'''chaperone-mediated autophagy''' defects may also lead to neurodegeneration. Research has shown that mutant proteins bind to the CMA-pathway receptors on lysosomal membrane and in doing so block their own degradation as well as the degradation of other substrates.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

====Membrane damage====
Damage to the membranes of organelles by monomeric or oligomeric proteins could also contribute to these diseases. Alpha-synuclein can damage membranes by inducing membrane curvature,&lt;ref name=curvature&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Varkey J, Isas JM, Mizuno N, etal |title=Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=285 |issue=42 |pages=32486–93 |date=October 2010  |pmid=20693280 |pmc=2952250 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M110.139576}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cause extensive tubulation and vesiculation when incubated with artificial phospholipid vesicles.&lt;ref name=curvature/&gt;
[http://www.jbc.org/content/287/35/29301.long The tubes formed from these lipid vesicles consist of both micellar as well as bilayer tubes. Extensive induction of membrane curvature is deleterious  to the cell and would eventually lead to cell death.][http://www.jbc.org/content/288/24/17620.long Apart from tubular structures, alpha-synuclein can also form lipoprotein nanoparticles similar to apolipoproteins.]

====Mitochondrial dysfunction====
The most common form of cell death in neurodegeneration is through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This pathway controls the activation of caspase-9 by regulating the release of [[cytochrome c]] from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are normal byproducts of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. ROS concentration is mediated by mitochondrial antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and [[glutathione peroxidase]]. Over production of ROS ([[oxidative stress]]) is a central feature of all neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the generation of ROS, mitochondria are also involved with life-sustaining functions including calcium homeostasis, PCD, [[mitochondrial fission]] and [[mitochondrial fusion|fusion]], lipid concentration of the mitochondrial membranes, and the mitochondrial permeability transition. Mitochondrial disease leading to neurodegeneration is likely, at least on some level, to involve all of these functions.&lt;ref name = dimauro&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=DiMauro S, Schon EA | title = Mitochondrial disorders in the nervous system| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 91–123| year = 2008| pmid = 18333761| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a causal role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, including in four of the more well known diseases [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Huntington's]], and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].&lt;ref name = lin&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lin MT, Beal MF | title = Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 787–95|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051205| doi = 10.1038/nature05292|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..787L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuron]]s are particularly vulnerable to [[oxidative stress|oxidative damage]] due to their strong metabolic activity associated with high [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] levels, high oxygen consumption, and weak [[antioxidant]] defense.&lt;ref name="pmid28785371"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu Z, Zhou T, Ziegler AC, Dimitrion P, Zuo L |title=Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Diseases: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Applications |journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev |volume=2017 |issue= |pages=2525967 |date=2017 |pmid=28785371 |pmc=5529664 |doi=10.1155/2017/2525967 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27663141"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Dharmalingam P, Vasquez V, Mitra J, Boldogh I, Rao KS, Kent TA, Mitra S, Hegde ML |title=Chronic oxidative damage together with genome repair deficiency in the neurons is a double whammy for neurodegeneration: Is damage response signaling a potential therapeutic target? |journal=Mech.

====DNA Damage====

The brain metabolizes as much as a fifth of consumed oxygen, and [[reactive oxygen species]] produced by oxidative metabolism are a major source of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] in the [[brain]].  Damage to a cell’s [[DNA]] is particularly harmful because DNA is the blueprint for protein production and unlike other molecules it cannot simply be replaced by re-synthesis. The vulnerability of post-mitotic neurons to DNA damage (such as oxidative lesions or certain types of DNA strand breaks), coupled with a gradual decline in the activities of [[DNA repair|repair mechanisms]], could lead to accumulation of DNA damage with age and contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name="pmid25033177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Madabhushi R, Pan L, Tsai LH |title=DNA damage and its links to neurodegeneration |journal=Neuron |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=266–282 |date=July 2014 |pmid=25033177 |pmc=5564444 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.06.034 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA single-strand breaks are common and are associated with the neurodegenerative disease ataxia-[[oculomotor apraxia]].&lt;ref name="pmid21550379"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeppesen DK, Bohr VA, Stevnsner T |title=DNA repair deficiency in neurodegeneration |journal=Prog.

====Axonal transport====
Axonal swelling and spheroids have been observed in many different neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that defective axons are not only present in diseased neurons, but also that they may cause certain pathological insult due to accumulation of organelles. Axonal transport can be disrupted by a variety of mechanisms including damage to: [[kinesin]] and [[cytoplasmic dynein]], [[microtubules]], cargoes, and [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name = devos&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=De Vos KJ, Grierson AJ, Ackerley S, Miller CC | title = Role of axonal transport in neurodegenerative diseases| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 151–73| year = 2008| pmid = 18558852| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090711}}&lt;/ref&gt; When axonal transport is severely disrupted a degenerative pathway known as [[Wallerian degeneration|Wallerian-like degeneration]] is often triggered.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman MP &amp; Freeman MF 'Wallerian degeneration, WldS and Nmnat' Annual Review of Neuroscience 2010, 33: 245-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programmed cell death===
[[Programmed cell death]] ('''PCD''') is death of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] in any form, mediated by an intracellular program.&lt;ref name = engelberg&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Engelberg-Kulka H, Amitai S, Kolodkin-Gal I, Hazan R | title = Bacterial Programmed Cell Death and Multicellular Behavior in Bacteria| journal = PLoS Genetics| volume = 2| issue = 10| pages = e135|date=October 2006| pmid = 17069462| pmc = 1626106| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can be activated in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, amytrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vila|first1=Miquel|last2=Przedbroski|first2=Serge|title=Targeting Programmed Cell Death in Neurodegenrative Diseases|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |doi=10.1038/nrn1100|date=May 2003|volume=4|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, situations in which these mediated pathways are artificially stimulated due to injury or disease.&lt;ref name = bredesen/&gt;

====Apoptosis (type I)====
[[Apoptosis]] is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. It is one of the main types of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD) and involves a series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell morphology and death.

*'''Extrinsic apoptotic pathways:''' Occur when factors outside the cell activate cell surface death receptors (e.g., Fas) that result in the activation of [[caspases]]-8 or -10.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;
*'''Intrinsic apoptotic pathways:''' Result from mitochondrial release of [[cytochrome c]] or endoplasmic reticulum malfunctions, each leading to the activation of caspase-9. The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] are other organelles that have damage sensors, which can lead the cells down apoptotic pathways.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;&lt;ref name = green&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Green DR, Kroemer G | title = Pharmacological manipulation of cell death: clinical applications in sight?| journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation| volume = 115| issue = 10| pages = 2610–7|date=October 2005| pmid = 16200193| pmc = 1236695| doi = 10.1172/JCI26321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caspases]] (cysteine-aspartic acid proteases) cleave at very specific [[amino acid]] residues. There are two types of caspases: '''initiators''' and '''effectors'''. Initiator caspases cleave inactive forms of effector caspases. This activates the effectors that in turn cleave other proteins resulting in apoptotic initiation.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

====Autophagic (type II)====
Autophagy is essentially a form of intracellular [[phagocytosis]] in which a cell actively consumes damaged organelles or misfolded proteins by encapsulating them into an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome to destroy the contents of the autophagosome. Many neurodegenerative diseases show unusual protein aggregates. This could potentially be a result of underlying autophagic defect common to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that this is a hypothesis, and more research must be done.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

====Cytoplasmic (type III)====
The final and least understood PCD mechanism is through non-apoptotic processes. These fall under Type III, or cytoplasmic cell death. Many other forms of PCD are observed but not fully understood or accepted by the scientific community. For example, PCD might be caused by trophotoxicity, or hyperactivation of trophic factor receptors. In addition to this, other cytotoxins that induce PCD at low concentrations act to cause [[necrosis]], or aponecrosis – the combination of apoptosis and necrosis, when in higher concentrations. It is still unclear exactly what combination of apoptosis, non-apoptosis, and necrosis causes different kinds of aponecrosis.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

===PCD===
In the above-mentioned neurodegenerative diseases, PCD may be pathogenic. In order to identify the potential of neuroprotective targets in PCD machinery, there were experimental models conducted on these neurodegenerative diseases. These studies showed that the expression of certain components have been altered by genetic and pharmacological means. Expression of PCD molecular components are said to be controlled by gene and antisense therapy, but this needs further research. Pharmacological approaches involve inhibitors of caspase activity, and caspase inhibition might delay cell death in the different experimental models.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;

===Transglutaminase===

[[Transglutaminase]]s are human [[enzymes]] [[ubiquitously]] present in the human body and in the brain in particular.&lt;ref name="caccamo"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Caccamo D, etal| title = Critical role of transglutaminase and other stress proteins during neurodegenerative processes| journal = Amino Acids| volume = 38| issue = | pages = 653–8|date=2010| pmid = 19960212| doi = 10.1007/s00726-009-0428-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main function of [[transglutaminases]] is [[Molecular binding|bind]] proteins and peptides intra- and intermolecularly, by a type of [[covalent bonds]] termed [[isopeptide bond]]s, in a reaction termed [[Isopeptide bond|transamidation]] or [[Isopeptide bond|crosslinking]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

[[Transglutaminase]] [[Chemical bond|binding]] of these proteins and peptides make them clump together. The resulting structures are turned extremely resistant to chemical and mechanical disruption.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

Most relevant human neurodegenerative diseases share the property of having [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures made up of proteins and peptides]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

Each of these neurodegenerative disesases have one (or several) specific main protein or peptide. In [[Alzheimer's disease]], these are [[amyloid-beta]] and [[tau]]. In [[Parkinson’s]] disease, it is [[alpha-synuclein]]. In [[Huntington’s]] disease, it is [[huntingtin]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''[[Transglutaminase]] [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]]:'''
[[Amyloid-beta]], [[tau]], [[alpha-synuclein]] and [[huntingtin]] have been proved to be [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] of [[transglutaminases]] in vitro or in vivo, that is, they can be [[Chemical bond|bonded]] by trasglutaminases by [[covalent bonds]] to each other and potentially to any other transglutaminase substrate in the brain.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''[[Transglutaminase]] augmented expression:'''
It has been proved that in these neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease) the [[Gene expression|expression]] of the [[transglutaminase]] [[enzyme]] is increased.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''Presence of [[isopeptide bond]]s in these structures:'''
The presence of [[isopeptide bond]]s (the result of the [[transglutaminase]] reaction) have been detected in the [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures that are characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''Co-localization:'''
Co-localization of transglutaminase mediated [[isopeptide bond]]s with these [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures]] has been detected in the autopsy of brains of patients with these diseases.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

==Specific disorders==

===Alzheimer's disease===
[[File:Alzheimer's Disease.gif|thumb|Normal cerebral cortex vs Alzheimer's disease]]
{{main|Alzheimer's disease}}

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross [[atrophy]] of the affected regions, including degeneration in the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], and parts of the [[frontal cortex]] and [[cingulate gyrus]].&lt;ref name="pmid12934968"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wenk GL|title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease|journal=J Clin Psychiatry|volume=64 Suppl 9|pages=7–10|year=2003|pmid=12934968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alzheimer's disease has been ''hypothesized'' to be a [[protein folding|protein misfolding]] disease ([[proteopathy]]), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and [[Tau protein|tau proteins]] in the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid14528050"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hashimoto M, Rockenstein E, Crews L, Masliah E |title=Role of protein aggregation in mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases|journal=Neuromolecular Med.|volume=4|issue=1–2|pages=21–36|year=2003|pmid=14528050|doi=10.1385/NMM:4:1-2:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaques are made up of small [[peptide]]s, 39–43&amp;nbsp;amino acids in length, called [[beta-amyloid]] (also written as A-beta or Aβ). Beta-amyloid is a fragment from a larger protein called [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP), a [[transmembrane protein]] that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair.&lt;ref name="pmid16822978"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Priller C, Bauer T, Mitteregger G, Krebs B, Kretzschmar HA, Herms J |title=Synapse formation and function is modulated by the amyloid precursor protein|journal=J.

===Parkinson's disease===
{{main|Parkinson's disease}}

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26718594 | doi=10.1016/j.neurol.2015.09.012 | volume=172 | title=Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease |vauthors=Elbaz A, Carcaillon L, Kab S, Moisan F | journal=Rev Neurol (Paris) | pages=14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries. Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It results from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of cell-death is unknown. The following paragraph is an excerpt from the Pathophysiology section of the article [[Parkinson's disease]].

The mechanism by which the brain cells in Parkinson's are lost ''may'' consist of an abnormal accumulation of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. The [[alpha-synuclein]]-ubiquitin complex cannot be directed to the proteasome.  This [[protein]] accumulation forms proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions called [[Lewy bodies]]. The latest research on pathogenesis of disease has shown that the death of dopaminergic neurons by alpha-synuclein is due to a defect in the machinery that transports proteins between two major cellular organelles – the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Certain proteins like Rab1 may reverse this defect caused by alpha-synuclein in animal models.&lt;ref&gt;"Parkinson's Disease Mechanism Discovered," [http://www.hhmi.org/news/lindquist20060622.html HHMI Research News] June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research suggests that impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein leads to its accumulation in the Lewy bodies. Experiments have revealed reduced transport rates of both wild-type and two familial Parkinson's disease-associated mutant alpha-synucleins through axons of cultured neurons.&lt;ref name = devos /&gt; Membrane damage by alpha-synuclein could be another Parkinson's disease mechanism.&lt;ref name=curvature/&gt;

The main known risk factor is age. Susceptibility genes including α-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK-2), and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have shown that genetic predisposition is another important causal factor.

Mutant [[Huntingtin]] is an aggregate-prone protein. During the cells' natural clearance process, these proteins are retrogradely transported to the cell body for destruction by lysosomes. It is a possibility that these mutant protein aggregates damage the retrograde transport of important cargoes such as [[BDNF]] by damaging molecular motors as well as microtubules.&lt;ref name = devos /&gt;

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)===
{{main|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}}

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) is a disease in which motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration. In 1993, missense mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 ([[SOD1]]) were discovered in subsets of patients with familial ALS. This discovery led researchers to focus on unlocking the mechanisms for SOD1-mediated diseases. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying SOD1 mutant toxicity has yet to be resolved.  More recently, [[TDP-43]] and [[FUS (gene)|FUS]] protein aggregates have been implicated in some cases of the disease, and a mutation in chromosome 9 ([[C9orf72]]) is thought to be the most common known cause of sporadic ALS.

Recent independent research by Nagai et al.&lt;ref name = nagai&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagai M, Re DB, Nagata T, etal | title = Astrocytes expressing ALS-linked mutated SOD1 release factors selectively toxic to motor neurons| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 615–22|date=May 2007| pmid = 17435755| doi = 10.1038/nn1876| pmc = 3799799}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Di Giorgio et al.&lt;ref name ="  digiorgio"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Di Giorgio FP, Carrasco MA, Siao MC, Maniatis T, Eggan K | title = Non–cell autonomous effect of glia on motor neurons in an embryonic stem cell–based ALS model| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 608–14|date=May 2007| pmid = 17435754| doi = 10.1038/nn1885| pmc = 3139463}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide ''in vitro'' evidence that the primary cellular sites where SOD1 mutations act are located on astrocytes. [[Astrocytes]] then cause the toxic effects on the [[motor neurons]]. The specific mechanism of toxicity still needs to be investigated, but the findings are significant because they implicate cells other than neuron cells in neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name ="  julien"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Julien JP| title = ALS: astrocytes move in as deadly neighbors| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 535–7|date=May 2007| pmid = 17453052| doi = 10.1038/nn0507-535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batten disease===
[[Batten disease]] is a rare and fatal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that begins at birth.

==Therapeutics==
The process of neurodegeneration is not well understood, so the diseases that stem from it have, as yet, no cures. In the search for effective treatments (as opposed to [[palliative care]]), investigators employ [[animal model]]s of disease to test potential therapeutic agents. Model organisms provide an inexpensive and relatively quick means to perform two main functions: target identification and target validation. Together, these help show the value of any specific therapeutic strategies and drugs when attempting to ameliorate disease severity. An example is the drug [[Dimebon]] (Medivation). This drug is in phase III clinical trials for use in Alzheimer's disease, and also recently finished phase II clinical trials for use in Huntington's disease.&lt;ref name = marsh /&gt; In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug Dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2387 Dimebon Disappoints in Phase 3 Trial]&lt;/ref&gt; With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for Dimebon (latrepirdine) in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sweetlove M: Phase III CONCERT Trial of Latrepirdine. Negative results. Pharm Med 2012;26(2):113-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment using a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, it was demonstrated that systemic administration of hypothalamic proline-rich peptide (PRP)-1 offers neuroprotective effects and can prevent neurodegeneration in hippocampus [[amyloid-beta]] 25–35. This suggests that there could be therapeutic value to PRP-1.&lt;ref name = galoyan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galoyan AA, Sarkissian JS, Chavushyan VA, etal | title = Neuroprotection by hypothalamic peptide proline-rich peptide-1 in Aβ25–35 model of Alzheimer's disease| journal = Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 332–44|date=September 2008| pmid = 18790460| doi = 10.1016/j.jalz.2007.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein degradation offers therapeutic options both in preventing the synthesis and degradation of irregular proteins. There is also interest in upregulating autophagy to help clear protein aggregates implicated in neurodegeneration. Both of these options involve very complex pathways that we are only beginning to understand.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

The goal of [[immunotherapy]] is to enhance aspects of the immune system. Both active and passive vaccinations  have been proposed for Alzheimer's disease and other conditions, however more research must be done to prove safety and efficacy in humans.&lt;ref name = brody&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brody DL, Holtzman DM | title = Active and Passive Immunotherapy for Neurodegenerative Disorders| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 175–93| year = 2008| pmid = 18352830| pmc = 2561172| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optical fibers typically include a [[Core (optical fiber)|core]] surrounded by a transparent [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]] material with a lower [[index of refraction]]. Light is kept in the core by the phenomenon of [[total internal reflection]] which causes the fiber to act as a [[waveguide]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Senior|Senior]], pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; Fibers that support many propagation paths or [[transverse mode]]s are called [[multi-mode fiber]]s, while those that support a single mode are called [[single-mode fiber]]s (SMF). Multi-mode fibers generally have a wider core diameter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFMiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Multi-mode+fibers+generally+have+a+wider+core+diameter+and+are+used+for+short-distance+communication+links&amp;dq=Multi-mode+fibers+generally+have+a+wider+core+diameter+and+are+used+for+short-distance+communication+links&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidtri8xZrVAhUGz2MKHXIjAgQ4ChDoAQglMAA|title=The Optical Industry &amp; Systems Purchasing Directory|date=1984|publisher=Optical Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are used for short-distance communication links and for applications where high power must be transmitted.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Single-mode fibers are used for most communication links longer than {{convert|1000|sp=us|m|ft}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Being able to join optical fibers with low loss is important in fiber optic communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Senior|Senior]], p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; This is more complex than joining electrical wire or cable and involves careful [[Cleave (fiber)|cleaving]] of the fibers, precise alignment of the fiber cores, and the coupling of these aligned cores. For applications that demand a permanent connection a [[Fusion splicing|fusion splice]] is common. In this technique, an electric arc is used to  melt the ends of the fibers together. Another common technique is a [[mechanical splice]], where the ends of the fibers are held in contact by mechanical force. Temporary or semi-permanent connections are made by means of specialized [[optical fiber connector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Senior|Senior]], pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of applied science and engineering concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known as '''fiber optics'''. The term was coined by Indian physicist [[Narinder Singh Kapany]], who is widely acknowledged as the father of fiber optics.&lt;ref name="southasia.ucsc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southasia.ucsc.edu/endowed-chairs/narinder-singh-kapany.html|title=Narinder Singh Kapany Chair in Opto-electronics|publisher=ucsc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guiding of light by refraction, the principle that makes fiber optics possible, was first demonstrated by [[Jean-Daniel Colladon|Daniel Colladon]] and [[Jacques Babinet]] in [[Paris]] in the early 1840s. [[John Tyndall]] included a demonstration of it in his public lectures in [[London]], 12 years later.&lt;ref name=regis&gt;{{cite book

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, light was guided through bent glass rods to illuminate body cavities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa980407.htm The Birth of Fiber Optics]. inventors.about.com&lt;/ref&gt; Practical applications such as close internal illumination during dentistry appeared early in the twentieth century. Image transmission through tubes was demonstrated independently by the radio experimenter [[Clarence Hansell]] and the television pioneer [[John Logie Baird]] in the 1920s. In the 1930s, [[Heinrich Lamm]] showed that one could transmit images through a bundle of unclad optical fibers and used it for internal medical examinations, but his work was largely forgotten.&lt;ref name=regis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hecht2004/&gt;

In 1953, Dutch scientist Bram van Heel first demonstrated image transmission through bundles of optical fibers with a transparent cladding.&lt;ref name=Hecht2004&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Hecht |title=City of Light: The Story of Fiber Optics |publisher=Oxford University |edition=revised |date=2004 |isbn=9780195162554 |pages=55–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Harold Hopkins (physicist)|Harold Hopkins]] and [[Narinder Singh Kapany]] at [[Imperial College]] in London succeeded in making image-transmitting bundles with over 10,000 fibers, and subsequently achieved image transmission through a 75&amp;nbsp;cm long bundle which combined several thousand fibers.&lt;ref name=Hecht2004/&gt; Their article titled "A flexible fibrescope, using static scanning" was published in the journal ''Nature'' in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hopkins, H.

In the process of developing the gastroscope, Curtiss produced the first glass-clad fibers; previous optical fibers had relied on air or impractical oils and waxes as the low-index cladding material. A variety of other image transmission applications soon followed.

Kapany coined the term ''fiber optics'', wrote a 1960 article in ''Scientific American'' that introduced the topic to a wide audience, and wrote the first book about the new field.&lt;ref name=Hecht2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/oct/08/how-india-missed-another-nobel-prize.htm How India missed another Nobel Prize – Rediff.com India News].

The first working fiber-optical data transmission system was demonstrated by German physicist [[Manfred Börner]] at [[Telefunken]] Research Labs in Ulm in 1965, which was followed by the first patent application for this technology in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = DE | number = 1254513 | status = patent | title = Mehrstufiges Übertragungssystem für Pulscodemodulation dargestellte Nachrichten. | gdate = 1967-11-16 | inventor = Börner, Manfred | assign1 = Telefunken Patentverwertungsgesellschaft m.b.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 3845293 | status = patent | title = Electro-optical transmission system utilizing lasers| inventor = Börner, Manfred }}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA used fiber optics in the television cameras that were sent to the moon.

[[Charles K. Kao]] and [[George A. Hockham]] of the British company [[Standard Telephones and Cables]] (STC) were the first, in 1965, to promote the idea that the [[attenuation]] in optical fibers could be reduced below 20 [[decibel]]s per kilometer (dB/km), making fibers a practical communication medium.&lt;ref name=hecht1999&gt;{{cite book

They correctly and systematically theorized the light-loss properties for optical fiber, and pointed out the right material to use for such fibers—silica glass with high purity. This discovery earned Kao the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/press.html|title=Press Release&amp;nbsp;— Nobel Prize in Physics 2009|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially high-quality optical fibers could only be manufactured at 2 meters per second. Chemical engineer [[Thomas Mensah]] joined Corning in 1983 and increased the speed of manufacture to over 50 meters per second, making optical fiber cables cheaper than traditional copper ones.&lt;ref name=RSCiB&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Author – Thomas Mensah |url=http://rightstuffcomesinblack.com/about-the-author-dr-thomas-mensah |publisher=The Right Stuff Comes in Black |accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations ushered in the era of optical fiber telecommunication.

The Italian research center [[CSELT]] worked with Corning to develop practical optical fiber cables, resulting in the first metropolitan fiber optic cable being deployed in Turin in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Catania, B., et al.

Attenuation in modern optical cables is far less than in electrical copper cables, leading to long-haul fiber connections with repeater distances of {{convert|70|–|150|km|mi|sp=us}}. The [[erbium-doped fiber amplifier]], which reduced the cost of long-distance fiber systems by reducing or eliminating optical-electrical-optical repeaters, was co-developed by teams led by [[David N.

== Uses ==

=== Communication ===
{{Main|Fiber-optic communication}}
Optical fiber is used as a medium for telecommunication and [[computer network]]ing because it is flexible and can be bundled as cables. It is especially advantageous for long-distance communications, because light propagates through the fiber with much lower [[attenuation]] compared to electrical cables. This allows long distances to be spanned with few [[optical communications repeater|repeaters]].

The per-channel light signals propagating in the fiber have been modulated at rates as high as 111 [[gigabit per second|gigabits per second]] (Gbit/s) by [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntt.co.jp/news/news06e/0609/060929a.html 14 Tbps over a Single Optical Fiber]: Successful Demonstration of World's Largest Capacity – 145 digital high-definition movies transmitted in one second.

Each fiber can carry many independent channels, each using a different wavelength of light ([[wavelength-division multiplexing]] (WDM)). The net data rate (data rate without overhead bytes) per fiber is the per-channel data rate reduced by the FEC overhead, multiplied by the number of channels (usually up to 80 in commercial [[dense WDM]] systems {{As of|2008|lc=on}}). {{As of|2011}} the record for bandwidth on a single core was 101 Tbit/s (370 channels at 273 Gbit/s each).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2009, Bell Labs broke the 100 (Pbit/s)·km barrier (15.5 Tbit/s over a single 7,000&amp;nbsp;km fiber).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news173455192.html/ Bell Labs breaks optical transmission record, 100 Petabit per second kilometer barrier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009052534/http://www.physorg.com/news173455192.html/ |date=October 9, 2009 }}.

For short-distance applications, such as a network in an office building (see [[Fibre to the office|FTTO]]), fiber-optic cabling can save space in cable ducts. This is because a single fiber can carry much more data than electrical cables such as standard [[Cat-5|category 5]] Ethernet cabling, which typically runs at 100 Mbit/s or 1 Gbit/s speeds. Fiber is also immune to electrical interference; there is no cross-talk between signals in different cables, and no pickup of environmental noise. Non-armored fiber cables do not conduct electricity, which makes fiber a good solution for protecting communications equipment in [[high voltage]] environments, such as [[power generation]] facilities, or metal communication structures prone to [[lightning]] strikes. They can also be used in environments where explosive fumes are present, without danger of ignition. [[Wiretapping]] (in this case, [[fiber tapping]]) is more difficult compared to electrical connections, and there are concentric dual-core fibers that are said to be tap-proof.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Fibers are often also used for short-distance connections between devices. For example, most [[high-definition television]]s offer a digital audio optical connection. This allows the streaming of audio over light, using the [[TOSLINK]] protocol.

==== Advantages over copper wiring ====
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The advantages of optical fiber communication with respect to copper wire systems are:
* '''Broad bandwidth''': A single optical fiber can carry over 3,000,000 [[duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]] voice calls or 90,000 TV channels.
* '''Immunity to electromagnetic interference:''' Light transmission through optical fibers is unaffected by other [[electromagnetic radiation]] nearby. The optical fiber is electrically non-conductive, so it does not act as an antenna to pick up electromagnetic signals. Information traveling inside the optical fiber is immune to [[electromagnetic interference]], even [[electromagnetic pulse]]s generated by nuclear devices.
* '''Low attenuation loss over long distances:''' Attenuation loss can be as low as 0.2&amp;nbsp;dB/km in optical fiber cables, allowing transmission over long distances without the need for [[repeater]]s.
* '''Electrical insulator:''' Optical fibers do not conduct electricity, preventing problems with [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] and conduction of [[lightning]]. Optical fibers can be strung on poles alongside high voltage power cables.
* '''Material cost and theft prevention:''' Conventional cable systems use large amounts of copper. Global copper prices experienced [[2000s commodities boom#Copper|a boom]] in the 2000s, and copper has been a target of [[metal theft]].
* '''Security of information passed down the cable:''' Copper can be tapped with very little chance of detection.

=== Sensors ===
{{Main|Fiber optic sensor}}
Fibers have many uses in remote sensing. In some applications, the sensor is itself an optical fiber. In other cases, fiber is used to connect a non-fiberoptic sensor to a measurement system. Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, or the fact that no [[electrical power]] is needed at the remote location, or because many sensors can be [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] along the length of a fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an ''[[optical time-domain reflectometer]]''.

Optical fibers can be used as sensors to measure [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]], [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the property to measure modulates the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], [[phase (waves)|phase]], [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[wavelength]], or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of such fiber optic sensors is that they can, if required, provide distributed sensing over distances of up to one meter. In contrast, highly localized measurements can be provided by integrating miniaturized sensing elements with the tip of the fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Extrinsic fiber optic sensors use an [[optical fiber cable]], normally a multi-mode one, to transmit [[modulation|modulated]] light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is their ability to reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside [[aircraft]] [[jet engine]]s by using a fiber to transmit [[radiation]] into a radiation [[pyrometer]] outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors can be used in the same way to measure the internal temperature of [[electrical transformer]]s, where the extreme [[electromagnetic field]]s present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and torsion. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The [[fiber optic gyroscope]] (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the [[Sagnac effect]] to detect mechanical rotation.

Common uses for fiber optic sensors includes advanced intrusion detection security systems. The light is transmitted along a fiber optic sensor cable placed on a fence, pipeline, or communication cabling, and the returned signal is monitored and analyzed for disturbances. This return signal is digitally processed to detect disturbances and trip an alarm if an intrusion has occurred.

Optical fibers are widely used as components of optical chemical sensors and optical [[biosensors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Florinel-Gabriel |last=Bănică |title=Chemical Sensors and Biosensors: Fundamentals and Applications |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=Chichester |year=2012 |at= Ch. 18–20 |isbn=978-0-470-71066-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power transmission ===
Optical fiber can be used to transmit power using a [[photovoltaic cell]] to convert the light into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/electricity-over-glass IEEE Spectrum: Electricity Over Glass]. IEEE Spectrum. October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While this method of power transmission is not as efficient as conventional ones, it is especially useful in situations where it is desirable not to have a metallic conductor as in the case of use near MRI machines, which produce strong magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.electronicproducts.com/Photovoltaic_feat_advances_power_over_optical_fiber-article-olap01-jun2006-html.aspx Photovoltaic feat advances power over optical fiber – Electronic Products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718095104/http://www2.electronicproducts.com/Photovoltaic_feat_advances_power_over_optical_fiber-article-olap01-jun2006-html.aspx |date=July 18, 2011 }}. 06/01/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are for powering electronics in high-powered antenna elements and measurement devices used in high-voltage transmission equipment.

[[File:OpticFiber.jpg|thumb|left|Light reflected from optical fiber illuminates exhibited model]]

Optical fibers have a wide number of applications. They are used as [[light tube|light guides]] in medical and other applications where bright light needs to be shone on a target without a clear line-of-sight path. In some buildings, optical fibers route sunlight from the roof to other parts of the building (see [[nonimaging optics]]). [[Optical-fiber lamp]]s are used for illumination in decorative applications, including [[Commercial signage|signs]], [[art]], toys and artificial [[Christmas tree]]s.  Optical fiber is an intrinsic part of the light-transmitting concrete building product [[LiTraCon]].

Optical fiber can also be used in [[structural health monitoring]]. This type of [[sensor]] is able to detect stresses that may have a lasting impact on [[structures]]. It is based on the principle of measuring analog attenuation.

[[File:Use of optical fiber in a lamp..JPG|thumb|Use of optical fiber in a decorative lamp or nightlight]]
Optical fiber is also used in imaging optics. A coherent bundle of fibers is used, sometimes along with lenses, for a long, thin imaging device called an [[endoscope]], which is used to view objects through a small hole. Medical endoscopes are used for minimally invasive exploratory or surgical procedures. Industrial endoscopes (see [[fiberscope]] or [[borescope]]) are used for inspecting anything hard to reach, such as jet engine interiors. Many [[microscopes]] use fiber-optic light sources to provide intense illumination of samples being studied.

In [[spectroscopy]], optical fiber bundles transmit light from a spectrometer to a substance that cannot be placed inside the spectrometer itself, in order to analyze its composition. A spectrometer analyzes substances by bouncing light off and through them. By using fibers, a spectrometer can be used to study objects remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In situ real-time monitoring of a fermentation reaction using a fiber-optic FT-IR probe |journal=Spectroscopy |date=June 2001 |first=Zaid |last=Al Mosheky |author2=Melling, Peter J.  |author3=Thomson, Mary A.  |url=http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/SP5619.pdf |format=PDF|volume= 16|issue =6|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reaction monitoring in small reactors and tight spaces |first=Peter |last=Melling |author2=Thomson, Mary |journal=American Laboratory News |date=October 2002 |url=http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/amlab1002.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fiber-optic probes for mid-infrared spectrometry |first=Peter J. |last=Melling |author2=Thomson, Mary |title=Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy |editor1=Chalmers, John M.|editor2=Griffiths, Peter R.|publisher=Wiley |year=2002 |url=http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/2703_o.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An optical fiber [[dopant|doped]] with certain [[rare-earth element]]s such as [[erbium]] can be used as the [[gain medium]] of a [[fiber laser|laser]] or [[optical amplifier]]. Rare-earth-doped optical fibers can be used to provide signal [[amplifier|amplification]] by splicing a short section of doped fiber into a regular (undoped) optical fiber line. The doped fiber is [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] with a second laser wavelength that is coupled into the line in addition to the signal wave. Both wavelengths of light are transmitted through the doped fiber, which transfers energy from the second pump wavelength to the signal wave. The process that causes the amplification is [[stimulated emission]].

Optical fiber is also widely exploited as a nonlinear medium. The glass medium supports a host of nonlinear optical interactions, and the long interaction lengths possible in fiber facilitate a variety of phenomena, which are harnessed for applications and fundamental investigation.&lt;ref name="Agrawal2012"&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-12-397023-7 | title = Nonlinear Fiber Optics, Fifth Edition | last1 = Govind | first1 = Agrawal | year = &lt;!--replace this comment with the publication year--&gt;  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, fiber nonlinearity can have deleterious effects on optical signals, and measures are often required to minimize such unwanted effects.

Optical fibers doped with a [[wavelength shifter]] collect [[scintillator|scintillation]] light in [[physics experiment]]s.

[[Iron sights#Fiber optic|Fiber-optic sights]] for handguns, rifles, and shotguns use pieces of optical fiber to improve visibility of markings on the sight.

== Principle of operation ==
[[File:Fiber-engineerguy.ogv|thumb|An overview of the operating principles of the optical fiber]]
An optical fiber is a cylindrical [[dielectric waveguide]] ([[insulator (electrical)|nonconducting]] waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, by the process of [[total internal reflection]]. The fiber consists of a ''core'' surrounded by a [[cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]] layer, both of which are made of [[dielectric]] materials.&lt;ref name=RPP /&gt; To confine the optical signal in the core, the [[refractive index]] of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in ''[[step-index profile|step-index fiber]]'', or gradual, in ''[[graded-index fiber]]''.

=== Index of refraction ===
{{Main|Refractive index}}
The index of refraction (or refractive index) is a way of measuring the [[speed of light]] in a material. Light travels fastest in a [[vacuum]], such as in outer space. The speed of light in a vacuum is about 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. The refractive index of a medium is calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in that medium. The refractive index of a vacuum is therefore 1, by definition. A typical singlemode fiber used for telecommunications has a cladding made of pure silica, with an index of 1.444 at 1500&amp;nbsp;nm, and a core of doped silica with an index around 1.4475.&lt;ref name=RPP&gt;{{cite web  |title=Fibers |url=https://www.rp-photonics.com/fibers.html |work=[[Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology]] |publisher=RP Photonics |first=Rüdiger |last=Paschotta |accessdate=Feb 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger the index of refraction, the slower light travels in that medium. From this information, a simple rule of thumb is that a signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200,000 [[kilometers]] per second. To put it another way, the signal will take 5 [[milliseconds]] to travel 1,000 kilometers in fiber. Thus a phone call carried by fiber between Sydney and New York, a 16,000-kilometer distance, means that there is a minimum delay of 80 milliseconds (about &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{12}&lt;/math&gt; of a second) between when one caller speaks and the other hears. (The fiber in this case will probably travel a longer route, and there will be additional delays due to communication equipment switching and the process of encoding and decoding the voice onto the fiber).

Most modern optical fiber is ''weakly guiding'', meaning that the difference in refractive index between the core and the cladding is very small (typically less than 1%).&lt;ref name="Gloge1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gloge|first1=D.|date=1 October 1971|title=Weakly Guiding Fibers|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/view_article.cfm?gotourl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eopticsinfobase%2Eorg%2FDirectPDFAccess%2F783D95CC-E3F4-15BC-A695C10530FC7545_73014%2Fao-10-10-2252%2Epdf%3Fda%3D1%26id%3D73014%26seq%3D0%26mobile%3Dno&amp;org=|journal=Applied Optics|volume=10|issue=10|page=2252|bibcode=1971ApOpt..10.2252G|doi=10.1364/AO.10.002252|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Total internal reflection ===
{{Main|Total internal reflection}}
When light traveling in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] for the boundary), the light is completely reflected. This is called total internal reflection. This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the fiber core, bouncing back and forth off the boundary between the core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the [[acceptance cone]] of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone is a function of the refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.

In simpler terms, there is a maximum angle from the fiber axis at which light may enter the fiber so that it will propagate, or travel, in the core of the fiber. The [[sine]] of this maximum angle is the [[numerical aperture]] (NA) of the fiber. Fiber with a larger NA requires less precision to splice and work with than fiber with a smaller NA. Single-mode fiber has a small NA.

=== Multi-mode fiber ===
[[File:Optical-fibre.svg|thumb|The propagation of light through a [[multi-mode optical fiber]].]]
[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A laser bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]
{{Main|Multi-mode optical fiber}}
Fiber with large core diameter (greater than 10&amp;nbsp;micrometers) may be analyzed by [[geometrical optics]]. Such fiber is called ''multi-mode fiber'', from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, [[ray (optics)|rays]] of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays that meet the core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line [[surface normal|normal]] to the boundary), greater than the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) is determined by the difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the [[core (optical fiber)|core]] into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the [[guided ray|acceptance angle]] of the fiber, often reported as a [[numerical aperture]]. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] as rays at different angles have different [[optical path length|path lengths]] and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.

[[File:Optical fiber types.svg|thumb|Optical fiber types.]]In graded-index fiber, the index of refraction in the core decreases continuously between the axis and the cladding. This causes light rays to bend smoothly as they approach the cladding, rather than reflecting abruptly from the core-cladding boundary. The resulting curved paths reduce multi-path dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower-index periphery of the core, rather than the high-index center. The index profile is chosen to minimize the difference in axial propagation speeds of the various rays in the fiber. This ideal index profile is very close to a [[parabola|parabolic]] relationship between the index and the distance from the axis.

=== Single-mode fiber ===

{{Main|Single-mode optical fiber}}
Fiber with a core diameter less than about ten times the [[wavelength]] of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] structure, by solution of [[Maxwell's equations]] as reduced to the [[electromagnetic wave equation]]. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined [[transverse mode]]s by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called ''single-mode'' or ''mono-mode fiber''. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core is large enough to support more than a few modes.

The waveguide analysis shows that the light energy in the fiber is not completely confined in the core. Instead, especially in single-mode fibers, a significant fraction of the energy in the bound mode travels in the cladding as an [[evanescent wave]].

The most common type of single-mode fiber has a core diameter of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the [[near infrared]]. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The [[normalized frequency (fiber optics)|normalized frequency]] ''V'' for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the [[Bessel function]] ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (approximately 2.405).

=== Special-purpose fiber ===
Some special-purpose optical fiber is constructed with a non-cylindrical core and/or cladding layer, usually with an elliptical or rectangular cross-section. These include [[polarization-maintaining optical fiber|polarization-maintaining fiber]] and fiber designed to suppress [[whispering gallery mode]] propagation. Polarization-maintaining fiber is a unique type of fiber that is commonly used in fiber optic sensors due to its ability to maintain the polarization of the light inserted into it.

[[Photonic-crystal fiber]] is made with a regular pattern of index variation (often in the form of cylindrical holes that run along the length of the fiber). Such fiber uses [[diffraction]] effects instead of or in addition to total internal reflection, to confine light to the fiber's core. The properties of the fiber can be tailored to a wide variety of applications.

== Mechanisms of attenuation ==
[[File:Zblan transmit.jpg|thumb|Light attenuation by [[ZBLAN]] and silica fibers]]
{{Main|Transparent materials}}
Attenuation in fiber optics, also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.
Empirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both [[scattering]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17&amp;nbsp;dB/km at 1550&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="CorningSMF28ULL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corning.com/opticalfiber/products/SMF-28_ULL_fiber.aspx |title=Corning SMF-28 ULL optical fiber|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an 8&amp;nbsp;km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550&amp;nbsp;nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one could see all the way to the bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.&lt;ref name="Jachetta2007"&gt;{{cite book |last= Williams |first=E. A. (ed.) |year=2007 |title=National Association of Broadcasters Engineering Handbook (Tenth Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |pages=1667–1685  (Chapter 6.10 – Fiber–Optic Transmission Systems, Jim Jachetta)|isbn=978-0-240-80751-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light scattering ===
[[File:Reflection angles.svg|thumb|Specular reflection]]
[[File:Diffuse reflection.PNG|thumb|Diffuse reflection]]
The propagation of light through the core of an optical fiber is based on total internal reflection of the lightwave. Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level, can cause light rays to be reflected in random directions. This is called [[diffuse reflection]] or [[light scattering|scattering]], and it is typically characterized by wide variety of reflection angles.

[[Light scattering]] depends on the [[wavelength]] of the light being scattered. Thus, limits to spatial scales of visibility arise, depending on the frequency of the incident light-wave and the physical dimension (or spatial scale) of the scattering center, which is typically in the form of some specific micro-structural feature. Since [[visible spectrum|visible]] light has a wavelength of the order of one [[micrometre|micrometer]] (one millionth of a meter) scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale.

Thus, attenuation results from the [[incoherent scatter]]ing of light at internal [[interface (chemistry)|surfaces and interfaces]]. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of [[transparent ceramics|transparent ceramic materials]].

Similarly, the scattering of light in optical quality glass fiber is caused by molecular level irregularities (compositional fluctuations) in the glass structure. Indeed, one emerging school of thought is that a glass is simply the limiting case of a polycrystalline solid. Within this framework, "domains" exhibiting various degrees of short-range order become the building blocks of both metals and alloys, as well as glasses and ceramics. Distributed both between and within these domains are micro-structural defects that provide the most ideal locations for light scattering. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of IR missile domes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Archibald, P.S.  |author2=Bennett, H.E. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Scattering from infrared missile domes|journal=Opt.

At high optical powers, scattering can also be caused by nonlinear optical processes in the fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.11.002489|title=Optical Power Handling Capacity of Low Loss Optical Fibers as Determined by Stimulated Raman and Brillouin Scattering|year=1972|last1=Smith|first1=R.

=== UV-Vis-IR absorption ===
In addition to light scattering, attenuation or signal loss can also occur due to selective absorption of specific wavelengths, in a manner similar to that responsible for the appearance of color. Primary material considerations include both electrons and molecules as follows:
* At the electronic level, it depends on whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or "quantized") such that they can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific wavelength or frequency in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible ranges. This is what gives rise to color.
* At the atomic or molecular level, it depends on the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how close-packed its atoms or molecules are, and whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.

The design of any optically transparent device requires the selection of materials based upon knowledge of its properties and limitations. The [[crystal structure|Lattice]] [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] characteristics observed at the lower frequency regions (mid IR to far-infrared wavelength range) define the long-wavelength transparency limit of the material. They are the result of the interactive [[coupling]] between the motions of thermally induced vibrations of the constituent [[atom]]s and molecules of the solid lattice and the incident light wave radiation. Hence, all materials are bounded by limiting regions of absorption caused by atomic and molecular vibrations (bond-stretching)in the far-infrared (&gt;10&amp;nbsp;µm).

Thus, multi-phonon absorption occurs when two or more phonons simultaneously interact to produce electric dipole moments with which the incident radiation may couple. These dipoles can absorb energy from the incident radiation, reaching a maximum coupling with the radiation when the frequency is equal to the fundamental vibrational mode of the molecular dipole (e.g. Si-O bond) in the far-infrared, or one of its harmonics.

The selective absorption of infrared (IR) light by a particular material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integer multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.

Reflection and transmission of light waves occur because the frequencies of the light waves do not match the natural resonant frequencies of vibration of the objects. When IR light of these frequencies strikes an object, the energy is either reflected or transmitted.

=== Loss budget ===
{{main|Optical power budget}}
Attenuation over a cable run is significantly increased by the inclusion of connectors and splices.  When computing the acceptable attenuation (loss budget) between a transmitter and a receiver one includes: 
* dB loss due to the type and length of fiber optic cable,
* dB loss introduced by connectors, and 
* dB loss introduced by splices.

Connectors typically introduce 0.3&amp;nbsp;dB per connector on well-polished connectors.  Splices typically introduce 0.3&amp;nbsp;dB per splice.

The total loss can be calculated by:
:Loss = dB loss per connector × number of connectors + dB loss per splice × number of splices + dB loss per kilometer × kilometers of fiber,

where the dB loss per kilometer is a function of the type of fiber and can be found in the manufacturer's specifications.  For example, typical 1550&amp;nbsp;nm single mode fiber has a loss of 0.4&amp;nbsp;dB per kilometer.

The calculated loss budget is used when testing to confirm that the measured loss is within the normal operating parameters.

== Manufacturing ==

=== Materials ===
Glass optical fibers are almost always made from [[silica]], but some other materials, such as [[fluoride glass|fluorozirconate]], [[fluoride glass|fluoroaluminate]], and [[chalcogenide glass]]es as well as crystalline materials like [[sapphire]], are used for longer-wavelength infrared or other specialized applications. Silica and fluoride glasses usually have refractive indices of about 1.5, but some materials such as the [[chalcogenide]]s can have indices as high as 3. Typically the index difference between core and cladding is less than one percent.

[[Plastic optical fiber]]s (POF) are commonly step-index multi-mode fibers with a core diameter of 0.5 millimeters or larger. POF typically have higher attenuation coefficients than glass fibers, 1&amp;nbsp;dB/m or higher, and this high attenuation limits the range of POF-based systems.

==== Silica ====
[[Silica]] exhibits fairly good optical transmission over a wide range of wavelengths. In the [[near-infrared]] (near IR) portion of the spectrum, particularly around 1.5 μm, silica can have extremely low absorption and scattering losses of the order of 0.2&amp;nbsp;dB/km. Such remarkably low losses are possible only because ultra-pure silicon is available, it being essential for manufacturing integrated circuits and discrete transistors. A high transparency in the 1.4-μm region is achieved by maintaining a low concentration of [[hydroxyl group]]s (OH). Alternatively, a high OH [[concentration]] is better for transmission in the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Skuja | first1 = L. | last2 = Hirano | first2 = M. | last3 = Hosono | first3 = H. | last4 = Kajihara | first4 = K. | title = Defects in oxide glasses | doi = 10.1002/pssc.200460102 | journal = Physica Status Solidi C | volume = 2 | pages = 15–24 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2005PSSCR...2...15S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silica can be drawn into fibers at reasonably high temperatures, and has a fairly broad [[glass transformation range]]. One other advantage is that fusion splicing and cleaving of silica fibers is relatively effective. Silica fiber also has high mechanical strength against both pulling and even bending, provided that the fiber is not too thick and that the surfaces have been well prepared during processing. Even simple cleaving (breaking) of the ends of the fiber can provide nicely flat surfaces with acceptable optical quality. Silica is also relatively [[chemically inert]]. In particular, it is not [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] (does not absorb water).

Silica glass can be doped with various materials. One purpose of doping is to raise the [[refractive index]] (e.g. with [[germanium dioxide]] (GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[aluminium oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)) or to lower it (e.g. with [[fluorine]] or [[boron trioxide]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)). Doping is also possible with laser-active ions (for example, rare-earth-doped fibers) in order to obtain active fibers to be used, for example, in fiber amplifiers or [[laser]] applications. Both the fiber core and cladding are typically doped, so that the entire assembly (core and cladding) is effectively the same compound (e.g. an [[aluminosilicate]], germanosilicate, phosphosilicate or [[borosilicate glass]]).

Particularly for active fibers, pure silica is usually not a very suitable host glass, because it exhibits a low solubility for rare-earth ions. This can lead to quenching effects due to clustering of dopant ions. Aluminosilicates are much more effective in this respect.

Silica fiber also exhibits a high threshold for optical damage. This property ensures a low tendency for laser-induced breakdown. This is important for fiber amplifiers when utilized for the amplification of short pulses.

Because of these properties silica fibers are the material of choice in many optical applications, such as communications (except for very short distances with plastic optical fiber), fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, and fiber-optic sensors.

==== Fluoride glass ====
[[Fluoride glass]] is a class of non-oxide optical quality glasses composed of [[fluoride]]s of various [[metal]]s. Because of their low [[viscosity]], it is very difficult to completely avoid [[crystallization]] while processing it through the glass transition (or drawing the fiber from the melt). Thus, although [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] fluoride glasses (HMFG) exhibit very low optical attenuation, they are not only difficult to manufacture, but are quite fragile, and have poor resistance to moisture and other environmental attacks. Their best attribute is that they lack the absorption band associated with the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) group (3,200–3,600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; i.e., 2,777–3,125&amp;nbsp;nm or 2.78–3.13 μm), which is present in nearly all oxide-based glasses.

An example of a heavy metal fluoride glass is the [[ZBLAN]] glass group, composed of [[zirconium]], [[barium]], [[lanthanum]], [[aluminium]], and [[sodium]] fluorides. Their main technological application is as [[optical waveguide]]s in both planar and fiber form. They are advantageous especially in the [[mid-infrared]] (2,000–5,000&amp;nbsp;nm) range.

HMFGs were initially slated for optical fiber applications, because the intrinsic losses of a mid-IR fiber could in principle be lower than those of silica fibers, which are transparent only up to about 2 μm. However, such low losses were never realized in practice, and the fragility and high cost of fluoride fibers made them less than ideal as primary candidates. Later, the utility of fluoride fibers for various other applications was discovered. These include mid-[[IR spectroscopy]], [[fiber optic sensor]]s, [[thermometry]], and [[optical imaging|imaging]]. Also, fluoride fibers can be used for guided lightwave transmission in media such as YAG ([[yttrium aluminium garnet]]) [[laser]]s at 2.9 μm, as required for medical applications (e.g. [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JLT.1984.1073661|author=Tran, D.|title=Heavy metal fluoride glasses and fibers: A review|journal=J.

[[Phosphate glass]] constitutes a class of optical glasses composed of [[metaphosphate]]s of various metals. Instead of the SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;!-- I don't think there is an SiO4 --&gt; [[tetrahedra]] observed in silicate glasses, the building block for this glass former is [[phosphorus pentoxide]] (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which crystallizes in at least four different forms. The most familiar [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] (see figure) comprises molecules of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

Phosphate glasses can be advantageous over silica glasses for optical fibers with a high concentration of doping rare-earth ions. A mix of fluoride glass and phosphate glass is fluorophosphate glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-3093(01)00615-9|title=Mechanical and structural properties of phosphate glasses|year=2001|last1=Karabulut|first1=M.|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|volume=288|pages=8–17|bibcode=2001JNCS..288....8K|last2=Melnik|first2=E.|last3=Stefan|first3=R|last4=Marasinghe|first4=G.

==== Chalcogenide glass ====
The [[chalcogen]]s—the elements in [[group (periodic table)|group 16]] of the [[periodic table]]—particularly [[sulfur]] (S), [[selenium]] (Se) and [[tellurium]] (Te)—react with more [[electropositive]] elements, such as [[silver]], to form [[chalcogenides]]. These are extremely versatile compounds, in that they can be crystalline or amorphous, metallic or semiconducting, and conductors of [[ion]]s or [[electron]]s. [[Chalcogenide glass|Glass containing chalcogenides]] can be used to make fibers for far infrared transmission.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== Process ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

==== Preform ====
[[File:OF-MCVD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Illustration of the modified chemical vapor deposition (inside) process]]
Standard optical fibers are made by first constructing a large-diameter "preform" with a carefully controlled refractive index profile, and then "pulling" the preform to form the long, thin optical fiber. The preform is commonly made by three [[chemical vapor deposition]] methods: ''inside vapor deposition'', ''outside vapor deposition'', and ''vapor axial deposition''.&lt;ref name=gowar1993&gt;{{cite book|title=Optical communication systems
|last= Gowar

|publisher= Prentice-Hall
|location= Hempstead, UK
|year= 1993
|isbn= 0-13-638727-6
|page= 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''inside vapor deposition'', the preform starts as a hollow glass tube approximately {{convert|40|cm|in|sp=us}} long, which is placed horizontally and rotated slowly on a [[lathe]]. Gases such as [[silicon tetrachloride]] (SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[germanium tetrachloride]] (GeCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are injected with [[oxygen]] in the end of the tube. The gases are then heated by means of an external hydrogen burner, bringing the temperature of the gas up to 1,900&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (1,600&amp;nbsp;°C, 3,000&amp;nbsp;°F), where the tetrachlorides react with oxygen to produce [[silica]] or [[germanium dioxide|germania]] (germanium dioxide) particles. When the reaction conditions are chosen to allow this reaction to occur in the gas phase throughout the tube volume, in contrast to earlier techniques where the reaction occurred only on the glass surface, this technique is called ''[[modified chemical vapor deposition]] (MCVD)''.

The oxide particles then agglomerate to form large particle chains, which subsequently deposit on the walls of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as [[thermophoresis]]). The torch is then traversed up and down the length of the tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has reached the end of the tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. For each layer the composition can be modified by varying the gas composition, resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.

In outside vapor deposition or vapor axial deposition, the glass is formed by ''flame hydrolysis'', a reaction in which silicon tetrachloride and germanium tetrachloride are oxidized by reaction with water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) in an [[oxyhydrogen]] flame. In outside vapor deposition the glass is deposited onto a solid rod, which is removed before further processing. In vapor axial deposition, a short ''seed rod'' is used, and a porous preform, whose length is not limited by the size of the source rod, is built up on its end. The porous preform is consolidated into a transparent, solid preform by heating to about 1,800&amp;nbsp;K (1,500&amp;nbsp;°C, 2,800&amp;nbsp;°F).

[[File:DShaped1.png|right|upright=0.55|thumb|Cross-section of a fiber drawn from a D-shaped '''preform''']]
Typical communications fiber uses a circular preform. For some applications such as [[double-clad fiber]]s another form is preferred.&lt;ref name="Kouznetsov"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly efficient, high-gain, short-length, and power-scalable incoherent diode slab-pumped fiber amplifier/laser| author= Kouznetsov, D.|author2=Moloney, J.V.| journal=[[IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics]]| volume=39 | year=2003 | issue=11 | pages=1452–1461 | doi=10.1109/JQE.2003.818311|bibcode = 2003IJQE...39.1452K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[fiber laser]]s based on double-clad fiber, an asymmetric shape improves the [[filling factor]] for [[laser pumping]].

Because of the surface tension, the shape is smoothed during the drawing process, and the shape of the resulting fiber does not reproduce the sharp edges of the preform. Nevertheless, careful polishing of the preform is important, since any defects of the preform surface affect the optical and mechanical properties of the resulting fiber. In particular, the preform for the test-fiber shown in the figure was not polished well, and cracks are seen with the confocal [[optical microscope]].

==== Drawing ====
The preform, however constructed, is placed in a device known as a [[drawing tower]], where the preform tip is heated and the optical fiber is pulled out as a string. By measuring the resultant fiber width, the tension on the fiber can be controlled to maintain the fiber thickness.

=== Coatings ===
The light is guided down the core of the fiber by an optical cladding with a lower [[refractive index]] that traps light in the core through total internal reflection.

The cladding is coated by a buffer that protects it from moisture and physical damage.&lt;ref name=Kurkjian /&gt; The buffer coating is what gets stripped off the fiber for termination or splicing. These coatings are UV-cured [[urethane acrylate]] composite or [[polyimide]] materials applied to the outside of the fiber during the drawing process. The coatings protect the very delicate strands of glass fiber—about the size of a human hair—and allow it to survive the rigors of manufacturing, proof testing, cabling and installation.

Today’s glass optical fiber draw processes employ a dual-layer coating approach. An inner primary coating is designed to act as a shock absorber to minimize attenuation caused by microbending. An outer secondary coating protects the primary coating against mechanical damage and acts as a barrier to lateral forces, and may be colored to differentiate strands in bundled cable constructions.

These fiber optic coating layers are applied during the fiber draw, at speeds approaching {{convert|100|km/h|mph|-1|sp=us}}. Fiber optic coatings are applied using one of two methods: ''wet-on-dry'' and ''wet-on-wet''. In wet-on-dry, the fiber passes through a primary coating application, which is then UV cured—then through the secondary coating application, which is subsequently cured. In wet-on-wet, the fiber passes through both the primary and secondary coating applications, then goes to UV curing.

Fiber optic coatings are applied in concentric layers to prevent damage to the fiber during the drawing application and to maximize fiber strength and microbend resistance. Unevenly coated fiber will experience non-uniform forces when the coating expands or contracts, and is susceptible to greater signal attenuation. Under proper drawing and coating processes, the coatings are concentric around the fiber, continuous over the length of the application and have constant thickness.

Fiber optic coatings protect the glass fibers from scratches that could lead to strength degradation. The combination of moisture and scratches accelerates the aging and deterioration of fiber strength. When fiber is subjected to low stresses over a long period, fiber fatigue can occur. Over time or in extreme conditions, these factors combine to cause microscopic flaws in the glass fiber to propagate, which can ultimately result in fiber failure.

Three key characteristics of fiber optic waveguides can be affected by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending. External [[optical fiber cable]] jackets and buffer tubes protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiber’s performance and long-term durability. On the inside, coatings ensure the reliability of the signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.

=== Cable construction ===
[[File:Optical fiber cable.jpg|thumb|An [[optical fiber cable]]]]
{{Main|Optical fiber cable}}
In practical fibers, the cladding is usually coated with a tough [[resin]] coating and an additional ''[[buffer (optical fiber)|buffer]]'' layer, which may be further surrounded by a ''jacket'' layer, usually plastic. These layers add strength to the fiber but do not contribute to its optical wave guide properties. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another. This reduces [[crosstalk (electronics)|cross-talk]] between the fibers, or reduces [[Lens flare|flare]] in fiber bundle imaging applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/129#toc2 |title=Light collection and propagation |work=National Instruments' Developer Zone |publisher=National Instruments Corporation |accessdate=2007-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125051848/http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/129 |archivedate=January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hecht2002&gt;{{cite book| first=Jeff| last=Hecht| title=Understanding Fiber Optics| year=2002| edition=4th| isbn=0-13-027828-9|publisher= Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cables come in a wide variety of sheathings and armor, designed for applications such as direct burial in trenches, high voltage isolation, dual use as power lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |title=Screening report for Alaska rural energy plan |format=PDF |work=Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs|accessdate=April 11, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508191931/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf|archivedate=May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2008}} installation in conduit, lashing to aerial telephone poles, submarine installation, and insertion in paved streets. Multi-fiber cable usually uses colored coatings and/or buffers to identify each strand. The cost of small fiber-count pole-mounted cables has greatly decreased due to the high demand for [[fiber to the home]] (FTTH) installations in Japan and South Korea.

Fiber cable can be very flexible, but traditional fiber's loss increases greatly if the fiber is bent with a radius smaller than around 30&amp;nbsp;mm. This creates a problem when the cable is bent around corners or wound around a spool, making [[FTTX]] installations more complicated. "Bendable fibers", targeted towards easier installation in home environments, have been standardized as ITU-T G.657. This type of fiber can be bent with a radius as low as 7.5&amp;nbsp;mm without adverse impact. Even more bendable fibers have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Corning announces breakthrough optical fiber technology |publisher=[[Corning Incorporated]] |date=2007-07-23 |url=http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2007/2007072301.aspx |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613040314/http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2007/2007072301.aspx |archivedate=June 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bendable fiber may also be resistant to fiber hacking, in which the signal in a fiber is surreptitiously monitored by bending the fiber and detecting the leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=222 |title=Protect your network against fiber hacks |accessdate=2007-12-10 |last=Olzak |first=Tom |date=2007-05-03 |work=Techrepublic |publisher=CNET |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217210636/http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=222 |archivedate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important feature of cable is cable's ability to withstand horizontally applied force. It is technically called max tensile strength defining how much force can be applied to the cable during the installation period.

Some fiber optic cable versions are reinforced with [[aramid]] yarns or glass yarns as intermediary [[strength member]]. In commercial terms, usage of the glass yarns are more cost effective while no loss in mechanical durability of the cable. Glass yarns also protect the cable core against rodents and termites.

=== Termination and splicing ===
[[File:ST-optical-fiber-connector-hdr-0a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[optical fiber connector|ST connectors]] on [[multi-mode fiber]]]]

Optical fibers are connected to terminal equipment by [[optical fiber connector]]s. These connectors are usually of a standard type such as ''FC'', ''SC'', ''ST'', ''LC'', ''MTRJ'', ''MPO'' or ''SMA''. Optical fibers may be connected to each other by connectors or by ''splicing'', that is, joining two fibers together to form a continuous optical waveguide. The generally accepted splicing method is [[fusion splicing|arc fusion splicing]], which melts the fiber ends together with an [[electric arc]]. For quicker fastening jobs, a “mechanical splice” is used.

Fusion splicing is done with a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are ''cleaved'' (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves before and after the splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between [[electrodes]] at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the [[melting point]] of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1&amp;nbsp;dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.

Mechanical fiber splices are designed to be quicker and easier to install, but there is still the need for stripping, careful cleaning and precision cleaving. The fiber ends are aligned and held together by a precision-made sleeve, often using a clear [[index-matching gel]] that enhances the transmission of light across the joint. Such joints typically have higher optical loss and are less robust than fusion splices, especially if the gel is used. All splicing techniques involve installing an enclosure that protects the splice.

Fibers are terminated in connectors that hold the fiber end precisely and securely. A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be ''push and click'', ''turn and latch'' (''[[bayonet mount]]''), or ''screw-in'' (''threaded''). The barrel is typically free to move within the sleeve, and may have a key that prevents the barrel and fiber from rotating as the connectors are mated.

A typical connector is installed by preparing the fiber end and inserting it into the rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a [[strain relief]] is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, depending on the type of fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a ''physical contact'' (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an ''angled physical contact (APC)'' connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called ''[[gap loss]]''. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.

In the 1990s, terminating fiber optic cables was labor-intensive. The number of parts per connector, polishing of the fibers, and the need to oven-bake the epoxy in each connector made terminating fiber optic cables difficult. Today, many connectors types are on the market that offer easier, less labor-intensive ways of terminating cables. Some of the most popular connectors are pre-polished at the factory, and include a gel inside the connector. Those two steps help save money on labor, especially on large projects. A [[cleave (fiber)|cleave]] is made at a required length, to get as close to the polished piece already inside the connector. The gel surrounds the point where the two pieces meet inside the connector for very little light loss.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Long term performance of the gel is a design consideration, so for the most demanding installations, factory pre-polished pigtails of sufficient length to reach the first fusion splice enclosure is normally the safest approach that minimizes on-site labor.

=== Free-space coupling ===
It is often necessary to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an [[optoelectronic device]] such as a [[light-emitting diode]], a [[laser diode]], or a [[modulator]]. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it in contact with the device, or can use a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to allow coupling over an air gap. Typically the size of the fiber mode is much larger than the size of the mode in a laser diode or a [[Silicon photonics|silicon optical chip]]. In this case, a [[Tapered fiber|tapered]] or [[lensed fiber]] is used to match the fiber mode field distribution to that of the other element. The lens on the end of the fiber can be formed using polishing, laser cutting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laser Lensing |work=OpTek Systems Inc.|url=http://www.opteksystems.com/laser-lens}}&lt;/ref&gt; or fusion splicing.

In a laboratory environment, a bare fiber end is coupled using a fiber launch system, which uses a [[microscope objective lens]] to focus the light down to a fine point. A precision [[translation stage]] (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic collimator, which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned with respect to the fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into single-mode fiber, the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized. With good beams, 70 to 90% coupling efficiency can be achieved.

With properly polished single-mode fibers, the emitted beam has an almost perfect Gaussian shape—even in the far field—if a good lens is used. The lens needs to be large enough to support the full numerical aperture of the fiber, and must not introduce [[optical aberration|aberrations]] in the beam. [[Aspheric lens]]es are typically used.

=== Fiber fuse ===
At high optical intensities, above 2 [[megawatt]]s per square centimeter, when a fiber is subjected to a shock or is otherwise suddenly damaged, a ''fiber fuse'' can occur. The reflection from the damage vaporizes the fiber immediately before the break, and this new defect remains reflective so that the damage propagates back toward the transmitter at 1–3 meters per second (4–11&amp;nbsp;km/h, 2–8&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R.

=== Chromatic dispersion ===
{{Main|Dispersion (optics)}}
The refractive index of fibers varies slightly with the frequency of light, and light sources are not perfectly monochromatic. Modulation of the light source to transmit a signal also slightly widens the frequency band of the transmitted light. This has the effect that, over long distances and at high modulation speeds, the different frequencies of light can take different times to arrive at the receiver, ultimately making the signal impossible to discern, and requiring extra repeaters.&lt;ref&gt;G. P. Agrawal, Fiber Optic Communication Systems, Wiley-Interscience, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem can be overcome in a number of ways, including the use of a relatively short length of fiber that has the opposite refractive index gradient.

'''Pat Lee Lauderdale''' (born Hobart, Oklahoma, U.S.A. October 19, 1944) is an American professor in the School of Justice and Social Inquiry at [[Arizona State University]]. He received his doctorate in the [[sociology of law]] from [[Stanford University]]. In 2008, he was appointed a visiting scholar at the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity at Stanford University. His teaching and research interests include indigenous jurisprudence, [[racialization]], diversity, global indigenous struggles, law and the social science, and [[Terrorism|international terrorism]]. In the 1980s he helped create the [[Herbert Blumer]] Institute in [[Costa Rica]] with the goal of discovering and describing alternatives to violence and [[criminal law]].  He also is known internationally for his research on the relationship between social deviance, law and diversity, and is a former editor of the ''International Studies Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/wicazo_sa_review/v021/21.1gray.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sjsi.clas.asu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sec.was.asu.edu/directory/person/10857&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''Law and Society'' (with James Inverarity and Barry Feld) has been translated into Japanese. His related research has been published in Spanish, German, and Italian (including the Calabrian dialect).

He is the former Director of the University-wide Ph.D./J.D. program in Justice Studies, Law, and the [[Social sciences|Social Sciences]]. Before coming to ASU in 1981, Dr. Lauderdale was an [[Professor|Associate Professor]] of Sociology and Law at the University of Minnesota. He had been a Visiting Scholar at the University of California, [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. He has received Fulbright Research Fellowships to Costa Rica and Austria.  He also has been a Visiting Scholar and Professor at the University of Lecci, Italy, the University of Austria, and Stanford University. In 2007, he received an invitation to be a Fulbright Senior Specialist for a research project on "Indigenous peoples, minorities and globalization," Department of Sociology and UNISA Press, [[University of South Africa]]. He was a National President of [[Phi Theta Kappa]] [[Honor society|Honorary Society]] and a [[Woodrow Wilson]] Scholar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">'''Physics of financial markets''' is a discipline that studies [[financial markets]] from the perspective of [[physics]]. It seeks to understand the nature of financial processes and phenomena by employing the [[scientific method]] and avoiding beliefs, unverifiable assumptions and immeasurable notions, not uncommon to finance and economic disciplines. Physics of financial markets addresses issues such issues as theory of price formation,&lt;ref name="Jack2013"&gt;J.

Physics of financial markets should not be confused for [[Mathematical finance|quantitative finance]] and [[econophysics]], which are only concerned with modeling financial instruments without seeking to understand nature of underlying processes.

'''Reverse cholesterol transport''' is a multi-step process resulting in the net movement of cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver first via entering the lymphatic system, then the bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=LH|last2=Elvington|first2=A|last3=Randolph|first3=GJ|pmid=26388772|title=The role of the lymphatic system in cholesterol transport.|volume=6|issue=182|date=September 2015|journal=Frontiers in Pharmacology|pmc=4557107|  doi =10.3389/fphar.2015.00182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cholesterol]] from non-hepatic peripheral tissues is transferred to [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] by the [[ABCA1]] ([[ATP-binding cassette transporter]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://biochemistry.med.uoc.gr/pages/kardasis_research.html?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=5 http://biochemistry.med.uoc.gr/photos/kardasis_research-07.gif in]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apolipoprotein A1]] (ApoA-1), the major protein component of HDL, acts as an acceptor, and the [[phospholipid]] component of HDL acts as a sink for the mobilised cholesterol.
The cholesterol is converted to [[cholesteryl ester]]s by the [[enzyme]] LCAT ([[lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase]]).
The cholesteryl esters can be transferred, with the help of CETP ([[cholesterylester transfer protein]]) in exchange for triglycerides, to other [[lipoprotein]]s (such as [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] and VLDL), and these lipoproteins can be taken up by secreting unesterified cholesterol into the [[bile]] or by converting cholesterol to [[bile acid]]s.

Uptake of HDL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is mediated by [[hepatic lipase]], a special form of [[lipoprotein lipase]] found only in the liver. Hepatic lipase activity is increased by [[androgen]]s and decreased by [[estrogen]]s, which may account for higher concentrations of HDL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in women.

'''Discoidal (Nascent) HDL:'''
 Initially, HDL is discoidal in shape because it lacks esterified cholesterol but as it keeps accumulating free cholesterol in it, the enzyme LCAT keeps esterifying the free cholesterol. 
When the HDL molecule is cholesterol rich, it's shape is changed into more spherical and it becomes less dense (HDL 2)
This is carried to the liver to release all the esterified cholesterol into the liver.

A '''science slam''' is a scientific talk where scientists present their own [[scientific research]] work in a given time frame - usually 10 minutes - in front of a non-expert audience. The focus lies on teaching current science to a diverse audience in an entertaining way. The presentation is judged by the audience.&lt;ref name="Science in the Pub"&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/bko/en6483164.htm Article on "Science in the Pub"]&lt;/ref&gt; A science slam is a form of [[science communication]].

== Variants ==
Science slams are open to all fields of science. However, events specializing on particular topics exist as well. Examples include: technical science slams,&lt;ref name="ideenexpo science slam"&gt;[http://www.ideenexpo.de/scienceslam/index.php Ideenexpo science slam]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "'''semiotic anthropology'''" was first used by Milton Singer (1978). Singer's work brought together the [[semiotics]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] with theoretical streams that had long been flowing in and around the [[University of Chicago]], where Singer taught.{{elucidate|date=July 2012}} In the late 1970s, [[Michael Silverstein]], a young student of Jakobson's at [[Harvard University]], joined Singer in Chicago's Department of Anthropology. Since that time, anthropological work inspired by Peirce's semiotic have proliferated, in part as students of Singer and Silverstein have spread out across the country, developing semiotic-anthropological agendas of their own.

Semiotic [[anthropology]] has its precursor in [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]]'s [[contextualism]] (which may be called [[anthropological semantics]]), which was later resumed by [[John Rupert Firth]].&lt;ref name="Nöth1995p103"&gt;[[Winfried Nöth]] (1995) ''Handbook of semiotics'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=rHA4KQcPeNgC&amp;pg=PA103 p.103]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropological approaches to semantics are alternative to the three major types of semantics approaches: [[linguistic semantics]], [[logical semantics]], and [[general semantics]].&lt;ref name="Nöth1995p103"/&gt; Other independent approaches to semantics are [[philosophical semantics]] and [[psychological semantics]].&lt;ref name="Nöth1995p103"/&gt;

[[Elizabeth Mertz]] has recently reviewed the burgeoning literature in semiotic anthropology (2007).

In the [[Education in the United States|United States education system]], '''social studies''' is the integrated study of multiple fields of [[social science]] and the [[humanities]], including [[history]], [[geography]], and [[political science]]. The term was first coined by American educators around the turn of the twentieth century as a catch-all for these subjects, as well as others which did not fit into the traditional models of lower education in the United States, such as [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="History of SS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ718721.pdf|title= On the Alleged Demise of Social Studies: The Eclectic Curriculum in times of Standardization—A Historical Sketch |author= David Warren Saxe | access-date= January 20, 2018 | publisher= Eric.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the [[U.S. Office of Education|Bureau of Education]] (not to be confused with its successor agency, the [[United States Department of Education]]) was tasked by then [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Franklin Knight Lane]] with completely restructuring the American education system for the twentieth century. In response, the Bureau of Education, together with the [[National Education Association]], created the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education. The Commission was made up of 16 committees (a 17th was established two years later, in 1916), each one tasked with the reform of a specific aspect of the American Education system. Notable among these was the Committee on Social Studies, which was created to consolidate and standardize various subjects which did not fit within normal school curricula into a new subject, to be called "the social studies."&lt;ref name="The Report"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED542444.pdf |title= The Social Studies in Secondary Education: A Six-Year Program Adapted Both to the 6-3-3 and the 8-4 Plans of Organization.

Bulletin, 1916, No. 28 |publisher = Bureau of Education | work= Committee on Social Studies | date = January 1, 1916 | access-date = January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bulletin No. 28==
In 1920, the work done by the Committee on Social Studies culminated in the publication and release of Bulletin No. 28 (also called "The Committee on Social Studies Report, 1916").&lt;ref name="The Report"/&gt; The 66-page bulletin published and distributed by the Bureau of Education is believed to be the first written work dedicated entirely to the subject. It was designed to introduce the concept to American educators and serve as a guide for the creation of nationwide curricula based around social studies. The bulletin proposed many ideas which were considered radical at the time, and it is regarded by many educators as one the most controversial educational resources of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="History of SS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED315329.pdf | title = The Social Contexts of the Committee on Social Studies Report of 1916 |first = Murray R. |last = Nelson |publisher = Institute of Education Resources |work = National Education Association | date = August 23, 1988 | access-date= January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after its release, the bulletin received criticism from educators on its vagueness, especially in regards to the definition of Social Studies itself.&lt;ref name="History of SS"/&gt; Critics often point to Section 1 of the report, which vaguely defines Social Studies as "...understood to be those whose subject matter relates directly to the organization and development of human society, and to man as a member of social groups."&lt;ref name="The Report"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1485) [[Accademia, Venice]]]]
'''Somatocentrism''' is a [[cultural]] [[value system]] in which [[biological determinism]] is the basis for social organization.  The [[phenotypical]] variation of an individual in this system determines the individual’s [[social identity]] and [[social relations]], although it doesn’t necessarily denote their [[social position]].  
== Definition ==

The term ‘somatocentric’ is derived from 
* “soma”, [[New Latin]], meaning ‘[[Human body|body]]’
* and “centric” from the [[Greek language|Greek]] “kentrikos”, meaning of the center.  
In this system, the [[physical body]] of an individual is heavily emphasized, and valued in determining the [[social identity]] of the individual.

== Perception ==
A necessary precondition for individuals in a somatocentric system is the privileging of [[Visual perception|sight]] over other [[senses]] in perceiving [[reality]].  Using vision as the primary sense for constructing [[reality]] may cause one to miss complex and hidden nuances of [[existence]], limiting [[perception]].&lt;ref&gt;Coetzee, Pieter Hendrik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eJCkw7e05p4C&amp;pg=PA467 ''Race and Gender''], 28 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  A comparison of [[Visual perception|sight]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] shows that sight is mono-directional and exclusive, while sound is proximate, fluid, and inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, David: ''History of Bourgeois Perception''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982, pp. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Privileging [[Visual perception|sight]] over other senses facilitates a type of [[self-image]] that focus on the individual's body, as vision is the primary means to delineate phenotypical difference.  Identifying these differences this way may lead to attributing social value to individuals who look a certain way.

=== Body Image ===
[[Body image]] is a [[subjectivity|subjective]] picture of one’s own [[human physical appearance|physical appearance]] established both by [[self-awareness]] and by noting the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online, ''Body image'', "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/body%20image]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Preoccupation with body image and the physical appearance of one’s body denotes how much value one ascribes to their phenotypical traits.  Body image may be valued highly, and more often than not, dissatisfaction with one’s own body image perverts that value with other social effects.

==== Body Dysmorphic Disorder ====
People who suffer from [[Body Dysmorphic Disorder]] (or BDD) fixate on a defect in their appearance.  People with BDD are affected daily with [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[anxiety]], which may impair their role in the social and occupational areas of their life. The amount of social value ascribed to the importance of body image affects the level of stress someone suffering from BDD feels. &lt;ref&gt;Fox, Kate. ''Body Image Studies'', 1997. "[http://www.mybodybeautiful.co.uk/body_image/BodyImage_Studies.htm]", 25 September 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; 
==== Height ====
Studies show that in some cultures, people who are relatively taller than others get relatively better treatment by their peers. 

A study conducted in [[Australia]] found that tall people earn higher [[wages]] than their equally competent shorter co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Kathy. ''Tall men earn $1000 more than short ones'', 17 May 2009. "[http://www.news.com.au/features/tall-men-earn-1000-more-than-short-ones/story-e6frfl49-1225713033720]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted in [[Southampton]] of ninety two normal teens who were shorter than their peers revealed that the shorter boys were twice as likely to be [[bullied]] than their average height controls matched by sex and age.&lt;ref&gt;Voss, Linda D. and Mulligan, Jean. ''Bullying in school: are short pupils at risk?'', 1 November 2000. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32258/]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of these studies reveal a [[correlation]] between height and social value, indicating somatocentric issues.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists define ‘short stature’ as being two [[standard deviations]] below the [[average]] for a particular age and sex; in [[United States|America]], a male shorter than 5’7’’ and a female shorter than 5’2’’ are both short statured.&lt;ref&gt;"NOSSA, What is short statured?", 2011, "{{cite web |url=http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus/whatisshortstatured.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926233901/http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus/whatisshortstatured.html |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups have been formed by people who feel short, such as [[National Organization of Short Statured Adults|The National Organization of Short Statured Adults (NOSSA)]].  One of the primary functions of this group is to inform its members of the [[sociological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of being short statured as research continues.&lt;ref&gt;"NOSSA, About Us", 2011, "{{cite web |url=http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004121828/http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racism ===
[[Racism]] is defined by a belief that [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online, ''Racism'', "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism?show=0&amp;t=1316986204]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial differences are most easily compared by the phenotypical differences between peoples of a different race, i.e. [[Human skin color|skin tone]], facial features, [[hair color]], and [[body type]].  To place social value on any trait, whether positive or negative, is a product of somatocentric values.

=== Gender ===
A somatocentric culture may create [[Social constructionism|social constructs]] based on the interpretation of biological differences between its individuals.  The concept of ‘[[gender]]’ is an example of a [[social construct|construct]] that may arise from somatocentricity.  [[Sex and gender distinction|Sex and gender]] are loosely related as they both deal with the [[male]] and the [[female]]; however, one considers [[empirical]] distinction, while the other considers [[social]] distinction.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"&gt;[[Oyèrónkẹ́ Oyěwùmí|Oyewumi, Oyeronke]], ''The Invention of Women'', 1997, 5 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A sex refers to biological distinctions between males and females.  Certain [[Organ (anatomy)|biological structures]] are unique to either females or males; in humans, the [[ovary]] being unique to the former, the [[prostate gland]] being unique to the latter.  Biological differences between males and females govern the action of [[reproduction]] in any [[species]] that repopulates via [[sexual reproduction]], and in some cases, influence the action of child-rearing.

By contrast, [[gender roles]], [[gender identities]], and the concepts of [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] are all [[social constructs]] which may be extrapolated from phenotypical differences between men and women.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"/&gt;

For example, in [[Western culture]], women may fill domestic [[Role|social roles]], with an emphasis on [[Parenting|childcare]].  Women are also unique members of a population that are outfitted with [[breasts]] which help feed [[infants]], while men lack these [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].  While it is logical to assert that women may be biologically better suited for [[postnatal]] care of an [[infant]] than men, it does not follow from the ability to [[Breastfeeding|breast-feed]] that women are better suited to domestic [[Role|social roles]] than men.

==== Masculinity and Femininity ====
[[Masculinity]] and [[femininity]] are also engendered concepts that may draw from phenotypical difference between male and female.  A person who exhibits [[physical strength]] may be deemed [[masculine]], while a person who exhibits [[gentleness]] may be deemed [[feminine]].  Attributing significance to the phenotypical difference between the size or shape of men and women creates a [[binary opposition|binary]] between the two that allows the casual observer to presume social significance of a person in terms of this [[arbitrary]] scale.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"/&gt;

A '''stereopticon''' is a [[slide projector]] or "[[magic lantern]]", which has two lenses, usually one above the other.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were a popular form of entertainment and education before the advent of [[motion picture|moving pictures]]. Americans William and [[Frederick Langenheim]] introduced stereopticon slide technology—slide shows of projected images on glass—in 1850.  For a usual fee of ten cents, people could view realistic images of nature, history, and science themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magiclanternsociety.org/about-magic-lanterns/lantern-slides/|title=Lantern Slides {{!}} Magic Lantern Society|website=www.magiclanternsociety.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two lenses are used to dissolve between images when projected. At first, the shows used random images, but over time, lanternists began to place the slides in logical order, creating a narrative.  This "visual storytelling" with technology directly preceded the development of the first moving pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term stereopticon has been widely misused to name a [[stereoscope]]. A stereopticon will not project or display stereoscopic/[[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] images on cards. All stereopticons can be classified as [[Magic lantern|magic lanterns]], but not all magic lanterns are stereopticons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Sulfur water''' (or '''sulphur water''') is a condition where the running water contains a high amount of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas that escapes into the air when the plumbing line is opened, giving a distinct "rotten egg" smell.  

==Cause and treatment==
The condition indicates a high level of [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] in the water supply. This may be due to the use of well water, poorly treated city water, or water heater contamination.

Various methods exist to treat sulfur in water. These methods include
# Use of a [[Carbon_filtering|Carbon Filter]] (useful for very small amounts of hydrogen sulfide)
# Filtering the water through a canister of manganese oxide coated [[Greensand]]
# [[Water_aeration|Aeration]] of the water
# Treating the water with [[Water_chlorination|chlorine]] (can be used to treat large amounts of hydrogen sulfide)

==Health==
Bathing in water high in sulfur or other minerals for its presumed health benefits is known as [[balneotherapy]].

===Concerns===
According to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drinking water with high levels of sulfate can cause diarrhea, especially in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cervin|first1=Michael|title=Sulfur Springs: To Soak or not to Soak?|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/08/sulfur-springs-to-soak-or-not-to-soak/|accessdate=24 February 2015|agency=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swinging''', sometimes called '''wife swapping''', '''husband swapping''' or '''partner swapping''', is a [[Non-monogamy|non-monogamous]] behavior in which both singles and partners in a [[committed relationship]] engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Swinging is a form of [[open relationship]]. People may choose a swinging lifestyle for a variety of reasons. Many cite an increased quality, quantity, and frequency of sex. Some people may engage in swinging to add variety into their otherwise conventional sex lives or due to their curiosity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.netcom.com/~jonnall/babylon/pattys.htm|title=Why Swing?|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of swinging, or at least its wider discussion and practice, is regarded by some as arising from the freer attitudes to sexual activity after the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, the invention and availability of the [[contraceptive pill]], and the emergence of treatments for many of the [[sexually transmitted disease]]s that were known at that time. The adoption of [[safe sex]] practices became more common in the late 1980s.

The swinger community sometimes refers to itself as "the lifestyle", or as "the alternative lifestyle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergstrand|first=Curtis R.|title=Swinging in America : love, sex, and marriage in the 21st century|year=2010|publisher=Praeger/ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0313379666|author2=Sinski, Jennifer Blevins }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the culture and the context, the practice has also been called "wife lending", "wife sharing", a "community of women" or similar terms.  Another term, “hotwife / hotwifing” specifically refers to a married woman who often has sexual relations with different men, with the approval of her husband.

== Description ==
[[John Stossel]] produced an investigative news report into the swinging lifestyle. Stossel's report in 2005 cited [[Terry Gould]]'s research, which concluded that "couples swing in order to not cheat on their partners". When Stossel asked swinging couples whether they worry their spouse will "find they like someone else better," one male replied, "People in the swinging community swing for a reason. They don't swing to go out and find a new wife;" a woman asserted, "It makes women more confident – that they are the ones in charge." Stossel interviewed 12 marriage counselors. According to Stossel, "not one of them said don't do it," though some said "getting sexual thrills outside of marriage can threaten a marriage". Nevertheless, swingers whom Stossel interviewed claimed "their marriages are stronger because they don't have affairs and they don't lie to each other."&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Health/story?id=2395727&amp;page=1#.UG4e3U3A_Jc |title=The 'Lifestyle' – Real-Life Wife Swaps |date=18 March 2005 |publisher=ABC 20/20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinging can take place in a number of contexts, ranging from spontaneous sexual activity involving partner swapping or adding a third or more participants at an informal gathering of friends to planned regular social meetings to "[[Casual sex|hooking up]]" with like-minded people at a [[sex club]] (also known as a swinger club, not to be confused with a [[strip club]]). Different clubs offer varied facilities and atmospheres, and often hold "theme" nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swingerspartiesuk.com |title=Advice and information on Swingers Clubs |publisher=Swingers parties |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinging is also known to take place in semi-public venues such as hotels, resorts, or cruise ships, or often in private homes.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Hallie |title=Happily Married Swingers |url=http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/happy-swinger-couples |publisher=Redbook |accessdate=2 July 2013|date=September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many websites that cater to swinging couples now exist, some boasting hundreds of thousands of members.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

== Prevalence ==
In 2018, a study of the prevalence of nonmonogamous practices in the United States estimated that 2.35% of Americans currently self-identify as swingers and 4.76% had identified as swingers at some point in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.31234/osf.io/st2k5 |title=Counting polyamorists who count: Prevalence and definitions of an under-researched form of consensual nonmonogamy |last1=Burleigh |first1=Tyler |last2=Rubel |first2=Alicia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study solicited respondents through [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[Sampling (statistics)#Survey weights|weighted]] responses to increase representativeness.

== Effects ==

=== Relationship quality ===

Research on swinging has been conducted in the United States since the late 1960s. One 2000 study, based on an Internet questionnaire addressed to visitors of swinger-related sites, found swingers are happier in their relationships than the norm.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers" /&gt;

60% said that swinging improved their relationship; 1.7% said swinging made their relationship less happy. Approximately 50% of those who rated their relationship "very happy" before becoming swingers maintained their relationship had become happier. 90% of those with less happy relationships said swinging improved them. Almost 70% of swingers claimed no problem with jealousy; approximately 25% admitted "I have difficulty controlling jealousy when swinging" as "somewhat true", while 6% said this was "yes, very much" true. Swingers rate themselves happier ("very happy": 59% of swingers compared to 32% of non-swingers) and their lives more "exciting" (76% of swingers compared to 54% of non-swingers) than non-swingers, by significantly large margins. There was no significant difference between responses of men and women, although more males (70%) than females completed the survey. This study, which only polled self-identified swingers, is of limited use to a broader application to the rest of society ([[external validity]]) owing to [[self-selection bias|self-selected sampling]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Some believe sexual attraction is part of human nature and should be openly enjoyed by a committed or married couple. Some swingers cite divorce data in the US, claiming the lack of quality of sex and spousal infidelity are significant factors in divorce. One study showed 37% of husbands and 29% of wives admit at least one extramarital affair (Reinisch, 1990), and divorce rates for first marriages approached 60%.

=== Sexually transmitted infections ===
Swingers are exposed to the same types of risks as people who engage in [[casual sex]], with the main concerns being the risk of pregnancy and of contracting a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI). Some swingers engage in [[unprotected sex]], a practice known as [[barebacking]], while others follow [[safe sex]] practices and will not engage with others who do not also practice safe sex. Swingers may reduce the risk of STI by exchanging STI test results and [[serosorting]]. Proponents of swinging argue that safe sex is accepted within the swinging community and the risk of sexual disease is the same for them as for the general population&amp;nbsp;– and that some populations of sexually non-monogamous people have clearly lower rates of STIs than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aim-med.org/news/2009/10/20/1256052533/ |title=Superior Court Quashes CAL-OSHA'S Attempt to Subpoena Confidential AIM Medical Records |accessdate=2009-10-21 |date= 2009-10-20 |publisher=AIM Medical}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents are also concerned about the risk of pregnancy and STIs such as [[HIV]], arguing that even protected sex is risky given that some STIs may be spread regardless of the use of condoms, such as [[Herpes]] and [[HPV]]. In a 1992 study, an overall 7% of swingers had quit swinging because of the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic. It was also stated that 62% of swingers changed their sex practices, by becoming more selective with partners or by practicing safe sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenks|first1=Richard J.|date=|year=1998|title=Swinging: A Review of the Literature|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=27|issue=5|pages=507–521|doi=10.1023/a:1018708730945|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dutch study that compared the medical records of self-reported swingers to that of the general population found that STI prevalence was highest in young people, homosexual men, and swingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/sti.2009.041954 |pmid=20577016 |title=Older and swinging; need to identify hidden and emerging risk groups at STI clinics |journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=315–317 |year=2010 |last1=Dukers-Muijrers |first1=N. H. T. M. |last2=Niekamp |first2=A.-M. |last3=Brouwers |first3=E. E. H. G. |last4=Hoebe |first4=C. J. P. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study has been criticized as not being representative of swinger populations as a whole: its data was formulated solely on patients receiving treatment at an STI clinic. In addition, according to the conclusions of the report, the STI rates of swingers were in fact nearly identical to those of non-swinging straight couples, and concluded that the safest demographic for STI infection were female prostitutes. According to the Dutch study, "the combined rates of [[chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]] were just over 10% among straight people, 14% among gay men, just under 5% in female prostitutes, and 10.4% among swingers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/23/us-sex-diseases-swingers-idUSTRE65M6NX20100623 |work=Reuters |title=Disease risk higher for swingers than prostitutes |date=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===

Although there is a risk of pregnancy, they are the same as monogamous sex and can be minimized.  Solutions include a tubal ligation (female sterilization), vasectomy (male sterilization), or having a group entirely made of menopausal women. Other solutions include using condoms or the pill. Proper use of a condom with an effective birth control method minimises the risk of pregnancy and transmission of STIs.&lt;ref name="Condom Effectiveness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Condom Effectiveness |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/416 |work=advocatesforyouth.org |accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Western society ==
It may not be possible to trace a precise history of swinging since the modern concept is so closely related to basic human sexuality and relationships, and they vary significantly across time and cultures. The modern concept of "swinging" is a recent Western phenomenon with no counterpart or meaning in many other cultures and civilizations in history in which monogamous relationships was the norm or which had religious or social prohibitions against such sexual practices.

=== 16th century ===
The "community of women" was practiced by several radical [[Anabaptist]] sects including the [[Batenburgers]] and the [[Münster rebellion|Munsterites]].

A formal arrangement was signed by [[John Dee]], his wife Lynae, his [[scryer]], [[Edward Kelley]] and Kelley's wife Joanna on 22 April 1587, whereby conjugal relations would be shared between the men and their spouses. This arrangement arose following [[seance]]s which apparently resulted in spirits guiding Dee and Kelley towards this course of action. The arrangement ended badly and destroyed Dee's working relationship with Kelley.&lt;ref&gt;''The Queen's Conjuror; The life and magic of John Dee'' by Benjamin Woolley, [[Harper Collins]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-6510-7}}, p292&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th century ===
It has been claimed that two related 18th-century messianic Jewish sects—the Frankists, followers of [[Jacob Frank]], and the [[Dönmeh]], followers of [[Sabbatai Zevi|Shabbetai Zvi]]—held an annual springtime Lamb Festival, which consisted of a celebratory dinner that included a ritualized exchange of spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeek.net/706jay/ |title=Why I Study Sabbateanism |last=Michaelson |first=Jay |date=June 2007| publisher=Zeek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gadnassi.com/files/publications/Exploring_the_Pagan_-_Jewish_and_Ottoman_Roots_of_the_Sabbatean-Lamb_Festival.pdf |title=Exploring the Pagan, Jewish and Ottoman Roots of the "Sabbatean Lamb Festival" |last=Nassi |first=Gad |publisher=GadNassi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
One of the criticisms of [[communism]] was the allegation that communists practice and propagandize the "community of women". In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848), [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] suggest that this allegation is an example of hypocrisy and [[psychological projection]] by "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" critics of communism, who "not content with having wives and daughters of their [[proletariat|proletarians]] at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm |author=Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels|year= 1848 |title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
According to [[Terry Gould]]'s ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers'',&lt;ref&gt;Terry Gould, ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers''. Vintage Canada, November 23, 1999 {{ISBN|1-55209-482-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; swinging began among American [[United States Army Air Forces|Air Force]] pilots and their wives during [[World War II]] before pilots left for overseas duty. The mortality rate of pilots was so high, as Gould reports, that a close bond arose between pilot families that implied that pilot husbands would care for all the wives as their own&amp;nbsp;– emotionally and sexually&amp;nbsp;– if the husbands were lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homerf.org History of Wife Swapping], homerf.org&lt;/ref&gt; The realities of the demographics and basing of US Army Air Force (USAAF) pilots and crew suggest that this arrangement did not evolve during WWII, instead evolving later. US military personnel in WWII were not accompanied by their families (and many especially in the USAAF, were single) - the giant military bases where families live while accompanying a deployed soldier, sailor, aviator, or Marine are mostly Cold War creations. Though the origins of swinging are contested, it is assumed American swinging was practiced in some American military communities in the 1950s. By the time the [[Korean War]] ended, swinging had spread from the military to the [[suburb]]s. The media dubbed the phenomenon wife-swapping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libchrist.com/swing/began.html The History and Definitions of Swinging which is Couples Only], Liberated Christians, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s in the heyday of the ''[[Free love|Free Love]]'' movement, the activities associated with swinging became more widespread in a variety of social classes and age levels.&lt;ref name="Stonesex"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "Sex, Love and Hippies"]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, sometimes referred to as "The Swinging '70s", swinging activities became more prevalent, but were still considered "alternative" or "fringe" because of their association with non-mainstream groups such as [[communes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sheff |first=Elisabeth |title=Gender, Family, and Sexuality: Exploring Polyamorous Community |year=2005 |publisher=University of Colorado |pages=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key party is a form of swinger party, in which male partners place their car or house keys into a common bowl or bag on arriving. At the end of the evening the female partners randomly select keys from the bowl and leave with that key's owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell | first = Robert | authorlink =   | title = Social Deviance: A Substantive Analysis | publisher = Dorsey Press | year = 1971 | location = University of Michigan | isbn = 978-0-256-01663-5 | page = 74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key parties are portrayed in Season 4 Episode 4 of [[List of Masters of Sex episodes|''Masters of Sex'']], Season 2 Episode 4 of the TV show [[List of Life on Mars (UK TV series) episodes|''Life on Mars'' (UK)]], Episode 14 of  [[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|''Life on Mars'' (US)]] and episode 8 of ''[[List of Journeyman episodes|Journeyman]]'', as well as in the film ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]]''.

According to economic studies on swinging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Orlando | first1 = Fabio | year = 2010 | title = Swinger Economics | url = | journal = The Journal of Socio-Economics | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 303–304 | doi=10.1016/j.socec.2009.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the information and communications technology revolution, together with improvements in medicine, has been effective in reducing some of the costs of swinging and hence in increasing the number of swingers.

Swinging activities had another surge in interest and participation in the late 1990s due to the rise of the [[Internet]].

=== Religious and moral objections ===
{{See also|Religion and sexuality|Sexual norm|Casual sex}}
Some people object to swinging on moral or philosophical grounds. Most religious communities and moralists regard swinging as [[adultery]], not withstanding that it is with the knowledge, consent or encouragement of one spouse to the other. Some argue that strict [[monogamy]] is the ideal form for marital relationships and that sexual relations should only take place between marriage partners or, perhaps, between partners in a committed monogamous relationship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== In other societies ==
===Native Americans===
According to Mark Carroll, wife lending and husband lending was a Native American custom, especially within the family such as brothers. He says that anthropologists have characterised it as "anticipatory [[Levirate marriage|levirate]]" – that is, in anticipation of a future levirate marriage - of the wife to her brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YEwFREzG_TcC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=wife+lending#v=onepage&amp;q=wife%20lending&amp;f=false |last=Carroll |first=Mark |title=Homesteads Ungovernable: Families, Sex, Race, and the Law in Frontier Texas, 1823-1860 |page=26 |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2010 |location= |isbn=9780292782730 |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabia===
Wife lending was a practice in pre-Islamic Arabia whereby husbands allow their wives to live with "men of distinction" to produce noble offspring. The husband, who abstained while his wife lived with the other man, would then be socially considered the father of the child. After the arrival of Islam this practice was forbidden and was considered a form of adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwlusa.org/topics/history/herstory.html|title=Women in Pre-Islamic Arabia|last=Muslim Women's League|date=September 1995 |publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
Temporary spouse-trading is practiced as an element of ritual initiation into the [[Lemba people|Lemba]] secret society in the [[French Congo]] through "wife exchange:"&lt;ref&gt;Janzen 1982, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; "you shall lay with the priestess-wife of your Lemba Father and he shall lay with your wife too."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; McGaffey 1974, p. 100b (.7.10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; McGaffey 1974, p. 116 (81)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Guinea ===
Among the [[Orya]] of northern [[Irian Jaya]], the ''agama toŋkat'' (Indonesian for "walking-stick") cult "encouraged men to trade wives, i.e., to have sexual relations with each other's wives. This trading of sexual favours ... was only between pairs of families, ... adherents are now very secretive concerning cult activities and teachings."&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In this 'walking-stick' cult "the walking stick ... ''dute'' is the term men use to refer to the husband of the woman who becomes his sexual partner."&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Phil, ''Of Paradise Lost: Orya myth''. 1998, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "There have been other similar movements ... near Jayapura. These are popularly called Towel Religion (''agama handuk'') and the Simpson Religion (''agama simpson'')."&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1998, p. 39, fn. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Mimika of southern Irian Jaya, temporary spouse-trading is said to have been originated by a woman who had returned from the world of the dead: "The wife says to her husband, '...&amp;nbsp;tonight I will sleep in the house of the headman ..., and ... his wife, will sleep in your house. Because I have been dead ..., tonight I am going to do for the first time what people have been looking forward to (for so long). I am going to institute the ''papisj'', wife exchange.'"&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Zegwaard (transl. from the Dutch by Peter Mason and Ton van Santvoord), ''Amoko''. Crawford House, Belair (SA), 2002. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inuit and Aleut ===
[[Inuit]] wife trading has often been reported and commented on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence |last=Hennigh |date=March 1970 |title=Functions and Limitations of Alaskan Eskimo Wife Trading |journal=Arctic |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=24–34 |jstor=40507675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary "wife-lending ... was apparently more common among the Aleuts than Eskimos".
Several motivations for temporary spouse-trading among the Inuit have been suggested:
*at the instigation of an [[Alaska Native religion|aŋekok]] (shaman), as a magical rite to achieve better weather for hunting expeditions
*as a regular feature of the annual "[[Bladder Festival]]"
*for a man visiting unaccompanied by his wife, under the promise that he will in the future make his own wife sexually available to his host whenever the host will himself come visiting his erstwhile guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2066/do-eskimo-men-lend-their-wives-to-strangers |title=Do Eskimo men lend their wives to strangers? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=2003-01-21 |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Inuit, a very specialized and socially circumscribed form of wife-sharing was practiced. When hunters were away, they would often stumble into the tribal lands of other tribes, and be subject to death for the offense. But, when they could show a "relationship" by virtue of a man, father or grandfather who had sex with their wife, mother or other female relatives, the wandering hunter was then regarded as family. The Inuit had{{When|date=October 2012}} specific terminology and language describing the complex relationships that emerged from this practice of wife sharing. A man called another man "aipak", or "other me", if the man had sex with his wife. Thus, in their conception, this other man having sex with one's wife was just "another me".&lt;ref name="Ley, David 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ley |first=David |title=Insatiable Wives: Women Who Stray and The Men Who Love Them |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-1-4422-0030-2 |oclc=373474387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenous peoples in South America ===
Among the [[Araweté]] ([[Asurini]]) in the state of [[Pará]], [[Brazil]], "spouse-swapping" is practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Batalha Viveiros de Castro (transl. from the Portuguese by Catherine V. Howard) : ''From the Enemy's Point of View''. University of Chicago Press, 1992. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Bari tribe of Venezuela, when a woman becomes pregnant, the woman often takes other male lovers. These additional lovers then take on the role of secondary or tertiary fathers to the child. If the primary father should die, the other men then have a social obligation to support these children. Research has shown that children with such "extra" fathers have improved life outcomes, in this economically and resource-poor area of the jungle.&lt;ref name="Ley, David 2009"/&gt;

'''Teleforce''' was a proposed defensive weapon by [[Nikola Tesla]] that accelerated pellets or slugs of material to a high velocity inside a vacuum chamber via [[electrostatic]] repulsion and then fired them out of aimed nozzles at intended targets.  Tesla claimed to have conceived of it after studying the [[Van de Graaff generator]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news | title= Tesla's Ray |work=Time |date= 23 July 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seifer1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seifer|first=Marc|title=Tesla's "Death Ray" Machine|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_2.htm|publisher=bibliotecapleyades.net|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla described the weapon as being able to be used against ground-based infantry or for anti-aircraft purposes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news | title= Beam to Kill Army at 200 Miles, Tesla's Claim on 78th Birthday |work=New York Times |date= 11 July 1934 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news | title= 'Death Ray' for Planes |work=New York Times |date= 22 September 1940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Tesla described ''Teleforce'''s operation in 1934: &lt;blockquote&gt;My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist."&lt;ref name="AmtEW"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Machine to End War|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html|publisher=[[PBS]]|work=Tesla - Master of Lightning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nozzle would send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter that was written to [[J. P. Morgan, Jr.]] on November 29, 1934, Tesla described the weapon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have made recent discoveries of inestimable value... The flying machine has completely demoralized the world, so much that in some cities, as London and Paris, people are in mortal fear from aerial bombing. The new means I have perfected afford absolute protection against this and other forms of attack. ... These new discoveries, which I have carried out experimentally on a limited scale, have created a profound impression. One of the most pressing problems seems to be the protection of London and I am writing to some influential friends in England hoping that my plan will be adopted without delay. The Russians are very anxious to render their borders safe against Japanese invasion and I have made them a proposal which is being seriously considered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/teslafaq/q&amp;a_011.htm Tesla FAQ].  Retrieved 2013-12-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1937, Tesla wrote a treatise, "''The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslaradio.com/pages/teleforce.htm THE NEW ART OF PROJECTING CONCENTRATED NON-DISPERSIVE ENERGY THROUGH NATURAL MEDIA] -- System of Particle Acceleration for Use in National Defense.&lt;/ref&gt; concerning [[charged particle beam]] weapons.&lt;ref name="Seifer454"&gt;{{cite book |title=Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla: biography of a genius |last=Seifer |first=Marc J |year=2001 |publisher=Citadel |page=454 |isbn=978-0-8065-1960-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2DTNDFcC14C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a '[[superweapon]]" that would put an end to all war." This treatise is currently in the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]] archive in [[Belgrade]]. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through [[electrostatic]] repulsion).&lt;ref name="Seifer454" /&gt; 

== "Death ray" misnomer ==
Teleforce was mentioned publicly in the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on July 11, 1934.&lt;ref name=polyphase&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Beam to Kill Army at 200 Miles, Tesla's Claim On 78th Birthday |url=http://www.tesla-coil-builder.com/Articles/jul_11_1934b.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201211113/http://www.tesla-coil-builder.com/Articles/jul_11_1934b.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 1, 2010 |publisher=[[New York Herald Tribune]] |date=July 11, 1934 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Tesla, At 78, Bares New 'Death-Beam'.

Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles ..."&lt;ref name="AmtEW"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What set Tesla's proposal apart from the usual run of fantasy "death rays" was a unique vacuum chamber with one end open to the atmosphere. Tesla devised a unique vacuum seal by directing a high-velocity air stream at the tip of his gun to maintain "high vacua." The necessary pumping action would be accomplished with a large [[Tesla turbine]].&lt;ref name="AWtEW"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Components of Teleforce==

In total, the components and methods included:

* An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air instead of in a [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] as in the past.
* A mechanism for generating tremendous electrical force.
* A means of intensifying and amplifying the force developed by the second mechanism.
* A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force. This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention.&lt;ref name="AmtEW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Death-Ray Machine Described | work=New York Sun |date= 11 July 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that the charged particles would self-focus via "[[gas focusing]],".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In 1940, Tesla estimated that each station would cost no more than $2,000,000 and could have been constructed in a few months.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

After Tesla died, in a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's "death ray" apparatus, [[John G. Trump]] found a 45-year-old [[Decade Box|multidecade resistance box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|1993|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts at development and marketing  ==
By November 1934 Tesla was attempting (unsuccessfully) to obtain funding from J. P. Morgan's son, [[J. P. Morgan Jr.|Jack Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 386&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of Tesla possibly having a new type of weapon and his further offer to give it to the [[League of Nations]] as a way to prevent future war was looked on as alarming security threat by one US diplomat, a view not shared by his government.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 387&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 the [[Soviet Union]], through the US [[Amtorg Trading Corporation]], paid Tesla $25,000 for detailed plans, specification, and complete information on the method and apparatus but it is unclear whether a physical device was ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWtEW"/&gt; Tesla also attempted to get funding for his device in 1937, sending a paper ("New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive Energy Through Natural Media") outlining his plans to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="AWtEW"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Weapon to End War|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_wendwar.html|work=Tesla - Master of Lightning|publisher=[[PBS]]|quote=By 1937 it was clear that war would soon break out in Europe. Frustrated in his attempts to generate interest and financing for his "peace beam," he sent an elaborate technical paper, including diagrams, to a number of Allied nations including the United States, Canada, England, France, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. Titled "New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive Energy Through Natural Media," the paper provided the first technical description of what is today called a charged particle beam weapon.Of all the countries to receive Tesla's proposal, the greatest interest came from the Soviet Union. In 1937 Tesla presented a plan to the Amtorg Trading Corporation, an alleged Soviet arms front in New York City. Two years later, in 1939, one stage of the plan was tested in the USSR and Tesla received a check for $25,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Kingdom considered Tesla's offer to sell the device to them for $30 million, maybe with the idea that even hinting they had a super weapon would be a deterrent to [[Adolf Hitler]], but by 1938 they had dropped all interest.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 388&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this period Tesla claimed that efforts had been made to steal the invention saying his room had been entered and his papers had been scrutinized, but the thieves, or spies, left empty-handed. He said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper. The blueprint for the Teleforce weapon was all in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= O'Neill |first1= John J. |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art12.html |title=Tesla Tries To Prevent World War II (unpublished Chapter 34 of Prodigal Genius) |work=PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, at his [[Nikola Tesla#Birthday press conferences|birthday press conference]] Tesla was asked about his weapon and made the claim, "But it is not an experiment... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world."&lt;ref name="seifer1"/&gt; At the 1940 birthday press conference an 84 year old Tesla offered to develop his weapon for the US but there was no interest in his offer.

'''''The Faith Healers''''' is a 1987 book by magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] with a foreword by [[Carl Sagan]], that documents Randi's exploration of the world of [[faith healing]], and his exposing the [[sleight of hand]] trickery and deceit by its practitioners.

In eighteen chapters Randi explores the origins of faith healing and [[psychic surgery]], and critically analyzes the claims made by [[A. A. Allen]], [[Ernest Angley]], [[Willard Fuller]], [[WV Grant]], [[Peter Popoff]], [[Oral Roberts]], [[Pat Robertson]], and [[Ralph DiOrio]] for his claims of miracles at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in the town of [[Lourdes]]. Randi shows how people are tricked with [[Magician (illusion)|magician's]] tricks under the guise of religion.

In 1988, Earl Hautala in a review wrote "an eye opener for the naïve, this book provides a crash course in the methods of skeptical inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Hautala, Earl. (1988). ''The Faith Healers by James Randi''. [[Institute of General Semantics|ETC: A Review of General Semantics]]. Vol. 45, No. 2. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Scientist]]'' praised the book in a 1990 review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517045.300-money-for-old-soap--review-of-the-faith-healers-by-jamesrandi-.html | title=Money for old soap / Review of 'The Faith Healers' | newspaper=[[New Scientist]] | date= 17 February 1990 | first=Roy | last=Herbert | accessdate =2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theory of [[empirical knowledge]], '''the problem of the speckled hen''' is whether a single immediate [[observation]] of a [[wikt:speckle|speckle]]d [[chicken|hen]] provides a certain knowledge of the number of speckles observed. Clearly, this is not an isolated example, and therefore it is of fundamental nature.&lt;ref name=chis42&gt;[[Roderick Chisholm]], "The Problem of the Speckled Hen", ''Mind'' 51 (1942): pp.&amp;nbsp;368–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophically, this problem probes the limits of [[knowledge by acquaintance]]: one is unable to know with [[certainty]] the existence of determinate things in one's experience merely by the virtue of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/certainty/ "Certainty"], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roderick Chisholm]] attributes it to [[Gilbert Ryle]] suggesting to [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=chis42/&gt; It is viewed as a critisicm of the view expressed by [[C. I. Lewis]] that there can never be "positive bafflement in the presence of the immediate, because there is here no question which fails to find an answer".&lt;ref&gt;C. I. Lewis, Mind and the World-Order, p. 128, As cited by Chisholm (1942). &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heath]] remarks that this problem is one of the "descendants of [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]]'s '[[chiliagon]]' argument in the sixth of his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]''". &lt;ref name=heath2008&gt;[[Joseph Heath]], ''Following the Rules: Practical Reasoning and Deontic Constraint'', Oxford: OUP, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;305, note&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;/ref&gt;

A. J. Ayer suggested that if we are unable to enumerate speckles accurately, then it is incorrect to suggest that the "sense-data" provides a definite number of speckles despite the fact that the hen does have a definite number of them, clearly outlined. In Ayers' words, speckles are enumerable only if in fact they have been enumerated. &lt;ref name=chis42/&gt;

A number of philosophers analyzed the merits of this proposition. Chisholm concludes that the problem of the speckled hen emphacises the fact that there are basic propositions ([[synthetic proposition]]s which do not refer beyond the content of the immediate experience) that are necessarily imprecise. &lt;ref name=chis42/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17858">'''Traceability''' is the capability to trace something.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|traceable|id=204180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, it is interpreted as the ability to verify the history, location, or application of an item by means of documented recorded identification.&lt;ref&gt;"Glossary," ''[[ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code]]'', Section III, Article NCA-9000&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common definitions include the capability (and implementation) of keeping track of a given set or type of information to a given degree, or the ability to chronologically interrelate uniquely identifiable entities in a way that is verifiable.

Traceability is applicable to measurement, supply chain, software development, healthcare and security.

==Measurement==
The term ''measurement traceability'' is used to refer to an unbroken chain of comparisons relating an [[Measuring instrument|instrument]]'s [[measurement]]s to a known [[Standard (metrology)|standard]]. [[Calibration]] to a traceable standard can be used to determine an instrument's bias, [[Accuracy and precision|precision]], and [[accuracy]]. It may also be used to show a [[chain of custody]] - from current interpretation of evidence to the actual evidence in a legal context, or history of handling of any information.

In many countries, national standards for weights and measures are maintained by a National Measurement Institute (NMI) which provides the highest level of standards for the [[calibration]] / measurement traceability infrastructure in that country. Examples of government agencies include the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]] (NPL) the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) in the USA, the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] (PTB) in Germany, and the [[Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica]] (INRiM) in Italy. As defined by NIST, "Traceability of measurement requires the establishment of an unbroken chain of comparisons to stated references each with a stated uncertainty."

A clock providing '''{{visible anchor|traceable time}}''' is traceable to a time standard such as [[Coordinated Universal Time]] or [[International Atomic Time]]. The [[Global Positioning System]] is a source a traceable time.

==Supply chain==
In the [[supply chain]], traceability may be both a regulatory and an ethical or environmental issue.&lt;ref&gt;Moyer-Lee, J. and M.

In regard to [[Materials science|materials]], traceability refers to the capability to associate a finished part with destructive test results performed on material from the same ingot with the same heat treatment, or to associate a finished part with results of a test performed on a sample from the same melt identified by the unique lot number of the material. Destructive tests typically include chemical composition and mechanical strength tests. A [[heat number]] is usually marked on the part or raw material which identifies the ingot it came from, and a lot number may identify the group of parts that experienced the same heat treatment (i.e., were in the same oven at the same time). Material traceability is important to the aerospace, nuclear, and process industry because they frequently make use of high strength materials that look identical to commercial low strength versions. In these industries, a part made of the wrong material is called "counterfeit," even if the substitution was accidental.

This same practice extends throughout industries using military hardware, including the [[fastener]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Traceability Matters|url=http://www.bbem.com/military-hardware-traceability|website=B&amp;B Electro-Mechanical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logistics===
{{See also|Track and trace}}
In [[logistics]], traceability refers to the capability for tracing goods along the distribution chain on a [[Batch production|batch]] number or series number basis. Traceability is an important aspect for example in the automotive industry, where it makes recalls possible, or in the food industry where it contributes to [[food safety]].

The international standards organization [[EPCglobal]] under [[GS1]] has ratified the [[EPCglobal Network]] standards (especially the EPC Information Services [[EPCIS]] standard) which codify the syntax and semantics for supply chain events and the secure method for selectively sharing supply chain events with trading partners. These standards for traceability have been used in successful deployments in many industries and there are now a wide range of products that are certified as being compatible with these standards.

===Food processing===
In [[food processing]] ([[meat processing]], fresh produce processing), the term traceability refers to the recording through means of barcodes or RFID tags &amp; other tracking media, all movement of product and steps within the production process. One of the key reasons this is such a critical point is in instances where an issue of contamination arises, and a recall is required. Where traceability has been closely adhered to, it is possible to identify, by precise date/time &amp; exact location which goods must be recalled, and which are safe, potentially saving millions of dollars in the recall process. Traceability within the food processing industry is also utilised to identify key high production &amp; quality areas of a business, versus those of low return, and where points in the production process may be improved.

In ''food processing software'', traceability systems imply the use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number, generally through the use of a [[barcode]] / [[RFID]]) which can be traced through the entire production flow, linking all sections of the business, including suppliers &amp; future sales through the supply chain. Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability software to find the particular transaction and/or product within the supply chain.

The European Union's General Food Law came into force in 2002, making traceability compulsory for food and feed operators and requiring those businesses to implement traceability systems. The EU introduced its Trade Control and Expert System, or [[TRACES]], in April 2004. The system provides a central database to track movement of animals within the EU and from third countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/foodlaw/traceability/factsheet_trace_2007_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has its [[National Livestock Identification System]] to keep track of livestock from birth to slaughterhouse.

India has started taking initiatives for setting up traceability systems at Government and Corporate levels. Grapenet,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/Grapenet/GrapeNet_new.htm&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative by Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Ministry of Commerce, Government of India is an example in this direction. GrapeNet is an internet based traceability software system for monitoring fresh grapes exported from India to the European Union. GrapeNet is a first of its kind initiative in India that has put in place an end-to-end system for monitoring pesticide residue, achieve product standardization and facilitate tracing back from pallets to the farm of the Indian grower, through the various stages of sampling, testing, certification and packing. Grapenet won the National Award (Gold), in the winners announced for the best e-Governance initiatives undertaken in India in 2007. Grapenet was designed and developed by Logicsoft,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsipl.com/Downloads_page/Grapenet.html&lt;/ref&gt; award-winning traceability solutions company, based in New Delhi, India.

The Directorate Generate Foreign Trade (DGFT), Government of India, through its notification 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://164.100.9.245/Exim/2000/NOT/NOT12/not2812.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403154618/http://164.100.9.245/Exim/2000/NOT/NOT12/not2812.htm |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }} No.84(RE-2008)/2004-2009&lt;/ref&gt; dated 04.02.2009 relating to Amendment in Foreign Trade Policy (RE2008)has mandated that Export to the [[European Union]] is permitted subject to registration with APEDA, thereby making Grapenet mandatory for all exports of fresh grapes from India to Europe.

[[Uruguay]] has also designed a system called ''Traceability &amp; Electronic Information System of the Beef Industry''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inac.gub.uy/innovanet/macros/TextContentWithMenu.jsp?contentid=4057&amp;version=1&amp;site=1&amp;channel=innova.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forest products===
Within the context of supporting legal and sustainable forest [[supply chain]]s, traceability has emerged in the last decade as a new tool to verify claims and assure buyers about the source of their materials. Mostly led out of Europe, and targeting countries where [[illegal logging]] has been a key problem ([[FLEGT]] countries), [[timber tracking]] is now part of daily business for many enterprises and jurisdictions. Full traceability offers advantages for multiple partners along the supply chain beyond certification systems, including:

* Mechanism to comply with local and international policies and regulations.
* Reducing the risk of illegal or non-compliant material entering the supply chains.
* Providing coordination between authorities and relevant bodies.
* Allowing automatic reconciliation of batches and volumes available.
* Offering a method of stock control and monitoring.
* Triggering real-time alerts of non-compliance.
* Reducing likelihood of recording errors.
* Improving effectiveness and efficiency.
* Increasing transparency.
* Promoting company integrity.

A number of timber tracking companies are in operation to service global demand.

Enhanced traceability ensures that the supply chain data is 100% accurate from the forest to the point of export. Nowadays, there are techniques to predict geographical provenance of wood and contribute to the fight against illegal logging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yuri | first1 = Gori | last2 = Ana | first2 = Stradiotti | last3 = Federica | first3 = Camin | year = 2018 | title = Timber isoscapes.

==Systems and software development==
In systems and [[software development]], the term traceability (or [[Requirements Traceability]]) refers to the ability to link product requirements back to stakeholders' rationales and forward to corresponding design artifacts, code, and [[test case]]s. Traceability supports numerous [[software engineering]] activities such as change [[Change impact analysis|impact analysis]], compliance verification or traceback of code, [[Regression testing|regression test]] selection, and requirements validation. It is usually accomplished in the form of a matrix created for the [[Verification and Validation|verification and validation]] of the project. Unfortunately, the practice of constructing and maintaining a [[Traceability matrix|requirements trace matrix]] (RTM) can be very arduous and over time the traces tend to erode into an inaccurate state unless date/time stamped. Alternate automated approaches for generating traces using [[information retrieval]] methods have been developed.

In transaction processing software, traceability implies use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number) which can be traced through the entire software flow of all relevant application programs. Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability key to find the particular transaction. This is also sometimes referred to as the transaction footprint.

To prevent theft, and assist in locating stolen objects, goods may be marked indelibly or undetectably so that they may be determined to be stolen, and in some cases identified. For example, it is sometimes arranged that stolen banknotes are marked with indelible dye to show that they are stolen; they can be identified by their unique serial numbers. Announcing that [[cash machine]]s were fitted with sprayers of [[SmartWater (forensic)|SmartWater]], an invisible gel detectable for years, to mark thieves and their clothing when breaking into or tampering with the machine was found in a 2016 pilot scheme to reduce theft by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/03/co-operative-atm-cash-machine-thieves-sprayed-traceable-gel-crime |title=Co-op ATM thieves to be sprayed with long-lasting traceable gel |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 August 2017  |author=Rupert Jones |accessdate= 3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
