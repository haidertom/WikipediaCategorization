'''Amsterdam University College''' (AUC) is a public [[liberal arts college]] in the [[Netherlands]] with an enrolment of about 900 students from more than 60 countries.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; All teaching is in English.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). AUC Informational Sheet 2013-2015. Retrieved January 13, 2013 from [http://www.auc.nl/binaries/content/assets/projectsites/amsterdam-university-college/study-abroad/auc-information-sheet-2014-2015.pdf AUC.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The college was founded in 2009 as a joint initiative of the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[VU University Amsterdam]] with a particular focus on the natural sciences. Although AUC has its own campus, students can also use facilities of both parent universities. The college is part of a recent wave of [[University college#Netherlands|university colleges in the Netherlands]] which have introduced liberal arts education to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Redden, E.

Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/02/08/netherlands-growth-liberal-arts-colleges-has-influenced-higher-ed-sector-whole insidehighered.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

AUC offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in the social sciences and humanities and a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in science, which are pursued by about 50%, 15%, and 33% of the student body, respectively.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; The curriculum is strongly interdisciplinary; within each field, students have to pursue at least two disciplines. AUC further emphasizes its 'academic core', which makes up a large part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="core"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2012). Academic Core. Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.auc.nl/academic-programme/programme-structure/academic-core/academic-core.html auc.nl].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The foundation of AUC goes back to an initiative of the two large universities in Amsterdam, [[University of Amsterdam]] (UvA) and [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] (VU), as well as the municipality. It is part of an initiative to make Amsterdam a hub for research and development in the natural sciences{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

AUC was officially founded in 2008, and took up operation with its founding class in 2009. The first dean of the college is Prof. Dr. [[Marijk van der Wende]], Professor of Higher Education at the VU. The first class of graduates received their diplomas in 2012. In 2016, van der Wende was succeeded as AUC dean by Prof. [[Murray Pratt]].

==Academics==

===Reputation===
In the 2016 Keuzegids Universiteiten, AUC earned a designation as top-rated programme based on student ratings and evaluations by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2015, November 3). [http://www.auc.nl/news-events/auc-news/news-and-media/news-and-media/content/folder-5/11/auc-top-rated-programme-2016.html?page=2&amp;pageSize=20 AUC earns Top Rated Programme designation for 2016]. ''AUC.nl''. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 Nationale Studentenquête, AUC received a high rating of 4.3 out of 5, placing it among the best programmes at the University of Amsterdam and in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Nationale Studentenenquête. (n.d.). [https://www.studiekeuze123.nl/opleidingen/liberal-arts-and-sciences-joint-degree-universiteit-van-amsterdam-wo-bachelor Universiteit van Amsterdam: Liberal Arts and Sciences]. ''Studiekeuze123''. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at Amsterdam University College receive a joint degree from the University of Amsterdam and the VU University. The University of Amsterdam regularly ranks among the best 100 universities in the world (2015/16 [[QS World University Rankings]]: 56).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-amsterdam University of Amsterdam]. Topuniversities. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Academic programme===
AUC offers a three-year honours degree in three very broad majors in science, social sciences, and humanities. During the academic year 2013/14, students could choose between approximately 200 courses across eight fields in the sciences, nine in the social sciences, seven in the humanities, as well as the academic core.&lt;ref name="major"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). Your major. ''AUC.nl''. Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.auc.nl/academic-programme/programme-structure/your-major/your-major.html auc.nl].&lt;/ref&gt; As part of AUC's interdisciplinary orientation, students have to pursue 'tracks' in at least two fields within their major. Interdisciplinarity is also emphasized by AUC's themes, which link fields across majors.&lt;ref name="major" /&gt;

The college emphasizes a strong academic core, which includes academic writing and basic calculus or statistics, but also more unusual courses such as logic or 'identity and diversity', which are compulsory for students of all majors. Furthermore, students are required to take two to three language courses; in 2013/14, the languages offered were Arabic, Dutch, French, German, and Spanish.

AUC has branded itself as a 'science college', and places particular emphasis on the natural sciences. In 2013/14, courses were offered in eight 'tracks': information sciences, mathematics, physics, earth and environmental sciences, chemistry, biology, biomedical sciences, and health.  Although during the first years less than 35% of students were majoring in the sciences, this number is expected to rise to 50% in the future.&lt;ref name="qr2013"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). Quality Report 2012-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

While teachers for many core and introductory courses are employed by AUC directly, the college draws on its parent institutions for most of its lecturers.

Graduates receive a joint degree from the University of Amsterdam and VU University; a Bachelor of Arts in the social sciences or humanities or a Bachelor of Science in science. Students graduation with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher receive an honours degree. Cum laude degrees are awarded for graduation with a GPA of 3.5 or higher, and summa cum laude degrees for a 3.9 or higher.

====Study abroad====

Around a third of all students spend a semester abroad during their studies at AUC.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; The college has a number of partners on its own, but students can also apply to the exchange partners of UvA and VU on all continents.

===Admissions===
In 2010, AUC admitted 200 of about 900 applicants for its class of 2013. The maximum number of admissions per year is 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auc.nl/admissions-aid/policy-on-admissions/policy-on-admissions.html|title=AUC's policy on admissions|last=Amsterdam University College|first=|date=23 December 2016|website=AUC.nl|access-date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average grade of admitted students in the [[Grade (education)#Netherlands|Dutch system]] was 7.6, the highest of all Dutch university colleges that publish such information. Unusually for a European public university, AUC's application procedure includes an individual essay, motivation letter, and interview. In a country where access to most courses of study is unrestricted, this gives the college unusual freedoms to select its students. AUC in particular takes into account international experience.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). AUC's admission requirements.

==Tuition and scholarships==
As of the academic year of 2012/13, the tuition fee amounts to 3,901 Euro for Dutch and EU/[[European Economic Area|EEA]] students and 11,491 Euro for all other international students.&lt;ref name="feesandcosts"&gt;Amsterdam University College.

The AUC Scholarship Fund is supported by VU, UvA, and the [[Amsterdam University College Student Association]]; as well as a range of corporate sponsors. The latter include [[Rabobank]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Schiphol Group]], [[Akzo Nobel]], [[KLM]], and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].&lt;ref name="scholarship" /&gt;

==Accreditation==
The AUC programme is a fully accredited joint bachelor programme of the VU University Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The Dutch government allocates responsibility for accreditation to the NVAO (the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders). The AUC programme was accredited by the NVAO on 2 September 2008. Upon successful completion of the programme students receive a joint Bachelor honours degree from the VU University Amsterdam and University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the title Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc).

AUC has been awarded the "Distinctive feature of small-scale and intensive education" by the Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Council (NVAO), which is required from Dutch institutes of higher education for raising tuition fees beyond the national standard.&lt;ref name="feesandcosts" /&gt;

==Campus and location==
[[File:Amsterdam university college.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The AUC building at Amsterdam Science Park.]]
[[File:Amsterdam University College - level 2.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Inside the building.]]
AUC is a residential college with a campus in the Science Park. It is located in the borough of [[Amsterdam-Oost]], in what was formerly the borough of [[Watergraafsmeer]]. The campus houses an academic building, completed in 2012, and student residences managed by the student housing cooperation DUWO.

===Academic building===
AUC has a main academic building in [[Science Park Amsterdam]], where most classes are taught. In line with AUC's promise of small classes, the building does not have an auditorium; larger events take place in its common room area. Lecture rooms and study areas are spread over four levels, and teacher's rooms are notably located in areas accessible to students.&lt;ref name="dereuver"&gt;de Reuver, P. (2012). [http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/1424/STADSGEZICHTEN/article/detail/3319541/2012/09/20/Stadsgezichten-Amsterdam-University-College.dhtml Stadsgezichten: Amsterdam University College]. [[Het Parool]]. Retrieved September 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AUC academic building, opened in 2012, was designed by [[Mecanoo]] architects. Its exterior appearance is dominated by a façade of rust-coloured steel plates. The interior design received praise in the media for its "open character".&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt; The building won the 2013 Amsterdam Architecture Prize, for "the simplicity of its shape [and] its surprising interior. A variety of different types of space with a range of educational functions meet, connect and merge under one substantial roof, which is spectacular and yet unobtrusive."&lt;ref&gt;ARCAM. (2013). [http://www.arcam.nl/algemeen/770_nl.html Amsterdam University College Winnaar Gouden A.A.P. 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513180428/http://www.arcam.nl/algemeen/770_nl.html |date=May 13, 2013 }}. Retrieved April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of the academic building emphasises environmental sustainability. The roof is planted with grass, increasing insulation and acting as a water storeroom. In combination with a geothermal heat pump, this serves to minimise energy loss and consumption.&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt;

Before moving to its current location, for the first three years of its existence AUC had a temporary academic building in the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]] quarter, associated with the Roeterseiland location of the University of Amsterdam and opposite of the city's zoo, [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]].

===Student residences===

Students are required to maintain residence on campus for the whole duration of their studies. The student dorms are located on the Science Park campus in close proximity to AUC's academic building. The dorm buildings are administered by Dutch student housing specialist [[DUWO]].

===Science Park===
The Science Park Amsterdam was initiated in 1996 as the location for a cluster of university buildings, research institutes and businesses.&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt; Next to AUC, the area also houses the University of Amsterdam Faculty of Sciences and several research institutes for physics, computer science, and mathematics. With two [[colocation centre|colocations]] of the [[Amsterdam Internet Exchange]] at the institutes [[Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam|SARA]] and [[NIKHEF]], the Science Park Amsterdam is one of the major Internet hubs in Europe.

The [[Amsterdam Science Park railway station]] connects the area to [[Amsterdam Centraal|Amsterdam Central Station]] and [[Schiphol Airport]] in one direction and [[Almere]] in the other. A bus line connects the Science Park to [[Amsterdam Muiderpoort railway station|Muiderpoort]] and [[Amsterdam Amstel railway station|Amstel]] railway stations.

==Student life==

As a small residential college, AUC has a close-knit student community. Parts of campus life are organised by student committees, although many activities take place in an informal framework. In particular Dutch students of AUC also participate in student organisations off campus, including fraternities at the University of Amsterdam and the traditional student rowing clubs, [[Nereus Rowing Club|Nereus]] and [[Skøll]].

===Student body===

AUC annually admits 300 students, most of whom join for the fall semester; though spring admission is possible.&lt;ref name="300students"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2012). [https://archive.is/20130222153236/http://www.auc.nl/news-events/news-and-media/news-and-media/news-and-media/content/folder/08/auc-welcomes-class-of-2015.html AUC Welcomes Class of 2015]. AUC.nl. Retrieved December 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the year of 2013/14, enrollment was at about 750 students.

About 40% of student at Amsterdam University College come from abroad, roughly as many as come from the Netherlands (minority and foreign-educated Dutch students excluded). International students hail from more than 60 countries, though most are citizens of the European Union. In addition, in 2012/13, 12% of AUC students had a Dutch minority background. AUC has stated its aim to raise the minority population to 20% by means of scholarships and increased outreach to high schools.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013).

Retrieved September 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clubs and organisations===

Student activities at AUC are organised under the umbrella of the Amsterdam University College Student Association. The Student Association derives its budget from an annual membership fee collected via tuition payments. Funds are used to support independently run student committees. In 2013-14, there were 22 recognised student committees.&lt;ref&gt;AUCSA. (2012). [http://myauc.nl/committees/ Committees]. MyAUC. Retrieved December 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student politics===

Until the academic year 2012/13, students were represented by the elected five-member Student Council responsible for administrative matters, as well as three non-elected student members (alongside three faculty members) on the Board of Studies, with an advisory function on academic matters. As of 2012/13, Student Council and Board of Studies have undergone an experimental merger, forming a College Council with five representatives of student body and faculty each.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College.

In an ''ACI Manifesto'' (2011), Mancini defines one aim of ACI as understanding "the interaction between animals and computing technology within the contexts in which animals habitually live, are active, and socialize with members of the same or other species, including humans".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mancini|first=Clara|date=July 2011|title=Animal-computer Interaction: A Manifesto|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1978822.1978836|journal=interactions|volume=18|issue=4|pages=69–73|doi=10.1145/1978822.1978836|issn=1072-5520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mancini's ''ACI Manifesto'' additionally proposes three core design goals for the field: enhancing animals' quality of life and wellbeing; supporting animals in the functions assigned to them by humans; and supporting human-animal relationships. Accordingly, ACI research gives considerable attention to questions of animal ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mancini|first=Clara|title=Towards an animal-centred ethics for Animal–Computer Interaction|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1071581916300180|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|volume=98|pages=221–233|doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; welfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mancini|first=Clara|last2=van der Linden|first2=Janet|last3=Kortuem|first3=Gerd|last4=Dewsbury|first4=Guy|last5=Mills|first5=Daniel|last6=Boyden|first6=Paula|date=2014|title=UbiComp for Animal Welfare: Envisioning Smart Environments for Kenneled Dogs|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2632048.2632073|journal=Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing|series=UbiComp '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=117–128|doi=10.1145/2632048.2632073|isbn=9781450329682}}&lt;/ref&gt; consent and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/july-august-2016/power-participation-and-the-dog-internet|title=Power, Participation, and the Dog Internet|last=Lawson|first=Shaun|date=August 2016|work=Interactions|access-date=23 Nov 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Kirman|first2=Ben|pages=37|last3=Linehan|first3=Conor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10139">'''Ariel Toaff''' (born 1942) is a professor of Medieval and Renaissance History at [[Bar Ilan University]] in Israel, whose work has focused on Jews and their history in Italy. 

He came to international prominence with the 2007 publication of  the first edition of his controversial book ''Pasque Di Sangue'' (''[[Passovers of Blood]]''), in which he claimed historical basis&lt;ref name="Johnson" &gt; Hannah Johnson, ''Blood Libel: The Ritual Murder Accusation at the Limit of Jewish History,''University of Michigan Press,  2012 pp.132ff. p.132.&lt;/ref&gt; for ritual use of human blood, obtained by murder. The claim was criticized as lending support to [[blood libel against Jews|blood libel]], an allegation that modern historians have described as unsupported by facts and which the Catholic Church has similarly repudiated since the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492-1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, p. 188-189,193-195,208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g10-jews.asp 'Gregory X: Letter on Jews, (1271-76) - Against the Blood Libel,']&lt;/ref&gt; Toaff wrote that these critics had misunderstood his book, which argued that the ritual use of small quantities of dried blood in magical curses had been a real practice among medieval "Ashkenazi extremists", but that this was unrelated to the accusation of ritual murder which was the central claim of blood libel.&lt;ref name = "toa"/&gt;

==Biography==
Ariel Toaff is the son of [[Elio Toaff]], late former [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Rome]].

Among his works are ''The Jews in Medieval Assisi 1305-1487: A social and economic history of a small Jewish community'' (1979); ''Il vino e la carne. Una comunità ebraica nel Medioevo'' (''Wine and Meat. A Jewish Community in the Middle Ages'', 1989); ''Mostri giudei. L'immaginario ebraico dal Medioevo alla prima età moderna'' ("Jewish Monsters. The Jewish Imaginary from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Era", 1996); and ''Mangiare alla giudia. La cucina ebraica in Italia dal Rinascimento all'età moderna'' (''Eating Jewish style. Jewish Cooking in Italy from the Renaissance to the Modern Age'', 2000).

===''Passovers of Blood''===
{{main|Passovers of Blood: The Jews of Europe and Ritual Murders}}
Toaff's book, ''Pasque di sangue. Ebrei d'Europa e omicidi rituali'' ("Passovers of Blood: The Jews of Europe and Ritual Murders"), was published in February 2007. The book analyzes the cultural and historical background to a notorious 1475 murder trial in Italy. A group of Jews were accused of murdering a young boy, later known as [[Simon of Trent]], and using his blood for [[Passover]] rites. The accused were tortured and confessed to killing the boy, who was informally venerated as a saint by Catholics until the 1960s. The consensus of scholarship has dismissed cases such as Simon of Trent's as a [[blood libel against Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;S.Buttaroni, S. Musial (eds.) ''Ritual Murder Legend in European History'', Krakow, Nuremberg, Frankfort, 2003 p.12 reads:'It is important to state from the very beginning that Jewish ritual murder never took place. Today proving such theories wrong is not the goal of scientific research'. Cited Toaff, ''Pasque di sangue'' 2007 p.225 n.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book's publication, among other responses, led to calls for Toaff to resign from or be fired from his professorship, and questioning of his research, [[historical method]], and motives&lt;ref&gt;Adi Schwartz, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/832325.html Toaff fights for his good name], in [[Haaretz]], 1 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as they relate to his writing of the book. Threats were made against his life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blood and Belief: The Circulation of a Symbol Between Jews and Christians |first=David |last=Biale |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-520-25304-9 |page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some sought his prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Ofri Ilani, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/831189.html MKs seek to try Prof. Toaff over claims in blood libel book.'] in  ''Haaretz,'' February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was much criticized for providing material that anti-Semites might capitalize on, though [[Sergio Luzzatto]] praised his intellectual courage in reopening a dossier that had lain under a taboo.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; While Toaff framed his analysis in hypothetical language,  and phrased his speculations in conditional language, the reception of the book often tended to translate this caution, according to Hanna Johnson, into the indicative language of accepted fact.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

Toaff promised not to give in to pressure and defend his work "even if crucified".&lt;ref&gt;Ofri Ilani,[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=824537&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 , "Bar-Ilan professor who claimed Jews used Christian blood in Passover ceremonies defends his book: 'I will fight for my truth, even if I am crucified'."] in [[Haaretz]], 12 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a statement from Italian Jewish leaders that consumption or use of blood is prohibited by Jewish law and tradition, Toaff stressed that he was not implicating all Jews, but only "a group of fundamentalist Jews [who] did not respect the biblical prohibition [against use of blood]."&lt;ref&gt; The Associated Press and Ofri Ilani Haaretz Service, "[http://www.haaretz.com/news/bar-ilan-to-order-professor-to-explain-research-behind-blood-libel-book-1.212579 Bar-Ilan to order professor to explain research behind blood libel book: Ariel Toaff's book alleges accusations of Jews using Christian blood may be based on real ceremonies]", 11 February 2007; accessed 04 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, Toaff did eventually pull his book from circulation. He clarified that in regard to the specific trial, dealing with Jews accused of killing [[Simon of Trent]] for ritual purposes at Passover, there was no relationship whatsoever between the so-called 'ritual of blood' and ritual infanticide. He denied that the Jews implicated were in any way involved in the murder of Simon.&lt;ref&gt;Adi Schwartz [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/957357.html 'Historian recants theory that Jews killed Christian child in ritual murder,'] in ''Haaretz'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2007, Toaff said in a statement that he ordered the Italian publisher of his book to freeze distribution of his book so that he can "re-edit the passages which comprised the basis of the distortions and falsehoods that have been published in the media."&lt;ref name=JP024&gt;Matthew Wagner and AP, [https://archive.is/20120708055342/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860024&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'Blood libel' author halts press] in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' Feb. 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Sanders,[http://www.forward.com/articles/blood-libel-scholar-pulls-book-pledges-funds-to-a/ Scholar Pulls Book Revisiting Blood Libel - Says Press Distorted His Work, Pledges Proceeds to ADL] in ''[[The Forward]]'', February 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

A second edition of the book appeared in February, 2008. In an afterword to this edition in defense of his book, Toaff responded to his critics. To forestall possible misinterpretations, he said that the idea that Jews practiced ritual murder is a slanderous stereotype, and that ritual homicide or infanticide was a myth. That said, the possibility existed that:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;certain criminal acts, disguised as crude rituals, were indeed committed by extremist groups or by individuals demented by religious mania and blinded by desire for revenge against those considered responsible for their people’s sorrows and tragedies.&lt;ref name = "toa"&gt;[http://www.medievalists.net/files/08111401.pdf Ariel Toaff, 'Trials and Historical Methodology: In Defence of ''Pasque di sangue'',' p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
The evidence supporting this hypothesis draws on confessions extracted under torture. His book examines the strong documentary evidence in medieval medical handbooks that dried human blood, traded by both Jewish and Christian merchants, was thought to be medicinally efficacious. Under the stress of forced conversions, expulsions and massacres, Toaff thinks it possible that in certain Ashkenazi groups dried human blood came to play a magical role in calling down God's vengeance on Christians, the historic persecutors of the Jews, and that this reaction may have affected certain forms of ritual practice among a restricted number of Ashkenazi Jews during [[Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Toaff, ''Ebraismo Virtuale,''Rizzoli, 2008 pp.101-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catherine Bell''' (1953 – 23 May 2008)&lt;!-- year given in Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data --&gt; was an American [[religious studies]] scholar who specialised in the study of [[Chinese religions]] and [[ritual studies]]. From 1985 until her death she worked at [[Santa Clara University]]'s religious studies department, of which she was chair from 2000 to 2005.

Born in [[New York City]], she studied at [[Manhattanville College]] and [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] before briefly teaching in Japan at the [[Seishin Joshi Gakuin]] and [[International University of Japan]]. Returning to the United States, she began work at Santa Clara in 1985, devoting her research to Chinese ritual, resulting in her most prominent publication, ''Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice'' (1992). In 1998 she became the Bernard Hanley Professor of Religious Studies, before becoming chair of the religious studies department in 2000. Retiring due to persistent health problems in 2005, she continued to research until her death.

==Biography==

Born in [[New York City]], Bell undertook her undergraduate studies at [[Manhattanville College]], gaining a double-major BA in philosophy and religion in 1975.{{sfn|Divinity School|2004}} She proceeded to complete her MA in the History of Religion at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]] in 1976, continuing with a PhD there, completed in 1983.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}{{sfn|Divinity School|2004}} Moving to Japan, she taught at the [[Seishin Joshi Gakuin]] in [[Tokyo]] from 1982 to 1983, before moving to the [[International University of Japan]] in [[Niigata (city)|Nigata]] in 1983.{{sfn|Divinity School|2004}} She then undertook a post-doctoral fellowship for Chinese language study in Taiwan.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Covering the costs for her international research, she obtained award fellowships from the [[Mellon Foundation]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Becoming a fellow of the Center for Chinese Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and involved in their Chinese Popular Culture project, her studies of ritual praxes in Chinese religions led to her book ''Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice'', published in 1992.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}

In 1985 she began work at Santa Clara University.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Focused on teaching undergraduates, courses she ran included "Ways of Studying Religion," "Asian Religions," "Magic, Science and Religion," "Time and the Millennium" and "Religion and Violence," each of which she based around a core intellectual question.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=viii}} Involved in restructuring the department's curriculum, in 1996 she was awarded the Brutocao Award for Excellence in Curriculum Innovation.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} She was also involved in the creation of a Women's Faculty Group and Faculty Development Program to aid junior members in the department.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=ix}} In 1998 she was named Bernard Hanley Professor of Religious Studies, that year being awarded the [[Santa Clara University College of Arts &amp; Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]' Beyma Research Award.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} In 2001 she was then awarded the President's Award for distinction.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}

Bell served as chair of the department from 2000 to 2005, then stepping down to become [[professor emeritus]]; she took early retirement due to an inability to cope following her diagnosis with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 2000.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=x}} In 2005, the University of Chicago Divinity School named her "Alumna of the Year", on their website praising her as "a great scholar and teacher... [and] a skilled administrator".{{sfn|Divinity School|2004}}{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} She began work on a new project, ''Believing: Assuming Universality, Describing Particularity in the Study of Religion'', funded by another fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, but it was left unfinished at the time of her death.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Her unfinished manuscript, titled ''Believing and the Practice of Religion'', was later stored in Santa Clara's university library.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=ix}}

Bell died aged 55 on 23 May 2008, after a long illness.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} She was survived by her mother, sister, three brothers, and husband, Steven Gelber, who was a professor of history at Santa Clara.{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} The chair of the Santa Clara religious studies department, Paul Crowley, described her as "a magnificent colleague, a scholar of international standing, [and] an inspiring mentor to generations of students".{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}} Historian of religion Reza Aslan asserted that she would be remembered for generations to come due to her "rigorous scholarship", and that she was "unmatched" as an academic. Having known her personally, Aslan also commented on her "razor sharp wit, her boundless compassion, and refusal to accept anything but the best from her students."{{sfn|Aslan|2009|pp=vii&amp;ndash;viii}}

==Published work==

===''Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice''===
The work was published in two editions, the original Oxford University Press edition in 1992, and an edition also from Oxford University Press in 2009 with a new prologue, which is also available in electronic versions.  Both editions share the same pagination.

Religious studies scholar Diane Jonte-Pace opined that the book "changed the framework for understanding the nature and function of ritual", constituting Bell's "greatest contribution" to religious studies.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=vii}} Having known Bell personally, Jonte-Pace thought that the book exhibited her "fearless intellectual style" and "sense of freedom" from past frameworks.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=viii}} Historian of religion Reza Aslan claimed that it "launched a revolution" in the way that scholars understood the subject, becoming "required reading" for students of religious studies.{{sfn|Aslan|2009|p=vii}}

It was awarded "Best First Book in the History of Religions" from the [[American Academy of Religion]] in 1994.{{sfn|Jonte-Pace|2009|p=viii}}{{sfn|Santa Clara Magazine|2008}}

Because of the importance of this work for the field of ritual studies, a survey of the work is in order.  The book is organized into three major sections:  "The Practice of Ritual Theory" (chapters 1-3), which generally surveys the prior work in the field and situates Bell's book in that context; "The Sense of Ritual" (chapters 4-6), which develops the concept of ritual in terms of bodies and the external systems within which they work; and "Ritual and Power" (chapters 7-9), which frames the discussion of ritual in society, with the attending questions of power and authority.

====Chapter 1, Constructing Ritual====
Catherine Bell introduces the study of ritual theory in chapter 1. (19) She presents the idea of dichotomies and how they differentiate between conceptual blueprints (such as beliefs and myths) and ritual (something acted out). Ritual is seen as a performance of conceptual orientations. (19) Bell integrates the ideas and theories of [[Edward Shils]], [[Durkheim]], [[Stanley Tambiah]], [[Victor Turner]], [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Levi-Strauss|Claude Levi-Strauss]] all pertaining to ritual studies. Ritual is understood as a structural mechanism that reintegrates the two opposing dichotomies of thought and action, which is equivalent to the belief and behavior dichotomy. (20) In the sense of community, ritual is seen as a way to create a collective set of beliefs or ideals. In an ever changing society, ritual is the bridge between tradition and constant social change. (20) Ritual symbolism plays a role in the natural struggle of humans with their moral self and external “socio-political” order and constraints of the world. (24) However, this theory of ritual symbolism is seen as incomplete because 1) it does not have any cultural analysis in its explanation and 2) it does not take into consideration the duality of human nature. Bell reestablishes the different dichotomies that are at play against one another: continuity and change, individual experience and social forms, beliefs and behaviors, and thought and action. (25)

====Chapter 2, Constructing Meaning====
Catherine Bell maintains the idea that a successful ritual is one in which both cultural and sociological aspects work together. (34, 35) Bell bases her model of ritual on three elements: ritual as an activity, as a fusion of thought and activity, and the [[dichotomy]] between actor and thinker. (31) Ritual performs and enacts a system of symbols by integrating the conceptual and dispositional (i.e., the worldview and ethos). Ritual actors integrate worldview and the [[ethos]] (conceptual and dispositional) while the theorist integrates these conceptual categories. (32)

Building on the idea of the "acting actor", (31) ritual is now seen as “cultural performance” (37) and is “dramatisized”. (38)  Comparing symbols with either [[indexicality]] or iconicity allows for many interpretations of symbolism. (42) Iconicity, for example, within [[Christianity]] might include all images of a man hanging on a cross symbolize to a [[crucifix]] (reference: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/crucifix) . Ritual may be understood as communication among people, rather than individuals with the [[divine]]. (43) An Islamic example might be going to "[[jumu'ah]]" so others perceive the actor as pious. After a debate of what meaning is, from the views of [[Clifford Geertz]] and [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]], the next dichotic lens in which to view ritual is drama vs. performance. (43-44) Drama insinuates the individual participating in the ritual is like an [[actor]]; they are simply doing the actions and saying things, while their internal thoughts are irrelevant. (43) [[Performance]] may simply be the act of the ritual, the participant may be disregarded. Through text analogy one may see ritual as a text. (43) Text may be seen as unchanging, knowable and designed to be knowable, yet when studying text one may interpret and analyze it for oneself; that allows for variation of meaning, change over time, fluidity, which is essential for ritual. (43-45) However, texts are made to communicate directly with a reader, yet not all rituals communicate in the same way. (45)

====Chapter 5, The Ritual Body====
The body is seen in various ways with different functionalities and uses, where some view its purpose as a connector between the individual and society. (94) Bell discusses the ideas of [[Durkheim]], [[Mauss]], and [[Hertz]] on the body, arguing that bodily expressions are social in nature and acquired in practice. (94) In contrast to this perception, Bell includes [[Lakoff]]’s argument that these basic categories are inherent and rooted in the sociobiological body. (96) Bell argues that the body is no longer a physical instrument to perform rituals but in fact a social body that connects to society. (97)

The ritualized body is one that contains a ‘sense’ of values of ritual.(98) The ritual body is produced through interactions of the body with structure and a structured environment, therefore forming a relationship between the body and the environment around it, such as Muslims' prayer in a [[mosque]]. The actions that take place in a “ritual space” have a connection to the environment because it molds the way the environment is presented.(100) Yet the physical actions such as standing up straight or kneeling down during ''[[salat]]'' do not express inner states such as emotions or intentions of the individual. What one individual sees in terms of ritual action is not the display of one’s inner state or values.(100) Many rituals take part in certain performances that are mandated by the authority of history, such as Muslims sacrificing animals on the day of [[Eid Al-Adha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonsighting.com/articles/adha-paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525201545/http://www.moonsighting.com/articles/adha-paper.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If one believes in the exact repetition of an age-old ritual in the present day then no ritual style is autonomous.(101)

Bell describes a hierarchical system created via linguistic or physical means and organized by the creation of oppositions through ritualization. (104) She describes that although these oppositions may be in contrast, they do not always necessarily balance one another out, and some dominate over others (for example, the receiving of Eucharist (or the inner) dominates the act of lifting and lowering heads (or the outer) in the Catholic church). (102) She describes how the body molds a ritualized agent through the production of a structured environment based on oppositions. (106) However, this interaction of body and environment, or ritualization, simply shifts the nature of social problems to endless circular schemes, where no resolution is produced, only implied. (106-7)

Bell holds, ritualized agents see their purpose, but not what they actually do in ritually changing a situation. This is what she states [[Althusser]] views as the “...intrinsic blindness of practice.” (108) As far as ritual and language are concerned, Bell states that there are two main controversies: first, comparing ritual language to verbal/textual language; second, the role of aforementioned verbal/textual language in ritual. (110)  Bell mentions Tambiah and other scholars see ritual communication as not only another form of expression, but a way of expressing things that would be impossible to express in any other manner. (111) Bell argues language may be the most important part of some rituals. (113) She closes this section stating, “That is to say within the medium of formally explicit discourse, there is nothing there to grasp, just a variety of culturally instinctive and flexible schemes with which to avoid and undermine everything but the ritual acts themselves.” (114)

Since there is a difference between thought and action in ritual the same idea applies for what theoretical practice sees and does not see itself doing (the object-unity of theoretical discourse). (114) Seeing and not-seeing is the production of agents embodying sense of ritual constituted by and expressed in particular schemes of ritualization.(114) The schemes start to shape the world and spread out causing disposition of ritualization.(115) Shared culture may strategically transform the way one group practices from another in terms of the simple alterations of actions in ritual, which are then deployed around the area.The saying "[[fake it till you make it]]" is a good way to sum up the thoughts of Bell because as children are younger they learn so many rituals in our respective faiths but it is not until later in life that they give those rituals meaning and practice them as more than mere action. It is necessary to explore the actual contexts of ritualization by looking at a more accurate actions for ritualization, and the history behind the traditions practiced.(117)

====Chapter 8, Ritual, Belief, and Ideology====
In chapter 8, Bell evaluates the symbiotic relationship between ritual and belief. (182) Bell states that ritual is typically viewed as an expression of belief and holds social power, which generates change. (182) Bell believes that religious belief is understood in many different ways and that personal interpretation makes it difficult to analyze in a social context, despite being social in nature. (183) Bell also points out that belief is complex and its association with ritual is challenged. The intended belief behind ritual may be misunderstood by the participants, indicating that their participation in the ritual may not necessarily support or understand the initial institutional belief. (183)

Bell gives a detailed description of two notions of [[ideology]].  Although Bell describes two views, she discusses ideology implemented within a society as a way for the dominant class to maintain power and control. (188-92) Bell maintains [[Gramsci]]’s belief that the dominated class rarely passively accepts and internalizes the dominant class' values, but instead consents to a more appropriate alternative. (190)  She concludes that in this way, ideology is a unifying form of power which creates a greater distribution of control than relationships that exist with the use of pure force. (193)

Bell’s presentation maintains the notion that ritual, political power and legitimation of power are  three interdependent theories. Historically, ritual was cast as a mere “artifice” used to conceal the "brute exercise of real power". Thus sacred kingships throughout the past centuries used ritual as a tool to install hierarchy and fulfill political agendas. She invites the readers to question ritual as no longer a self-fulfilling tool but also a power tool for mass governance. Ritual constructs an argument, all while maintaining social order. It does not ‘disguise the exercise of power’ - it is in itself the power.

====Chapter 9, The Power of Ritualization====
[[power (social and political)|Power]] and [[authority]] play a strong role in Bell’s view of ritual: one does not necessarily have both. (197) A person in power may use that control to affect views within society, limiting other’s individual autonomy. (198) The power may be used through [[symbolic power]], where it may be used to help understand the actions and meanings of the world. (199) The top of the hierarchy only has power if the bottom responds to the directions from the top. (200) The individual, she concludes, is ultimately in power. (203) Bell seems to present the power relationship between individuals and society as a complex strategy to organize social norms. (204)

One aspect of ritualization is the differentiation and privileging of certain activities. (204) Features by which these activities differentiate themselves are not universal. Since ritual is a “way of acting” that is distinguished by a certain culture or situation, generalizing ritual strategies into a universal phenomenon undermines its logic. (205) Ritualizing strategies may be implemented without the involvement of religious activities. The purpose of ritualization might be to incite a controversy or to create certain impressions. Any moderately socialized person may use ritualization, both in its cultural and situational forms, as a strategy by distinguishing or blurring the boundary that makes an activity a “specific way of acting”. (206) Bell suggests that the deployment of ritualization is the construction of power relationships - one of domination, consent or resistance. While ritualization may be an effective strategy of power in some certain conditions, it has specific limits and may even be counterproductive in other scenarios. (206) Ritualization has two basic dimensions. The first dimension is the dynamics of the social body and its projection of a structured environment, where ritualization produces and objectifies the constructions of power. (207) The second dimension illustrates the limits of most ritual practice, which is the empowerment of those who were initially controlled by ritual relations, due to the fact that participation in ritual activities requires a conscious consent. (209) Bell then emphasizes that both participation in ritualization and objectification of power are negotiated processes, and since ritualization may foster a misrecognition of the level of consensus, it limits the social efficacy of ritualization and affects both those who dominate and those who are dominated. (210)

Ritualization may be viewed as a source of power and authority for people in a position to influence ritual, and as a source of power for the individual. (211)  In one form, ritual may be seen as a “‘blunt tool.’” (212) Bell asserts that ritual power is interpreted as an external power tapped into by whoever holds an office. She maintains that there are three forms of empowerment for those in charge of ritualization:  objectification of office, hierarchization of practices, and creating tradition. (211) Furthermore, in some ways ritual defines the self. Tambiah and Bloch in contrast to some other scholars view the formalization of ritual as furthering the divide between one’s sense of self and one’s ritual practices. (216) Bell in part looks at ritual through the lens of individual empowerment. "The person who has prayed to his or her god, appropriating the social schemes of the hegemonic order in terms of an individual redemption, may be stronger because these acts are the very definitions of power, personhood, and the ability to act.” (217-8)

===''Ritual:  Perspectives and Dimensions''===
Bell's second major work was published in  1997.  She intended it to be "a more holistic and pragmatic orientation to multiple dimensions of the phenomenon of ritual" &lt;ref&gt;Bell, ''Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions''. Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1997, ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

A musical '''clinic''' is an informal meeting with a guest [[musician]], where a small-to-medium-sized [[audience]] questions the musician's styles and techniques and also how to improve their own skill. The musician might perform an entire [[Musical piece|piece]], or demonstrate certain techniques for the audience to observe. 

The objective is for the audience to learn from the guest musician. A musical clinic can apply to any type of [[musical instrument]], music or player. The clinics are often held at a musical instrument stores.

The '''Ducal hat of Liechtenstein''' (German: ''Herzogshut'') is a former crown of the [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Princes of Liechtenstein]], who were also [[Duchy of Troppau|Dukes of Troppau and Jägerndorf]]. It went missing in the 18th century.

== History ==
The ducal hat of Liechtenstein was commissioned in 1623 by Prince [[Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Karl I of Liechtenstein]] and completed in 1626. It was discovered to be missing in 1781,&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Liechtenstein: The Princely Collections {{ISBN|0-87099-385-2}} Metropolitan Museum of Art, Middle Village, New York, U.S.A., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; following the death of Prince [[Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Franz Joseph I]], and it remains lost to the [[House of Liechtenstein]] since that time.

In 1976, the people of Liechtenstein presented a replica of the crown to Prince [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Franz Josef II]] on his 70th birthday.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; The replica is based on the only drawing of the crown, dated 1756, and is [http://www.tourismus.li/en/our-country/Liechtenstein-highlights/Highlights-Liechtenstein/Princely-Crown-National-Museum on display in the Liechtenstein National Museum].

The circlet of the crown was modeled on the circlet of the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]], while eight jeweled acanthus leaves, alternately large and small, rested on the rim of the circlet. As with the imperial crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], the precious stones used in this crown were white (diamonds and pearls) and red (rubies or red spinels), which may have had some alchemist significance. Inside the crown was a red velvet cap topped with a large jeweled button.

The gems used on the crown were chosen in accordance with the alchemical principles subscribed to in the Rudolphine Court, with the crown apparently being designed to protect its possessor against evil.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gembook"&gt;Gemmarum et lapidum historia (Hanau, 1609)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Emperor Rudolph's physician, [[Anselmus de Boodt]] (1550–1632), diamonds have an inherent power that wards off evil spirits, rubies protect against illness and poison and will warn the wearer when danger threatens by turning dark, and pearls strengthen the health of the wearer and counter the effects of poison.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qbook"&gt;Quellenband, {{ISBN|3-205-06271-X}} (EAN: 9783205062714 / 978-3205062714, Böhlau 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

The only depiction of the original crown dates from 1756, a [[gouache]] painting that is kept in the [[Liechtenstein Museum]].

[[File:Abraham Dharma.png|thumb|right|300px|Distribution of Eastern religions today (yellow), as opposed to [[Abrahamic religions]] (purple).]]
The '''Eastern religions''' are the [[religion]]s originating in [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and thus having dissimilarities with [[Western religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Eastern Religions: Origins, Beliefs, Practices, Holy Texts, Sacred Places |last1= Coogan |first1=Michael David |last2=Narayanan|first2=Vasudha|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]  |year=2005 |isbn=0195221907}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[East Asian religions]] ([[Shintoism]], [[Korean Shamanism|Sindoism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]), [[Indian religions]] ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Jainism]]) as well as [[animism|animistic]] [[indigenous religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Readings in Eastern Religions|editor-last1=Coward |editor-first1=Harold G.|editor-last2=Neumaier-Dargyay |editor-first2=Eva K. |editor-last3=Neufeldt |editor-first3=Ronald|publisher=[[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]] |year=1988 |isbn=0889209553|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Religions: Eastern Traditions, Volume 2|last1=Gurdon Oxtoby |first1=Willard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0195407504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This East-West religious distinction, just as with the [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] culture distinction, and the implications that arise from it, is broad and not precise. Furthermore, the geographical distinction has less meaning in the current context of global [[transculturation]].

While many [[Western culture|Western]] observers attempt to distinguish between [[Eastern philosophies]] and religions, this is a distinction that does not exist in some Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (2001). Pp 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian religions==
[[File:Temple hindu1.jpg|thumb|170px|A [[Hindu]] temple in [[Sri Lanka]].]]
{{details|Indian religions}}
Religions originating in the [[Indian subcontinent]] include [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;York (2005). Pg 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologies and philosophies of these religions have several concepts in common, such as ''[[dharma]]'', ''[[karma]]'', ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' and ''[[samsara]]''.

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism}}
[[File:Golden Aum.png|thumb|left|140px|[[Om|OM]], a sacred syllable and a quintessential symbol of Hinduism]]
[[File:Museum für Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 036 2.jpg|right|thumb|130px|A 13th century [[Cambodia]]n statue of [[Vishnu]].]]
Hinduism originated on the Indian subcontinent. It is considered by some to be the world's oldest extant major religion. Hinduism contains a vast body of [[scripture]], divided as [[Śruti|revealed]] and [[smriti|remembered]], expounding on dharma, or religious living. Hindus consider the ''[[Vedas]]'' and the ''[[Upanishads]]'' as being among the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{IAST|Bhagavad Gītā}}]]'', a treatise excerpted from the ''{{IAST|Mahābhārata}}'', is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the ''Vedas''. It is difficult to identify any universal belief or practice in Hinduism, although prominent themes include: ''[[Dharma]]'', ''[[Samsara]]'', ''[[Karma]]'', and ''[[Moksha]]''. Hinduism is sometimes called a [[polytheistic religion]], but this is an oversimplification. Hinduism includes a diverse collection of schools whose beliefs span [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], [[monism]] and even [[Atheism in Hinduism|atheism]]. For instance, the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school holds that there is only one causal entity ([[Brahman]]), which manifests itself into all the various living and non-living forms that we observe, whereas traditions such as [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]] worship [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] in a relatively more monotheistic sense (caused by a differentiation between the [[parabrahman]] and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]). A number of scholars even consider the [[Samkhya]] school of thought to have atheistic leanings.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskarananda (1994).&lt;br /&gt;Weightman (1997). Pg 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[File:Hong Kong Budha.jpg|thumb|130px|right|The [[Tian Tan Buddha]] statue in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{main|Buddhism}}
Buddhism is a [[Nontheistic religions|nontheistic]] [[Indian religions|Indian religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Buddhism was founded around the 5th century [[BCE]] in [[India]] by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the Buddha, with the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Eightfold Path]] as its central principles. According to the scriptures, the Four Noble Truths were revealed by the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. The schools of Buddhism are typically divided into [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]]. In academic circles, Mahayana is further divided into [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Buddhism teaches that someone who becomes [[bodhi|enlightened]] without instruction is a [[Buddhahood|buddha]]. The primary goal of Buddhism is the liberation of the practitioner from [[samsara]]. Buddhists hold this to be the solution to the problem of suffering.

===Jainism===
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|130px|right|This is the holiest [[Jain symbol]].]]
{{main|Jainism}}
Jainism is the religion of the followers of [[Mahavira]]. He is said to be the 24th [[Tirthankara]], or the 24th in a line of teachers espousing Jain principles. Jains reject the [[Veda]]s and highlight the practice of austerity. Jain philosophy states that the [[jiva]], or soul, can escape the cycle of rebirth and death through strict ethical behavior. When nothing remains but the purity of the jiva, that person is called a ''jina'', or winner, which is the origin of the term Jain. [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]] is viewed as an accumulation that burdens the soul, causing attachment and suffering. [[Ahimsa]], or non-violence, is central to Jain faith, philosophy and practice. It is interpreted very strictly as prohibiting all forms of harm to other living beings. Due to this, Jainism requires a strict [[Jain vegetarianism|vegetarian]] lifestyle. ''Ahimsa'' also applies to speaking, as one's words can cause harm and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996). Pg 76.&lt;br /&gt;Fisher (1997). Pp 116-117.&lt;br /&gt;Rausch &amp; Key (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
{{main|Sikhism}}
[[File:Khanda.svg|left|80px]]
Sikhism is a religion which began in Punjab of [[Northern India]]. It is founded on the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev]] and the nine human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]] that followed. He received a vision to preach the way to enlightenment and God in Sultanpur. His views rejected the traditional worships and caste of the Hindu faith. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sikhism.htm] Religions of the World Sikhism&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom from reincarnation is tied to remembrance and repetition on one universal God. God is formless and simultaneously in every form. Sikhs believe that there is one universal God who is the ultimate creator, sustainer, and destroyer. The [[Gurū Granth Sāhib]] are the central scriptures intended to preserve hymns and the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and other saints from Hindu and Sufi traditions. Rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship are considered of little use and Sikhs are discouraged from fasting or going on pilgrimages. The tenets of Sikhism include (1) honest living/earning (2) tithing and giving alms (3) chanting on God. Sikhism also has a strong warrior tradition which arose in defense of religious freedom and human rights from a tyrannical [[Moghul]] occupation of India.

==East Asian religions==
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
The group of [[East Asia]]n religions or philosophies share the concept of [[Tao]]. They may be considered as forming a group within [[world religion]]s&lt;ref&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp 71-72, 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] or [[Dharmic religion|Dharmic]] groups. The Taoic faiths claim at least 500 million members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html Religious population statistics]. These statistics are limited and do not reflect the full population of Taoic adherents due to complexities in definition and polling.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
{{main|Taoism}}
Taoism, also known as Daoism, comprises a variety of related religious and philosophical traditions. Categorization of Taoist sects and movements is very controversial. Taoist propriety and ethics places an emphasis on the [[Three Jewels of the Tao]]; love, moderation, humility. Taoist theology focuses on doctrines of [[wu wei]] ("non-action"), spontaneity, [[humanism]], [[relativism]] and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (1999). Pg 111.&lt;br /&gt;Slingerland (2003).&lt;br /&gt;Sharot (2001). Pg 78.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most traditional Chinese Taoists are polytheistic. There are disagreements regarding the proper composition of this pantheon. Popular Taoism typically presents the [[Jade Emperor]] as the head [[deity]]. Intellectual, or "elite", Taoism usually presents [[Laozi]] and the [[Three Pure Ones]] at the top of the pantheon. Nature and ancestor spirits are common in popular Taoism. But this sort of [[shamanism]] is eschewed for an emphasis on [[internal alchemy]] among the "elite" Taoists. Tao itself is rarely an object of worship, being treated more like the South Asian concept of [[wikt:atman|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal (2006). Pg 50. Maspero (1981). Pg 41. LaFargue (1994). Pg 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinto===
[[File:Priest at Dazaifu Tenmagu shrine 1.JPG|right|thumb|140px|A Shinto priest kneeling before a shrine.]]
{{main|Shinto}}
Shinto is an animistic [[folk religion]] practiced in Japan. Shinto literally means "the way of the gods". Many Japanese Shintoists also identify themselves as Buddhists. Japanese [[Pure Land Buddhism]] is deeply intertwined with the Shinto faith. Shinto practitioners commonly affirm tradition, family, nature, cleanliness and ritual observation as core values. Taoic influence is significant in their beliefs about nature and self-mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Pilgrim (1999). Pg 1.&lt;br /&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp. 161-162.&lt;br /&gt;Ono (2004). Pp 97-99, 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ritual cleanliness]] is a central part of Shinto life. [[Shrines]] have a significant place in Shintoism, reflecting the animistic veneration of the [[kami]]. "Folk", or "popular", Shinto places an emphasis on shamanism, particularly [[divination]], [[spirit possession]] and [[faith healing]]. "Sect" Shinto is a diverse group including mountain-worshippers and Confucian Shintoists.&lt;ref&gt;Ono (2004). Pp 12, 51-52, 108.&lt;br /&gt;Markham (2001). Pp 304-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
[[File:Confuciusstatue.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Statue of Confucius on Chongming Island in Shanghai]]
{{main|Confucianism}}
Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social and political thought, influential in the history of East Asia. It is debatable whether Confucianism is a religion or simply an ethical system. It is commonly associated with [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] but it rejects legalism for [[ritualism]]. It also endorses [[meritocracy]] as the ideal of [[nobility]]. Confucianism has a complicated system governing duties and etiquette in relationships. Confucian ethics focus on familial duty, loyalty and humaneness.&lt;ref&gt;Smart (2000). Pp 66.&lt;br /&gt;Yao (2000). pp 191-192&lt;br /&gt;De Bary &amp; Tu (1998). Pg 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Confucianism tolerates the Chinese folk recognition of the existence of animistic spirits, [[ghosts]] and [[deities]]. It approves paying them proper respect, but at a more fundamental level encourages avoiding them. Confucian thought is notable as the framework upon which the syncretic [[Neo-Confucianism]] was built.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp 46, 85.&lt;br /&gt;Huang (1999). Pg 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''EpiDoc''' Collaborative, building recommendations for structured [[markup language|markup]] of [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] documents in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] [[XML]], was originally formed in 2000 by scholars at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]: Tom Elliott, the former director of the Ancient World Mapping Center, with Hugh Cayless and Amy Hawkins. The guidelines have matured considerably through extensive discussion on the [http://lsv.uky.edu/archives/markup.html Markup list] and other discussion fora, at several conferences, and through the experience of various pilot projects. The first major&amp;mdash;but not by any means the only&amp;mdash;epigraphic project to adopt and pilot the EpiDoc recommendations were the Inscriptions of [[Aphrodisias]] and [[Vindolanda Tablets]] Online in 2002-4, and the guidelines reached a degree of stability for the first time in that period. EpiDoc has since been adopted as the native format for the Greek [[Papyrology]] site, Papyri.info.

The EpiDoc [[XML schema|schema]] and guidelines may also be applied, perhaps with some local modification to related palaeographical fields including [[Sigillography]], and [[Numismatics]].

==Guidelines and Schema==
The EpiDoc Guidelines are available in two forms:
# the stable guidelines, released periodically &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/ EpiDoc Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the source code, available in its most up-to-date form in the EpiDoc Sourceforge repository. The Guidelines source files are a series of XML documents, plus XSLT to transform them to the web version. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/guidelines/ SourceForge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EpiDoc Schema is also available in two forms:
# the latest stable version of the schema, which may be linked to directly by XML documents. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/schema/latest/tei-epidoc.rng Latest EpiDoc Schema]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the source code, available in its most up-to-date form in the EpiDoc SourceForge repository. &lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/schema/ EpiDoc ODD at Sourceforge]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
Other tools developed by and for the EpiDoc community include:
* The EpiDoc Reference Stylesheets (XSLT), available from the SourceForge file repository. These stylesheets are also used to deliver the online Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Stylesheets/ EpiDoc Reference Stylesheets]&lt;/ref&gt;
* CHET-C (the Chapel Hill Electronic Text-Converter), an application originally written in VBA, then as a free-standing [[Java (programming language)|Java]] app, and now available as a self-contained [[Javascript]] platform written by Hugh Cayless. &lt;ref&gt;[http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/chet-c/chetc.html Online CHET-C version]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transcoder: a Java tool for converting between Beta Code, Unicode NF C, Unicode NF D, and GreekKeys encoding for Greek script on the fly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/epidoc/files/Transcoder/ Transcode]&lt;/ref&gt;
* EFES (EpiDoc Front-End Services): an "out of the box" software package for the publication of EpiDoc collections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/EpiDoc/EFES EFES codebase in Github]; [https://github.com/EpiDoc/EFES/wiki/ Documentation and User Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Equal Rights Amendment''' ('''ERA''') is a [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Proposing amendments|proposed amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] designed to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex; it seeks to end the legal distinctions between men and women in terms of [[divorce]], [[property]], [[Employment discrimination|employment]], and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SZK5BwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA425&amp;dq=wladaver-morgan%20susan%20equal%20rights%20amendment&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q=wladaver-morgan%20susan%20equal%20rights%20amendment&amp;f=false|title=American Economic History: A Dictionary and Chronology: A Dictionary and Chronology|last=Olson|first=James S.|last2=Mendoza|first2=Abraham O.|date=2015-04-28|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610696982|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ERA was originally written by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Crystal Eastman]]. The amendment was introduced in [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the first time in 1921 and has prompted conversations about the meaning of legal equality for women and men ever since.

In the early history of the Equal Rights Amendment, middle-class women were largely supportive, while those speaking for the working class were often opposed, pointing out that employed women needed special protections regarding working conditions and employment hours. With the rise of the [[Women's Movement in the United States (1963-1982)|women's movement in the United States]] during the 1960s, the ERA garnered increasing support, and, after being reintroduced by U.S. Representative [[Martha Griffiths]] (D-Michigan), in 1971, it was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] on October 12 of that year and on March 22, 1972, it was approved by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], thus submitting the ERA to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for ratification, as provided for in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V of the U.S. Constitution]].

Congress had originally set a ratification deadline of March 22, 1979, for the state legislatures to consider the ERA. Through 1977, the amendment received 35 of the necessary 38 state [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification of amendments|ratifications]]. With wide, bipartisan support (including that of both major political parties, both houses of Congress, and Presidents [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Eric C.|date=2015-06-19|title=Phyllis Schlafly's "Positive" Freedom: Liberty, Liberation, and the Equal Rights Amendment|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/584317|journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs|volume=18|issue=2|pages=277–300|issn=1534-5238}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ERA seemed destined for ratification until [[Phyllis Schlafly]] mobilized [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] women in opposition, arguing that the ERA would disadvantage [[housewives]] and cause women to be drafted into the military.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032702357_pf.html|title=New Drive Afoot to Pass Equal Rights Amendment|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five state legislatures (Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee, and South Dakota) voted to revoke their ERA ratifications. Four claim to have rescinded their ratifications before the original March 22, 1979 ratification deadline, while the South Dakota legislature did so by voting to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] its ratification as of that original deadline. However, it remains a legal question as to whether a state can revoke its ratification of a federal constitutional amendment.

In 1978, Congress passed (by simple majorities in each house), and President Carter signed, a joint resolution with the intent of extending the ratification deadline to June 30, 1982. Because no additional state legislatures ratified the ERA between March 22, 1979 and June 30, 1982, the validity of that disputed extension was rendered academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-neuwirth-equal-rights-amendment-for-women-metoo-20180105-story.html|title=Unbelievably, women still don't have equal rights in the Constitution|date=January 5, 2018|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2017, the 45th anniversary of Congress' submission of the ERA to the nation's state lawmakers, the [[Nevada Legislature]] became the first to ratify the ERA after the expiration of both deadlines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/21/520962541/nevada-on-cusp-of-ratifying-equal-rights-amendment-35-years-after-deadline|title=Nevada Ratifies The Equal Rights Amendment ... 35 Years After The Deadline|author1=Colin Dwyer|author2=Carrie Kaufman|date=March 21, 2017|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its adoption of Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 (designated as "POM-15" by the U.S. Senate and published verbatim in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of April 5, 2017, at pages S2361 and S2362).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2017-04-04/pdf/CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2361.pdf#page=1|title=Congressional Record - April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Illinois General Assembly]] then ratified the ERA on May 30, 2018 with its adoption of Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment No. 4 (designated as "POM-299" by the U.S. Senate and likewise published verbatim in the ''Congressional Record'' of September 12, 2018, at page S6141).&lt;ref&gt;((cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2018-09-12/pdf/CREC-2018-09-12-pt1-PgS6141-3.pdf#page=1|title=Congressional Record - September 12, 2018))&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Alice paul.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Paul]] toasting (with grape juice) the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. August 26, 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|title=Who Was Alice Paul?|website=Alice Paul Institute|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On September 25, 1921, the [[National Woman's Party]] announced plans to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to guarantee women equal rights with men. The text of the proposed amendment read:

{{quote|Section 1. No political, civil, or legal disabilities or inequalities on account of sex or on account of marriage, unless applying equally to both sexes, shall exist within the United States or any territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof.

Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.&lt;ref name=BaltSun&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=[[c:File:Equal Rights Amendment proposed in Congress 1921.jpg|WOMAN'S PARTY ALL READY FOR EQUALITY FIGHT; Removal Of All National and State Discriminations Is Aim. SENATE AND HOUSE TO GET AMENDMENT; A Proposed Constitutional Change To Be Introduced On October 1]]|last=Henning|first=Arthur Sears|date=26 September 1921|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|access-date=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alice Paul, the head of the National Women's Party, believed that the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] would not be enough to ensure that men and women were treated equally regardless of sex. In 1923, she revised the proposed amendment to read:

{{quote|Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Alice Paul|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|website=Alice Paul Institute|access-date=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paul named this version the [[Lucretia Mott]] Amendment, after a female abolitionist who fought for women's rights and attended the First Women's Rights Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/lucretia-mott.htm.|title="Lucretia Mott" National Park Service|website=National Park Service|publisher=United States Government|access-date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Alice Paul further revised the amendment to reflect the wording of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] and Nineteenth Amendments. This text became Section 1 of the version passed by Congress in 1972.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/336era.html|title=Equal Rights Amendments, 1923-1972|website=history.hanover.edu|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, in the 1940s, ERA opponents proposed an alternative, which provided that "no distinctions on the basis of sex shall be made except such as are reasonably justified by differences in physical structure, biological differences, or social function." It was quickly turned down by both pro and anti-ERA coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ioM-8naFn60C|title=Moving the Mountain: The Women's Movement in America Since 1960|last=Davis|first=Flora|date=1999-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252067822|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminists split===
Since the 1920s, the Equal Rights Amendment has been accompanied by discussion among [[Feminism|feminists]] about the meaning of women's equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Judith|last=Sealander|title=Feminist Against Feminist: The First Phase of the Equal Rights Amendment Debate, 1923–1963|journal=South Atlantic Quarterly|year=1982|volume=81|issue=2|pages=147–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Paul]] and her [[National Woman's Party]] asserted that women should be on equal terms with men in all regards, even if that means sacrificing benefits given to women through protective legislation, such as shorter work hours and no night work or heavy lifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nancy|last=Cott|title=Feminist Politics in the 1920s: The National Woman's Party |journal=[[Journal of American History]]|year=1984|volume=71|issue=1|pages=43–68|jstor=1899833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the amendment, such as the [[Women's Joint Congressional Committee]], believed that the loss of these benefits to women would not be worth the supposed gain to them in equality. Although it now appears courts would indeed consider physical distinctions when applying the amendment, and determine whether a compelling government interest was met by sex-based government classifications, those discussing the amendment at the time had not yet seen the thoughtful Constitutional interpretations relating to civil rights and sex-based classifications that occurred years later. In 1924, ''The Forum'' hosted a debate between [[Doris Stevens]] and [[Alice Hamilton]] concerning the two perspectives on the proposed amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Susan|editor-last=Ware|chapter=New Dilemmas for Modern Women|title=Modern American Women: A Documentary History|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=1997|isbn=0-07-071527-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their debate reflected the wider tension in the developing feminist movement of the early 20th century between two approaches toward gender equality. One approach emphasized the common humanity of women and men, while the other stressed women's unique experiences and how they were different from men, seeking recognition for specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nancy|last=Cott|authorlink=Nancy Cott|title=The Grounding of Modern Feminism|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-300-04228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition to the ERA was led by [[Mary Anderson (labor leader)|Mary Anderson]] and the [[Women's Bureau]] beginning in 1923. These feminists argued that legislation including mandated minimum wages, safety regulations, restricted daily and weekly hours, lunch breaks, and maternity provisions would be more beneficial to the majority of women who were forced to work out of economic necessity, not personal fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dorothy Sue|last=Cobble|title=The Other Women's Movement: Workplace Justice and Social Rights in Modern America|location=Princeton, New Jersey|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|page=51|isbn=0-691-06993-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate also drew from struggles between working class and professional women. Alice Hamilton, in her speech "Protection for Women Workers," said that the ERA would strip working women of the small protections they had achieved, leaving them powerless to further improve their condition in the future, or to attain necessary protections in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Genora Johnson|last=Dollinger|chapter=Women and Labor Militancy|editor-first=Susan|editor-last=Ware|title=Modern American Women: A Documentary History|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=1997|isbn=0-07-071527-0|pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Woman's Party]] already had tested its approach in [[Wisconsin]], where it won passage of the Wisconsin Equal Rights Law in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Genevieve G.|last=McBride|chapter=‘Forward’ Women: Winning the Wisconsin Campaign for the Country's First ERA, 1921|editor-first=Peter G.

Instead, it was usually blocked in committee; except in 1946, when it was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 35 — not receiving the required two-thirds supermajority.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Hayden rider and protective labor legislation===
In 1950 and 1953, the ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as "the Hayden rider", introduced by [[Arizona]] Senator [[Carl Hayden]]. The Hayden rider added a sentence to the ERA to keep special protections for women: "The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex." By allowing women to keep their existing and future special protections, it was expected that the ERA would be more appealing to its opponents. Though opponents were marginally more in favor of the ERA with the Hayden rider, supporters of the original ERA believed it negated the amendment's original purpose—causing the amendment not to be passed in the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt6f59n89c&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text|title=Conversations with Alice Paul: Woman Suffrage and the Equal Rights Amendment.|website=cdlib.org|publisher=Suffragists Oral History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/eraname.htm|title=What's in a Name?

ERA supporters were hopeful that the second term of President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] would advance their agenda. Eisenhower had publicly promised to "assure women everywhere in our land equality of rights," and in 1958, Eisenhower asked a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, the first president to show such a level of support for the amendment. However, the National Woman's Party found the amendment to be unacceptable and asked it to be withdrawn whenever the Hayden rider was added to the ERA.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] included support of the ERA in its platform beginning in [[1940 Republican National Convention|1940]], renewing the plank every four years until [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|pages=245–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ERA was strongly opposed by the [[American Federation of Labor]] and other labor unions, which feared the amendment would invalidate protective labor legislation for women. [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and most [[New Deal]]ers also opposed the ERA. They felt that ERA was designed for middle class women, but that working class women needed government protection. They also feared that the ERA would undercut the male-dominated labor unions that were a core component of the [[New Deal coalition]]. Most northern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], who aligned themselves with the anti-ERA labor unions, opposed the amendment.&lt;ref name="'70s 245" /&gt; The ERA was supported by southern Democrats and almost all Republicans.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], the Democrats made the divisive step of including the ERA in their platform, but the Democratic Party did not become united in favor of the amendment until congressional passage in 1972.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; The main support base for the ERA until the late 1960s was among middle class Republican women. The [[League of Women Voters]], formerly the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], opposed the Equal Rights Amendment until 1972, fearing the loss of protective labor legislation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===1960s===
[[File:Women in favor of ERA - Tallahassee (32611083663).jpg|thumb|left|Women in favor of ERA - Tallahassee]]
At the [[1960 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention in 1960]], a proposal to endorse the ERA was rejected after it met explicit opposition from liberal groups including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), the [[AFL–CIO]], labor unions such as the [[American Federation of Teachers]], [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA), the [[American Nurses Association]], the Women's Division of the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist Church]], and the National Councils of Jewish, Catholic, and Negro Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jo Freeman]]|title=A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF8ov6Vc4YQC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9805-9|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The losing side then demanded that presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] announce his support of the ERA; he did so in an October 21, 1960, letter to the chairman of the National Woman's Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=74146|author=Kennedy, John F|date=October 21, 1960|title=Letter to Mrs. Emma Guffey Miller, Chairman of the National Woman's Party|website=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kennedy was elected, he made [[Esther Peterson]] the highest-ranking woman in his administration as an Assistant Secretary of Labor. Peterson publicly opposed the Equal Rights Amendment based on her belief that it would weaken protective labor legislation.&lt;ref name="fofweb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=awhm0502&amp;DataType=Women&amp;WinType=Free|title=Peterson, Esther Eggertsen|work=Facts on File History Database|publisher=Infobase Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson referred to the National Woman's Party members, most of them veteran suffragists and preferred the "specific bills for specific ills" approach to equal rights.&lt;ref name="fofweb.com"/&gt; Ultimately, Kennedy's ties to labor unions meant that he and his administration did not support the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph M. Siracusa|title=Encyclopedia of the Kennedys: The People and Events That Shaped America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEojQDou7MIC&amp;pg=PA864|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=864|isbn=9781598845396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concession to feminists, Kennedy appointed a [[Blue-ribbon panel|blue-ribbon commission]] on women, the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|President's Commission on the Status of Women]], to investigate the problem of sex discrimination in the United States. The commission was chaired by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] who opposed the ERA but no longer spoke against it publicly. In the early 1960s, Eleanor Roosevelt announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA was no longer a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that, as far as she was concerned, they could have the amendment if they wanted it. However, she never went so far as to endorse the ERA. The commission that she chaired reported (after her death) that no ERA was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurine Hoffman Beasley|title=Eleanor Roosevelt and the Media: A Public Quest for Self-fulfillment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55XG0oS3XyYC&amp;pg=PA184|year=1987|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=184|isbn=9780252013768}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission did, though, help win passage of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] which banned sex discrimination in wages in a number of professions (it would later be amended in the early 1970s to include the professions that it initially excluded) and secured an [[executive order]] from Kennedy eliminating sex discrimination in the [[civil service]]. The commission, composed largely of anti-ERA feminists with ties to labor, proposed remedies to the widespread sex discrimination it unearthed and in its 1963 final report held that on the issue of equality "a constitutional amendment need not now be sought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Keetley|editor1-first=Dawn|editor2-last=Pettegrew|editor2-first=John|title=Public Women, Public Words: A Documentary History of American Feminism, Volume III: 1960 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDd2aNCoGlYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=251|isbn=9780742522367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national commission spurred the establishment of state and local commissions on the status of women and arranged for follow-up conferences in the years to come. The following year, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] banned workplace discrimination not only on the basis of race, religion, and national origin, but also on the basis of sex, thanks to the lobbying of [[Alice Paul]] and [[Coretta Scott King]] and the skillful politicking of Representative [[Martha Griffiths]] of [[Michigan]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

A new women's movement gained ground in the later 1960s as a result of a variety of factors: [[Betty Friedan]]'s bestseller ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''; the network of women's rights commissions formed by Kennedy's national commission; the frustration over women's social and economic status; and anger over the lack of government and [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In June 1966, at the Third National Conference on the Status of Women in [[Washington, D.C.]], Betty Friedan and a group of activists frustrated with the lack of government action in enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act formed the [[National Organization for Women]] to act as an "[[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] for women", demanding full equality for American women and men.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In 1967, at the urging of Alice Paul, NOW endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  The decision caused some union Democrats and social conservatives to leave the organization and form the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (within a few years WEAL also endorsed the ERA), but the move to support the amendment benefited NOW, bolstering its membership. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} By the late 1960s, NOW had made significant political and legislative victories and was gaining enough power to become a major lobbying force. In 1969, newly-elected Representative [[Shirley Chisholm]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] gave her famous speech "Equal Rights for Women" on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Congressional passage==
[[File:Martha Griffiths.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. Representative [[Martha W. Griffiths]] championed the ERA]]
In February 1970, NOW picketed the United States Senate, a subcommittee of which was holding hearings on a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18. NOW disrupted the hearings and demanded a hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment and won a meeting with Senators to discuss the ERA. That August, over 20,000 American women held a nationwide [[Women's Strike for Equality]] protest to demand full social, economic, and political equality.&lt;ref name=wommarch&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902696,00.html/ Nation, Women on] ''Time'' (New York), September 7, 1970 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406112028/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902696,00.html/|date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said [[Betty Friedan]] of the strike, "All kinds of women's groups all over the country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women's life which are still not addressed. For example, a question of equality before the law; we are interested in the Equal Rights Amendment." Despite being centered in New York City—which was regarded as one of the biggest strongholds for NOW and other groups sympathetic to the [[women's liberation movement]] such as [[Redstockings]]&lt;ref name=femis209&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rk966-N_rh0C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=women's+strike+for+equality+nation+second+wave+feminism#v=onepage&amp;q=women's%20strike%20for%20equality%20nation%20second%20wave%20feminism&amp;f=false|title=Becoming The Feminist Subject.

In Washington, D.C., protesters presented a sympathetic Senate leadership with a petition for the Equal Rights Amendment at the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]. Influential news sources such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' also supported the cause of the protestors.&lt;ref name=wommarch /&gt; Soon after the strike took place, activists distributed literature across the country as well.&lt;ref name=femis209 /&gt; In 1970, congressional hearings began on the ERA.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

On August 10, 1970, Michigan Democrat [[Martha Griffiths]] successfully brought the Equal Rights Amendment to the House Floor, after fifteen years of the joint resolution languishing in the House Judiciary Committee. The joint resolution passed in the House and continued on to the Senate, which voted for the ERA with an added clause that women would be exempt from the military. The [[91st United States Congress|91st Congress]], however, ended before the joint resolution could progress any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/People/Listing/G/GRIFFITHS,-Martha-Wright-(G000471)/|title=GRIFFITHS, Martha Wright {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|website=history.house.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths reintroduced the ERA, and achieved success on Capitol Hill with her House Joint Resolution No. 208, which was adopted by the House on October 12, 1971, with a vote of 354 yeas (For), 24 nays (Against) and 51 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;117 ''Congressional Record'' 35815&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths' joint resolution was then adopted by the Senate—without change—on March 22, 1972, by a vote of 84 yeas, 8 nays and 7 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec118funit#page/n93/mode/2up|title=Congressional record|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate version, drafted by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cruikshank|first=Kate|title=The Art of Leadership: A Companion to an Exhibition from the Senatorial Papers of Birch Bayh, United States Senator from Indiana, 1963–1980|url=http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed after the defeat of an amendment proposed by Senator [[Sam Ervin]] of North Carolina that would have exempted women from the [[Conscription|draft]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245" /&gt; President [[Richard Nixon]] immediately endorsed the ERA's approval upon its passage by the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245" /&gt;

===Ratifications===
On March 22, 1972, the ERA was placed before the state legislatures, with a seven-year deadline to acquire ratification by three-fourths (38) of the state legislatures. A majority of states ratified the proposed constitutional amendment within a year. Hawaii became the first state to ratify the ERA, which it did on the same day the amendment was approved by Congress: The U.S. Senate's vote on House Joint Resolution No. 208 took place in the mid-to-late afternoon in Washington D.C., when it was still midday in Hawaii. The [[Hawaii Senate]] and [[Hawaii House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted their approval shortly after noon Hawaii Standard Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jone|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/which-states-ratified-the-era-3528872|title=Which States Ratified the ERA and When Did They Ratify?|publisher=Thoughtco.com|date=October 31, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1972, a total of 22 state legislatures ratified the amendment and eight more joined in early 1973. Between 1974 and 1977, only five states approved the ERA, and advocates became worried about the approaching March 22, 1979 deadline.&lt;ref name="ERA: History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm|title=ERA: History|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the legislatures of four states which had ratified the ERA then adopted legislation purporting to rescind those ratifications. If, indeed, a state legislature has the ability to rescind, then the ERA actually had ratifications by only 31 states{{snd}}not 35{{snd}}when March 22, 1979, arrived.

(Refer to "Executive branch involvement in ratification process" below).

===Ratifying state with self-declared March 22, 1979 sunset provision===
The action of the 95th Congress in October 1978 to extend the ERA ratification deadline from March 22, 1979, to June 30, 1982, was not universally accepted. On December 23, 1981, a federal district court ruled in ''Idaho v. Freeman'' that Congress had no power to extend ERA's ratification deadline.  On January 25, 1982, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] opted to [[Stay of proceedings|stay]] the district court's decision.  Taking no further action on the matter until October 4, 1982, the High Court, on that date, ruled in ''NOW v. Idaho'' and ''Carmen v. Idaho'' that the controversy had been rendered moot by virtue of the fact that no additional state legislatures ratified ERA between March 22, 1979 and June 30, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eagleforum.org/era/now-v-idaho.html|title=NOW v. Idaho {{!}} 459 U.S. 809 (1982)|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those rejecting Congress's claim to even hold such authority, the [[South Dakota Legislature]] adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 on March 1, 1979. The joint resolution stipulated that South Dakota's 1973 ERA ratification would be [[Sunset provision|"sunsetted"]] as of the original March 22, 1979 deadline. South Dakota's 1979 sunset joint resolution declared: "...the Ninety-fifth Congress ex post facto has sought unilaterally to alter the terms and conditions in such a way as to materially affect the congressionally established time period for ratification..." (designated as "POM-93" by the U.S. Senate and published verbatim in the ''Congressional Record'' of March 13, 1979, at pages 4861 and 4862).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1979-pt4/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1979-pt4-4-2.pdf#page=43&lt;/ref&gt;

The action on the part of South Dakota lawmakers—occurring 21 days prior to originally agreed-upon March 22, 1979 deadline—could be viewed as slightly different from a rescission. As noted in ''The Constitution of the United States Analysis and Interpretation'' (Centennial edition, 2017, at page 1005): "Four states had rescinded their ratifications [of the ERA] and a fifth had declared that its ratification would be void unless the [Equal Rights] amendment was ratified within the original time limit"; (see footnote 43 at the bottom of page 1005, which identifies South Dakota as that "fifth" state).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/content/conan/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2017.pdf#page=1031&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=941086029119014015123093108002102030040035068060068038011064116081004087098007002121027055021115000042004088076118087010119115062049001061039127092121098009126089039001020105065001123111009088107112069125001030090103100094119087113005006096065074015&amp;EXT=pdf|title=Buried Alive: The Reboot of the Equal Rights Amendment|last=Magliocca|first=Gerald N.|publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]]|page=10|date=June 22, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive branch involvement in ratification process===
The Constitution is silent as to whether the governor—or acting governor—of a state has any formal role to play regarding state ratification of an amendment to the Constitution. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Virginia]]'' (1798)&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Hollingsworth v. Virginia|volume=3|page=378|year=1798|reporter=Dall.|reporter-volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[President of the United States]] has no formal role in that process.

===Non-ratifying states with one-house approval===
At various times, in 7 of the 13 non-ratifying states, one house of the legislature approved the ERA. It failed in those states because both houses of a state's legislature must approve, during the same session, in order for that state to be deemed to have ratified.

==Congressional extension of ratification deadline==
The original joint resolution (H. J. Res. 208), by which the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]] proposed the amendment to the states, was prefaced by the following resolving clause:

{{quote|Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States ''within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress'': [emphasis added]}}

As the joint resolution was passed on March 22, 1972, this effectively set a March 22, 1979 deadline for the amendment to be ratified by the requisite number of states. However, the 92nd Congress did not incorporate any time limit into the body of the actual text of the proposed amendment, as had been done with a number of other proposed amendments.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3 of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], Section 6 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], Section 3 of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], Section 2 of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], and Section 4 of the rejected [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, as the original 1979 deadline approached, the [[95th United States Congress|95th Congress]] adopted House Joint Resolution No. 638 (H. J. Res. 638), by Representative [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], which purported to extend the ERA's ratification deadline to June 30, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 92, ''United States Statutes At Large,'' page 3799&lt;/ref&gt; H. J. Res. 638 received less than two-thirds of the vote (a [[Majority|simple majority]], not a [[supermajority]]) in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; for that reason, ERA supporters deemed it necessary that H. J. Res. 638 be transmitted to then-President [[Jimmy Carter]] for signature as a safety precaution. Carter signed the joint resolution, although he noted, on strictly procedural grounds, the irregularity of his doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Equal_Rights_Amendment_-_Extension_of_ratification_deadline/id/1367020 Equal Rights Amendment - Extension of ratification deadline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019174107/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Equal_Rights_Amendment_-_Extension_of_ratification_deadline/id/1367020|date=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this disputed extension of slightly more than three years, no additional states ratified or [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Rescinding a ratification|rescinded]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The purported extension of ERA's ratification deadline was vigorously contested in 1978 as scholars were divided as to whether Congress actually has authority to revise a previously agreed-to deadline for the states to act upon a Federal constitutional amendment. On June 18, 1980, a resolution in the Illinois House of Representatives resulted in a vote of 102-71 in favor, but Illinois' internal parliamentary rules required a three-fifths majority on constitutional amendments and so the measure failed by five votes. In 1982, seven female ERA supporters went on a fast and seventeen chained themselves to the entrance of the Illinois Senate chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=O'Dea, Suzanne|title=From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics, Volume 1|date=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780874369601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hungryheart"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholson, Zoe Ann|title=The Hungry Heart: A Woman's Fast for Justice|date=2004|publisher=Lune Soleil Press|isbn=0972392831|url=http://www.lunesoleilpress.com/the-hungry-heart-a-womans-fast-for-justice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-era"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheppard|first=Nathaniel|title=Women say they'll end fast but not rights fight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/us/women-say-they-ll-end-fast-but-not-rights-fight.html|date=June 24, 1982|accessdate=September 18, 2016|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest that the ERA came to gaining an additional ratification between the original deadline of March 22, 1979 and the revised June 30, 1982, expiration date was when it was approved by the [[Florida House of Representatives]] on June 21, 1982. In the final week before the revised deadline, that ratifying resolution, however, was defeated in the [[Florida Senate]] by a vote of 16 yeas and 22 nays. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the proposed amendment would still have fallen short of the required 38.

According to research by Professor Jules B. Gerard, professor of law at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], of the 35 legislatures that passed ratification resolutions, 24 of them explicitly referred to the original 1979 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to House Judiciary Committee, June 14, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the courts==
On December 23, 1981, a federal district court, in the case of ''Idaho v. Freeman'', ruled that the extension of the ERA ratification deadline to June 30, 1982, was not valid and that, ERA had actually expired from state legislative consideration more than two years earlier on the original expiration date of March 22, 1979.  On January 25, 1982, however, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Stay of proceedings|"stayed"]] the lower court's decision, thus signaling to the legislatures of still-unratified states that they may continue consideration of ERA during their spring 1982 legislative sessions.

After the disputed June 30, 1982, extended deadline had come and gone, the Supreme Court, at the beginning of its new term, on October 4, 1982, in the separate case of ''NOW v. Idaho'', 459 U.S. 809 (1982), vacated the federal district court decision in ''Idaho v. Freeman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/19811636529fsupp110711473 |title=STATE OF IDAHO v.

The Supreme Court declared these controversies [[Mootness|moot]] on the grounds that the ERA had not received the required number of ratifications (38), so that "the Amendment has failed of adoption no matter what the resolution of the legal issues presented here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eagleforum.org/era/now-v-idaho-memo.html Memorandum of Gerald P. Carmen, Administrator of General Services], July 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleforum.org/era/now-v-idaho.html|title=Now v. Idaho|work=eagleforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1939 case of ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13916201793014079286&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|title=Coleman v. Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the final authority to determine whether, by lapse of time, a proposed constitutional amendment has lost its vitality before being ratified by enough states, and whether state ratifications are effective in light of attempts at subsequent withdrawal. The Court stated: "We think that, in accordance with this historic precedent, the question of the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures, in the light of previous rejection or attempted withdrawal, should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, in 1939, upheld Congressional authority to determine in 1868 that the Fourteenth Amendment was properly ratified, including states that had attempted to rescind prior ratifications.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the context of this judicial precedent, nonpartisan counsel to a Nevada state legislative committee concluded in 2017 that "If three more states sent their ratification to the appropriate federal official, it would then be up to Congress to determine whether a sufficient number of states have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Minutes/Assembly/LOE/Final/428.pdf|title=Minutes, Hearing of the Assembly Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections}}, p.16 (Mar. 7, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, an informal advisory provided to Virginia State Senator Scott A. Surovell from the Virginia Attorney General’s office stated that Congress has the power to extend the ratification deadline even further. The advisory also stated that even without such a further extension, a contemporary ratification of the ERA by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] could be found valid by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-hopes-of-era-ratification-go-down-in-flames-this-year/2018/02/09/7acfbf80-0dab-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.html|title=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2018, a formal opinion letter of Virginia Attorney General [[Mark Herring]] concurred, stating:&lt;ref&gt;See Virginia Attorney General Opinion Letter, supra, at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In light of Congress's significant control over the amendment process, I cannot conclude that it lacks the power to extend the period in which an amendment can be ratified and recognize a State's intervening ratifying resolution as legally effective for purposes of determining whether the ERA has been ratified. Although the precise issue you raise has not been conclusively resolved, the historical evidence and case law demonstrate Congress's significant, even plenary, power over the amending process."

The Attorney General added, citing extensive sources: "As recognized by the constitutional scholars who testified before Congress and in the report of the House Judiciary Committee recommending extension, the limited Supreme Court precedent in this area suggests that Congress has authority to extend a ratification deadline."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After thorough discussion of legal precedent and testimony at the Congressional hearings, the opinion letter concluded: "It is my opinion that the lapse of the ERA's original and extended ratification periods has not disempowered the [Virginia] General Assembly from passing a ratifying resolution. Given Congress's substantial power over the amending process, I cannot conclude that Congress would be powerless to extend or remove the ERA's ratification deadline and recognize as valid a State's intervening act of ratification. Indeed, legislation currently pending in Congress seeks to exercise that very power."&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for the ERA==
Supporters of the ERA point to the lack of a specific guarantee in the Constitution for equal rights protections on the basis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/why.htm|title=ERA: Why|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, future Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] summarized a supporting argument for the ERA in the [[American Bar Association Journal]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The equal rights amendment, in sum, would dedicate the nation to a new view of the rights and responsibilities of men and women. It firmly rejects sharp legislative lines between the sexes as constitutionally tolerable. Instead, it looks toward a legal system in which each person will be judged on the basis of individual merit and not on the basis of an unalterable trait of birth that bears no necessary relationship to need or ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ginsburg |first=Ruth Bader |title=The Need for the Equal Rights Amendment |journal=American Bar Association Journal |volume=59 |issue=9 |year=1973 |pages=1013–1019 |jstor=25726416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the early 1940s both the Democratic and Republican parties added support for the ERA to their platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm|title=ERA: History|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) and ERAmerica, a coalition of almost 80 organizations, led the pro-ERA efforts. Between 1972 and 1982, ERA supporters held rallies, petitioned, picketed, went on hunger strikes, and performed acts of civil disobedience.&lt;ref name="ERA: History"/&gt; On July 9, 1978, NOW and other organizations hosted a national march in Washington D.C., which garnered over 100,000 supporters, and was followed by a Lobby Day on July 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2014/07/09/july-9-1978-feminists-make-history-with-biggest-ever-march-for-the-equal-rights-amendment/|title=July 9, 1978: Feminists Make History With Biggest-Ever March for the Equal Rights Amendment {{!}} Feminist Majority Foundation Blog|website=feminist.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1982, NOW sponsored marches in states that had not passed the ERA including Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/07/us/thousands-march-for-equal-rights.html|title=THOUSANDS MARCH FOR EQUAL RIGHTS|last=Times|first=Winston Williams, Special To The New York|date=1982-06-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-13|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key feminists of the time, such as [[Gloria Steinem]], spoke out in favor of the ERA, arguing that ERA opposition was based on gender myths that overemphasized difference and ignored evidence of unequal treatment between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/7025/|title="All Our Problems Stem from the Same Sex Based Myths": Gloria Steinem Delineates American Gender Myths during ERA Hearings|website=historymatters.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for the ERA among people of color===
Many women in the African American community have supported the ERA in light of the dual effects of both race and sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="SEDWICK 24–29"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SEDWICK|first=CATHY|last2=WILLIAMS|first2=REBA|date=1976-01-01|title=BLACK WOMEN AND THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT|journal=The Black Scholar|volume=7|issue=10|pages=24–29|jstor=41065957}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent female supporter was New York Representative [[Shirley Chisholm]]. On August 10, 1970, she gave a speech on the ERA called "For the Equal Rights Amendment" in Washington D.C. In her address, she pointed out how widespread sex discrimination had become and how the ERA would remedy it. She also said that laws to protect women in the workforce from unsafe working conditions would be needed by men, too, and thus the ERA would help all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.vod.umd.edu/civil/chisholm1970int.htm|title=Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm, "For the Equal Rights Amendment" (10 August 1970)|website=archive.vod.umd.edu|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424030341/http://archive.vod.umd.edu/civil/chisholm1970int.htm|archivedate=24 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1976, 60% of African American women and 63% of African American men were in favor of the ERA, and the legislation was supported by organizations such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], [[National Council of Negro Women]], [[Coalition of Black Trade Unionists]], National Association of Negro Business, and the [[National Black Feminist Organization]].&lt;ref name="SEDWICK 24–29"/&gt;

==Opposition to the ERA==
[[File:Anti-ERA women dnd0215.jpg|thumb|Anti-ERA women watching a committee meeting of the Florida Senate in 1979, where consideration of the ERA was postponed, thus effectively killing the resolution for the 1979 session]]
Opponents of the ERA focused on traditional gender roles, such as how men do the fighting in wartime. They argued that the amendment would guarantee the possibility that women would be subject to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed. Defense of traditional [[gender role]]s proved to be a useful tactic. In Illinois, supporters of [[Phyllis Schlafly]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republican activist from that state, used traditional symbols of the American [[housewife]]. They took homemade bread, jams, and apple pies to the state legislators, with the slogans, "Preserve us from a congressional jam; Vote against the ERA sham" and "I am for Mom and apple pie."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg225&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenberg, Rosalind|title=Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century|date=2008|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-GMcnUaLhEC&amp;pg=PA225|isbn=9780809016310}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appealed to married women by stressing that the amendment would invalidate protective laws such as alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhode, Deborah L.|title=Justice and Gender: Sex Discrimination and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1qosJPdqPkC&amp;pg=PA66|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=66–67|isbn=9780674042674}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that single-sex bathrooms would be eliminated and same-sex couples would be able to get married if the amendment were passed.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Women who supported traditional gender roles started to oppose the ERA.&lt;ref name=kllap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57c.asp|title=The Equal Rights Amendment|website=ushistory.org|publisher=Independence Hall Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlafly said the ERA was designed for the benefit of young career women and warned that if men and women had to be treated identically it would threaten the security of middle-aged housewives with no job skills. They could no longer count on alimony or Social Security.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Opponents also argued that men and women were already equal enough with the passage of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&amp;psid=3345|title=Digital History|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women's colleges would have to admit men. Schlafly's argument that protective laws would be lost resonated with working-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenberg, Rosalind|title=Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-GMcnUaLhEC&amp;pg=PA225|date=2008|pages=225–26|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|isbn=9780809016310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phyllis Schlafly by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright=0.85|thumb|left|[[Phyllis Schlafly]], a conservative activist, organized opposition to the ERA and argued that it "would lead to women being drafted by the military and to [[unisex public toilet|public unisex bathrooms]]"&lt;ref name=eilperin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032702357_pf.html|work=The Washington Post|title=New Drive Afoot to Pass Equal Rights Amendment|first=Juliet|last=Eilperin|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
At the [[1980 Republican National Convention]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] platform was amended to end its support for the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlez|first=Jane|title=Plan to omit rights amendment from platform brings objections|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/us/plan-to-omit-rights-amendment-from-platform-brings-objections.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=July 24, 2013|date=May 17, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent opponent of the ERA was Schlafly. Leading the Stop ERA campaign, Schlafly defended traditional gender roles and would often attempt to incite feminists by opening her speeches with lines such as, "I'd like to thank my husband for letting me be here tonight{{snd}} I always like to say that, because it makes the libs so mad."&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; When Schlafly began her campaign in 1972, public polls showed support for the amendment was widely popular and thirty states had ratified the amendment by 1973. After 1973, the number of ratifying states slowed to a trickle. Support in the states that had not ratified fell below 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Jane J. Mansbridge, ''Why we lost the ERA'' (University of Chicago Press, 1986) p 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Critchlow and Stachecki noted that public opinion in key states shifted against the ERA as opponents, operating on the local and state levels, won over the public. The state legislators in battleground states followed public opinion in rejecting the ERA.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Experts agree that Phyllis Schlafly was a key player in the defeat. Political scientist [[Jane Mansbridge]] in her history of the ERA argues that the draft issue was the single most powerful argument used by Schlafly and the other opponents to defeat ERA.&lt;ref&gt;Jane  Mansbridge, "Who's in Charge Here? Decision by Accretion and Gatekeeping in the Struggle for the ERA", ''Politics &amp; Society'' (1984) 13#4 pp 343-382.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansbridge concluded, "Many people who followed the struggle over the ERA believed{{snd}} rightly in my view{{snd}} that the Amendment would have been ratified by 1975 or 1976 had it not been for Phyllis Schlafly's early and effective effort to organize potential opponents."&lt;ref&gt;Mansbridge, ''Why we lost the ERA'' (1986) p 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar [[Joan C. Williams]] maintained, "ERA was defeated when Schlafly turned it into a war among women over gender roles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joan|title=Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What To Do About It|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxtNubyWAEMC&amp;pg=PA147|year=1999|publisher=Oxford UP|page=147|isbn=9780199840472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Judith Glazer-Raymo asserted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As moderates, we thought we represented the forces of reason and goodwill but failed to take seriously the power of the family values argument and the single-mindedness of Schlafly and her followers. The ERA's defeat seriously damaged the women's movement, destroying its momentum and its potential to foment social change....Eventually, this resulted in feminist dissatisfaction with the Republican Party, giving the Democrats a new source of strength that when combined with overwhelming minority support, helped elect Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and again in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glazer-Raymo|first=Judith|title=Shattering the Myths: Women in Academe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTWzBcW07RwC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP|page=19|isbn=9780801866418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many ERA supporters blamed their defeat on [[Advocacy group|special interest]] forces, especially the insurance industry and conservative organizations, suggesting that they had funded an opposition that subverted the democratic process and the will of the pro-ERA majority.&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow and Stachecki (2008). ''The Equal Rights Amendment Reconsidered''. pp. 157-8&lt;/ref&gt; Such supporters argued that while the public face of the anti-ERA movement was Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA organization, there were other important groups in the opposition as well, such as the powerful National Council of Catholic Women, [[Labor feminism|labor feminists]]{{verification needed|date=May 2018}} and (until 1973) the [[AFL–CIO]]. Opposition to the amendment was particularly high among religious conservatives, who argued that the amendment would guarantee universal abortion rights and the right for homosexual couples to marry.&lt;ref name="Francis ERA History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm|author=Francis, Roberta W.|title=The History Behind the Equal Rights Amendment|website=equalrightsamendment.org|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David W.

''The Equal Rights Amendment Reconsidered''. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sonia Johnson]], a traditionally-raised Mormon housewife whose eventual feminist advocacy for the ERA's passage led to her excommunication by the LDS church, subsequently wrote about her experiences in the memoir ''From Housewife to Heretic''.

==Post-deadline ratifications and the "three-state strategy"==

Beginning in the mid 1990s, ERA supporters began an effort to win ratification of the ERA by the legislatures of states that did not ratify it between 1972 and 1982. These proponents state that Congress can remove the ERA's ratification deadline despite the deadline having expired, allowing the states again to ratify it. They also state that the ratifications ERA previously received remain in force and that rescissions of prior ratifications are not valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three-State Strategy|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/strategy.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute in collaboration with the ERA Task Force of the National Council of Women's Organizations|accessdate=April 25, 2014|author=Francis, Roberta W.|website=equalrightsamendment.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127031352/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/strategy.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who espouse the "three-state strategy" (now down to only one state if the Nevada Legislature's and the Illinois General Assembly's belated ERA approvals are deemed legitimate) were spurred, at least in part, by the unconventional 202-year-long ratification of the Constitution's [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]] (sometimes referred to as the "Madison Amendment") which became part of the Constitution in 1992 after pending before the state legislatures since 1789.  Although the "Madison Amendment" was not associated with a ratification deadline, whereas the proposing clause of the ERA did include a deadline, states have in the past ratified amendments after a deadline, and Congress has not rejected those ratifications (as the Supreme Court has said, "Congress in controlling the promulgation of the adoption of a constitutional amendment has the final determination of the question whether by lapse of time its proposal of the amendment had lost its vitality prior to the required ratifications").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coleman v. Miller|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/433/|publisher=Justia|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2009, the [[National Organization for Women]] decided to support both efforts to obtain additional state ratifications for the 1972 ERA and any strategy to submit a fresh-start ERA to the states for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 National NOW Conference Resolutions: Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html|date=June 21, 2009|publisher=National Organization for Women|accessdate=2009-08-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812221001/http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html|archivedate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[Congressional Research Service]] issued a report saying that ratification deadlines are a [[political question]]:{{quote|ERA proponents claim that the Supreme Court's decision in ''Coleman v.

However, most recently, ERA Action has both led and brought renewed vigor to the movement by instituting what has become known as the "three state strategy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Held, Herndon, and Stager|first=Allsion, Sheryl, and Danielle|date=1997|title=The Equal Rights Amendment: Why the ERA Remains Legally Viable And Properly Before the States|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/misc/WM_law_article.pdf|journal=William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law|volume=3:113|pages=113–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 2013 that ERA Action began to gain traction with this strategy through their coordination with U.S. Senators and Representatives not only to introduce legislation in both houses of Congress to remove the ratification deadline, but also in gaining legislative sponsors. The Congressional Research Service then issued a report on the "three state strategy" on April 8, 2013 entitled "The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42979.pdf|title=The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues|last=Neale|first=Thomas|quote=Congressional Research Service|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the approach was viable.

In 2014, under the auspices of ERA Action and their coalition partners, both the Virginia and Illinois state senates voted to ratify the ERA. That year, votes were blocked in both states' House chambers. In the meantime, the ERA ratification movement continued with the resolution being introduced in 10 state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/index.htm|title=ERA: Home|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/21/520962541/nevada-on-cusp-of-ratifying-equal-rights-amendment-35-years-after-deadline|title=Nevada Ratifies The Equal Rights Amendment ... 35 Years After The Deadline|work=NPR|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bal-cardin-equal-rights-amendment-20170121-story.html|title=As women march in D.C., Cardin co-sponsors new Equal Rights Amendment|last=Brown|first=Matthew Hay|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2017, the Nevada Legislature became the first state in 40 years to ratify the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/2015/11/05/ratify-the-era/|title=Let's Ratify the ERA: A Look at Where We Are Now|last=says|first=Quora|website=AAUW: Empowering Women Since 1881|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illinois lawmakers and citizens took another look at the ERA, with hearings, testimony, and research including work by the law firm Winston &amp; Strawn to address common legal questions about the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.winston.com/images/content/1/3/v2/137207/ERA-Common-Legal-Questions.pdf|title=Common Legal Questions About the ERA|website=www.winston.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illinois state lawmakers ratified the ERA on May 30, 2018, with a 72-45 vote in the Illinois House following a 43-12 vote in the Illinois Senate in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2018/05/30/era-s-revival-illinois-ratifies-equal-rights-amendment|title=The ERA’s Revival: Illinois Ratifies Equal Rights Amendment|work=[[WTTW]]|date=May 30, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-illinois-equal-rights-amendment-20180411-story.html|title=Illinois Senate approves federal Equal Rights Amendment, more than 35 years after the deadline|date=April 12, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2018, the final day of that year's legislative session on which the Virginia General Assembly committees could have brought up the four ERA resolutions for consideration, women and men from the [[League of Women Voters]], Liberal Women of Chesterfield County, and several other women's rights groups across Virginia packed the committee chamber rooms of the [[Virginia General Assembly]]; when the chairmen did not bring up the ERA for a vote, they demanded, to resulting in applause in the room that the resolutions be given a fair hearing and vote. The House committee did not bring up the resolutions for consideration, and the Virginia Senate Rules Committee voted to table the resolution until the following year, citing an alleged statement from an official at the National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Patrick|title=Women pack committee rooms demanding Virginia debate ERA|issue=General Assembly 2018|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=February 10, 2018|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Patricia|title=Virginia’s hopes of ERA ratification go down in flames this year|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-hopes-of-era-ratification-go-down-in-flames-this-year/2018/02/09/7acfbf80-0dab-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=February 15, 2018|date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Archives and Records Administration later noted that the alleged statement had never occurred. "'The Archivist of the United States has not taken such a stance and has never issued an opinion on this matter either officially or unofficially,' said the agency’s director of communications, James Pritchett, in a statement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Ned|title=Only one more state needs to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.

==Subsequent congressional action==

The amendment has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-Massachusetts) championed it in the Senate from the [[99th United States Congress|99th Congress]] through the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]]. Senator [[Robert Menendez]] (D-New Jersey) introduced the amendment symbolically at the end of the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] and has supported it in the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]]. In the House of Representatives, [[Carolyn Maloney]] (D-New York) has sponsored it since the [[105th United States Congress|105th Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Equal Rights Amendment: 111th Congress|url=http://maloney.house.gov/sites/maloney.house.gov/files/documents/women/era/AUGUST%2012%20Facts%20About%20the%20ERA%20in%20the%20111th%20Congress.pdf|format=PDF|date=July 13, 2009|website=maloney.house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; most recently in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:h.j.res.56:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status 113th Congress (2013 - 2014) H.J. Res. 56 |website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the ERA passed through House committees with the same text as in 1972; however, it failed by six votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote on the House floor. That was the last time that the ERA received a floor vote in either house of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RD3wqORd9jMC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=1983+%22equal+rights+amendment%22+%22six+votes%22#v=onepage&amp;q=1983%20%22equal%20rights%20amendment%22%20%22six%20votes%22&amp;f=false|author=Randall, Vicky|title=Women and Politics: An International Perspective|page=308|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1987|isbn=9780226703923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 112th Congress on January 6, 2011, Senator Menendez, along with Representatives Maloney, [[Jerrold Nadler]] (D-New York) and [[Gwen Moore]] (D-Wisconsin), held a press conference advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment's adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/constitution-read-aloud-maloney-menendez-nadler-moore-cite-need-equal-rights-amendment|title=As Constitution is read aloud, Maloney, Menendez, Nadler, Moore cite need for Equal Rights Amendment|date=January 6, 2011|website=maloney.house.gov|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[113th United States Congress|113th Congress]] had a record number of women. On March 5, 2013, the ERA was reintroduced by Senator Menendez as S.J. Res. 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.J.+Res.+10:|title=Bill Text 113th Congress (2013-2014) S.J.RES.10.IS|website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/07/1192277/-Democrats-re-re-re-reintroduce-Equal-Rights-Amendment-but-shhhh-don-t-tell-anyone|author=Gray, Kaili Joy|date=March 7, 2013|title=Democrats re-re-re-reintroduce Equal Rights Amendment ... but shhhh, don't tell anyone|website=dailykos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "New ERA" introduced in 2013, sponsored by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, adds an additional sentence to the original text: "Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Equal Means Equal|last=Neuwirth|first=Jessica|publisher=The New Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-62097-039-3|location=New York|page=102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed removal of ratification deadline===

On March 8, 2011, the 100th anniversary of [[International Women's Day]], Representative [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-Wisconsin) introduced legislation (H.J. Res. 47) to remove the congressionally imposed deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=229427|title=U.S. Rep.

On March 22, 2012, the 40th anniversary of the ERA's congressional approval, Senator [[Benjamin L. Cardin]] (D-Maryland) introduced (S.J. Res. 39){{snd}} which is worded with slight differences from Representative Baldwin's (H.J. Res. 47). Senator Cardin was joined by ten other Senators who added their names to the Senate Joint Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/39/all-info|title=All Bill Information (Except Text) for S.J.Res.39 - A joint resolution removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment|website=congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2013, the [[New Mexico House of Representatives]] adopted House Memorial No. 7 asking that the congressionally-imposed deadline for ERA ratification be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/13%20Regular/memorials/house/HM007.pdf|format=PDF|title=House Memorial 7|author=51st Legislature, State of New Mexico, First Session, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_22568975/roundhouse-roundup-feb-11-2013|title=Roundhouse roundup, Feb. 11, 2013|work=Las Cruces Sun-News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203021428/http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_22568975/roundhouse-roundup-feb-11-2013|archivedate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; House Memorial No. 7 was officially received by the U.S. Senate on January 6, 2014, was designated as "POM-175", was referred to the Senate's Committee on the Judiciary, and was published verbatim in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' at page S24.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/01/06/CREC-2014-01-06-pt1-PgS21.pdf#page=4|format=PDF|author=113th Congress, 2nd Session

==State equal rights amendments==
{{Further|State equal rights amendments}}

Twenty-four states have adopted constitutions or constitutional amendments providing that equal rights under the law shall not be denied because of sex. Most of these provisions mirror the broad language of the ERA, while the wording in others resembles the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf|title=Equal Rights Amendment: State Provisions|last=Gladstone|first=Leslie|date=August 23, 2004|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1879 [[Constitution of California]] contains the earliest state equal rights provision on record. Narrowly written, it limits the equal rights conferred to "entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment". Near the end of the 19th century two more states, Wyoming (1890) and Utah (1896), included equal rights provisions in their constitutions. These provisions were broadly written to ensure political and civil equality between women and men.&lt;ref name="CRSReport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Rights Amendments: State Provisions|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515010101/http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark%3A/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf|work=CRS Report for Congress|publisher=Congressional Research Service - The Library of Congress|author=Leslie W. Gladstone|archivedate=May 15, 2015|dead-url=yes|date=August 23, 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several states crafted and adopted their own equal rights amendments during the 1970s and 1980s, while the ERA was before the states, or afterward.

The '''Executive DBA Council''' (EDBAC) is a global volunteer organization that focuses on [[Doctor of Business Administration|executive doctoral programs]] and their issues.  The group's posted mission is "...to provide outstanding networking and educational opportunities for professionals who serve and participate in executive doctoral degree programs."  The group states on its website that it is the only global organization of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/edbac/ |title=The Executive DBA Council |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The EDBAC was founded in 2011 to promote the DBA degree as a business or executive qualification, rather than an academic qualification, such as a PhD.  The group held its first meeting at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in June 2011.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2510e0fe-0941-11e0-ada6-00144feabdc0.html |title=Push to have DBA recognised as practitioner degree |publisher=FT.com |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==DBA versus PhD==
The DBA and PhD both focus on developing an individual's research skills, but the PhD is designed to prepare individuals for academic careers.&lt;ref name=CEO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/ceo-magazine/docs/ceo_15_-_complete_edition/40 |title=Debunking the Doctor of Business Administration |publisher=CEO Magazine |date=2014-07-14|accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DBA is intended to prepare students for a research career in business.  An executive qualification such as a DBA is also called a practitioner degree.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

==Membership==
The EDBAC offers membership to accredited, not-for-profit public or private institutions of higher learning that offer a doctoral program for executives or are considering doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/members/apply/ |title=Application for membership |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2016, there were 48 member schools, including [[University of Maryland University College]],[[Benedictine University]], [[Case Western Reserve University]], [[City University of Hong Kong]], [[Copenhagen Business School]], [[Cranfield University]], [[ESC Rennes School of Business]], [[Georgia State University]], [[Manchester University]], [[Oklahoma State University]], [[Paris Dauphine University]],  [[Rollins College]], [[Temple University]], [[University of Florida]] and [[University of Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/members/|title=Members |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization structure==
The EDBAC has a board consisting of a chairperson and ten other members, of which two are program alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/edbac/executive-board/ |title=Executive Board |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emma Parry of [[Cranfield University]], is the current chairperson.

==Events==
The Executive DBA Council sponsors and organizes an '''Annual Engaged Management Scholarship (EMS) Conference''' where current students and alumni of member programs present peer-reviewed research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weatherhead.case.edu/events/engaged-management/council |title=EXECUTIVE DOCTORATE in BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (EDBA) COUNCIL STATEMENT OF STRATEGIC DIRECTION |publisher=Case.edu |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sixth annual conference was held in Paris, France in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edba.dauphine.fr/en/news-videos/news/news-details/article/6e-conference-internationale-engaged-management-scholarship-ems.html |title=Past &amp; Upcoming Conferences |website =dauphie.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2017 conference was scheduled for Tampa, Florida in September 2017 but was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/past-and-upcoming-conferences/ |title=Past &amp; Upcoming Conferences |publisher=executivedba.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2018 conference is scheduled to take place at Temple University September 6-9 2018.

[[Image:Martin van Maele - Francion 15.jpg|thumb|[[Martin van Maële]]'s print ''Francion 15'' depicts a couple engaging in foreplay outdoors]]
In [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]], '''foreplay''' is a set of [[emotionally intimate|emotionally]] and [[physical intimacy|physically intimate]] acts between two or more people meant to create [[sexual arousal]] and [[sexual desire|desire]] for [[sexual activity]]. Foreplay results in physiological and mental responses in both parties in anticipation of the expected sexual activity. Either or any of the [[sexual partner]]s may indicate sexual interest and initiate foreplay, and the initiator may not be the active partner during the sexual activity. Foreplay stimulates both partners' sexuality, lowers [[Sexual inhibition|inhibition]]s and increases emotional intimacy between partners, and implies a certain level of confidence and trust between the partners. In [[animal sexual behavior]], the loose equivalent is sometimes termed 'precoital activity'.

Sexual desire is an aspect of a [[Human sexuality|person's sexuality]], which varies from one person to another. A person who desires sexual activity with another person can attempt to provoke sexual arousal in the person. Depending on the type and intensity of the relationship between the two people, the stimuli may involve indicating to the person in some subtle and romantic way that he or she has that desire or by provoking other [[erotic stimuli]]. There are many potential stimuli, both [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical]] and [[Stimulus (psychology)|mental]], which can cause a person to become sexually aroused, and which stimuli are invoked will depend on circumstances at a particular time.

On the other hand, there are other things which act as turn-offs, depending on the person's preferences. The response to an indication of sexual interest may be inhibited by issues of [[sexual morality]].

==Initiating==
[[File:Nipping the Nape.png|thumb|Foreplay by [[kissing]] on female's back]]

Foreplay can begin with one person indicating in some manner to another person a desire to engage in sexual activity with that other person. Any act that creates and enhances [[sexual desire]], interest, [[sexual stimulation|stimulation]] or arousal in a sexual partner may constitute foreplay. An indication of sexual desire can be through physical intimacy, such as [[kissing]], [[Physical intimacy|touching]], [[Hug|embracing]] or nibbling the partner. Mental engagement can also create sexual interest, such as [[flirting]], talking, whispering or [[teasing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/foreplay foreplay] cambridge.org&lt;/ref&gt; It may, for example, be a non-physical gesture that indicates sexual availability. Sexual interest can be indicated and created by [[nudity]], such as by one partner [[striptease|stripping]], or by wearing sexually suggestive clothing, or by creating a romantic, intimate, or overtly sexual atmosphere. The manual or oral touching of an [[erogenous zone]] may indicate sexual interest, as does an intimate kiss on the [[mouth]], [[breast]]s, [[stomach]], [[buttocks]], back and inner [[thigh]]s or other areas of the body. A passionate or [[French kiss]] commonly indicates sexual interest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreplaytricks.com/deep-kissing.php Foreplay Tricks To Improve Your Sexual Relations: Deep kissing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220060836/http://www.foreplaytricks.com/deep-kissing.php |date=2010-02-20 }} Retrieved on 2010-02-18&lt;/ref&gt; as does any removal of a partner's clothing.

Verbally, foreplay may include compliments, subtle comments with [[double entendre]], and intimate conversations. Non-verbally, foreplay can include provocative clothing, suggestive postures and motions, [[personal grooming|preening]] gestures, winking, licking or biting one's lips, standing inside a partner's [[personal space]], and holding a gaze longer than would be expected from only a casual interest.

Foreplay commences when the other partner indicates reciprocal sexual interest. Depending on the context, the non-objection to a partner's advances may indicate that the sexual interest is reciprocated, as may a response to a kiss or hug. The non-objection to the touching of an erogenous zone, or the taking off of an item of clothing may indicate reciprocated sexual interest. Also, the other partner may indicate reciprocal interest by engaging in intimate behaviour of their own.

There are situations which act as turn-offs or which can affect the romantic or erotic moment that may have been created. Turn-offs can range from things like bad breath, body odor, excessive noise or a reference to an ex-partner. A person's [[sexual inhibition]] can also impact on creation or maintenance of sexual interest. Some people feel uncomfortable with acts such as [[French kiss]]ing, or the possibility of someone (e.g. children) intruding, or nudity, besides other situations.

==Games==
[[Sexual role-playing]] or sex games can create sexual interest.&lt;ref name="FGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreplaygames.net |title=Fore Play Games |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games can be played in a variety of situations, and have been enhanced by technology. This type of extended foreplay can involve SMS messaging, phone calls, [[online chat]], or other forms of distance communication, which are intended to stimulate fantasizing about the forthcoming encounter. This tantalization builds up sexual tension.

A card or board game can be played for foreplay. The objective of the game is for the partners to indulge their fantasies. The loser can, for example, be required to [[strip games|remove clothing]] or give the winner a sensual [[foot massage]] or any other thing that the winner wants to try. A sensuous atmosphere can also be enhanced by candles, drinks, sensual food or suggestive clothing. Even a suggestion of the use of [[sex toys]] or the playing of games involving [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], [[sexual bondage]], [[blindfolding]] or [[sploshing]] is an indication of sexual interest.

Some couples create sexual interest by watching [[erotic]] and [[pornography|pornographic]] videos. [[Role play]]ing may involve the partners wearing [[costumes]], to create and maintain a [[sexual fantasy]]. For variety, the partners can make up a (sexual) story together. One of them starts with a sentence and then the other continues until the story becomes sexually explicit, and it provides an opportunity for the partners to express their sexual fantasies. 'Strangers for a day' is a role playing game which consists of the couple playing roles of the first meeting between them. In a public meeting place, the partners pretend to be strangers meeting for the first time. The objective is for them to [[flirt]] and [[seduce]] the other, without doing or saying anything that they normally would not do or say at a first meeting.

==Tantric==
Tantric foreplay is the first step in the lovemaking session, according to the [[tantra]] principles. [[Tantric sex]] is against rushing things for the purpose of reaching an [[orgasm]], so tantric foreplay is a way to prepare the body and the mind for the union between the two bodies. The tantric rules say that foreplay must be focused on the preparation before sexual intercourse. Tantric foreplay may include sensual baths between the two partners in a relaxing atmosphere. [[Fragrance oil]] and candles may also be used to set up the mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Van Lysebeth |first = Andre |title = Tantra: the cult of the feminine |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-81-208-1759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric foreplay is only about giving each other time to connect [[Spirituality|spiritually]] and bind. Staring at each other while in a cross-legged position and touching the other's hand palms is a usual foreplay tactic used by tantra practitioners.
Tantric foreplay may also include [[Tantra massage]]s. The massage that is applied, according to the tantric philosophy, is not for reaching orgasms but for giving each other pleasure and connecting at a spiritual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalforeplay.com/pag24.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123012018/http://mentalforeplay.com/pag24.php|archivedate=2011-11-23|title=Tantra foreplay techniques|author=Mental Foreplay online portal|date=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Foreplay is important from at least two considerations, one of which is purely physiological.&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femaleforeplay.com |title=Female Foreplay Before Intercourse |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, foreplay implies a certain level of confidence and trust between the partners and creates intimacy.

Psychologically, foreplay lowers [[Sexual inhibition|inhibitions]] and increases [[emotional intimacy]] between partners. Physically, it stimulates the process that produces [[sexual arousal]].

Foreplay has important physical and psychological effects on women. The biggest issue related to the ability of achieving orgasms is thought to be solved with the right foreplay techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreplayforwomen.net/mental.html Mental foreplay for women] Retrieved on 2010-02-24&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the subject of the effectiveness of foreplay continues to be a point of discussion. An example of this is a European survey of 2,300 women in Prague which showed that foreplay is not the key in a satisfactory sexual act. Instead "the duration of intercourse – 16.2 minutes on average – is the clincher".&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3405928/Foreplay-is-overrated-researchers-claim.html "Foreplay is overrated, researchers claim"] 2010-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Foreplay can vary dramatically based on age, religion, and cultural norms. In spite of the clichéd modern folklore that women demand more foreplay and require more time to become physically aroused, recent scientific research refutes that myth. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada used the method of [[thermography|thermal imaging]] to record baseline [[temperature]] change in the genital area as the definition of the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal and concluded that, on average, women and men spend almost the same time for sexual arousal — around 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060930094145.htm Thermal Imaging Shatters Arousal Gender Gap Myth; Study Shows Women Become Aroused As Quickly As Men]&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does not take into account the amount of time necessary to become mentally aroused. There are hypotheses that relates foreplay as a factor which would increase fertility rates although more research is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Segura-Sampedro JJ. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987716300226 Foreplay, a selected strategy that might be able to increase fertility rates.] Medical Hypotheses (2016). {{doi|10.1016/j.mehy.2016.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There are many historical references to foreplay, with many artistic depictions. The [[History of India|Ancient Indian]] work ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' mentions different types of embracing, kissing, and marking with nails and teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessbuildersbanquet.com/software/kamasutra.pdf translation], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama205.htm biting types], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama204.htm using nails]&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions [[BDSM]] activities such as slapping and moaning as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama207.htm slapping] Kama Sutra&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17010">The topic of gender and emotion is often reduced to attempts to identify the differences between women, men, and the various ways in which they express their emotions. Stereotypes are powerful, and men and women from various cultures have been shown to accept the Western stereotype that women are more emotional than men.&lt;ref name= kring&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kring | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = A. H. | year = 1998 | title = Sex differences in emotion: expression, experience, and physiology | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.686 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 686–703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, women are believed to experience and express discrete emotions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and sadness more than men. 

Many researchers have concluded that the observed emotional differences between men and women primarily stem from socialized [[gender role]]s, rather than biology.  Thus, the range of [[emotional expression]] that certain populations experience is based, in large part, on their culture's expectations for [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theories==
Many psychologists reject the notion that men actually experience emotions less frequently than do women.  Instead, researchers have suggested that men exhibit restrictive [[emotionality]]. Restrictive emotionality refers to a tendency to inhibit the expression of certain emotions and an unwillingness to self-disclose intimate feelings.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt; Men's restrictive emotionality has been shown to influence health, emotional appraisal and overall identity.  Furthermore, tendencies toward restrictive emotionality are correlated with an increased risk of certain anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt;
A substantial amount of research has suggested that women do, on average, express emotions more frequently than men.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; In the Handbook of Emotions, Leslie R. Brody and Judith A. Hall report that This difference in emotional expression starts at a young age, as early as 4 and 6 years old, as girls begin to express more sadness and anxiety than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;&lt;ref name = brody&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Hall | first2 = J. A. | year = 2008 | title = Gender and emotion in context | url = | journal = Handbook of emotions | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brody and Hall (2008) report that women generally smile, laugh, nod and use hand gestures more than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  The only known exception to this rule is that men more frequently express anger.  However, all of these effects are not commonly observed until after preschool, suggesting that these differences might be the result of certain [[socialization]] processes.&lt;ref name = jansz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jansz | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = [[Masculine]] identity and restrictive emotionality | url = | journal = Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives | volume = | issue = | pages = 166–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women are also more accurate expressers of emotion, when "posing deliberately and when observed unobstrusively."&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  This increased expressiveness in emotional expression is consistent across cultures – women report more intense emotional experiences and more overt emotional expressions across 37 cultures.&lt;ref name =  fischer&gt;Fischer, A. H., &amp; Manstead, A. S. R. (2000). The relation between gender and emotion in different cultures. In A. H. Fischer (Ed.), Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives (pp. 71–98). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been found that men and women more accurately display gender-stereotypic expressions – men more accurately express anger, contempt and happiness, while women were more accurately express fear and happiness.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  Other studies have shown that women show higher levels of expression accuracy and judgement of nonverbal emotional cues than men overall.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt; However, these patterns are not consistent across cultures, again suggesting that socialization influences the observed gender differences in emotional expression.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  For example, in [[Japan]], research has suggested that women convey anger and contempt better than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

==Major empirical findings==
Research has shown that culture and context-specific gender roles have a stronger influence on emotional expression than do biological factors.  "Empirical evidence suggests that girls are socialized to be emotional, nonaggressive, nurturing, and obedient, whereas boys are socialized to be unemotional, aggressive, achievement oriented, and self-reliant. Peers continue this process as children develop and mature in effect constraining how, where, why, and with whom certain emotions are expressed".&lt;ref name = wester/&gt;  One study suggests that people tend to exhibit more intense negative facial expressions in solitary conditions, and smile more when others are present.  In this experiment, men and women did not differ in their anger expression in non-social conditions. However, women were more likely to express their anger in the solitary condition as opposed to the social condition. Men, on the other hand, seemed to be less concerned with appearing positive to others; they showed no difference in their expression of anger based on whether or not others were present.&lt;ref name = derks/&gt;  In another recent study, Coats and Feldman found that women who were more accurate expressors of happiness were judged as more popular, while men who were more accurate expressors of anger were judged as more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coats | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = R. S. | year = 1996 | title = Gender differences in nonverbal correlates of social status | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 10| pages = 1014–1022 | doi=10.1177/01461672962210004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there are negative consequences for people who are less accurate expressors of gender-stereotypical emotions.

These consequences also extend to judging others' emotions. Studies have shown that there are negative social consequences for children who are deficient at judging gender-stereotypic nonverbal cues – angry nonverbal cues for boys and happy, sad, and fearful nonverbal cues for girls.  Communication of emotion involves both detection and expression of emotions or moods. The ability to detect non-verbal cues leads to successful communication of emotions. In [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC), the absence of body language and visibility restricts one's ability to correctly recognize other's [[emotion]]s.  For this reason, emoticons are widely used  in online communication to replace non-verbal behaviors that emphasize or clarify one's feelings.  Surprisingly, there is no static gender difference in the use of emoticons.  In some studies, both men and women display an increase in emoticon use in the context of a mixed-gender group chat.  Others show that men use more emoticons when interacting with women, while women show no change when interacting with men.&lt;ref name = derks&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derks | first1 = Daantje | last2 = Fischer | first2 = Agneta H. | last3 = Bos | first3 = Arjan E.R. | year = 2008 | title = The role of emotion in computer-mediated communication: A review | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 766–785 | doi =  10.1016/j.chb.2007.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature versus nurture==
{{Main article|Nature versus nurture}}
The social-developmental hypothesis is one of the major arguments for the impact of nurture on emotional expression.  The social-developmental theory explains gender differences in emotion expression through emphasizing "children's active role in their development of gendered behavior" through learning by watching adults or through interactions with their parents and peers (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name= chaplin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaplin | first1 = T. | last2 = Aldao | first2 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Gender differences in emotion expression in children: A meta-analytic review | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/bul-a0030737.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 139 | issue = 4| pages = 735–765 | doi=10.1037/a0030737 | pmid=23231534 | pmc=3597769}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis points to the fact that infants are not born with the same differences in emotional expression and gender differences generally grow more pronounced as children age.  In a 2012 meta-analysis conducted by Tara Chaplin and Amelia Aldao, researchers reviewed gender differences in emotion expression from the infancy period through adolescence in order to determine the impact of development and age on gender differences. Their findings support the notion that social factors in a child's development play a large role in the gender differences that later emerge, as "gender differences were not found in infancy…but they emerged by the toddler/preschool period and in childhood".&lt;ref name= chaplin /&gt; One possible explanation for this developmental difference comes from the child's parents.  In many Western cultures, for example, parents discuss and express a broader range of emotions with their daughters than their sons.&lt;ref name = wester&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = http://www.sagepub.com/counselingstudy/Journal%20Articles/Wester.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow older, these patterns continue with their peers.

The second major argument in support of social influences on emotion expression involves the idea that a society's gender roles reinforce gender differences.  The social constructionist theory states that children grow up in the context of gender roles that naturally place them in role-specific situations, influencing their emotion expression in that context.  Gender stereotypes in [[heteronormative]] societies enforce expectations for women to suppress anger and contempt, but express other emotions using words and facial expressions.  Simultaneously, these same cultural norms discourage men from verbally expressing emotions, with the exception of anger or contempt (Wester, Pressly, &amp; Heesacker, 2002).&lt;ref name = wester/&gt; As an adaptive feature, regulation of expression of emotion involves the consideration the social demands of any given situation.  Studies have shown that "fewer gender differences in emotion expression may be found when children are with someone they trust and know well than when children are with an unfamiliar person" (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name=chaplin /&gt; Generally, people are trained to behave in a "socially acceptable" way around strangers or acquaintances, suggesting that the social context of an environment can shape the levels of emotion expression.

Biological factors also play a role in influencing emotion expression.  One central biological argument is related to cognitive differences between genders. In a 2008 study using functional magnetic reasoning imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity in participants, researchers found that men and women differ in neural responses when experiencing negative emotions. "Compared with women, men showed lesser increases in prefrontal regions that are associated with reappraisal, greater decreases in the amygdala, which is associated with emotional responding, and lesser engagement of ventral striatal regions, which are associated with reward processing" (McRae, Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, &amp; Gross, 2008).&lt;ref name="mcrae"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McRae|first1=K.|last2=Ochsner|first2=K. N.|last3=Mauss|first3=I. B.|last4=Gabrieli|first4=J. J.|last5=Gross|first5=J. J.|year=2008|title=Gender differences in emotion regulation: An fMRI study of cognitive reappraisal|url=|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=11|issue=2|pages=143–162|doi=10.1177/1368430207088035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that male and female brains respond to emotions likely impacts the expression of those emotions.

The biological roots of gender differences interact with the social environment in various ways.  Biological theorists propose that females and males have innate differences that exist at birth, but unfold with age and maturation in response to interactions with their specific environments (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; An important argument for this viewpoint is that "gender differences in emotion expression are the result of a combination of biologically based temperamental predispositions and the socialization of boys and girls to adopt gender-related display rules for emotion expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L | year = 1997 | title = Gender and Emotion: Beyond Stereotypes | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 369–394 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1997.tb02448.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that even infant males display higher levels of activity and arousal than do infant girls as well as a lower ability for language and behavior inhibitory controls, which are biologically-based characteristics.  This "nature" argument interacts with "nurture" in that "parents and other socialization agents may respond to boys in ways that dampen emotional expressiveness…as a way to down-regulate their high emotional arousal and activity levels".&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; On the other hand, girls are encouraged to utilize their higher vocabulary and communication skills to verbally express their emotions to parents and other adults, which would also highlight expression differences between genders.

== "Man-box" ==
References to a figurative "man-box", an idea often attributed to [[TED (conference)|TED]] speaker Tony Porter, attempts to describe the societal restrictions on a man's freedom of emotional expression. As Porter describes, this restriction is a primary reason for high rates of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Porter|first=Tony|title=A call to men|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_porter_a_call_to_men|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his organization, ''A Call to Men'', Porter and his team organize initiatives and create awareness about what it means to possess "healthy manhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acalltomen.org/about-us/our-vision/|title=Mission/Vision|website=A Call To Men|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'man-box' is an analogous attempt to shed light on some of the cultural and social barriers we impose on men such as emotional reservedness, lack of physical intimacy with other men, and expectations of aggressive and/or dominant behavior in social environments.

==Controversies==
Emotions are complex and involve different components, such as physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, and conscious experience. While the expressive component of emotion has been widely studied, it remains unclear whether or not men and women differ in other aspects of emotion.  Most researchers agree that women are more emotionally expressive, but not that they experience more emotions than men do.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; Some studies have shown that women are more likely to produce inauthentic smiles than men do, while others have shown the opposite.  This debate is significant because emotion can be generated by adopting an action that is associated with a particular emotion, such as smiling and speaking softly.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

A possible explanation is that both men and women's emotional expressiveness is susceptible to social factors. Men and women may be reinforced by social and cultural standards to express emotions differently, but it is not necessarily true in terms of experiencing emotions. For instance, studies suggest that women often occupy roles that conform to feminine display rules, which require them to amplify their emotional response to impress others.&lt;ref name = derks /&gt;

[[File:CDC Graphic Artists at Work.jpg|right|thumb|Graphic artists at work during the 1960s]]
A category of [[fine art]], '''graphic art''' covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-art Graphic art]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Britannica.com. Retrieved 2016-02-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on colour, especially [[drawing]] and the various forms of [[engraving]];&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;"Graphic art." ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. 3rd ed.  Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to [[printmaking]] processes,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; such as [[line engraving]],  [[aquatint]], [[drypoint]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[monotyping|monotype]], [[lithography]], and [[screen printing]] (silk-screen, serigraphy).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph (1992). "Graphic arts, or graphics." ''The HarperCollins Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques''. 2nd ed. Revised and edited by Steven Sheehan. New York: Harper Perennial. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphic art further includes [[calligraphy]], [[photography]], [[painting]], [[typography]], [[computer graphics]], and [[bindery]]. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

==History==
Throughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as [[hieroglyphics]]. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others.&lt;ref name="Meggs"&gt;{{cite web|first=Philip B.|last=Meggs|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design |title=Graphic design|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-05 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, scribes [[scriptorium|manually copied]] each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to [[illuminated manuscript|insert drawings and decorations]]. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"&gt;McGuire-Lyle, Erin.  ''Careers in the Graphic Arts and Computer Graphics'' (Career Resource Library). June 2000. New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the [[printing press]] in 1450, the first outside of Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether.

Again during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on [[typeface]].

Due to the development of larger fonts during the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[posters]] became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.

The invention and popularity of [[film]] and [[television]] changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage.

The next major change in graphic arts came when the personal [[computer]] was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known.&lt;ref name="Meggs"/&gt;

The scientific investigations into legibility has influenced such things as the design of street signs. New York City is in the process of changing out all of its street signs bearing all capital letters for replacement with signs bearing only upper and lower case letters. They estimate that the increased legibility will facilitate way-finding and reduce crashes and injuries significantly.

== Graphic design software ==
{{off topic|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Vacation Rentals In Hawaii Image.jpg|thumb|Example of graphic arts created with the free tool, Paint.net.]]
Graphic artists applying for positions in today's job market are expected to be familiar with computers and a variety of software programs in order to create the most appealing, up to date designs.

Graphic art software includes applications such as:
*[[Adobe Dreamweaver]] – a tool that facilitates the creation of webpages and dynamic internet content
*[[Adobe Illustrator]] – an application that allows artists to manipulate vector graphics
*[[Adobe InDesign]] – desktop publishing software used for layout and design manipulation
*[[Adobe Photoshop]] – a bitmap graphics software including powerful graphics editing tools that provide a large variety of editing functionality
*[[CorelDRAW]] – similar to Adobe Illustrator, it is another vector graphic manipulation tool
*[[PhotoImpact]] – a digital photograph editor
*[[QuarkXPress]] – similar to Adobe InDesign, it is another computer publishing software tool

===Free software===
*[[Paint.net]] – photograph editing capabilities with lots of plugins to expand use
*[[GIMP]] – similar to paint.net and Photoshop
*[[Inkscape]] – similar to Illustrator

Beside computers and software, graphic artists are also expected to be creative with processing camera work, registration, crop marks, and masking.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt;

== Careers ==
{{howto|date=October 2013}}
One of the most common career paths for a graphic artist today is web design. With the popularity of the [[World Wide Web]], the demand for web designers is immense. Graphic artists use their creativity with layouts, typography, and [[logos]] to market the products or services of the client’s business. In addition to creating graphical designs, graphic artists also need to understand hypertext, web programming, and web page maintenance in order to successfully create a web page.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt; The responsibility for effective communication also falls under the auspices of the graphic designer.

'''Guerrilla Zoo'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Guerrilla Zoo | work=Official Website | url=http://www.guerrillazoo.com | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a contemporary arts organisation formed in 2004 by founder and creative director ''James Elphick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=James | last=Elphick | title=Interview with Curater of Modern Panic | url=http://www.lecoollondonblog.com/guerrillas-in-the-east-james-elphick/#more-7534 | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group produce a variety of creative events from experiential environments, live concerts, [[festivals]], immersive theatre, art exhibitions, arts awards, parties and [[masquerade ball]]s.

==Early Events==
The group fronted by James Elphick curated a series of irregular [[happenings]] starting in April 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kulture Jamming | work=Documentary Youtube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhuZ3NyAo3c | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at ''The Corsica Studios''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Corsica Studios | work=Arts Venue | url=http://www.corsicastudios.com | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing [[live art]], [[live music]] &amp; [[performance art]]. These events gain equal measures of popularity and notoriety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=It's Guerrilla Warefare | work=The London Paper, clipping | url=http://www.guerrillazoo.com/interzone-by-the-london-paper.html | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated with their last event at the venue in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Guerrilla Zoo Oro de Ojo | work=Soundsphere Magazine | url=http://www.soundspheremag.com/blog/event-preview-guerrilla-zoo-oro-de-ojo/ | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==William S. Burroughs==
On Friday 28 March 2008 at [[The Synergy Centre]] in Oval, London, Guerrilla Zoo held an event in homage to the works of cult writer [[William S. Burroughs]] which marked a changing point in the direction of its events. The popularity of the experiential event which combined all the elements of previous events but within an immersive environment set the precedent for future shows. Interzone was influenced by the strange and seedy city of ''Interzone'' described by Burroughs in his books, inspired by his time living in the north Moroccan city of Tangier during the late 1950s.

On Friday 7 February 2014 at [[Bunker 51]] in North Greenwich, London, Guerrilla Zoo returned to Interzone to celebrate Burroughs centennial with a new experimental event, with blessing from his estate. [[Dazed and Confused Magazine]] cited it as "The ultimate centenary party for the late creative rebel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How to celebrate William Burroughs 100th birthday | url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/18793/1/how-to-celebrate-100-years-of-william-s-burroughs | accessdate=20 Feb 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ten days over August and September 2014, Guerrilla Zoo's artistic director [[James Elphick]] and Yuri Zupancic curated an exhibition entitled 'Animals in the Wall' featuring over 50 original artworks by William S Burroughs, alongside artists such as [[Brion Gysin]], [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Cleon Peterson]] and Matt Black of [[Coldcut]], amongst others.
The exhibition was premiered in Shoreditch at Londonewcastle Project Space.

==Alejandro Jodorowsky==
In November 2009 Guerrilla Zoo celebrated the work of iconic figure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Lennon, Manson and me: the psychedelic cinema of Alejandro Jodorowsky | work=The Guardian Newspaper | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/14/alejandro-jodorowosky-el-topo | accessdate=17 May 2013 | location=London | first=Steve | last=Rose | date=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the arts [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] in a season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Season of Jodorowsky | work=Season of Jodorowsky Overview | url=http://www.guerrillazoo.com/season-of-jodorowsky | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting his work through theatre, film and music at venues in London. Events such as: The première of Alejandro Jodorowsky and his wife [[Pascale Montandon]] collaborative visual art at The Horse Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jodorowsky &amp; Montandon Exhibition |work=Interview vimeo| url=http://www.vimeo.com/32154468 | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also [[Brontis Jodorowsky]] starred in the solo production ''The Gorilla''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Gorilla Review | work=Remotegoat | url=http://www.remotegoat.co.uk/review_view.php?uid=4459 | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''Report to an Academy'' at Leicester Square Theatre, and the first Modern Panic exhibition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Panic Exhibition at The Old Abattoir | work=Spoonfed Review | url=http://www.spoonfed.co.uk/spooners/danielregan-5534/the-panic-exhibition-at-the-old-abattoir-1756/ | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was held at The Old Abbatoir, plus many other Jodorowsky-related events.

==Modern Panic==
The Modern Panic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Modern Panic : Dreams and Freedoms | work=Documentary Film | url=http://vimeo.com/65934475 | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; series is inspired by Alejandro Jodorowsky's [[Panic Movement]] and launched in 2009 originally as part of Season of Jodorowsky.  The now annual exhibition features provocative and controversial international artists and [[live art]]'s practitioners. It has established "a reputation for introducing new and edgy art"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=GUERRILLA ZOO – MODERN PANIC III INTERVIEW | work=Spindle Magazine | url=http://spindlemagazine.com/2012/11/guerrilla-zoo-modern-panic/ | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and been cited as "livening up modern art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Modern Panic III | work=Metro Newspaper Clipping | url=http://www.guerrillazoo.com/modern-panic-iii-by-metro.html | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Goblin King's Masquerade Ball==
In September 2010 Guerrilla Zoo launched a yearly themed and costumed ball which explores the darker side of fantasy. The Goblin King's Masquerade Ball&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Goblin King's Masquerade Ball | work=Official Site | url=http://www.goblin-king.co.uk | accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; features [[promenade theatre]], interactive creatures, puppetry, art installations &amp; [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] immersive games alongside live music, performance and occasionally market traders. In part inspired by the British conceptual designer and artist [[Brian Froud]] and the trend of [[Renaissance]] events in USA.

{{Globalize|date=December 2008}}
[[File:Calhan Colorado High School Gymnasium by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Calhan High School gymnasium in [[Calhan, Colorado]]]]

A '''gymnasium''', also known as a '''gym''', is a covered location for [[gymnastics]], [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]], and gymnastic services.  The word is derived from the ancient Greek [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|''gymnasium'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partridge|1984|p=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and [[learning space]]s in educational institutions.  "Gym" is also slang for "[[fitness center]]", which is often an area for indoor recreation.

Gymnasia apparatus such as barbells, parallel bars, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, fencing area, and so forth are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ravenstein|Hulley|1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included Gymnastica militaria or self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and gymnastica athletica for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them. Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing. There were schools of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in the 18th century, Salzmann, German clergyman, opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises, including running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in 1825, Doctor Beck, a German immigrant, established the first gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest in doing the same exercises, partly because of age. Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming. Some gym activities can be done by 6 to 8 year-olds while age 16 has been considered mature enough for boxing and horseback riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], the ''[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasion]]'' (γυμνάσιον) was a locality for both physical and intellectual [[education]] of young men. The latter meaning of intellectual education persisted in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[German language|German]] and other languages to denote a certain type of school providing [[secondary education]], the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], whereas in [[English language|English]] the meaning of physical education pertained in the word 'gym'.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Greek word ''gymnasium'' means "school for naked exercise" and was used to designate a locality for the [[education]] of young men, including physical education (''[[gymnastics]]'', i.e. exercise) which was customarily performed naked, as well as [[bathing]], and studies. For the Greeks, physical education was considered as important as cognitive learning. Most Greek ''gymnasia'' had libraries that could be utilized after relaxing in the baths.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==
[[File:Amsterdam - Gymnasium - 0591.jpg|thumb|right|Inside a gymnasium in Amsterdam]]
The first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient [[Persia]], where they were known as ''[[Pahlevani and zoorkhaneh rituals|zurkhaneh]]'', areas that encouraged physical fitness. The larger [[Thermae|Roman Baths]] often had attached fitness facilities, the baths themselves sometimes being decorated with [[mosaic]]s of local champions of sport. Gyms (''i.e''., places for gymnastics) in [[Germany]] were an outgrowth of the ''Turnplatz'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-turnplatz-open-air-gymnasium-in-the-hasenheide-1811-48390278.html|title=Stock Photo - Turnplatz (open-air gymnasium) in the Hasenheide, 1811|last=Limited|first=Alamy|website=Alamy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outdoor space for gymnastics, which was promoted by German educator [[Friedrich Jahn]] and the [[Turners]], a nineteenth-century political and gymnastic movement. The first indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built in [[Hesse]] in 1852 by Adolph Spiess, an enthusiast for boys' and girls' gymnastics in schools.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Through worldwide colonization, Great Britain expanded its national interest in sports and games to many countries. In the 1800s, programs were added to schools and college curricula that emphasized health, strength, and bodily measure. Sports drawn from European and British cultures thrived as college students and upper-class clubs financed competition. As a result, towns began building playgrounds that furthered interest in sports and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to physical education, exercise science, and sport studies|last=Lumpkin|first=Angela|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education; 9 edition|date=January 29, 2013|isbn=0078022665|location=|pages=226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the Turner movement thrived in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The first Turners group was formed in London in 1848. The Turners built gymnasia in several cities like Cincinnati and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] which had large [[German American]] populations. These gyms were utilized by adults and youth. For example, a young [[Lou Gehrig]] would frequent the Turner gym in [[New York City]] with his father.

The [[Boston Young Men's Christian Union]] claims to be "America's First Gym". The [[YMCA]] first organized in [[Boston]] in 1851 and a smaller branch opened in Rangasville in 1852. Ten years later there were some two hundred YMCAs across the country, most of which provided gymnasia for exercise, games, and social interaction.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The 1920s was a decade of prosperity that witnessed the building of large numbers of public high schools with a gymnasium, an idea founded by Nicolas Isaranga. Over the course of the 20th century, gymnasia have been reconceptualized to accommodate the popular team and individual games and sports that have supplanted gymnastics in the school [[curriculum]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Today, gymnasia are commonplace in the United States. They are in virtually all U.S. [[colleges]] and [[high school]]s, as well as almost all [[middle school]]s and [[elementary school]]s. These facilities are used for [[physical education]], [[intramural sports]], and school gatherings. The number of gyms in the U.S. has more than doubled since the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="The Scope of the U.S. Health Club Industry (industry estimates)."|journal=International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association (IHRSA). 2003.|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heinrich Graetz''' ({{IPA-de|ɡʁɛts|lang}}; 31 October 1817&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-the-Jews-Volume-Volume-6-Index/103369/29 "History of the Jews Volume 6" Page 5, 1898]&lt;/ref&gt; – 7 September 1891) was amongst the first historians to write a comprehensive history of the [[Jew]]ish people from a Jewish perspective.

Born Tzvi Hirsh Graetz to a butcher family in Xions (now [[Książ Wielkopolski]]), [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now in [[Poland]]), he attended [[University of Wrocław|Breslau University]], but since Jews at that time were barred from receiving Ph.D.s there, he obtained his doctorate from the [[University of Jena]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica, 2nd ed., vol. 8, sv. "Graetz, Heinrich"&lt;/ref&gt; After 1845 he was principal of the [[Jewish Orthodox]] school of the [[Wrocław|Breslau]] community, and later taught history at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland). His [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''History of the Jews'' was quickly translated into other languages and ignited worldwide interest in [[Jewish history]]. In 1869 the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] (Wrocław) granted him the title of Honorary Professor. In 1888 he was appointed an Honorary Member of the [[Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences]].

==Biography==
Graetz received his first instruction at [[Zerkov]], where his parents had relocated, and in 1831 was sent to [[Wolsztyn|Wolstein]], where he attended the [[yeshivah]] up to 1836, acquiring [[secular]] knowledge by private study. The "Neunzehn Briefe von Ben Uziel" (see [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]) made a powerful impression on him; and he resolved to prepare himself for academic studies in order to champion the cause of [[Orthodox Judaism]]. His first intention was to go to [[Prague]], to which place he was attracted by the fame of its old yeshivah and the facilities afforded by the university. Being rejected by the immigration officers, he returned to Zerkov and wrote to [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], then rabbi of Oldenburg, intimating his desire. Hirsch offered him a home in his house. Graetz arrived there on May 8, 1837, and spent three years with his patron as a pupil, companion, and amanuensis. In 1840 he accepted a tutorship with a family at [[Ostrów Wielkopolski|Ostrowo]], and in October 1842 he entered the University of Breslau.

At that time the controversy between Orthodoxy and [[Reform Judaism]] was at its height, and Graetz, true to the principles which he had imbibed from Hirsch, began his literary career by writing contributions to the "Orient," edited by [[Julius Fürst]], in which he severely criticized the Reform party, as well as Geiger's text-book of the [[Mishnah]] ("Orient," 1844). These contributions and his championship of the Conservative cause during the time of the rabbinical conferences made him popular with the Orthodox party. This was especially the case when he agitated for a vote of confidence to be given to [[Zecharias Frankel]] after he had left the [[Frankfurt]] conference because of the stand which the majority had taken on the question of the [[Hebrew language]]. After Graetz had obtained his degree of Ph.D. from the [[University of Jena]] (his dissertation being "De Auctoritate et Vi Quam Gnosis in Judaismum Habuerit," 1845; published a year later under the title "[[Gnosticism]]us und Judenthum"), he was made principal of a religious school founded by the Conservatives in Breslau. In the same year he was invited to preach a trial sermon before the congregation of [[Gliwice|Gleiwitz]], [[Silesia]], but failed completely.

He remained in Breslau until 1848, when, upon the advice of a friend, he went to Vienna, purposing to follow a journalistic career. On the way he stopped at [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]], where [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] was residing as Moravian chief rabbi. Hirsch, who then contemplated the establishment of a rabbinical seminary, employed Graetz temporarily as teacher at Nikolsburg, and afterward gave him a position as principal of the Jewish school in the neighboring city of Lundenburg (1850). In October 1850, Graetz married Marie Monasch, the daughter of the printer and publisher B. L. Monasch, of [[Krotoszyn|Krotoschin]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Memoirs of B. L. Monasch of Krotoschin", edited and translated by [[Peter Fraenkel (journalist)|Peter Fraenkel]]. ''Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook'' (1979) 24 (1): 195-223; here: p. 213. [[doi: 10.1093/leobaeck/24.1.195]].&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Hirsch's departure from Nikolsburg had an influence on Graetz's position; for in 1852 the latter left [[Lundenburg]] and went to Berlin, where he delivered a course of lectures on Jewish history before rabbinical students. They do not seem to have been successful. Meantime his advocacy of Frankel's course had brought him into close contact with the latter, for whose magazine he frequently wrote articles; and accordingly in 1854 he was appointed a member of the teaching staff of the seminary at Breslau, over which Frankel presided. In this position he remained up to his death, teaching history and Bible exegesis, with a preparatory course on the [[Talmud]]. In 1869 the government conferred upon him the title of professor, and thenceforward he lectured at Breslau University.

In 1872 Graetz went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the company of his friend [[Gottschalck Levy]] of [[Berlin]], for the purpose of studying the scenes of the earliest period of Jewish history, which he treated in volumes  one and two of his history, published in 1874-76; these volumes brought that great work to a close. While in Palestine, he gave the first impetus to the foundation of an orphan asylum there. He also took a great interest in the progress of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]], and participated as a delegate in the convention assembled at Paris in 1878 in the interest of the [[Romania]]n Jews. Graetz's name was prominently mentioned in the [[anti-Semitic]] controversy, especially after [[Heinrich von Treitschke|Treitschke]] had published his "Ein Wort über Unser Judenthum" (1879–1880), in which the latter, referring to the eleventh volume of the history, accused Graetz of hatred of [[Christianity]] and of bias against the [[German people]], quoting him as a proof that the Jews could never assimilate themselves to their surroundings.

[[File:Grobowiec-HeinrichGraetz.jpg|thumb|Graetz's tomb in the [[Old Jewish Cemetery, Wrocław|Jewish Cemetery in Wrocław]]]]

This arraignment of Graetz had a decided effect upon the public. Even friends of the Jews, like [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], and advocates of Judaism within the Jewish fold expressed their condemnation of Graetz's passionate language. It was due to this comparative unpopularity that Graetz was not invited to join the commission created by the union of German Jewish congregations ([[Deutsch-Israelitischer Gemeindebund]]) for the promotion of the study of the history of the Jews of Germany (1885). On the other hand, his fame spread to foreign countries; and the promoters of the [[Anglo-Jewish Exhibition]] invited him in 1887 to open the Exhibition with a lecture. His seventieth birthday was the occasion for his friends and disciples to bear testimony to the universal esteem in which he was held among them; and a volume of scientific essays was published in his honor ("Jubelschrift zum 70. Geburtstage des Prof. Dr. H. Graetz," Breslau, 1887). A year later (27 October 1888) he was appointed an honorary member of the [[Spanish Academy]], to which, as a token of his gratitude, he dedicated the third edition of the eighth volume of his history.

As usual he spent the summer of 1891 in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]]; but alarming symptoms of heart disease forced him to discontinue his use of the waters. He went to Munich to visit his son [[Leo Graetz|Leo]], a professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|university of that city]], and died there after a brief illness. He was buried in Breslau. Besides Leo, Graetz left three sons and one daughter.

==Works==

===History of the Jews===
Graetz is chiefly known as the Jewish historian, although he did considerable work in the field of [[exegesis]] also. His ''Geschichte der Juden'' superseded all former works of its kind, notably that of [[Isaak Markus Jost|Jost]], in its day a very remarkable production; and it has been translated into many languages. The fourth volume, beginning with the period following the destruction of Jerusalem, was published first. It appeared in 1853; but the publication was not a financial success, and the publisher refused to continue it. However, the publication society [[Institut zur Förderung der Israelitischen Litteratur]], founded by [[Ludwig Philippson]], had just come into existence, and it undertook the publication of the subsequent volumes, beginning with the third, which covered the period from the death of [[Judas Maccabeus]] to the destruction of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]]. This was published in 1856 and was followed by the fifth, after which the volumes appeared in regular succession up to the eleventh, which was published in 1870 and brought the history down to 1848, with which year the author closed, not wishing to include living persons.

In spite of this reserve he gravely offended the Liberal party, which inferred, from articles that Graetz contributed to the ''Monatsschrift'', that he would show little sympathy for the Reform element, and therefore refused to publish the volume unless the manuscript was submitted for examination. This Graetz refused to do; and the volume therefore appeared without the support of the publication society. Volumes i. and ii. were published, as stated above, after Graetz had returned from Israel. These volumes, of which the second practically consisted of two, appeared in 1872-75, and completed the stupendous undertaking. For more popular purposes Graetz published later an abstract of his work under the title ''Volksthümliche Geschichte der Juden'', in which he brought the history down to his own time.

The fourth volume of the ''History of the Jews'' received a detailed review by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in a series of essays in Vols. II-IV (1855-8) of his monthly journal ''Jeschurun''. In these essays, a 203-page masterpiece of objective critique, Hirsch proves beyond doubt that Graetz is guilty of the utmost sloppiness of scholarship: e.g., Graetz omitted the second halves of quotations which, if quoted in their entirety, flatly contradict his thesis. Graetz claims, on the basis of one or two quotations from certain Talmudic sages, that they "were wont to do" something - despite sources explicitly to the contrary - and goes on to develop these suppositions into theories affecting the entire Torah tradition. Graetz fabricates dates, rearranges generations, speaks of "most of these laws" when in fact his description applies, even by a charitable interpretation, to fewer than half, and in many other ways rewrites the Talmud to support his theses and facilitate the flow of his history.

A translation into English was begun by [[S. Tuska]], who in 1867 published in [[Cincinnati]] a translation of part of vol. ix. under the title "Influence of Judaism on the [[Protestant Reformation]]". The fourth volume was translated by James K. Gutheim under the auspices of the American Jewish Publication Society, the title being "History of the Jews from the Down-fall of the [[Jewish State]] to the Conclusion of the Talmud" (New York, 1873).

A five-volume English edition was published in London in 1891-92 as ''History of the Jews from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'' (5 vols.; edited and in part translated by Bella Löwy).  According to a review in the January–April 1893 edition of ''[[Quarterly Review]]'', it "was passing through the press in its English version, and had received the author's final touches, when Graetz died in September 1891".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Quarterly Review |issue=January &amp; April 1893}}, reprinted in {{Cite journal|title=Littel's Living Age |issue=April–June 1893 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=geuPPcrxzykC&amp;pg=PA467#PPA451,M1 |volume=197 |author1=Littell, Eliakim |author2=Project, Making of America |author3=Littell, Robert S |year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the Jordan Publishing Co. of New York published a two-volume "improved" edition, with a supplement of recent events by Dr. Max Raisin. Rabbi A. B. Rhine provided the English translation.

===Exegesis===
Graetz's historical studies, extending back to [[Biblical]] times, naturally led him into the field of [[exegesis]]. As early as the fifties he had written in the "Monatsschrift" essays dealing with exegetical subjects, as "Fälschungen in dem Texte der LXX." (1853) and "Die Grosse Versammlung: Keneset Hagedola " (1857); and with his translation of and commentaries on Ecclesiastes and Canticles (Breslau, 1871) he began the publication of separate exegetical works. A commentary and translation of the Psalms followed (ib. 1882-83). Toward the end of his life he planned an edition of the whole Hebrew Bible with his own [[textual emendation]]s. A prospectus of this work appeared in 1891. Shortly before the author's death, a part of it, [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]], was issued in the form in which the author had intended to publish it; the rest contained only the textual notes, not the text itself. It was edited, under the title "Emendationes in Plerosque Sacræ Scripturæ Veteris Testamenti Libros," by W. Bacher (Breslau, 1892–94).

The most characteristic features of Graetz's exegesis are his bold textual emendations, which often substitute something conjectural for the [[Masoretic]] text, although he always carefully consulted the ancient versions. He also determined with too much certainty the period of a Biblical book or a certain passage, when at best there could only be a probable hypothesis. Thus his hypothesis of the origin of [[Ecclesiastes]] at the time of [[Herod the Great]], while brilliant in its presentation, is hardly tenable. His textual emendations display fine tact, and of late they have become more and more respected and adopted.

===Other literary work===
Graetz's activity was not limited to his special field. He enriched other branches of Jewish science, and wrote here and there on general literature or on questions of the day. To the field of general literature belongs also his essay on "[[Shylock]]," published in the ''Monatsschrift'', 1880. In the early years of the anti-Semitic movement he wrote, besides the articles in which he defended himself against the accusations of Treitschke, an anonymous essay entitled "Briefwechsel einer Englischen Dame über Judenthum und Semitismus," Stuttgart, 1883. To supplement his lectures on Jewish literature he published an anthology of neo-Hebraic poetry under the title "Leḳeṭ Shoshannim" (Breslau, 1862), in which he committed the mistake of reading the verses of a poem horizontally instead of vertically, which mistake Geiger mercilessly criticized (''Jüdische Zeitschrift für Wissenschaft und Leben'', 1, p.&amp;nbsp;68-75). A very meritorious work was his edition of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] in one volume (Krotoschin, 1866). A bibliography of his works has been given by [[Israel Abrahams]] in ''The [[Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' (4, p.&amp;nbsp;194-203).

====The Kompert Affair====
Graetz's essay "Die Verjüngung des jüdischen Stammes," in Wertheimer-Kompert's ''Jahrbuch für Israeliten'', vol. x., Vienna, 1863 (reprinted with comments by Th. Zlocisti, in ''Jüdischer Volks-Kalender'', p.&amp;nbsp;99, Brünn, 1903), caused a suit to be brought against him by the clerical anti-Semite [[Sebastian Brunner]] for libeling the Jewish religion. As Graetz was not an [[Austria]]n subject, the suit was nominally brought against [[Leopold Kompert]] as editor, and the latter was fined (30 December 1863).

Graetz had interpreted [[Isaiah]] chapters 52 and 53 to refer not to the personal [[Messiah]], but rather to the entire people Israel. Graetz and Kompert were brought to court in Vienna for publishing ideas that were heretical to the Catholic faith, in addition to contradicting Jewish tradition. Viennese rabbis [[Isaak Noah Mannheimer]] and [[Lazar Horowitz]] defended Graetz, and [[Azriel Hildesheimer]] criticized them for doing so; [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]] published a pamphlet entitled ''Neẓaḥ Yisrael'' in support of their testimony.

This case, known as the "Kompert Affair," was important in defining the wedge between [[Orthodox Judaism]] and the nascent [[Conservative Judaism]] championed by the likes of Graetz and [[Zecharias Frankel]]. Thus, within the Jewish fold the lawsuit also had its consequences, as the Orthodox raised against Graetz the accusation of heresy because he had denied the personal character of the prophetic [[Messiah]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Legacy==
Graetz's history became very popular and influential in its time. The material for Jewish history being so varied, the sources so scattered in the literatures of all nations, and the chronological sequence so often interrupted, made the presentation of this history as a whole a very difficult undertaking; and it can not be denied that Graetz performed his task with consummate skill, that he mastered most of the details while not losing sight of the whole. Another reason for the popularity of the work is its sympathetic treatment. This history of the Jews is not written by a cool observer, but by a warm-hearted Jew. On the other hand, some of these commendable features are at the same time shortcomings. {{according to whom|date=April 2017}}

Some characterize Graetz's main elements of Jewish experience through the ages to be 'suffering and spiritual scholarship', while later Jewish scholarly works like [[Salo W. Baron]]'s 1937 ''A Social and Religious History of the Jews'', opposed the view of Jewish history as being 'all darkness and no light' and sought to restore balance, by writing a social history.  Baron strove to integrate the religious dimension of Jewish history into a full picture of Jewish life and to integrate the history of Jews into the wider history of the eras and societies in which they lived.   Baron brought very distinctive views to his scholarship. He inveighed against what he termed the "lachrymose conception of Jewish history," sometimes identified with Heinrich Graetz. In a 1975 interview Baron said: "Suffering is part of the destiny [of the Jews], but so is repeated joy as well as ultimate redemption." According to [[Arthur Hertzberg]], Baron was writing social history, insisting that spiritual creativity and the political situation were all borne by a living society and its changing forms,''&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEED91630F935A15752C1A96F948260 Salo W.

An '''hydrological transport model''' is a [[mathematical model]] used to simulate river or [[stream flow]] and calculate [[water quality]] parameters. These models generally came into use in the 1960s and 1970s when demand for numerical forecasting of water quality was driven by [[environmental legislation]], and at a similar time widespread access to significant computer power became available. Much of the original model development took place in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], but today these models are refined and used worldwide.

There are dozens of different transport models that can be generally grouped by [[water pollution|pollutants]] addressed, complexity of pollutant sources, whether the model is steady state or dynamic, and time period modeled. Another important designation is whether the model is distributed (i.e. capable of predicting multiple points within a river) or lumped. In a basic model, for example, only one pollutant might be addressed from a simple point discharge into the [[receiving water]]s. In the most complex of models, various [[line source]] inputs from [[surface runoff]] might be added to multiple [[Point source (pollution)|point source]]s, treating a variety of [[chemical]]s plus [[sediment]] in a dynamic environment including vertical river stratification and interactions of pollutants with in-stream [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. In addition [[Drainage basin|watershed]] [[groundwater]] may also be included. The model is termed "physically based" if its parameters can be measured in the field.

Often models have separate modules to address individual steps in the simulation process. The most common module is a [[subroutine]] for calculation of surface runoff, allowing variation in [[land use]] type, [[topography]], [[soil]] type, [[vegetation|vegetative cover]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and land management practice (such as the application rate of a [[fertilizer]]). The concept of hydrological modeling can be extended to other environments such as the [[ocean]]s, but most commonly (and in this article) the subject of a river watershed is generally implied.

==History==

In 1850, T. J. Mulvany was probably the first investigator to use mathematical modeling in a [[stream hydrology]] context, although there was no chemistry involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulvany | first1 = T.J. | year = 1850 | title = On the use of self registering rain and flow gauges | url = | journal = [[Proc. Institute Civ. Eng.]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1892 M.E. Imbeau had conceived an [[event model]] to relate runoff to peak rainfall, again still with no chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Imbeau, (1892) ''La Durance: Regime. Crues et inundations'', ''Ann. Ponts Chausses Mem. Doc. Ser.'' 3(I) 5-18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Horton]]’s seminal work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = R.E. | year = 1933 | title = The role of infiltration on the hydrologic cycle | url = | journal = Trans. Am. Geophys. Union | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 446–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[surface runoff]] along with his coupling of quantitative treatment of erosion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = R.E. | year = 1945 | title = Erosional development of streams and their drainage basins: Hydrological approach to quantitative geomorphology | url = | journal = [[Bull. Geol. Soc. Am.]] | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 275–330 | doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1945)56[275:edosat]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the groundwork for modern chemical transport hydrology.

==Types==

===Physically based models===

Physically based models (sometimes known as deterministic, comprehensive or process-based models) try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of surface runoff, subsurface flow, evapotranspiration, and channel flow, but they can be far more complicated. "Large scale simulation experiments were begun by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1953 for reservoir management on the main stem of the Missouri River". This,&lt;ref&gt;''Report on use of electronic computers for integrating reservoir operations'', vol.1 DATAmatic Corporation technical reports, prepared in cooperation with Raytheon Manufacturing Company for the Missouri River Division, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, January, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; and other early work that dealt with the River Nile&lt;ref&gt;M.P.Barnett, ''Comment on the Nile Valley Calculations'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, vol. 19, 223, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.A.W. Morrice and W.N. Allan, ''Planning for the ultimate hydraulic development of the Nile Valley'', Proceedings of the Institute of Civil Engineers, 14, 101, 1959,&lt;/ref&gt; and the Columbia River&lt;ref&gt;F.S. Brown, ''Water Resource Development -- Columbia River Basin'', in ''Report of Meeting of Columbia Basin Inter-Agency Committee, Portland, OR, Dec. 1958&lt;/ref&gt; are discussed, in a wider context, in a book published by the Harvard Water Resources Seminar, that contains the sentence just quoted.&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Manzer and M.P. Barnett, ''Analysis by Simulation: Programming techniques for a High-Speed Digital Computer'', in Arthur Maas ''et al'', ''Design of Water Resource Systems'', pp. 324--390, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early model that integrated many submodels for basin chemical hydrology was the Stanford Watershed Model (SWM).&lt;ref&gt;N.H. Crawford and R.K. Linsley. ''Digital simulation in hydrology: Stanford Watershed Model IV'', Technical Report No.39 [[Stanford University]], Palo Alto, Ca. (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; The SWMM ([[Storm Water Management Model]]), the HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN) and other modern [[United States|American]] derivatives are successors to this early work.

In Europe a favoured comprehensive model is the Système Hydrologique Européen (SHE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = P.E.O'Connell | last2 = Bathurst | first2 = J.C. | last3 = Cunge | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Rasmussen | first4 = J. | year = 1986 | title = An Introduction to the European System: Systeme Hydrologique Europeen (SHE) | url = | journal = [[Journal of Hydrology]] | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 61–77 | doi=10.1016/0022-1694(86)90115-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vijay P. Singh,, ''Computer Models of Watershed Hydrology, Water Resource Publications'', pgs. 563-594 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; which has been succeeded by [[MIKE SHE]] and [[SHETRAN]]. [[MIKE SHE]] is a watershed-scale physically based, spatially distributed model for water flow and [[sediment transport]]. Flow and transport processes are represented by either finite difference representations of partial [[differential equation]]s or by derived empirical equations. The following principal submodels are involved:

:* [[Evapotranspiration]]: [[Penman-Monteith]] formalism
:* Erosion: Detachment equations for raindrop and overland flow
:* Overland and [[Channel (geography)|Channel]] Flow: Saint-Venant equations of continuity and [[momentum]]
:* Overland Flow [[Sediment]] Transport: 2D total sediment load conservation equation
:* Unsaturated Flow: [[Richards equation]]
:* Saturated Flow: [[Darcy's law]] and the [[conservation of mass|mass conservation]] of 2D laminar flow
:* Channel Sediment Transport 1D mass conservation equation.

This model can analyze effects of [[land use]] and [[climate change]]s upon in-stream water quality, with consideration of [[groundwater]] interactions.

Worldwide a number of basin models have been developed, among them RORB ([[Australia]]), Xinanjiang ([[China]]), Tank model ([[Japan]]), ARNO ([[Italy]]), TOPMODEL ([[Europe]]), UBC ([[Canada]]) and [[HBV hydrology model|HBV]] ([[Scandinavia]]), MOHID Land ([[Portugal]]). However, not all of these models have a chemistry component. Generally speaking, SWM, SHE and TOPMODEL have the most comprehensive stream chemistry treatment and have evolved to accommodate the latest data sources including [[remote sensing]] and [[geographic information system]] data.

In the United States, the Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center in conjunction with a researchers at a number of universities have developed the Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis [[GSSHA]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Downer, C.W., and F.L. Ogden, 2006, Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) User's Manual, Version 1.43 for Watershed Modeling System 6.1, System Wide Water Resources Program, Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, ERDC/CHL SR-06-1, 207 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Downer | first1 = C.W. | last2 = Ogden | first2 = F.L. | year = 2004 | title = GSSHA: A model for simulating diverse streamflow generating processes | url = | journal = J. Hydrol. Engrg | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 161–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downer, C.W., F.L. Ogden, J. M. Niedzialek, and S. Liu, 2006, Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) Model: A Model for Simulating Diverse Streamflow Producing Processes, pp.&amp;nbsp;131–159, in Watershed Models, V.P. Singh, and D. Frevert, eds., Taylor and Francis Group, CRC Press, 637 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[GSSHA]] is widely used in the U.S. for research and analysis by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts and larger consulting companies to compute flow, water levels, distributed erosion, and sediment delivery in complex [[engineering]] designs. A distributed nutrient and contaminant fate and transport component is undergoing testing. [[GSSHA]] input/output processing and interface with [[GIS]] is facilitated by the Watershed Modeling System (WMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaveo.com/wms|publisher=[[Aquaveo]]|title=Watershed Modeling System|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model used in the United States and worldwide is [[Vflo|V''flo'']], a physics-based distributed hydrologic model developed by Vieux &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vieuxinc.com Vieuxinc.com]&lt;/ref&gt; V''flo'' employs radar rainfall and GIS data to compute spatially distributed overland flow and channel flow. Evapotranspiration, inundation, infiltration, and snowmelt modeling capabilities are included. Applications include civil infrastructure operations and maintenance, stormwater prediction and emergency management, soil moisture monitoring, land use planning, water quality monitoring, and others.

===Stochastic models===

These models based on data are [[Black box (systems)|black box]] systems, using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance [[rainfall]]) to the model output (for instance [[Surface runoff|runoff]]). Commonly used techniques are [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[transfer function]]s, [[neural networks]] and [[system identification]]. These models are known as stochastic hydrology models. Data based models have been used within hydrology to simulate the rainfall-runoff relationship, represent the impacts of [[antecedent moisture]] and perform real-time control on systems.

==Model components==

===Surface runoff modelling===

[[Image:ColumbiarivergorgeJRH.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Columbia River]], which has [[surface runoff]] from [[agriculture]] and [[logging]]]]

A key component of a hydrological transport model is the [[surface runoff]] element, which allows assessment of sediment, [[fertilizer]], [[pesticide]] and other chemical contaminants. Building on the work of Horton, the unit hydrograph theory was developed by Dooge in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;J.C.I. Dooge, ''Parameterization of hydrologic processes'', JSC Study Conference on Land Surface Processes in Atmospheric General Circulation Models, 243-284 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; It required the presence of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and kindred other national legislation to provide the impetus to integrate water chemistry to hydrology model protocols. In the early 1970s the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began sponsoring a series of water quality models in response to the [[Clean Water Act]]. An example of these efforts was developed at the Southeast Water Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw, Harry Seidman et al. ''Computer modeling of pesticide transport in soil for five instrumented watersheds'', U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Southeast Water Laboratory, Athens, Ga. by [[ESL Inc.]], Sunnyvale, California (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first attempts to calibrate a surface runoff model with field data for a variety of chemical contaminants.

The attention given to surface runoff contaminant models has not matched the emphasis on pure hydrology models, in spite of their role in the generation of stream loading contaminant data. In the United States the EPA has had difficulty interpreting&lt;ref&gt;Steven Grant, I K Iskandar , ''Contaminant Hydrology'', CRC Press (2000) {{ISBN|1-56670-476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; diverse proprietary contaminant models and has to develop its own models more often than conventional resource agencies, who, focused on [[flood]] forecasting, have had more of a centroid of common basin models.

==Example applications==

Liden applied the [[HBV hydrology model|HBV model]] to estimate the riverine transport of three different substances, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[suspended sediment]]&lt;ref&gt;Rikard Liden, ''Conceptual Runoff Models for Material Transport Estimations'', PhD dissertation, [[Lund University]], Lund, Sweden (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; in four different countries: [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. The relation between internal hydrological model variables and [[nutrient]] transport was assessed. A model for [[nitrogen]] sources was developed and analysed in comparison with a statistical method. A model for suspended sediment transport in [[tropical]] and [[semi-arid]] regions was developed and tested. It was shown that riverine total nitrogen could be well simulated in the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] climate and riverine suspended sediment load could be estimated fairly well in tropical and semi-arid climates. The HBV model for material transport generally estimated material transport loads well. The main conclusion of the study was that the HBV model can be used to predict material transport on the scale of the [[drainage basin]] during stationary conditions, but cannot be easily generalised to areas not specifically calibrated. In a different work, Castanedo et al. applied an evolutionary algorithm to automated watershed model calibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castanedo | first1 = F. | last2 = Patricio | first2 = M.A. | last3 = Molina | first3 = J.M. | year = | title = Evolutionary Computation Technique Applied to HSPF Model Calibration of a Spanish Watershed | doi = 10.1007/11875581_26 | journal = IDEAL | volume = 2006 | issue = | pages = 216–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:lake-tahoe.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Lake Tahoe]], [[headwater]] sub-basin of the [[Truckee River]] watershed]]

The United States EPA developed the [[DSSAM Model]] to analyze [[water pollution|water quality]] impacts from [[land use]] and [[wastewater]] management decisions in the [[Truckee River]] basin, an area which include the cities of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Sparks, Nevada]] as well as the [[Lake Tahoe]] basin. The model&lt;ref&gt;''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; satisfactorily predicted nutrient, sediment and dissolved oxygen parameters in the river. It is based on a pollutant loading [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] called "Total Daily Maximum Load" (TDML). The success of this model contributed to the EPA’s commitment to the use of the underlying TDML protocol in EPA’s national policy for management of many river systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;USEPA. 1991. ''Guidance for water quality-based decisions: The TMDL process'', EPA 440/4-91-001. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSSAM Model is constructed to allow dynamic decay of most pollutants; for example, total nitrogen and phosphorus are allowed to be consumed by [[Benthic zone|benthic]] [[alga]]e in each time step, and the algal communities are given a separate population dynamic in each river reach (e.g. based upon river temperature). Regarding stormwater runoff in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], the specific elements within a new [[xeriscape]] ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model. For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in-river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two [[endangered species]] found in the [[Truckee River]] and [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]]  (endangered 1967) and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] (threatened 1970).

'''Instituts d'études politiques''' ({{Lang-en|'''Institutes of Political Studies'''}}), or '''IEPs''', are ten publicly owned institutions of higher learning in France. They are located in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Grenoble]], [[Lille]], [[Lyon]], [[Paris]], [[Rennes]], [[Strasbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep-strasbourg.fr/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toulouse]], and since 2014 [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integrersciencespo.fr/index.php?article340/un-nouvel-iep-sciences-po-grand-paris&lt;/ref&gt; Their vocation is the study and research of contemporary political science. All students at the IEPs study a curriculum that is highly practical and broadbased, focusing on the full range of the social sciences: law, economics, finance, management, etc. These schools are considered as some of the most selective in France, mainly because they are the place where main political and business leaders are born.

These establishments are more known under the name of Sciences Po, followed by the name of the city where they are located (for example Sciences Po Bordeaux). The epithet ''Sciences Po'' without precision of place indicates the IEP Paris. The Paris Institute is referred to as simply the Sciences Po because it is the school after which all other IEPs in France were modelled from the inception of the IEP system by [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1945, apart from Strasbourg, which was created by the same law but with the status of an internal institute of the Robert Schuman University.

According to article 2 of an 18 December 1989 decree, their mission is:
# to contribute to the training of higher civil servants as well as executives in the public, para-public and private sectors, notably in the State and decentralized communities
# to develop the research in political and administrative sciences

The Sciences Po approach and style inspired many universities in France but also abroad (the most famous example is that of the [[London School of Economics]], founded on the model of the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques).

==Critérium==
Every year an inter-IEP competition is held, hosted by the hometown of one of the IEPs and attended by participants from all 10 IEPs. The first ''crit'', as it is known colloquially, was created in 1987 by the IEPs of [[Bordeaux]] and [[Toulouse]] who decided to have a friendly rugby match.

This competition takes the form of a 3-day sports event and party, and is held over the last weekend of March, run by the host university's "Sports office". The hosting of an event generally costs about 200,000 [[euro]]s, funded by the participants, as well as by sponsors and grants. The hosting of the event is rotated between the different IEPs each year.

The '''International Development Design Summit''' is a collaboration to find cost effective technology solutions for the third world. It was first held in 2007 at [[MIT]]. It is held annually to study problems in the developing world and create real, workable solutions to them.&lt;ref name=PCOLMitnews/&gt;

==Background==
"I believe very strongly that solutions to problems in the developing world are best created in collaboration with the people who will be using them", said founder Amy Smith .&lt;ref name=PCOLMitnews/&gt; "By bringing this group of people together, we get an incredibly broad range of backgrounds and experiences.&lt;ref name=PCOLMitnews&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/iddesignsummit-0713.html "Making a difference in the developing world"] by Heather Manning, ''MIT News'', July 13, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''WorldChanging'' reported on August 14, 2007 that the results from the first International Development Design Summit (IDDS) had been very positive with end products including an off-grid refrigeration unit tailored for rural areas using an evaporative cooling method to store perishable food and a low-cost greenhouse from recycled and widely available materials.&lt;ref name=PCOLWorldchanging&gt;[http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007106.html "South-South Design Flourishes at MIT Summit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826185714/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007106.html |date=2007-08-26 }} by Jonathon Greenblatt, ''World Changing''.

* '''IV International Exhibition of Calligraphy'''

Date — November 1 – December 15, 2012. Venue — the [[Museum of Calligraphy|Contemporary museum of calligraphy]].

10 new authors from European and Eastern countries with their distinct styles and personalities took part in the 4th International Exhibition of Calligraphy. Valerian Bakharev’s “I Ching Signs” consisting of 64 hexagrammic paintings became the symbol of the exposition.

The unique feature of this exhibition was the fact that the exposition changed 6 times. The program included lectures and workshops for both adults and children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m24.ru/videos/5031 “The 4th International Exhibition of Calligraphy opened in Sokolniki”], Moskva 24 TV-channel, November 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''V International Exhibition of Calligraphy'''

V International Exhibition of Calligraphy was held in Moscow March 14 through April 12, 2015. The anniversary event boasted with the participation of a recorв number of participants: 90 artists from 52 countries who presented 201 calligraphy artworks. The theme of the exposition was ‘Reflections on the Motherland’.

== Project’s development ==

=== National Union of Calligraphers ===

On May 14, 2008 the National Union of Calligraphers was established at the International Exhibition of Calligraphy. The handwritten charter with many famous Russian calligraphers’ signatures testifies to the Union’s birth. Under the Charter the Union aims at revival of the art of calligraphy in Russia, creating conditions for its development and admitting everybody who is willing to learn the beauty of writing. Petr Chobitko was elected Chairman of the Union with Alexey Shaburov as its President.

The most outstanding Union’s masterpiece is the Handwritten Constitution of the Russian Federation performed by Pyotr Chobitko in person. It is stored at Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy. Miniature copies of the piece have been prepared as gift editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21926">In the height region between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km altitude on Earth, the ionospheric plasma is electrically conducting. Atmospheric tidal winds due to differential  solar heating or due to gravitational lunar forcing move the ionospheric plasma against the [[geomagnetic field]] lines thus generating electric fields and currents just like a [[dynamo]] coil moving against magnetic field lines. That region is therefore called '''ionospheric dynamo region'''.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels&gt;Chapman , S.J. and J. Bartels, „Geomagnetism“ , Clarendon Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; 
The magnetic manifestation of these electric currents on the ground  can be observed during magnetospheric quiet conditions. They are called Sq-variations (S=solar; q=quiet) and L-variations  (L=lunar) of the geomagnetic field.
Additional electric currents are generated by the varying  [[magnetospheric electric convection field]]. These are the DP1-currents (the auroral electrojets) and the  polar DP2-currents.
&lt;ref name=Akasofu&gt;Akasofu, S.I., "Physics of Magnetospheric Substorms", Reidel, Dordrecht, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a polar-ring current has been derived from the observations which depends on the polarity of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;Heppner, J.P., in Dyer, E.R. (ed), "Critical Problems of Magnetospheric Physics", Nat. Acad. Sci.,Washington, D.C., p. 107. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; These geomagnetic variations belong to the so-called external part of the [[geomagnetic field]]. Their amplitudes reach at most about 1% of the main internal [[geomagnetic field]] '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Atmospheric Electric Conductivity==
Radioactive material from the ground and galactic cosmic rays ionize a small fraction  of the atmospheric gas within the lower and middle atmosphere  and make the gas electrically conducting. Electrons quickly  attach to neutral particles forming negative ions. The positive ions are mostly singly charged. The electric conductivity depends on the mobility of the ions . That mobility  is proportional to the reciprocal air density. Thus, the electric conductivity increases almost  exponentially with altitude.  The ions move with the neutral gas making the conductivity [[isotropic]].&lt;ref&gt;Viggiano, A.A., and F. Arnold, in Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. 1, p. 1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

At heights between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km however -the dynamo region-, solar X- and extreme [[ultraviolet radiation]] (XUV) is almost completely absorbed  generating the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers.  Here, the electrons are already bound to the [[geomagnetic field]] gyrating several times about these lines before they collide with the neutrals, while the positive ions still essentially move with the neutral gas. Thus, the electric conductivity becomes [[anisotropic]]. The conductivity parallel to an electric field  '''E'''  is called  [[Pedersen]] conductivity.  The conductivity orthogonal to '''E''' and the geomagnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  is the [[Hall]] conductivity. Ohmic losses and thus [[Joule]] heating occur when Pedersen currents flow. The component parallel to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  still increases with altitude. Near the geomagnetic dip equator, a west-east directed electric field generates vertical Hall currents which cannot close. Therefore,  a vertical polarization field builds up generating a horizontal Hall current which adds to the Pedersen current. Such enhancement is described by the [[Cowling]] conductivity. Pedersen and Hall conductivities reach maximum values near 120 to 140&amp;nbsp;km  altitudes with numbers of about 1 mS/m during sunlit conditions. During the night, these numbers may decrease by a factor of ten or more. The values of  these conductivities depend on local time, latitude, season and solar 11- year cycle. The height integrated conductivities become of the order of 50 S, or  a total resistance of the dynamo region of about 1/50 = 0.02 Ohm during daytime conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Fejer, A.A., Rev. Geophys., 2, 275, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

In the auroral regions which lie between about 15° and 20° geomagnetic co-latitude and the corresponding latitudes in the southern hemisphere, precipitating high energy particles from the [[magnetosphere]] ionize the neutral gas, in particular at heights around 110 to 120&amp;nbsp;km, and increase the electric conductivity substantially. During magnetospheric disturbed conditions, this conductivity enhancement becomes much larger, and the auroral regions move equatorward.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt;

At heights above about 200&amp;nbsp;km, collisions between neutrals and plasma become rare so that both ions and electrons can only gyrate about the geomagnetic lines of force, or drift orthogonal to '''E''' and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. The parallel conductivity is so large that the geomagnetic lines of force become electric potential lines, and only electric fields orthogonal to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; can exist (see [[magnetosphere]]).

==Atmospheric Tides==
'''Atmospheric tides''' are global-scale waves excited by regular solar differential heating (thermal tides)or by the gravitational [[tidal force]] of the moon (gravitational tides). The atmosphere behaves like a huge waveguide closed at the bottom (the Earth's surface) and open to space at the top. In such a waveguide an infinite number of atmospheric wave modes can be excited. Because the waveguide is imperfect, however, only  modes of lowest degree with large horizontal and vertical scales can develop sufficiently well so that they can be filtered out from the meteorological noise. They are solutions of the [[Laplace]] equation &lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, M.S., "The eigenfunctions of Laplace's tidal equations over a sphere", Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.", London, A262, p. 511, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and are called Hough functions. These can be approximated by a sum of [[spherical harmonics]].

Two kinds of wave modes exit: class 1 waves (sometimes called gravity waves), and class 2 waves (rotational waves). Class 2 waves owe their existence to the [[Coriolis effect]] and can only exist for periods larger than 12 hours. Tidal waves can be either internal (travelling waves ) with positive eigenvalues (or equivalent depth)  which have finite vertical wavelengths and can transport wave energy upward, or external (evanescent waves) with negative eigenvalues and infinitely large vertical wavelengths meaning that their phases remain constant with altitude. These external wave modes cannot transport wave energy, and their  amplitudes decrease exponentially with height outside their source regions. Each mode is characterized by four numbers: the zonal wave number n, positive for class 1 waves and negative for class 2 waves (their meridional structures becoming increasingly complex with increasing number n), a meridional wave number m, the eigenvalue, and the period, in our case one solar or [[lunar day]], respectively. The modes are labeled as (m, n). Even numbers of n correspond to waves symmetric with respect to the equator, and odd numbers corresponding to antisymmetric waves.

At thermospheric heighs, [[dissipation]] of atmospheric waves becomes significant so that at above about 150&amp;nbsp;km altitude, all wave modes gradually become external waves, and the [[Hough function]]s degenerate to [[spherical harmonics]]s; e.g., mode (1, -2) develops to the spherical harmonic P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), mode (2, 2) becomes P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), with θ the co-latitude, etc.&lt;ref name=VollandAT&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migrating Solar  Tides===
The fundamental solar diurnal tidal mode which optimally matches the solar heat input configuration and thus is most strongly excited is the (1,&amp;nbsp;-2) - mode. It depends on local time and travels westward with the Sun. It is an external mode of class 2. Its maximum pressure amplitude on the ground is about 60 hPa.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen &gt;Chapman, S., and R.S. Lindzen, "Atmospheric Tides", Kluwer Dordrecht, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[thermosphere]], however, it becomes the predominant mode reaching temperature amplitudes at the [[exosphere]] of at least 140 K  and horizontal winds of the order of  100&amp;nbsp;m/s and more increasing with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, H. and J.W. King, J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 29,1045, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The largest solar semidiurnal wave is mode (2,&amp;nbsp;2) with maximum pressure amplitudes near the ground of 120&amp;nbsp; hPa. It is an internal class 1 wave. Its amplitude increases with altitude. Although its solar excitation is half of that of mode (1,&amp;nbsp;-2), its amplitude on the ground is larger by a factor of two. This indicates the effect of  suppression of external waves, in this case by a factor of four
.&lt;ref name=VollandAT/&gt;

===Semidiurnal Lunar Tides===
The dominant migrating lunar tide is the (2, 2) mode depending on lunar [[Time zone|local time]]. Its maximum pressure amplitude near the ground is 6 Pa, which is far below the meteorological noise. Therefore, it is not simple to detect such small signal.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen /&gt; Because it is an internal waves, its amplitude increases with altitude reaching values at 100&amp;nbsp;km height two orders of magnitude larger than on the ground.

==Electric Currents==

===Sq-Current===

====Morphology====
More than 100 geomagnetic observatories around the world measure regularly the variations of the [[earth's magnetic field]]. The daily variations during selected days of quiet geomagnetic activity are used to determine a monthly mean. From the horizontal component ΔH of such data, one can derive a corresponding overhead equivalent electric sheet current system at dynamo layer heights of strength

J = 2 ΔH/μ = 1.6 ΔH

with J (in milliAmpere/meter) the electric overhead sheet current, ΔH (in nanoTesla) the observed horizontal component of the geomagnetic variation, and μ the electric permeability of free space.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels /&gt; One can determine the direction of the magnetic field with regard to the current by the simple rule of thumb: if the thumb of the right hand points into the direction of the current, the curved fingers give the direction of the associated magnetic field.

One has to take into account that this relationship is not unique. In general, electric currents within [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] are three-dimensional, and an infinite number of current configurations fits to the geomagnetic variations observed on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima, N., Radio Sci., 6, 269, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic measurement in space are necessary to obtain a realistic picture.

[[File:Sqcurrent.jpg|thumb|400px|Figure 1. Streamlines of equivalent ionospheric Sq current during equinox (1957 - 1969) at 12 UT separated into primary (a) and secondary (b) part. Between two streamlines flow 20 kA &lt;ref&gt;Malin, S.R.C., Phil Trans. R. Soc., London, Ser. A 274, 551,1973&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;]].
Figure 1a shows current streamlines of an equivalent Sq current as seen from the sun at noon. This current configuration is fixed to the sun, while the earth rotates beneath it. A total current of about 140 kA flows within one daytime vortex. The rotating Sq current and the electrically conducting earth interior behave like  a huge  transformer with the dynamo region as the primary winding and the earth as the secondary winding. Since the Sq current varies with the basic period of one day, electric currents are induced within the earth's interior. The magnetic field of this secondary current is superimposed on the magnetic field of the primary Sq current. Methods to separate  both components go back to [[Gauss]]. The amplitude of the secondary current is about 1/3 of that of the  primary current and slightly shifted in  phase. Figure 1b shows that secondary component. The ratio between sheet current and magnetic component given above has now simply the value one.

The Sq current depends on season. The summer [[vortex]] is intensified compared with the winter vortex and reaches into the winter hemisphere. A longitudinal dependence of the Sq current exists which is related to  the inclined dipole component of the internal magnetic field, but probably also to nonmigrating tidal waves from below.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., at all., J. Geophys. Res., Space Physics, 113, 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 11-year [[solar cycle]], the amplitude of Sq increases by a factor of more than two from sunspot minimum to sunspot maximum. Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric [[E-layer]] diminishes much more strongly than that of the [[F-layer]]. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Matsushita, S., and W.H. Campell, W.H. (eds.), "Physics of Geomagnetic Phenomena", Vol. I and II, Academic Press, New York,1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The main driver of the Sq current is the external (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height,&lt;ref&gt;Kato, S., J. Geophys. Res., 71, 3211, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., J. Geophys.Res. 87, 5222, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by  180°. This appears to be the result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity  
.&lt;ref name=VollandAE&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; 
The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity.  
 
Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150&amp;nbsp;km from the equator
.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; Such enhancement of the Sq current  by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. 
During a [[solar flare]], bursts of [[solar radiation]] from the environment of an active  sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase  occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.DF., and S.V. Venkatesmaran, J. Geophys. Res., 81, 139,1971&lt;/ref&gt; During  a [[solar eclipse]], the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C.U., J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 25,529,1963&lt;/ref&gt; It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity.
 
In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi 
anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanc, M., and A.D. Richmond, J. Geophys. Res., 85, 1669, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaka, K,.Z., et all., Ann. Geophys., 27, 3523, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This current system is called Ddyn.

====Theory====
[[File:Sqblockdiagram.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2. Blockdiagram illustrating coupling between the horizontal wind '''U''' and pressure p via the Ampere force '''j'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Here '''j''' is the electric current density, '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; the geomagnetic field, h the equivalent depth, σ the electric conductivity, and '''E''' the electric polarization field. In a self-consistent treatment of the coupled system, gate B must be closed. In conventional dynamo theories, gate B is open.]]
In order to determine quantitatively the dynamo action of the neutral wind '''U''', one starts with the horizontal momentum equation of the wind together with  an equation for the divergence of the wind. The momentum equation balances the inertial force, the Coriolis force, and the horizontal gradient of pressure p.&amp;nbsp;In addition, the Ampere force '''J'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; couples the electric  current density '''j''' to the wind and pressure system. The equivalent depth h (the eigenvalue of the tidal mode) determines the divergence of the wind. The electric current must obey [[Ohm]]'s law. An electric polarization field  '''E''' is generated by charge separation to enforce the condition of no sources and sinks of the current. Feedback between wind and electric current occurs via the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''. Usually, the  electric conductivity tensor '''σ''' is considered as a given data set, and a height integrated conductivity tensor '''Σ'''  and a height integrated sheet current  '''J''' are applied.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.D., Geomagn. and Geoelectr. 31, 287,1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In conventional models, the Ampere force is neglected. This means that gate B in Figure 2 is open. This is called a kinematic dynamo. Models with closed gate B are called  hydromagnetic dynamos. The influence of the mutual coupling between wind and current can immediately be seen if one considers an infinitely large electric conductivity σ. In the kinematic model, the electric current would become infinitely large, while the wind amplitude remains constant. In the hydromagnetic model, the current reaches an upper limit, similar to a technical dynamo during short circuit, while the wind amplitude breaks down to a fraction of its original value. Charge separation acts like a self-impedance preventing the current to become infinitely large.&lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;

===L-Current===
Lunar (L) currents are weaker by a factor of about 20 than the Sq currents. The dominant wind component to drive these currents is the (2, 2) tidal mode. The L current is similar in shape as the Sq current, with the difference that four vortices instead of two exit. In each vortex a total current of about 4 kA flows. The seasonal variation of L is similar to that of Sq. During sunlit hours, L is strongly enhanced, while it approaches zero during the night. Thus, the L current exhibits, in addition, a  modulation depending on the lunar phase.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; The geomagnetic effect of the L-current can best been seen near the dip equator where the [[Cowling]] conductivity strongly enhances that current.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt;

===DP1-Current===
Interaction between [[solar wind]] plasma and the polar [[geomagnetic field]] produces a global-scale [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] directed from dawn to dusk  with a potential difference of  about 15 kV during quiet magnetospheric conditions, increasing substantially during disturbed conditions. Charge separation takes place at the [[magnetopause]]. This area is connected with the ionospheric dynamo region via the first open geomagnetic field lines with one footpoint within the auroral regions. Thus, electric discharging currents can flow via field-aligned currents as two small bands within the auroral zone dynamo layer, on the daytime as well as on the nighttime hemisphere. These currents are called DP1 current or auroral electrojets. Their magnitudes  are of the order of Mega Amperes.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt; Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating of these currents is comparable with that due to the solar XUV heat input within middle and lower latitudes during quiet conditions and much larger during disturbed conditions. Therefore, it dominates ionospheric and thermospheric dynamics and causes [[ionospheric]] and thermospheric storms &lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G.W., in  Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. II, p.195, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G. W., Surv. Geophys. 32, 101, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===DP2-Current===
The [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] drives a two cell current within the polar cup  with their vortices situated on the morning and on the evening side. It is called DP2 current. That current exists already during quiet conditions  (S&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;) and becomes enhances during disturbed conditions. It is mainly composed of electric  Hall currents.&lt;ref name= ChapmanBartels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishida, A., and S. Kokubun, Rev. Geophys. Space Sci., 9, 417,1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar-Ring Current===
If the azimuthal  component of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]]  (IMF) is directed toward dusk, the magnetospheric plasma is slowed down in the northern polar cap and accelerated in the southern polar cap. If the azimuthal component of the IMF is directed toward dawn, the situation is reversed. This devitation from co-rotation disappears at lower latitudes. The magnetic effect on the ground within the polar regions corresponds to an ionospheric Hall current at about 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; polar distance encircling the magnetic poles in a clockwise direction as seen by an observer standing on the ground during interplanetatry sectors with fields pointing away from the sun, and in a counterclockwise direction during toward-sector polarity &lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;

'''Joachim Ernst Adolphe Felix Wach''' ({{IPA-de|vaχ|lang}}; January 25, 1898&amp;nbsp;– August 27, 1955) was a [[Germany|German]] religious scholar from [[Chemnitz]], who emphasised a distinction between the history of [[religion]] (Religionswissenschaft) and the philosophy of religion.

Wach was descended on both sides from the famous [[Mendelssohn family]], both the philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn|Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. He shared the latter's love of music and was said to have inherited some important papers and relics of his ancestor. After schooling in Dresden, he enlisted in the German army in 1916, where he served as a cavalry officer. After World War I, he studied at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Freiburg, and Leipzig, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1922. He taught at Leipzig University. His ''Habilitationsschrift'', entitled ''Religionswissenschaft'', is widely considered a landmark document in the field of the History of Religions.

Though Wach's family had long since converted from Judaism to Christianity, he was nonetheless driven out of his teaching post by the Nazis in the early 1930s. He was able to emigrate to the United States, where he took up a post at Brown University, first as Visiting Professor of Biblical Literature (1935–1939) and then as Associate Professor (1939–1946). Raised as a Lutheran, he became an Episcopalian shortly after coming to the United States. He was granted United States citizenship in 1946.

Wach taught at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] from 1945 to 1955, becoming the chair of the History of Religions area, which had just been moved to the Divinity School from its earlier home in the Division of the Humanities. In his lectures and his writings, he emphasized a comprehensive study of religion, focusing on a) religious experience, b) religious praxis, and c) religious communities.

According to the University of Chicago Archives, Wach used the methods of the social sciences to better understand religious thought. Developing the field known as the Sociology of Religion, he maintained that the founder of a new religion experienced a revelation illuminating the way the world worked. He then began to acquire disciples who became a closely knit circle directed towards the founder with whom they each had intimate contact. The solidarity of this relationship bound the disciples together and differentiated them from other forms of social organization. Membership in the group required a break with past life and its everyday pursuits in order to focus on the new knowledge to the extent that ties of family and kinship would be relaxed or severed.

Wach died unexpectedly of a heart attack (though he had had a history of heart trouble) on August 27, 1955, in Locarno, Switzerland.

A [[fatwa]] ({{lang-ar|فتوى}}), is a legal pronouncement in [[Islam]], issued by a religious law specialist on a specific issue. 
{{Dynamic list}}

== Fatwa against [[Man sa yarbah al malyoon]] ==

In 2001, Egypt's [[Grand Mufti]] issued a fatwa stating that the show "من سيربح المليون؟" (''Man sa yarbah al malyoon?''&amp;nbsp;– literally "Who will Win the Million?"), modelled on the British show [[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]], was un-Islamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1457145.stm|title='Millionaire' fatwa rejected|date=2001-07-26|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2010-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031106063935/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1457145.stm#|archive-date=2003-11-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheikh of Cairo's [[Al-Azhar University]] later rejected the fatwa, finding that there was no objection to such shows since they spread general knowledge.

==Fatwa regarding theology==
* [[al-Azhar Shia Fatwa]] on July 6, 1959:
:''"The [[Jafari]] [[fiqh]] of the [[Shi'a]] is a school of thought that is religiously correct to follow in worship as are other [[Sunni]] schools of thought."

Many other fatwas have been [[Sunni fatwas on Shias|made by Sunnis]] regarding the Shia.

==The Fatwa against production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons==
{{main|Khamenei's fatwa against nuclear weapons}}
It refers to the [[fatwa]] against the acquisition, development and use of [[nuclear weapons]] by [[supreme leader]] of [[Iran]], [[Ali Khamenei]].&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{cite web|last=L Afrasiabi|first=Kaveh|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HC17Ak02.html|title=An Iran option the US prefers to ignore|date=17 March 2006|work=[[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the fatwa originally dates back to mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="forein policy" /&gt; the first public issue of it is reported to be that of October 2003, which was followed by an official statement at a meeting of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in [[Vienna]], two years later on August 2005.

The fatwa have received criticisms regarding the existence, applicability and  constancy of it.&lt;ref name="Kessler-7-4-15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker Did Iran’s supreme leader issue a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/27/did-irans-supreme-leader-issue-a-fatwa-against-the-development-of-nuclear-weapons/|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=November 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403161326/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/27/did-irans-supreme-leader-issue-a-fatwa-against-the-development-of-nuclear-weapons/#|archive-date=2015-04-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalaji"&gt;{{citation|last=Eisenstadt|first=Michael|last2=Khalaji|first2=Mehdi|5=|url=https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus115.pdf|title=Nuclear Fatwa; Religion and Politics in Iran’s Proliferation Strategy|publisher=[[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]|date=September 2011|access-date=2015-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428003851/http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus115.pdf#|archive-date=2015-04-28|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Khalaji, Khamenei may alter his fatwa under critical circumstances, in a similar manner as [[Khomeini]] did.&lt;ref name="Khalaji"/&gt; While, according to [[Gareth Porter]] in [[Foreign Policy]], Iran has sincerely banned the atomic bombs considering the "historical episode during its eight-year [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iraq]]", when Iran never sought revenge for Iraqis chemical attacks killing 20,000 Iranians and severely injuring 100,000 more.&lt;ref name="forein policy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Gareth|authorlink=Gareth Porter|title=When the Ayatollah Said No to Nukes|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/16/when-the-ayatollah-said-no-to-nukes/|accessdate=21 August 2015|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=16 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921001025/https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/16/when-the-ayatollah-said-no-to-nukes/#|archive-date=2017-09-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the fatwa is considered consistent with Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name="Khalaji"/&gt;

==Fatwa against illegal hunting and wildlife trade==
In March 2014 the [[Indonesian Council of Ulama]] (Indonesia's highest Islamic clerical body) issued a fatwa against illegal hunting and wildlife trafficking. The fatwa instructed Muslims to protect [[endangered species]] by conserving their habitat and stopping illegal trade. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] described the fatwa as a positive step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26452346|title=Muslim clerics ban illegal hunting and wildlife trade|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2014-03-05|access-date=2018-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806044120/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26452346#|archive-date=2017-08-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatwas against terrorism, Al-Qaeda and ISIS==
[[Islam in Spain|Spanish Muslims]] proclaimed a fatwa against [[Osama Bin Laden]] in March 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturekitchen.com/archives/002868.html |title=Text of the Fatwa Declared Against Osama Bin Laden by the Islamic Commission of Spain |accessdate=2006-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727013942/http://www.culturekitchen.com/archives/002868.html |archivedate=2005-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; issued by Mansur Escudero Bedate, Secretary General of the [[Islamic Commission of Spain]]. The ruling says that [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]] and "his" [[al-Qaeda]] had [[apostacy|abandoned their religion]] and should thus be called "al-Qaeda terrorists" without using the [[adjective]] "Islamic". The fatwa urges other Muslims to make similar proclamations. They were followed in July 2005 by the [[Fiqh Council of North America]], a ruling council that issued a fatwa against providing support to "terrorist" groups that make up their own rules by unjustifiably referring to Islam (see [[Istihlal]]).

===Fatwa on terrorism===
The [[Fatwa on Terrorism]] is a 600-page Islamic decree against terrorism and suicide bombings released in March 2010. This fatwa is a direct refutation of the ideology of [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]]. It is one of the most extensive rulings, an "absolute" condemnation of terrorism without "any excuses or pretexts" which goes further than ever and declares [[terrorism]] as [[kufr]] under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Jerome |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html |title=Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists |publisher=The Independent |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912181128/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html# |archive-date=2011-09-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced in [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/03/30/tor-ul-qadri-gta.html |title=Influential Pakistani cleric based in GTA |publisher=CBC News |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402102656/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/03/30/tor-ul-qadri-gta.html# |archive-date=2010-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by an influential Muslim scholar Dr [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]] and was launched in [[London]] on March 2, 2010. Dr Qadri said during the launch "Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses or ifs or buts." According to [[CNN]], experts see the fatwa as a significant blow to terrorist recruiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khalid |first=Kiran |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/terror.fatwa.analysis/index.html |title=Some experts see fatwa as significant blow to terrorist recruiting |publisher=CNN |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108010752/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/terror.fatwa.analysis/index.html# |archive-date=2012-11-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2013 in [[Lahore]], 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings declaring them as Haram or forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1022298 |title=Fatwa issued against suicide bombings, targeted killings and terrorism |date=2 July 2013 |location=Lahore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have also declared that terrorism is not Islamic by issuing fatwas against terrorism and fifteen lakh muslims support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html|title=Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202021756/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html#|archive-date=2015-02-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70000-clerics-issue-fatwa-against-terrorism-15-lakh-Muslims-support-it/articleshow/50100656.cms|title=70,000 clerics issue fatwa against terrorism, 15 lakh Muslims support it|work=The Times of India|accessdate=5 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105231801/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70000-clerics-issue-fatwa-against-terrorism-15-lakh-Muslims-support-it/articleshow/50100656.cms#|archive-date=2018-11-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwa on ISIS membership===
On March 11, 2015, [[Syed Soharwardy]], the founder of the [[Islamic Supreme Council of Canada]], and 37 other Muslim leaders of various Islamic sects from across Canada gathered in [[Calgary]] and issued a fatwa condemning followers of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State (ISIS)]] as non-Muslims. Soharwardy cited capturing opponents and beheading them, killing Muslims who disagree with ISIS's actions, destroying mosques, burning enemy soldiers alive and encouraging Muslim girls to join ISIS, among others, as acts by ISIS that violate Islamic law. Under this fatwa, anybody who even wishes to join the group will be "excommunicated from the Muslim community" and no longer considered Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canadian-imams-issue-fatwa-isil-supporters-calling-them-183339522.html# |title=Canadian Press story about Calgary fatwa |access-date=2015-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143620/https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canadian-imams-issue-fatwa-isil-supporters-calling-them-183339522.html# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/resources/historic-islamic-edict-fatwa-on-joining-isis-isil/# |title=ISCC's announcement of fatwa against ISIS |access-date=2015-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312160925/http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/resources/historic-islamic-edict-fatwa-on-joining-isis-isil/# |archive-date=2015-03-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatwas promoting violence against a particular individual==
Fatwas involving violence are more likely to be well known than other fatwas, especially to non-Muslims. One possible reason is that non-Muslims regard most fatwas as not affecting them, but fatwas involving violence can potentially affect them. Fatwas do not only affect non-Muslims. It is important to note that a Fatwa is meant to be issued by a legal scholar, not by any political entity. Generally, any given case may have many fatwas (legal opinions) written by the scholars of the region and time. The fatwa backed by the State is the one with legal power. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Muammar al-Gaddafi ===
{{main|Muammar al-Gaddafi}}

In 2011, an Egyptian Muslim cleric, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], issued a fatwa that urged soldiers to kill [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], the leader of Libya, if they were able to do so.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10707969"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10707969 |title='Shoot Gaddafi' fatwa issued |date=February 22, 2011 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=October 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024210536/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10707969# |archive-date=2012-10-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geert Wilders===
{{main|Geert Wilders}}

An Australian imam named [[Feiz Mohammad]] has issued a fatwa calling for the beheading of the Dutch politician [[Geert Wilders]], as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berkowitz|first=Ben|title=Muslim cleric calls for beheading of Dutch politician|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/03/us-dutch-wilders-idUSTRE68217920100903|accessdate=October 25, 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=September 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617152746/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-wilders-idUSTRE68217920100903#|archive-date=2017-06-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerry Falwell===
{{main|Jerry Falwell}}

In an interview given on September 30, 2002, for the October 6 edition of ''[[60 Minutes]]'', American [[Southern Baptist]] [[pastor]] and [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[Jerry Falwell]] said: "I think Muhammad was a terrorist. I read enough by both Muslims and non-Muslims, [to decide] that he was a violent man, a man of war."

The following Friday, [[Mohsen Mojtahed Shabestari]], an Iranian cleric, issued a fatwa calling for Falwell's death, saying Falwell was a "mercenary and must be killed." He added, "The death of that man is a religious duty, but his case should not be tied to the Christian community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2002/10/WeeklyReview2002-10-15#20030930004639-8368231218 Weekly Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009212052/http://harpers.org/archive/2002/10/WeeklyReview2002-10-15#20030930004639-8368231218#20030930004639-8368231218 |date=2011-10-09 }}, Harper's Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salman Rushdie===
{{main|Salman Rushdie}}
{{main|The Satanic Verses controversy}}

One of the first well-known fatwas was proclaimed in 1989 by the [[Iran]]ian [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], against [[Salman Rushdie]] over his novel ''[[The Satanic Verses (novel)|The Satanic Verses]]''. The reason was an allegedly blasphemous statement taken from an early biography of [[Muhammad]], regarding the incorporation of pagan [[goddess]]es into Islam’s strongly monotheistic structure. Khomeini died shortly after issuing the fatwa. In 1998 Iran stated it is no longer pursuing Rushdie’s death; however, that decree was again reversed in early 2005 by the present [[theocrat]], [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]].

In 1991, Rushdie's [[Japanese language|Japanese]] translator, [[Hitoshi Igarashi]], was stabbed to death in [[Tokyo]], and his [[Italian language|Italian]] translator was beaten and stabbed in [[Milan]]. In 1993, Rushdie's [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] publisher [[William Nygaard]] was shot and severely injured in an attack outside his house in [[Oslo]]. Thirty-seven guests died when their hotel in [[Sivas, Turkey]] was torched by locals protesting against [[Aziz Nesin]], Rushdie's [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translator.

In February 2016, in celebration of the anniversary of the fatwa against Rushdie, Iranian state-run median agencies added $300,000 to the estimated $3.3 Million bounty for the death of Rushdie.

===Taslima Nasreen===
{{main|Taslima Nasreen}}

Fundamentalists in [[Bangladesh]] proclaimed a fatwa against [[Taslima Nasreen]] in 1993, against a series of newspaper columns in which she was critical of the treatment of [[women in Islam|women under Islam]]. The next year she wrote ''[[Lajja]]'' (Shame) which described the abuse of women and minorities. Again there were calls for her death, and her passport was confiscated. Within the legal system, she felt that she might have faced a jail term of up to two years, where she was likely to be murdered. She managed to escape the country via [[Calcutta]], was granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in [[Sweden]], and then lived in [[Paris]], and finally went to India. Even in India, she had to flee the city of [[Kolkata]] and move to [[Delhi]] under the Indian government's strict orders following riots in Kolkata.

===Isioma Daniel===

[[Mamuda Aliyu Shinkafi]], the deputy governor of Zamfara state in [[Nigeria]], issued a fatwa in November 2002 calling for the death of journalist [[Isioma Daniel]] for comments suggesting that [[Muhammad]] may have chosen a wife from one of the [[Miss World]] contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,848553,00.html|title=

In an audio file published on the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] website Renesans.nu during September 2008, [[Mullah Krekar]] allegedly threatened to kill [[Mariwan Halabjaee]], the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Iraqi Kurdish]] author of ''Sex, Sharia and Women in the History of Islam'', who also resided in [[Norway]]. "I swear that we will not live if you live.

'''Mathematical methods''' are integral to the study of '''electronics'''.

==Mathematics in Electronics==
Electronics Engineering careers usually include courses in [[Calculus]] (single and [[Multivariable Calculus|multivariable]]), [[Complex analysis|Complex Analysis]], [[Differential Equations]] (both [[Ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[Partial differential equation|partial]]), [[Linear Algebra]] and [[Probability]]. [[Fourier Analysis]] and [[Z-transform|Z-Transforms]] are also subjects which are usually included in electrical engineering programs.

==Basic applications==
A number of electrical laws apply to all electrical networks.  These include
*[[Faraday's law of induction]]: Any change in the magnetic environment of a coil of wire will cause a voltage (emf) to be "induced" in the coil. 
*[[Gauss's law|Gauss's Law]]:  The total of the electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity.
*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law|Kirchhoff's current law]]: the sum of all currents entering a node is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node or the sum of total current at a junction is zero
*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's voltage law|Kirchhoff's voltage law]]: the directed sum of the electrical potential differences around a circuit must be zero.
*[[Ohm's law]]: the voltage across a resistor is the product of its resistance and the current flowing through it.at constant temperature.
*[[Norton's theorem]]: any two-terminal collection of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with a single resistor.
*[[Thevenin's theorem]]: any two-terminal combination of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to a single voltage source in series with a single resistor.
*[[Millman's Theorem|Millman's theorem]]: the voltage on the ends of branches in parallel is equal to the sum of the currents flowing in every branch divided by the total equivalent conductance.
* See also [[Analysis of resistive circuits]].

Circuit analysis is the study of methods to solve linear systems for an unknown variable.

*[[Circuit analysis]]

==Components==
There are many electronic components currently used and they all have their own uses and particular rules and methods for use.

*[[Electronic components]]

==Complex numbers==
If you apply a voltage across a capacitor, it 'charges up' by storing the electrical charge as an electrical field inside the device. This means that while the voltage across the capacitor remains initially small, a large current flows. Later, the current flow is smaller because the capacity is filled, and the voltage raises across the device.

A similar though opposite situation occurs in an inductor; the applied voltage remains high with low current as a magnetic field is generated, and later becomes small with high current when the magnetic field is at maximum.

The voltage and current of these two types of devices are therefore out of phase, they do not rise and fall together as simple resistor networks do. The mathematical model that matches this situation is that of complex numbers, using an imaginary component to describe the stored energy.

==Signal analysis==
* [[Fourier analysis]]. Deconstructing a [[Wave|periodic]] waveform into its constituent frequencies; see also: [[Fourier theorem]], [[Fourier transform]].
* [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]].
*[[Information theory]]. Sets fundamental limits on how information can be transmitted or processed by any system.

The '''Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command''' (COMNAVMETOCCOM) or '''CNMOC''', serves as the operational arm of the Naval Oceanography Program.  Headquartered at the [[Stennis Space Center]] in Mississippi, CNMOC is an echelon three command reporting to [[United States Fleet Forces Command]] (USFLTFORCOM).  CNMOC's claimancy is globally distributed, with assets located on larger ships (aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, and command and control ships), shore facilities at fleet concentration areas, and larger production centers in the U.S.

CNMOC is focused on providing critical environmental knowledge to the warfighting disciplines of Anti-Submarine Warfare; Naval Special Warfare; Mine Warfare; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; and Fleet Operations (Strike and Expeditionary), as well as to the support areas of Maritime Operations, Aviation Operations, Navigation, Precise Time, and Astrometry.
[[File:Oceanographer of the Navy - U.S. (seal).gif|thumb|Oceanographer of the Navy seal.]]
The Oceanographer of the Navy works closely with the staff of CNMOC to ensure the proper resources are available to meet its mission, to act as a liaison between CNMOC and the Chief of Naval Operations, and to represent the Naval Oceanography Program in interagency and international forums.

==Mission==
Responsible for command and management of the Naval Oceanography Program, utilizing meteorology and oceanography, GI&amp;S, and precise time and astrometry, to leverage the environment to enable successful strategic, tactical and operational battle space utilization across the continuum of campaigning and at all levels of war – strategic, operational and tactical.

==History==
The Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command traces its ancestry to the [[United States Naval Observatory|Depot of Charts and Instruments]], a 19th-century repository for nautical charts and navigational equipment. In the 1840s, its superintendent, Lieutenant [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], created and published a revolutionary series of ocean current and wind charts. This information, still resident in modern computer models of the [[ocean basin]]s and [[atmosphere]], laid the foundation for the sciences of [[oceanography]] and [[meteorology]].

Atmospheric science was further developed with the birth of [[naval aviation]] early in the twentieth century. During World War I and the following decades, naval aerological specialists applied the fledgling concepts of air masses and fronts to warfare, and provided forecasts to the first [[transatlantic flight]].

The Navy's weather and ocean programs contributed greatly to Allied victory in World War II. In the Pacific, Navy forecasters cracked the Japanese weather code. [[Hydrography|Hydrographic]] survey ships, often under enemy fire, collected data along foreign coastlines for the creation of critical navigation charts.

In the mid-1970s, the Navy's meteorology and oceanography programs were integrated in a single organization reflecting nature's close interaction of sea and air. This structure is today the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command.

==Organization==
Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command is a third echelon operational command reporting to Fleet Forces Command. The Command's personnel are located at its headquarters at the John C. Stennis Space Center near [[Bay St. Louis]], Mississippi, and at several field activities located around the world.

Effective October 1, 2014, the Command's major subordinate activities fourth echelon commands include the [[Naval Oceanographic Office]], located at Stennis Space Center Mississippi; [[Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center]], located in Monterey, California; the [[Naval Observatory]], located in Washington, D.C.; the Naval Oceanography Operations Command, located at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi; the Atlantic Fleet Weather Center, located in Norfolk, Virginia; The Pacific Fleet Weather Center, located in San Diego, California; and the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Professional Development Center located in Gulfport, Mississippi were all administratively realigned to Naval Information Dominance Forces, Suffolk, Va.  Operational control of Navy Oceanography forces remains aligned to Naval Meteorology and Oceangraphy Command.

Furthermore, effective October 1, 2014, the Command realigned its fifth echelon commands include The Naval Ice Center, located in Suitland, Maryland and aligned underneath the Atlantic Fleet Weather Center; The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]], located in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and aligned underneath The Pacific Fleet Weather Center; The [[Fleet Survey Team]], located in [[Stennis Space Center]], Mississippi and aligned underneath the Naval Oceanographic Office; and Naval Oceanography Anti-Submarine Warfare Center - Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, Naval Oceanography Anti-Submarine Warfare Center - Yokosuka, Japan, Naval Oceanography Mine Warfare Center - Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, and Naval Oceanography Special Warfare Center - San Diego, California who all align underneath The Naval Oceanography Operations Command.

The Command provides meteorological and oceanographic services to five of the Navy's warfighting disciplines:
*Anti-Submarine Warfare; 
*Special Warfare; 
*Mine Warfare; 
*Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance;
*and Fleet Operations (Strike and Expeditionary)

It also supports Navigation, Precise Time and Astrometry, Maritime Operations and Aviation Operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">'''On Line Opinion''', or Online Opinion, is an [[open access]] [[electronic journal]], specialising in social and political debate. The journal is published in Australia, although content is not necessarily limited to Australian issues, and extends at times to publication in wider areas, such as, religion, ethics, and philosophy.

== History ==

On Line Opinion was established in 1999 by political commentator Graham Young.&lt;ref name="Flew&amp;Young"&gt;Flew, T. and G. Young. 2004. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/393/ 'If they come they will build it: Managing and building e-democracy from the ground up']. ''Proceedings of the Australian Electronic Governance Conference''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, On Line Opinion has become recognized as one of the leading examples of [[alternative journalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Forde, S. 2011. ''[https://he.palgrave.com/page/detail/challenging-the-news-susan-forde/?sf1=barcode&amp;st1=9780230243569 Challenging the News: The Journalism of Alternative and Community Media]''. p9. 2011. Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Higher Education]]. {{ISBN|978-0230243569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[citizen journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. and J. Cokley. 2013. [http://ejournalist.com.au/v13n2/TaylorCokley.pdf 'How citizen journalism websites are working in Australia: news and discussion']. ''Ejournalist: a Refereed Media Journal''. Vol.13, No.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation by the Hon [[Raymond Antony Finkelstein]] QC stated that: "While the start-up costs for new print publications have been prohibitive and inhibited new enterprises emerging, the streamlining of the relationship between content producers and consumers has led to many new websites and web-based services. Among the most important such websites that have grown up in Australia over the last decade are ''[[Inside Story (Australian TV program)|Inside Story]]'', ''[[Australian Policy Online]]'', Online Opinion, ''[[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]'', ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'', and [[New Matilda]]."&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, R. March 2012. [http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1205_finkelstein.pdf Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Media and Media Regulation]. Retrieved 19/2/16.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is referenced by the [[Australian National Library]],&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Library Catalogue: See http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4395745.&lt;/ref&gt; with {{ISSN|1442-8458}}.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Public Affairs Information Service, [http://www.nla.gov.au/apais/jourandconf.html Electronic Journals and Conferences]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

On Line Opinion was founded as an experiment in [[participatory democracy]], through the means of [[participatory journalism]].&lt;ref name="Flew&amp;Young"/&gt; The contributors to On Line Opinion constitute a wide range of writers, such as what might be described as high-profile contributors, including politicians and academics, and what might be called ordinary citizens, that is, those with no particular public profile.&lt;ref&gt;See list of authors at: http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp&lt;/ref&gt; One of the motivations behind On Line Opinion was to address the limitations of [[academic publishing]], and thus On Line Opinion aims to publish accessible material, sometimes called [[grey literature]], on a more timely basis and with a wider audience, than would otherwise be the case. Research has suggested that, in comparative terms, publication within On Line Opinion is indeed more timely than is the case with other citizen journals, with on average five new articles per day appearing on the website.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. and J. Cokley. 2013. [http://ejournalist.com.au/v13n2/TaylorCokley.pdf 'How citizen journalism websites are working in Australia: news and discussion']. ''Ejournalist: a Refereed Media Journal''. Vol.13, No.2. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22895">'''Picture framing glass''' ("glazing," "conservation glass," "museum quality glass") usually refers to flat glass or acrylic ("plexi") used for framing artwork and for presenting art objects in a display box (also, "conservation framing").

==Purpose==
The primary purpose of glazing in art framing is to physically protect the work of art from damaging factors such as [[humidity]], [[heat]], and soiling. [[Laminated glass]] and some [[Acrylic glass|acrylic]] may be used to protect against physical damage from glass breakage and to offer protection from a malicious attack. Regular glass as well as some glass surface treatments can also filter some of the damaging [[ultra-violet radiation]] (UV) and heat (NIR). Artworks that require protective glazing are those rendered on paper or fabrics (including photographs), which contain pigments and dyes that absorb UV and are susceptible to discoloration.&lt;ref&gt;http://painting.about.com/od/oilpaintingfaq/f/oil_frame_glass.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the case if the framed object or artwork is UV resistant, UV protection can still serve the purpose of preserving the integrity and colors of non-conservation grade framing materials susceptible to UV damage, such as mat board (passe partout).

Although protection is a primary purpose of glazing, ''displaying'' an artwork is the primary purpose of framing it. Therefore, the least visible glazing best displays the artwork behind it. [[Visible light]] transmission is the primary measure of glass' ''invisibility'', since the viewer actually sees the light, reflected from the artwork. Light transmission of glass is especially important in art framing, since light passes through the glass twice – once to illuminate the artwork, and then again, reflected from the artwork, as colors - before reaching the viewer.

[[Transmittance|Light transmission]] (for this article, the perceivable [[visible spectrum]] between 390&amp;nbsp;nm and 750&amp;nbsp;nm is considered) through glass is diminished either by [[light reflection]] or [[light absorption]] of the glazing material. The total light transferred through the glazing material (light transmission) is reduced by reflection and/or absorption. In art framing, [[light reflection]] causes [[glare (vision)|glare]], while [[light absorption]] also may cause the transmitted colors to be dulled or distorted. While type of the glass substrate will affect the [[light absorption]] of the glazing, the surface treatment can affect [[light scattering]], [[light reflection]] and in some cases, [[light absorption]]. There are various glazing options to achieve this goal as explained in the following sections on Types of Picture Framing Glass.

==Types of Picture Framing Glass==

=== Regular (or "Clear") ===

Due to widespread availability and low cost, [[Soda-lime glass|Soda Lime Glass]] is most commonly used for picture framing glass. Glass thicknesses typically range from thin 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm, to 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm. Clear glass has [[Transmittance|light transmission]] of ~ 90%, absorption of ~ 2%, and reflection of ~ 8%. Whereas absorption can be reduced by using low-iron glass, reflection can only be reduced by an anti-reflective surface treatment.

===Low-iron (or "Extra-Clear," "Water White," etc)===
Low-iron, or water white glass, is made using special iron free silica, and is generally only available in 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm thicknesses for picture framing applications. Because low iron glass light absorption can be as low as 0.5% vs. ~ 2% for [[Float glass|clear glass]], the light transmission will be significantly better vs. clear glass. Low iron glass has light transmission of ~91.5% and reflection of 8%.

===Laminated Glass===
[[Laminated glass]] offers shatter-resistance and protection from malicious breakage to art glazing. The most commonly used configuration is Glass + PVB Foil + Glass. Some variations of foils and glass thicknesses can offer shatter- and breakage-resistance or even [[Bullet-resistant glass|bullet-resistance]]. The absorption of laminated glass depends on the glass substrates and foils used in the laminating process. Reflection of laminated glass is similar to monolithic glass, unless surface treatments are applied to reduce reflection.

===Acrylic===
Some types of [[acrylic glass]] can have the high light transmission and optical quality of glass. Acrylic is also light weight, compared to glass, and is shatter-resistant, making acrylic an attractive choice for framing large, oversized works of art. In general, acrylic sheet scratches easily and retains a static charge, which can be problematic when framing pastels or charcoals. Some manufacturers, add [[dyes]] to [[acrylic glass]] to filter the UV light transmittance, and its surface can also be treated with both [[anti-static]] and [[anti-reflective coating]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tru-vue.com/files/Fact_specificationsheet_Updated1209(2).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glass Surface Treatments and Coatings==
Due to the change in the [[refractive index]], as a light beam travels from air ([[refractive index]] of ~1) into glass or acrylic ([[refractive index]] of ~1.5) and then back into air, these transitions cause part of the light to be reflected. While "anti-glare" (a.k.a. "non-glare" or matte finish) glass treatments focus on scattering the light, "anti-reflective" coatings actually reduce the amount of light, which is reflected from each glazing surface, which has the benefit of increasing the amount of light transmitted through the glazing.

===Matte (Etched, "Non-Glare," or "Anti-Glare")===
The main purpose of [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] glass is to transform the [[specular reflection]] into [[Visual appearance|reflection haze]]. So-called "[[scattering]]" of the reflected light renders reflected images blurry, so that distinct reflected shapes and sources of light do not distract from the art viewing experience. Scattering the light does not reduce the [[Specular reflection|reflection]] or [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], which remain at the level of the glass substrate. There are several ways of making the glass surface matte – from pressing the pattern when the glass is still soft to fine etching of the glass surface by acid. The quality of matte glass is usually determined by its gloss factor or haze factor.

===Anti-Reflective Coatings===

Single-layer anti-reflective coatings aim to achieve the refractive index of 1.25 (halfway between air and glass), and can be made either by single-layer micro-porous structures achieved by etching,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arestipower.gr/xmsAssets/File/PV/Solara/Sunarc_Expertise__English_14112006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; hybrid materials&lt;ref name="dsm.com"&gt;http://www.dsm.com/en_US/downloads/dfuco/DSM_AR_coating_technology_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and other processes suitable for producing large-area coatings for art framing purposes. Single layer coatings have been used as a lower-cost alternative to multi-layer anti-reflective coatings. Single-layer anti-reflective coatings can reduce [[light reflection]] to as low as 1.5%.&lt;ref name="dsm.com"/&gt;

====Multi-Layer====

The lowest reflection can be achieved with multi-layer anti-reflective coatings, which can be applied by either [[magnetron sputtering]], [[evaporation]] or [[sol-gel]] process (or other processes, which can control the uniformity of deposition on nanometer-scale), and can reduce the light reflection to lower than 0.25% per side (0.5% total).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hy-tech-glass.ch/en/products/anti-reflective-glass.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Features of Anti-Reflective Coatings====

* '''Light Reflection''' - the main goal of [[anti-reflective]] coatings is to reduce the light [[Specular reflection|reflection]] that causes the so-called [[glare (vision)|glare]]. Therefore, the lower the light [[Specular reflection|reflection]], the less [[glare (vision)|glare]] reaches the viewer. The best anti-reflective products available for the picture framing market have [[light reflection]] of 0.5%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flabeg.com/files/glas/downloads/PDFs/ENG/FLABEG_ARTControl_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hy-tech-glass.ch/en/products/anti-reflective-glass/luxar-classic/product-information-luxar-classic.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.groglass.com/images/pdfs/artglass_us_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tru-vue.com/Tru-Vue/Products/33/&lt;/ref&gt; The seemingly small differences in light reflection are actually very important due to the logarithmic response of human eyes to signal intensity ([[Weber's law]]). In other words, under normal lighting conditions, the human eye perception of the intensity of a reflected light source in a 1% reflecting glass surface will be perceived as more than twice of the same light source in 0.5% reflecting glass.
* '''Light Absorption''' - light [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of glazing is the light that is neither transmitted nor reflected by the glazing. Since light is not necessarily absorbed uniformly, some wavelengths may be transmitted more than others, causing the transmitted color to be distorted. A good way to detect light absorption of glazing is so-called ''white paper test''. This test, used to detect the ''transmission color'' of glazing, involves placing a piece of glazing on white paper, and comparing the paper's color with and without the glass. A slight greenish tint will indicate the presence of iron oxide in the raw materials used to produce clear float glass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stegbar.com.au/pdf/data_sheets/Stegbar%20Data%20Sheet%20-%20Clear%20Float%20and%20Low%20Iron%20Glass.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additional transmitted colors may result from the absorption of any applied coatings.
* '''Light Transmission''' - the lower the light reflection and light absorption, the higher the light transmission, and therefore, the visibility of the objects displayed behind the glazing.
* '''Reflected Color''' - Uncoated glass reflects light uniformly and does not cause [[reflected light]] to be distorted (a white light source reflected in a non-coated glass pane will still appear white). However, [[anti-reflective coating]]s typically cause some wavelengths of light to be reflected more than others, causing a ''shift'' in the [[Reflection (physics)|reflected color]]. This way, a white light source reflected in an anti-reflected glass surface may appear green or blue or red, depending on the wavelengths that are favored by a particular [[anti-reflective]] coating design.
* '''Intensity of Reflected Color''' - intensity of reflected color can be measured by its relative distance from the color neutral zone (i.e. white). Due to the variability of industrial processes, some producers design their anti-reflective coatings to have more intense colors so that the statistical deviation of outcomes falls within a specific color (green or blue, etc.). The tighter a manufacturer's control of its processes, the closer the design can be to the color neutral zone, without crossing over from a designated color.
* '''Reflected Color under an Angle''' - as a reflected light source is [[Specular reflection|reflected]] from the glazing under a shallow angle, some anti-reflective coatings may cause the reflected color to shift. Therefore, in picture framing, a stable color under a wide [[viewing angle]] is desirable.
* '''Cleaning''' - since anti-reflective coatings render the glass surface virtually invisible, the dirt or soiling of the surface is much more visible on an [[anti-reflective]] surface. This enhanced visibility of surface smudges results in an end-user difficulty to clean the AR-coated glass. Therefore, some anti-reflective coatings have special surface treatments to improve cleanability, while others give special cleaning instructions to avoid damage to its coating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tru-vue.com/Framers/FAQ/Glass/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Handling''' - Some coatings are more durable than others. A scratch through an anti-reflective coating is also much more visible than a scratch through the surface of an uncoated glass due to the difference in the reflectivity of the scratched surface (glass ~8%) and the reflectivity of the anti-reflective surface around the scratch (~0.5%). Therefore, anti-reflective coatings with more scratch-resistance are preferred in art glazing. Magnetron-sputtered and sol-gel anti-reflective coatings are typically metal oxides with superior hardness compared to other application methods.

====UV Filtering Coatings====

In order to reduce the amount of damaging light radiation transmitted through glazing, some glass coatings are designed to either ''reflect'' or ''absorb'' the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. The following technologies are used to reduce the amount of UV from reaching the artwork:

* '''Organic UV Absorbers''' are added to an inert, inorganic silica-based coating to yield a UV ''absorbing'' layer on one side of the glass. Organic UV absorbers are capable of blocking almost 100% of UV radiation between 300&amp;nbsp;nm to 380&amp;nbsp;nm, but in an industrial environment it is difficult to make a sharp UV cut-off without affecting the visible spectrum, therefore UV absorbers tend to also increase the absorption of the visible light. Chemically-deposited UV absorbers also result in a less scratch resistant surface than magnetron-sputtered or Sol-gel UV blocking layers, as evidenced by the manufacturer's recommendation for avoiding environmental and other contact with the UV-coated side.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tru-vue.com/Framers/FAQ/Glass&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interference UV Blockers''' are usually built into anti-reflective interference thin film stacks, and focus on maximizing the UV ''reflection'' below the visible light boundary. Industrially-available sol-gel processes offer up to 84% UV block,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.us.schott.com/special_applications/english/products/non_reflective_glass/mirogard/products.html&lt;/ref&gt; while magnetron-sputtered AR/UV-Blocking layers can block up to ~92%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flabeg.com/files/glas/downloads/PDFs/ENG/ARTControl_Perfectprotection_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.groglass.com/en/products/art-glass-for-framing&lt;/ref&gt; with no adverse effects on the transmission or absorption of visible light.
* '''UV Filtering of the Substrate''' is possible by adding UV filtering agents during the production of the substrate. While typical clear float glass blocks ~45% of UV radiation, the addition of CeOx to glass&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/44666.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to further reduce UV transmission as well as widespread use of organic UV blocking dyes in the production of acrylic substrates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acrylite.net/sites/dc/Downloadcenter/Evonik/Product/ACRYLITE/1213F%20Light%20Trans%20and%20Reflect.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most soda-lime glass completely absorbs short wavelength UV-B radiation below 300&amp;nbsp;nm. Low-iron glass typically blocks ~12% of UV radiation between 300 and 380&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;http://krystalinteriors.com/pdf/KrystalKlearBrochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==UV Protection in Art Glazing==

=== UV Definition in Art Framing ===

The most widely used definition of "[[UV Light]]" in the framing industry has been defined as non-weighted average transmittance between 300&amp;nbsp;nm and 380&amp;nbsp;nm, while the ISO-DIS-21348&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacewx.com/Docs/ISO_PRF_21348_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808145531/http://www.spacewx.com/Docs/ISO_PRF_21348_e.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; standard for determining irradiances defines various UV light ranges:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! Abbreviation !! [[Wavelength]] range in [[nanometer]]s !! Energy per photon
|-
| Ultraviolet A, long wave, or [[black light]] || UVA || 400&amp;nbsp;nm–315&amp;nbsp;nm || 3.10–3.94 eV
|-
| Near || NUV || 400&amp;nbsp;nm–300&amp;nbsp;nm || 3.10–4.13 eV
|-
| Ultraviolet B or medium wave || UVB || 315&amp;nbsp;nm–280&amp;nbsp;nm || 3.94–4.43 eV
|}

The definition of the upper limit of UV protection as 380&amp;nbsp;nm by the framing industry is not consistent with accepted standards above.

According to the Library of Congress Preservation department, the artwork damage does not stop at 380&amp;nbsp;nm though,&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/mat.html&lt;/ref&gt; and all radiation (UV, visible, IR) has the potential to damage art. Thus, calculating a simple average of all wavelengths between 300&amp;nbsp;nm and 380&amp;nbsp;nm does not account for the fact that different wavelengths have different artwork damage potential. At least two other methods exist, which provide a more holistic measurement of radiation damage, from both the UV and visible portions of the spectrum:

* Krochmann Damage Function (KDF) is used to rate a glazing's ability to limit fading potential. It expresses the percentage of both UV and of that portion of the visible spectrum from 300&amp;nbsp;nm to 600&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cardinalcorp.com/data/tsb/ig/IG11_05-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that passes through the window and weights each wavelength in relation to the potential damage it can cause to typical materials. Lower numbers are better.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sage-ec.com/pages/glossary.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* ISO-CIE Damage-Weighted Transmission (ISO) uses a weighting function recommended by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). Its spectral range is also weighted and extends from 300&amp;nbsp;nm to 700&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfrc.org/documents/NFRC_300-2004-E0A1_000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For picture framing purposes, it is not appropriate to use these methods for ''absolute'' ratings, since "Better" ratings are obtained with lower visible light transmission, which is not aesthetically desirable in a framing glazing. However, by including more art damaging factors than UV radiation between 300&amp;nbsp;nm and 380&amp;nbsp;nm, these methods provide a more holistic ''relative'' ranking tool. For example, comparing a 99% and 92% UV Blocking glazing, would translate to 44% and 41%, respectively, under the KDF.

===How much UV filtering should a glazing have===
The discussion on how much [[Ultraviolet|UV]] filtering is necessary in art framing is complex and controversial, driven by conflicting corporate interests. There have so far been no independent organizations, not tied to corporate sponsors, which have presented scientifically verifiable and conclusive evidence to the amount of UV filtering necessary for a glazing to both display and at the same time protect an artwork. On one hand, the issue is complicated by the varying amount of damaging light actually present in an indoor environment (from low level indirect sources to direct daylight). On the other, by the fact that not only [[Ultraviolet|UV]], but also [[visible light]] damages an artwork.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt; According to the National Fenestration Rating Council, only 40% of artwork fading is caused by UV radiation.&lt;ref name="nfrc.org"&gt;http://www.nfrc.org/documents/UVFactSheet2009February27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining damage comes from the visible light, heat, humidity and material chemistry.&lt;ref name="nfrc.org"/&gt; This means that increasing visible light transmission by an anti-reflective coating actually increases the amount of damaging radiation on an artwork.

One of the most thorough and independent studies was conducted by the US Library of Congress in an effort to display and preserve the US Declaration of Independence. At first, it was decided to use special yellow "Plexiglass UF3", which removes both the ultra-violet as well as the blue end of the visible spectrum, with significant, but acceptable interference for viewing.&lt;ref name="Kurt Nassau 1998, p. 349"&gt;Kurt Nassau, et at., "Color for Science, Art and Technology" 1998, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; Sealing the display by a chemically inert gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium also aided its preservation.&lt;ref name="Kurt Nassau 1998, p. 349"/&gt; In 2001, the display of the US Declaration of Independence was revised to include a multi-laminated glazing for shatter-resistance, with sol-gel interference-based multi-layer Anti-Reflective coatings on outer surfaces&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/charters.html#pressrelaese1&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the visibility of the document.

From the above evidence, it can be concluded that if preservation were the only goal of glazing, then only a climate-controlled, dark space would offer the best possible protection for an artwork, which can be exhibited once in every several years,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyhistory.org/web/default.php?section=whats_new&amp;page=detail_pr&amp;id=4871334&lt;/ref&gt; while no glass at all provides a perfect displaying option. Therefore, for those artworks, which are chosen to be displayed, the ideal amount of UV blocking should be ''as much as possible, without affecting the visible light transmission''.

===Controlling UV Lighting Inside===
While determining how much UV light should be filtered by art glazing, it may also be important to consider the amount of UV light present inside a room or a building. Note that regular window glazing filters away a significant portion of the UV light, which originates from the [[sun]].

The relative amounts of damaging light in equal quantities of light:&lt;ref name="Kurt Nassau 1998, p. 349"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Illumination !! Relative Damage
|-
| Horizontal skylight, open || 100%
|-
| Horizontal skylight, window glass || 34%
|}

The above indicates that the damage level of even direct sunlight coming from the horizontal skylight is reduced to 36% by regular window glass. Due to the sun's changing position, even less direct light enters through side windows and hanging an artwork away from direct sunlight reduces the exposure to potentially damaging direct sunlight even further.

Indoor lighting, especially fluorescent lighting, is considered to contain some UV Light. GELighting.com asserts that "UV exposure from sitting indoors under fluorescent lights at typical office light levels for an eight-hour workday is equivalent to just over one minute of exposure to the sun in Washington D.C. on a clear day in July.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gelighting.com/na/business_lighting/faqs/fluorescent.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the relative damage of incandescent light is 3 times less than that of fluorescent light.&lt;ref name="Kurt Nassau 1998, p. 349"/&gt; Since UV filtering picture framing glass does not protect against all damage factors, it is important to display framed artwork in a well controlled environment to reduce the effects of heat, humidity, and visible light.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/shtml_sub/consumerguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pomology''' (from [[latin language|latin]] ''pomum'' ([[fruit]]) + ''-logy'') is a branch of [[botany]] that studies and cultivates [[fruit]]. The denomination '''fruticulture'''—introduced from [[Romance language]]s (from [[Latin]] ''fructus'' and ''cultura'')—is also used.

Pomological research is mainly focused on the development, enhancement, cultivation and physiological studies of fruit trees. The goals of fruit tree improvement include enhancement of fruit quality, regulation of production periods, and reduction of production cost. One involved in the science of pomology is called a '''pomologist'''.

==History==
Pomology has been an important area of research for centuries.

===United States===
During the mid-19th century in the [[United States]], farmers were expanding fruit orchard programs in response to growing markets. At the same time, horticulturists from the [[USDA]] and agricultural colleges were bringing new varieties to the United States from foreign expeditions, and developing experimental lots for these fruits. In response to this increased interest and activity, USDA established the Division of Pomology in 1886 and named Henry E. Van Deman as chief pomologist. An important focus of the division was to publish illustrated accounts of new varieties and to disseminate research findings to fruit growers and breeders through special publications and annual reports. During this period   [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] and his brother [[Charles Downing (pomologist)|Charles]] were prominent in Pomology and [[Horticulture]], producing ''The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America'' (1845).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxADAAAAYAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8 |title=''The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America'' (1845) online |accessdate=|date=|publisher=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of new varieties required exact depiction of the fruit so that plant breeders could accurately document and disseminate their research results. Since the use of scientific photography was not widespread in the late 19th Century, USDA commissioned artists to create watercolor illustrations of newly introduced [[cultivar]]s. Many of the watercolors were used for [[Lithography|lithographic reproductions]] in USDA publications, such as the ''Report of the Pomologist'' and the ''Yearbook of Agriculture''.

Today, the collection of approximately 7,700 watercolors is preserved in the [[National Agricultural Library|National Agricultural Library's]] Special Collections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/speccoll/collectionsguide.shtml |title=Guide to the USDA Special Collections |accessdate= |last= |first= |date=  |publisher=[[National Agricultural Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it serves as a major historic and botanic resource to a variety of researchers, including [[horticulturists]], historians, artists, and publishers..

The study of pomology has somewhat dwindled over the past century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6546">'''Preservationist''' is generally understood to mean ''historic preservationist'': one who advocates to preserve architecturally or historically significant buildings, structures, objects, or sites from demolition or degradation. [[Historic preservation]] usually refers to the preservation of the built environment, not to the preservation of, for instance, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Preservationist'' is, however, sometimes used descriptively in other contexts, notably with regards to language and the environment.

==Other uses of the term==
Persons who work to preserve ancient or [[endangered language]]s are called [[Language preservation|language preservationists.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Language Preservation: UNESCO-CI |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060706085338/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Clarification: ''Ethnologue,'' a reference work published by [[SIL International]], has cataloged the world’s known living languages, and it estimates that 417 languages are on the verge of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ |accessdate=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservationist is also sometimes used in the natural [[environmentalist]] field, but while the natural environment [[conservation movement|conservationist]] movements preserve [[ecosystem]]s and the [[natural environment]], this movement is widely known as ''[[conservation ethic|conservation]]'' or ''[[environmentalism]]''. 

*Clarification: A key difference between the Preservationist and [[conservation movement|Conservationist]] [[environmentalist]] schools is this: Preservationists view the environment as having intrinsic value that should be preserved by making as little change to it as possible. Conservationists view the environment as having instrumental value that can be of help to people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; and generally accept [[Gifford Pinchot]]'s notion of [[sustainable yield]]: that man can harvest some forest or animal products from a natural environment on a regular basis without compromising the long-health of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;W.N. Sparhawk, "The History of Forestry in America" in Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture,1949. Washington,D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservationism has been defined by [[Richard Heinberg]] in his book ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World'' as distinguishing survivalist groups who wish merely to survive a collapse of civilization from preservationist communities who wish to preserve as much of human culture as is possible in the event of collapse. 

*Clarification: The idea of preservationist communities is part of a broader strategy in which individuals achieve independence from the centralized power grid, forming sustainable communities that could provide mutual support in the event of critical depletion of non-renewable resources.&lt;ref&gt;Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World ({{ISBN|9780865715103}}) (2004; British edition 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risk score''' (or '''risk scoring''') is the name given to a general practice in applied [[statistics]], [[Biostatistics|bio-statistics]], [[econometrics]] and other related disciplines, of creating an easily calculated number (the '''score''') that reflects the level of [[risk]] in the presence of some [[risk factor]]s (e.g. risk of mortality or disease in the presence of symptoms or genetic profile, risk financial loss considering credit and financial history, etc.). 

Risk scores are designed to be: 
* Simple to calculate: In many cases all you need to calculate a score is nothing a pen and a piece of paper (although [[QRISK|some]] scores use rely on more sophisticated or less transparent calculations that require a computer program).
* Easily interpreted: The result of the calculation is a single number, and higher score usually means higher risk. Furthermore, many scoring methods enforce some form of [[Monotonic_function|monotonicity]] along the measured risk factors to allow a straight forward interpretation of the score (e.g. risk of mortality only increases with age, risk of payment default only increase with the amount of total debt the customer has, etc.).
* Actionable: Scores are designed around a set of possible actions that should be taken as a result of the calculated score. Effective score-based policies can be designed and executed by setting thresholds on the value of the score and associating them with escalating actions. 

== Formal definition == 
A typical scoring method is composed of 3 components:
# A set of consistent rules (or weights) that assign a numerical value ("points") to each risk factor that reflect our estimation of underlying risk.
# A formula (typically a simple sum of all accumulated points) that calculates the score.
# A set of thresholds that helps to translate the calculated score into a level of risk, or an equivalent formula or set of rules to translate the calculated score back into probabilities (leaving the nominal evaluation of severity to the practitioner0.

Items 1 &amp; 2 can be achieved by using some form of [[Regression_analysis|regression]], that will provide both the risk estimation and the formula to calculate the score. Item 3 requires setting an arbitrary set of thresholds and will usually involve expert opinion. 

=== Estimating risk with GLM ===
Risk score are designed to represent an underlying probability of an adverse event denoted &lt;math&gt; \lbrace Y = 1 \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; given a vector of &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; [[explaining variables]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; containing measurements of the relevant risk factors. In order to establish the connection between the risk factors and the probability we estimate a set of weights &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is estimated using a [[generalized linear model]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}(\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{Y} = 1 | \mathbf{X}) = g^{-1}(\mathbf{X} \beta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued, monotonically increasing function that maps the values of the  [[Generalized_linear_model#Linear_predictor|linear predictor]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} \beta &lt;/math&gt; to the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt;. GLM methods typically uses the [[logit]] or [[probit]] as the [[Generalized_linear_model#Link_function|link function]].

==== Estimating risk with other methods ====
While it's possible to estimate &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{Y} = 1 | \mathbf{X}) &lt;/math&gt; using other statistical or machine learning methods, the requirements of simplicity and easy interpretation (and monotonicity per risk factor) make most of these methods difficult to use for scoring in this context:
* With more sophisticated methods it becomes difficult to attribute simple weights for each risk factor and to provide a simple formula for the calculation of the score. A notable exception are tree-based methods like [[Classification_and_regression_tree|CART]], that can provide a simple set of decision rules and calculations, but cannot ensure the monotonicity of the scale across the different risk factors.
* The fact that we are estimating underlying risk across the population, and therefore cannot tag people in advance on an ordinal scale (we can't know in advance if a person belongs to a "high risk" group, we only see observed incidences) [[Statistical_classification|classification]] methods are only relevant if we want to classify people into 2 groups or 2 possible actions. 

=== Constructing the score ===
When using GLM, the set of estimated weights &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; can be used to assign different values (or "points") to different values of the risk factors in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; (continuous or nominal as indicators). The score can then be expressed as a weighted sum:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{Score} = \mathbf{X} \beta = \sum_{j=1}^{P} \mathbf{X}_{j} \beta_{j}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* While some scoring methods use the values of the score "as is", some scoring methods (e.g. [[ABCD²_score|ABCD²]] score) will translate the score into probabilities by using &lt;math&gt; g^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; or a look-up table. This makes the process of obtaining the score more complicated computationally but has the advantage of translating an arbitrary number to a more familiar scale of 0 to 1.
* The columns of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; can represent complex transformations of the risk factors (including multiple [[Interaction_(statistics)|interactions]]) and not just the risk factors themselves.
* The values of &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; are sometimes scaled or rounded to allow working with integers instead of very small fractions (making the calculation simpler). While scaling has no impact ability of the score to estimate risk, rounding has the potential of disrupting the "optimality" of the GLM estimation. 

=== Making score-based decisions ===
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \lbrace \mathbf{a}_{1}, ... ,\mathbf{a}_{m} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; denote a set of &lt;math&gt; m \geq 2 &lt;/math&gt; "escalating" actions available for the decision maker (e.g. for credit risk decisions:  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{1} &lt;/math&gt; = "approve automatically", &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{2} &lt;/math&gt; = "require more documentation and check manually", &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{3} &lt;/math&gt; = "decline automatically"). In order to define a decision rule, we want to define a map between different values of the score and the possible decisions in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; \tau = \lbrace \tau_1, ... \tau_{m-1} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; be a [[Partition_of_an_interval|partition]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; consecutive, non-overlapping intervals, such that &lt;math&gt; \tau_1 &lt; \tau_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; \tau_{m-1} &lt;/math&gt;. 

The map is defined as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{If Score} \in [\tau_{j-1},\tau_{j}) \rightarrow \text{Take action } \mathbf{a}_{j}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* The values of &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; are set based on expert opinion, the type and prevalence of the measured risk, consequences of miss-classification, etc. For example, a risk of 9 out of 10 will usually be considered as "high risk", but a risk of 7 out of 10 can be considered either "high risk" or "medium risk" depending on context. 
* The definition of the intervals is on right open-ended intervals but can be equivalently defined using left open ended intervals &lt;math&gt; (\tau_{j-1},\tau_{j}] &lt;/math&gt;.
* For scoring methods that are already translated the score into probabilities we either define the partition &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; directly on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; or translate the decision criteria into &lt;math&gt; [g^{-1}(\tau_{j-1}),g^{-1}(\tau_{j})) &lt;/math&gt;, and the monotonicity of &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; ensures a 1-to-1 translation.

== Examples ==
=== Biostatistics ===
Some notable examples, taken from the category page [[:Category:Medical_scoring_system]]:
* [[Framingham Risk Score]]
* [[QRISK]]
* [[TIMI]]
* [[Rockall score]]
* [[ABCD² score]]
* [[CHA2DS2–VASc score]]

=== Financial industry ===
The primary use of scores in the financial sector is for [[Credit scorecards]], or [[Credit_score|credit scores]]: 
* In many countries (such as the [[Credit_score_in_the_United_States|US]]) credit score are calculated by commercial entities and therefore the exact method is not public knowledge (for example the [[Bankruptcy risk score]], [[Credit_score_in_the_United_States#FICO_score|FICO score]] and others). Credit scores in [[Credit_score#Australia|Australia]] and [[Credit_score#United_Kindgom|UK]] are often calculated by using [[Logistic_Regression|logistic regression]] to estimate [[probability of default]], and are therefore a type of risk score.
* Other financial industries, such as the [[Insurance_score|insurance]] industry also use variants of credit score.

==Electron accelerator facility==
The electron accelerator is the only one in the country. It has 500&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|keV]] energy and 20&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]] current.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;

==Proton accelerator facility==
The country's first proton accelerator facility ({{lang-tr|Proton Hızlandırıcı Tesisi}}, TAEK-PHT) is housed in a separate building of two stories built on a ground area of {{convert|3100|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}. The building consists of a [[cyclotron]] room, four target rooms, six production laboratories, three quality control laboratories, a R&amp;D laboratory and storage rooms for material and waste.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;

Facility's groundbreaking was held on February 24, 2010. The building was constructed by the Turkish Housing Development Administration (TOKİ), and it was completed on December 12, 2010. The installation of the [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] and all the equipment needed concluded in 2011.&lt;ref name="taek2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem/30-arastirma-ve-gelistirme-bolumu/855-proton-hizlandirici-tesisi.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=Proton Hızlandırıcı Tesisi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was officially opened on May 30, 2012 by Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-opens-first-particle-accelerator.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=22014&amp;NewsCatID=341 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |title=Turkey opens first particle accelerator |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=TAEK Proton Hızlandırıcısı Tesisi Açıldı |date=2012-05-31 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cyclotron]] type proton accelerator "CYCLONE-30" has a variable beam energy between 15 and 30 MeV and variable beam current up to 1.2 mA. It was designed, manufactured and installed by Belgian Ion Beam Applications S.A. (IBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iba-cyclotron-solutions.com/sites/default/files/ressources/CBR_Cyclone30_R01.pdf |publisher=IBA Cyclotron Solutions |title=Cyclone 30 |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclotron cost 11.6 million EUR.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=67826 |publisher=[[CERN]] |title=TAEK Proton Hızlandırıcı Tesisi Kapsamı ve Hedefleri |author=Yüksel, Alper Nazmi |date=2009--09-10 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the cyclotron, four [[beamline]]s can be generated, three beamlines for radiositope production and one for research and development works.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c"/&gt; With the proton bombardment following radioisotopes are produced in three separate target rooms:
* [[Indium-111]], [[gallium-67]], [[thallium-201]] on solid target material,
* [[Fluorine-18]] on liquid target material,
* [[Iodine-123]] on evaporated target material.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

These radioisotopes and [[radiopharmaceutical]]s produced from those radioisotopes are used for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases like [[cancer]], [[neurological disorder]], brain physiology and pathology as well as [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref name="taek2"/&gt;

By producing radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, the facility conducts research work in the fields of medicine, industry, agriculture, food, [[biotechnology]], animal husbandry and heath physics.&lt;ref name="taek1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/sanaem.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=Sarayköy Nükleer Araştırma ve Eğitim Merkezi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13503">'''Shared historical authority''' is a current trend in [[museums]] and [[cultural institutions|historical institutions]] which aims to open the interpretation of [[history]] to the public.

== Definition ==
The concept of shared historical [[authority]] is defined by the premise that traditional institutions of historical authority, such as museums and [[historical society|historical societies]], are increasingly inviting non-professionals (the general public) to share their historical [[Perspective (cognitive)|viewpoints]] and [[experience]]s with the public. It is argued that this trend toward sharing authority is changing the nature of public historical experience in significant ways.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Shared authority removes the hierarchy commonly practiced within cultural institutions. Moving away from a top down approach, shared authority is geared towards collaboration that includes dialogue, and participatory engagement.  

Typical examples of shared historical authority include:
* A museum inviting a community artist to create and install a work of historically inspired public art on their site.
* A historical society providing gallery space for community groups to display their own exhibitions.
* Web-based projects that invite and display user-generated components.
* Using oral and written histories contributed by individuals outside the strictly academic community in conjunction with more traditional scholarly essays, text panels or exhibit labels.
* A historic house tour where visitors are encouraged to explore on their own and draw their own conclusions.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* Community curation - "crowdsourcing" related content from [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] groups

In each case the institution serves as a catalyst for non-traditional participants to contribute to a body of information presented to the public.  The institution uses its resources - e.g. staff expertise, collections, public space - to help non-traditional participants share their contributions in publicly accessible and engaging ways.  At its most basic, shared authority turns people who would otherwise be historical consumers (visitors and audiences) into participants and co-generators of historical content for public display. Museums who coordinate programs that share historical authority often wish to imbue a sense of democratization to the historical narrative, in contrast to the top-down historical narratives that sometimes emerge in museums. In addition, shared authority projects frequently try to involve communities who have traditionally been disenfranchised or underrepresented in historical narratives and institutions, providing a platform for alternative voices to engage in a public historical dialogue.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The role of shared historical authority continues to be debated in the field of [[public history]].

== History of the idea ==

The need for museums and other historical institutions to "share authority" with their audiences and surrounding communities is rooted in the ideologies of [[social history|New Social History]] and social constructivism.  Both paradigms reject the concept of a "master narrative" for describing historical events, finding it an inadequate method for representing the multiple experiences and perspectives of individuals involved.  Arising from the work of folklorists such as [[John Lomax]] and [[Alan Lomax]], [[New Deal]]-era [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) programs such as the [[Federal Writers' Project]] and the work of [[Studs Terkel]], the social history movement of the 1960s placed new academic emphasis on the experiences of people not represented in traditional or "official" historical narratives, and gave further impetus to projects focused on collecting and sharing those experiences.&lt;ref name="Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski|first=eds.|title= Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Frisch, a professor at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]], popularized the term "shared authority" in his 1990 book ''A Shared Authority: Essays on the Craft and Meaning of Oral and Public History.'' In recent years, Frisch has distinguished between "sharing authority" and "''a'' shared authority." The former suggests that historians possess authority and have a responsibility to share it, reinforcing a traditional, top-down view of history. "A shared authority", by contrast, recognizes that traditional historical authorities and the public share in the interpretive and [[meaning-making]] process "''by definition''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frisch|first=Michael|title="From A Shared Authority to the Digital Kitchen, and Back" in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=126–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 2000s, the proliferation of [[Web 2.0]] technologies that allow users to easily create and share content on digital platforms offered historical institutions a variety of new tools to facilitate public participation.

==Case Studies==
[[File:97 Orchard Street Front.jpg|thumb|The [[Lower East Side Tenement Museum]] in New York's Manhattan district is a good example of how an urban museum can share historical authority]]

Other examples of shared historical authority include [[StoryCorps]], City of Memory, and Philaplace, an internet based neighborhood history project produced by the Historical Society of Philadelphia that combines scholarly essays with stories from anyone who cares to submit one.  Staff members then curate the submitted stories. [[Dennis Severs' House|Dennis Severs House]] is a historic townhouse in [[London]] (18 Folgate St.) that was restored by Dennis Severs.  The house is filled with historic objects alongside modern touches, sound clips of carriages and crying babies, and plates of real food set out each day by the staff.  Visitors are encouraged to roam the house on their own, sit down on the furniture, interact with other visitors and draw their own conclusions. The experience is meant to blur the lines between art and history.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[Lower East Side Tenement Museum]] is the first museum to focus on the lives of [[Urban area|urban]], [[immigrant]] [[tenement]] dwellers.  It shares authority by inviting the families of former residents to contribute objects, photographs, documents, interviews and oral histories to the museum tours.  Part of the museum's mission is to address today's immigrant issues. This provides another avenue for sharing authority through public programs that connect speakers with varied backgrounds to public audiences. The museum invites sharing on one of its tours, ''Sweatshop Workers'', with the words:

:"Spend extended time inside the Levine and Rogarshevsky apartments and join in a discussion about themes arising from the tour. Share your experiences, thoughts and family histories with your educator and fellow visitors."&lt;ref name="LESTMtours"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tenement.org/tours.php | title=Sweatshop Workers: Tour &amp; Discussion | publisher=Lower East Side Tenement Museum | work=Tour the Building | year=2011 | accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open House: If These Walls Could Talk is an exhibition that was produced by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]] in 2006. The exhibition traced the stories of families in a single house in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] between 1888 and 2006.  The curators did not want to show patterns or people as part of aggregate groups.  Instead, they chose to emphasize singularity and individuality.  To accomplish this, the Minnesota Historical Society built a house for visitors to walk through.  Instead of reading large panels of wall texts, visitors had to interact with objects to hear, read, or see information.  Unlike projects in which the content is produced in conjunction with a group of community members, here authority was shared at the level of [[narrative]] creation.  Curators controlled the objects in the house, recordings of former residents, and the setup of the space.  Without an overarching structure, visitors could wander through at random, co-creating their own narratives. There was no clear beginning and end beyond entering and exiting the house.&lt;ref&gt;Filene, B. (2011).

Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World''. in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski (eds.),''Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World'', pp. 138-155.  Philadelphia, PA: Pew Center for Arts and Heritage. {{ISBN|978-0-9834803-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Bottom Performance Project is a partnership between the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and residents of [[Black Bottom, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Black Bottom]], an historically black neighborhood destroyed by [[urban renewal]] policies and the University of Pennsylvania's expansion in the 1960s.  Billy Yalowitz, a theater professor working at the university, invited Penn students as well as student and teacher partners from University City High School—a school built in the former Black Bottom neighborhood—and former residents of the neighborhood to work together on the telling of the neighborhood's history, ultimately creating "Black Bottom Sketches" in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Yalowitz, B. (2011). "The Black Bottom: Making Community-Based Performance in West Philadelphia." in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski (eds.),''Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World'', pp. 156-173.  Philadelphia, PA: Pew Center for Arts and Heritage. {{ISBN|978-0-9834803-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wing_Luke_Museum_of_the_Asian_Pacific_American_Experience|Wing Luke Museum]] is an example of a museum in which shared authority is a core component of its programming policies.

==Criticism==

Despite the interest and affirmation that sharing authority is currently receiving in museum and public humanities circles, there are scholars and practitioners who criticise the practice.  Generally, these criticisms are aimed at one of two levels.  First, some scholars suggest that the phrase itself is wrong. "Sharing authority" implies that the process is something museums/archives do rather than something that just "is."  In his essay for ''Letting Go?'', Michael Frisch suggests that a more appropriate formulation of the concept is "a shared authority."&lt;ref name=Frisch/&gt;

:"a shared authority"... suggests something that 'is'-- that in the nature of oral and public history, we are not the sole interpreters.  Rather, the interpretive and meaning-making process is in fact shared by definition-- it is inherent in the dialogic nature of an interview, and in how audiences receive and respond to exhibitions and public history interchanges in general.&lt;ref name=Frisch&gt;Frisch in ''Letting Go?'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and artists also worry that sharing authority devalues the hard-won expertise of professionals. The artist [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], whose 1992-1993 exhibit "Mining the Museum" at the [[Maryland Historical Society]] is considered a landmark moment in museums' assessments of their role as historical arbiters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Letting Go?|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; has expressed, "I don't think people should share authority to the degree that you devalue your own scholarship, your own knowledge. That's not sharing anything. You're not giving what you have. That is highly problematic. You have to be realistic about your years of experience, what you can give, and what others can give."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fred Wilson, Paula Marincola, and Marjorie Schwarzer|first= "Mining the Museum Revisited: A Conversation"|title= in Letting Go?|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication,''''' written by American scholar [[John Durham Peters]], is a classic and important work in Commucation area and also the first and most well-known book of John Durham Peters. In this book, the author asserts that communicating like angels is "impossible" but it is not just a tragic fact but also a blessed one. This book talks about the history of communication failure from different aspects like philosophy, politics, media technology and so forth. This book won the [[National Communication Association]] Award in 2000.

== Themes ==
''Speaking into the Air: A history of the Idea of Communication'' studies on Communication failure. It contains five phrases of history of the idea of Communication, Plaeo's eros, The Bible's one-way dissemination, Religious Angle communication in Middle Ages, Spiritual communication in modern philosophy, and the communication idea in modern communication theory. It also involves the subject machines, animals and aliens as horizons of incommunicability.

== Book review ==
At the end of the Introduction "he Problem of Communication", Peters asserts that "dissemination" can be more charming：

"The most beautiful thing about our contact with each other is its free dissemination, not its anguished communion. The ultimate futility of our attempts to "communicate" is not lamentable; it is a handsome condition. The notion of communication deserves to be liberated from its earnestness and spiritualism, its demand for precision and agreement, demands whose long history I attempt to illustrate in this book. The requirement of interpersonal mimesis can be despotic...The idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible."

And then in the first chapter "Dialogue and Dissemination", Peters compares two forms of communication: dialogue and dissemination and makes an argument that “dialogue can be tyrannical and dissemination can be just”, which provides an interesting perspective of one-way communication: dissemination. And my study about dissemination of Chinese literature is based on the pressing industries, is all about book. Compared to radio, television, internet, books like newspaper, magazines and other pressing productions can be more like the media of one-way communication, since we can easily make instant interactions through radio, television, internet but as for books, due to the lack of interaction, the audiences may have more time and freedom to interpret meanings by themselves.

To illustrate, we may use the theory of Encoding and Decoding by Stuart Hall, as shown right:
[[File:Encoding-decoding.gif|thumb]]
A programme can be encoded and decoded separately by different groups of people. In a dialogue or any other means of interaction, encoding and decoding can happen in turn or together frequently within a certain time between the two sides. And because of such strong interaction in it, say, the two sides have hugely different frameworks of knowledge, and then what will happen? Probably, they start to fight against each other... more emotion and non-rationality are filled in. Say, the two sides are more polite and open to the other’s opinions and maybe they have to force themselves to adjust their framework of knowledge and achieve a consistent but not perfectly accepted point at the end. As Peters said, dialogue can be tyrannical. More conflicts and disgraceful compromise may happen in a dialogue. Of course, in a one-way dissemination, say the dissemination of Chinese Contemporary literature books overseas, the process of encoding of Chinese writers is complete without too much distraction from the audiences overseas. The writers can fill their knowledge, feelings and thoughts in their books. And through the dissemination overseas, audiences in the far access the productions and decode the meanings by themselves with less distraction. Of course, the audiences could write book reviews or make direct connections to the authors, and at the same time, the authors could hold book launches or make a speech to make connections with the authors. But this kind of interaction afterwards can’t compete with the counterpart in instant dialogues in a phone call and chats in the social media, where encoding and decoding happen together at the same time. This kind of inspires me to reconsider the beauty of "dissemination"----one-way communication. But we should also realize that either in a dialogue or the dissemination, the failure always exists. Regardless of the tragedy, what we should also keep in mind is that “ the idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible.”

Accessed July 28 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that Modernism first emerged in the field of mathematics rather than the arts, specifically in the work of German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]], who, in 1872, demonstrated that mathematicians operate without a continuum; this represents the formalization of Everdell's axiom of "ontological discontinuity," which he goes on to examine in a multiplicity of contexts. He examines this emerging framework of discreteness in science ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s mechanics, [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Cajal]]'s neuroscience, [[Hugo de Vries]]'s conception of the gene and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s quantum work, [[Einstein]]'s physics); mathematics, logic, and philosophy ([[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and the linguistic turn, [[Husserl]] and the beginnings of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]); in addition to the arts ([[James Joyce]]'s novels, [[Picasso]]'s [[Demoiselles d'Avignon|''Demoiselles D'Avignon'']], [[Schoenberg]]'s twelve-tone music).

==Reviews==

Critics largely reviewed ''The First Moderns'' favorably, appreciating Everdell's interdisciplinary approach, in publications including the [[New york review of books|''New York Review of Books'']], the ''New York Times,'' the [[Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times,'']] and the [[Washington Post Book World|''Washington Post''.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/05/20/infinitesimally-yours/ "Infinitesimally Yours"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''New York Review of Books,'' May 20, 1999. "Drawing together such disparate manifestations as Seurat's pointillism, Muybridge's stop-motion photography, the poetry of Whitman, Rimbaud, and Laforgue, the tone rows of Schoenberg, and the novels of Joyce, the author [Everdell] makes an engrossing and persuasive case for his claim that 'the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Kenner]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/970629.29kennert.html "A Change of Mind], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought'', ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1997. "The change started to happen in the 1870's [sic], and not, as William R. Everdell arrestingly demonstrates in ''The First Moderns,'' in painting or in literature but in number theory. He's aware that word-focused people will be startled: ''Everyone who has heard of modernism has heard of Picasso. Most have heard of Joyce. But who has heard of Dedekind?'' Yet it was an 1872 pamphlet of Richard Dedekind's that first, to use the terminology of 19th-century positivism, ''rigorized'' modernism's generic concept -- which, as Everdell reveals, is discontinuity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Morton]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/20/books/bk-14342 "Deconstructing Modernism"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''Los Angeles Times'', July 20, 1997. "''The First Moderns'' brilliantly maps the beginning of a path at whose end loom as many diasporas as there are men."&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in 1965. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cited TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice". TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor = Monica Prendergast &amp; Juliana Saxton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a high-impact child-centred performance for a specifically targeted school audience became hugely popular. Due to small audiences students can be encouraged to participate through work in-role and through debate. Student experimentation can be supported with resource materials and training or support for the students by teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zsbjn39/revision/1|title= history of TIE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Need ==

Education is becoming like rote learning. The education the students are getting is not being applied creatively in any area. Contrary to this 'rote' education, TIE presents a different approach including discussions, contributions and creativity through performance. It fulfils all types of [[learning]] and enhances the development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aate.com/?page=effects|title=Effect of drama|work=AMERICAN ALLIANCE FOR THEATRE &amp; EDUCATION}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/theatre/You-can-now-study-theatre-in-school/articleshow/30887799.cms|title=Times of india|work=YOU CAN NOW STUDY THEATER IN SCHOOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference between Drama in Education and Theatre in Education ==

In the last twenty years many books have appeared describing drama and theatre activities with children. These various labels are indicative of the range of the work and of the possible confusions that can arise. Some of the main areas of work are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ann Redington|first1=Christine|title=Theatre in education : an historical and analytical study.|journal=University of Glasgow|date= December 1979|pages=10–460|url=http://theses.gla.ac.uk/2535/1/1979redingtonphd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drama in Education'''
In the school curriculum, this is both a method and a subject. As a curriculum subject it uses various dramatic elements, and acting out. In many Secondary schools drama is now a separate department. In some Primary schools it is used as a method to teach a number of subjects.

'''Theatre in Education'''
A professional team of trained and experienced actor/teachers, who prepare relevant material/project/experiment to be presented in schools often involving more than one visit. These programmes are usually devised and researched by the team/teachers and are for small groups of one or two classes of a specific age. The aim of the programmes is essentially educational, and uses theatre, drama in education and teaching techniques for educational purposes. 
This work provides an educational aid, resource and stimulus for both teachers and pupils, but to do so it may vary from place to place, total participation sessions to performance and discussion. Theatre in Education can be considered as a method of work used by some companies all the time, and by others only occasionally. Many companies who use this method of work have, as their starting point, a strong left-wing or didactic approach to their subject matter, and they cannot be considered as mere tools of the education system. Rather, they act as outside questioners, looking at ideas and values in society.

== The main element of TIE ==

These are the following characteristics of TIE&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*There is a clear aim and educational objective running throughout this process.
*The cast should be small so actors must be versatile and often take several roles.
*A low budget project has to be taken so that actors can play [[Musical instruments|instruments]] too. 
*The production must be portable and the design of the production will be simple and representational.
*The exploration of issues has to be from various viewpoints, so that we can see the effect of the action upon a range of people.
*There should be involvement by the audience.
*They are rarely wholly [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] because narration is often used.
*As actors have multiple roles, the costume are representational and simple.
*For educating the audience facts and figures can be included.
*They may have a strong message or moral running throughout the production.

== How TIE can be used ==

TIE can create different kinds of productions:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Supported by resource materials, the production can be designed to stimulate reaction and participation from its small audience, through role play and debate. 
*By specifically targeting an area for a particular age group in a school’s personal, social and health education curriculum.
*For the young audience the production can be based on the traditional story, allowing a range of follow-up activities if desired.
*Linking the story to the given activities for very young children can provide opportunities for involvement. 
*For the adult age group some additional 'dramatizing' activities may be added e.g. learning parenting skills or preparing for employment.
*It should be organised meaningfully.

== In Schools ==

'''The Role of Teacher '''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Synkova|first1=Klara|title=Drama in Education|journal=The Charles University (Czech Republic)|url=http://conference.pixel-online.net/ICT4LL2012/common/download/Abstract_pdf/436-QIL61-ABS-Synkova-ICT2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to knowledge dissemination, memory-based teaching, [[Drama games]] and fun during lessons leads to better engagement. Instead of simply lecturing, the teacher in the TIE setting can become a conceptual artist who moulds [[knowledge]], [[feelings]], [[thoughts]], [[sensation (psychology)|sensations]] and experience into an active and activating educational process. This is not about an artist in a traditional way. It’s more a way of thinking, perception of the world and its needs in right - brained way as non-linear, practical, intuitive, and holistic. 
*Teacher´s typology 
The personality of a teacher influences the use of drama in lessons.  According to Barucha, teacher types fall into four quadrants (see Figure 1).  Barucha differentiates two dimensions depending on the teacher’s behaviour, perception, values and attitudes: the interactivity level and the level of logical/emphatic thinking. Both dimensions operate on a whole scale in between the extreme values. 


'''The Role of Student'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this methodology the student need to understand that the role of the teacher changes. In TIE the student himself takes the initiative and responsibility. TIE demands much greater independence of thinking. In this process of structured learning, drama rehearsals require full dedication. Due to this and closer interpersonal interaction, the process can lead to more clashes compared to traditional class teaching. There are several issues apart from memory training, courage to act, and the ability to emerge from the shell that each of us adopts at work or at school, there can be language difficulties, stage fright, newness in being expected to adopt a role, confidence etc.

Summarizing the main requirements and preconditions as follows: -
*Intellectual maturity, ability to understand the play and roles
*Ability to comprehend the cost and investment, but also the benefits. Openness to accept new method of teaching/ learning.
*Time management or Commitment
*Acceptance of guiding role of the teacher without formal authority
*Language competence
*Performance skills/competence (active attitude to potential stage fright issues, memory issues etc.)
*Collective work competence 
*Controlling the emotional intelligence and Ability to cooperate even in stressful moments (like a performance).

==Some theatre improvisation games==
This are some theatre games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=David|title=101 Drama Games and Activities|date=2007|publisher=Lulu |edition=2nd|url=https://earthviaradio.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/drama_101_games_and_activities.pdf|ref=http://www.dramaresource.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) '''Alphabet conversation'''

Having a group of student, start a conversation one by one where each sentence begins with the next letter of the alphabet. Giving a situation before you begin will help the student. Students can also use sounds to start a sentence, for example “Mmmm” or “tut-tut”.  This game can be played in pairs or small groups.  Here is an example:
 
A:   Anyone seen my cat?

B:   Black one, with funny eyes?

A:   Can’t say I remember.

B:   Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what it looks like?

A:   Every cat looks the same to me.

B:   Fortunately, I found one yesterday

A:   Gee, that’s great…

*Try starting somewhere in the middle of the alphabet.  Then when you reach “Z”, return to “A” until you arrive back where you started. This technique can be combine with one word stories.

2) '''People poems'''

Divide the class into small group of four or five. To each group give a topic/word –e.g. “Time”. Now each person in an each group as to write down or remembers some words associated with the theme, e.g.- slow, fast, boredom, quickly and centuries. Now every group has to make an object out of the members, linked to the theme (such as a clock). Ideally the group object should move. 
Next every group has to bring the object to life and works out a way of bringing in some or all of their words-linked to their movements. And at the end they show the resulting people poem to the rest of the class, who can try and guess the theme.
Themes can include: 
* Elements - earth, air, fire, water 
* Opposites – cold/hot, fast/slow, high/low 
* Colours
* Emotions

== Benefits ==
These are some benefits of TIE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.DramaEd.netCopyright|title=Benefits of Drama}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edartes.it/doc/Gaetano_Oliva,_Education_to_Theatricality_inside_Secondary_School,_Art_and_Body.pdf|title=Education to Theatricality inside Secondary School, Art and Body}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Self-Confidence''': By performing in front audience the student get the [[confidence]] to trust on his own ideas and abilities.  This will be applied to his life, career and school.
* 
* '''Imagination''': Thinking out of the box, and interpreting familiar material in new ways. [[Einstein]] said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.”
* 
* '''Empathy''': Acting in a roles for different situations, time periods, and different [[cultures]] promotes compassion and it develops tolerance for others’ feelings and viewpoints.
* 
* '''Collaboration''': It combines the new ideas and abilities of its participants. This [[cooperative learning]] includes discussing, sharing, negotiating, rehearsing, and [[performing]].
* 
* '''Concentration''': Performing in a [[play (theatre)|play]] develops a constant focus of [[mind]], body, and [[voice]], which also helps in life and in school subjects.
* 
* '''Communication Skills''': In a play a student enhances [[Language|verbal]] and [[nonverbal]] expression of ideas. It also improves voice projection, articulation of words, and fluency with language. 
* 
* '''Emotional Outlet''': In the play the student is allowed to express a range of emotions. Sadness, aggression and tension are released in a safe, controlled environment, reducing antisocial [[behaviours]].
* 
* '''Relaxation''': Theatre activities reduce stress by releasing mental, physical, and emotional tension.
* 
* '''Physical Fitness''': Movement in drama improves body balance, coordination, flexibility, and control.

There are many '''theories of humor''' which attempt to explain what [[humor]] is, what social functions it serves, and what would be considered humorous. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of humor, there are [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider humor to be very healthy behavior; there are [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]], which consider humor to be an inexplicable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Smullyan]], "The Planet Without Laughter", ''[[This Book Needs No Title]]: A Budget of Living Paradoxes'' (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1980). Copyright (c) 1980 by Raymond M. Smullyan&lt;/ref&gt; Although various classical theories of humor and laughter may be found, in contemporary academic literature, three theories of humor appear repeatedly: relief theory, superiority theory, and incongruity theory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buijzen|first1=M.|last2=Valkenburg|first2=P. M.|title=Developing a Typology of Humor in Audiovisual Media|journal=Media Psychology|date=2004|volume=6|issue=2|pages=147–167|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among current humor researchers, there is no consensus about which of these three theories of humor is most viable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Proponents of each one originally claimed their theory to be capable of explaining all cases of humor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=J. C.|title=Humor as a Double-Edged Sword: Four Functions of Humor in Communication|journal=Communication Theory|date=2000|volume=10|issue=3|pages=310–331|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2000.tb00194.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they now acknowledge that although each theory generally covers its own area of focus, many instances of humor can be explained by more than one theory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berger, A. A. (1993). ''An Anatomy of Humor''. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Veatch|first1=T. C.|title=A theory of humor|journal=Humor|date=1998|volume=11|issue=2|pages=161–215|doi=10.1515/humr.1998.11.2.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incongruity and superiority theories, for instance, seem to describe complementary mechanisms which together create humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandaele|first1=J.|title=Humor Mechanisms in Film Comedy: Incongruity and Superiority|journal=Poetics Today|date=2002|volume=23|issue=2|pages=221–249|doi=10.1215/03335372-23-2-221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relief theory==
Relief theory maintains that laughter is a [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanism by which psychological tension is reduced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berlyne, D. E. (1972). "Humour and its kin", in J. H. Goldstein &amp; P. E. McGhee (Eds.), ''The Psychology of Humour'' (pp. 43–60). New York: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Humor may thus for example serve to facilitate relief of the tension caused by one's fears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. George Boeree |url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/humor.html |title=Humor |publisher=Webspace.ship.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laughter and mirth, according to relief theory, result from this release of nervous energy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Humor, according to relief theory, is used mainly to overcome sociocultural inhibitions and reveal suppressed desires. It is believed that this is the reason we laugh whilst being tickled, due to a buildup of tension as the tickler "strikes".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, N. (1981). ''The Art of Laughter''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Herbert Spencer]], laughter is an "economical phenomenon" whose function is to release "psychic energy" that had been wrongly mobilized by incorrect or false expectations. The latter point of view was
supported also by [[Sigmund Freud]].

==Superiority theory==
The superiority theory of humor traces back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. The general idea is that a person laughs about misfortunes of others (so called ''[[schadenfreude]]''), because these misfortunes assert the person's superiority on the background of shortcomings of others.&lt;ref name=mn2002&gt;M.P. Mulder, A. Nijholt (2002) [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/580062.html "Humour Research: State of the Art"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] was reported by [[Plato]] as saying that the [[ridiculous]] was characterized by a display of self-ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Philebus'' 49b ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Aristotle]], we laugh at inferior or ugly individuals, because we feel a joy at feeling superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', 1449a, p. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incongruous juxtaposition theory==
[[File:HalfFullHalfEmptyBeerGlass.jpg|thumb|A beer glass made by [[Camden Town Brewery]] ([[London]]). The physical presence of beer in the glass's lower part, exactly where the inscription is: 'HALF EMPTY', sets a collision between two frames of reference. This incongruity results in a humorous effect at the moment of its realization.]]
The incongruity theory states that humor is perceived at the moment of realization of incongruity between a concept involved in a certain situation and the real objects thought to be in some relation to the concept.&lt;ref name=mn2002/&gt;

Since the main point of the theory is not the incongruity ''per se'', but its realization and resolution (i.e., putting the objects in question into the real relation), it is often called the incongruity-resolution theory.&lt;ref name=mn2002/&gt;

[[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] expressed in ''Thoughts on Laughter'' (1725) what became a key concept in the evolving theory of the comic: laughter as a response to the perception of incongruity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ludwig Berger]] ''Redeeming Laughter: The Comic Dimension of Human Experience'' (1997) p.22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] wrote that the perceived incongruity is between a concept and the real object it represents. [[Hegel]] shared almost exactly the same view, but saw the concept as an "appearance" and believed that laughter then totally negates that appearance.

The first formulation of the incongruity theory is attributed to the Scottish poet Beattie.&lt;ref&gt;J.Beattie,  Essays (William Creech, Edinburg, 1776).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous version of the incongruity theory, however, is that of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who claimed that the comic is "the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Masculinity and Ridicule| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Anna | last2= Hickey-Moody | journal=Gender: Laughter |publisher=Macmillan Reference|location=Farmington Hills, MI| pages= 216–217 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Bergson]] attempted to perfect incongruity by reducing it to the "living" and "mechanical".&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic'' (1900) English translation 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incongruity like Bergson's, in things juxtaposed simultaneously, is still in vogue. This is often debated against theories of the shifts in perspectives in humor; hence, the debate in the series ''Humor Research'' between John Morreall and Robert Latta.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Latta (1999) The Basic Humor Process: A Cognitive-Shift Theory and the Case against Incongruity, Walter de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3-11-016103-6}} (Humor Research no. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;
Morreall presented mostly simultaneous juxtapositions,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Morreall]] (1983) Taking Laughter Seriously, Suny Press, {{ISBN|0-87395-642-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Latta focusing on a "cognitive shift" created by the sudden solution to some kind of problem.

Humor frequently contains an unexpected, often sudden, shift in perspective, which gets assimilated by the Incongruity Theory. This view has been defended by Latta (1998) and by [[Brian Boyd]] (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=B.|title=Laughter and Literature: A Play Theory of Humor|journal=Philosophy and Literature|date=2004|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1353/phl.2004.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd views the shift as from seriousness to play. Nearly anything can be the object of this perspective twist; it is, however, in the areas of human creativity (science and art being the varieties) that the shift results from "structure mapping" (termed "[[bisociation]]" by Koestler) to create novel meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1964): "The Act of Creation".&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Koestler argues that humor results when two different frames of reference are set up and a collision is engineered between them.

==Other theories==

=== Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor ===

The Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor (SSTH) was introduced by [[Victor Raskin]] in "Semantic Mechanisms of Humor", published 1985.&lt;ref name="Semantic_Mechanisms"&gt;Victor Raskin (1985). ''Semantic Mechanisms of Humor'' (302 pp.). Dordrecht - Boston - Lancaster: D. Reidel.&lt;/ref&gt;  While being a variant on the more general concepts of the Incongruity theory of humor (see above), it is the first theory to identify its approach as exclusively linguistic. As such it concerns itself only with verbal humor: written and spoken words used in narrative or riddle jokes concluding with a punch line.

The linguistic scripts (a.k.a. frames) referenced in the title include, for any given word, a "large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word and evoked by it [...] a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker".&lt;ref&gt;Raskin (1985), pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; These scripts extend much further than the [[lexical definition]] of a word; they contain the speaker's complete knowledge of the concept as it exists in his world. Thus native speakers will have similar but not identical scripts for words they have in common.

To produce the humor of a verbal joke, Raskin posits, the following 2 conditions must be met: 
* "(i) The text is compatible, fully or in part, with two different [semantic] scripts 
* (ii) The two scripts with which the text is compatible are opposite [...]. The two scripts with which the text is compatible are said to overlap fully or in part on this text."&lt;ref&gt;Raskin (1985), pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Humor is evoked when a trigger at the end of the joke, the [[punch line]], causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding from the primary (or more obvious) script to the secondary, opposing script.

As an example Raskin uses the following joke:

:"Is the doctor at home?" the patient asked in his bronchial whisper. "No," the doctor's young and pretty wife whispered in reply. "Come right in."&lt;ref&gt;Raskin (1985), pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this example, the two scripts contained in the joke are &lt;small&gt;DOCTOR&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;LOVER&lt;/small&gt;; the switch from one to the other is triggered by our understanding of the "whispered" reply of the "young and pretty wife". This reply only makes sense in the script of &lt;small&gt;LOVER&lt;/small&gt;, but makes no sense in the script of a bronchial patient going to see the &lt;small&gt;DOCTOR&lt;/small&gt; at his (home) office. Raskin expands further on his analysis with more jokes, examining in each how the scripts both overlap and oppose each other in the text.&lt;ref name="Krikmann"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krikmann|first1=A.|title=Contemporary Linguistic Theories of Humour|journal=Folklore: Electronic Journal of Folklore|date=2006|volume=33|pages=27–58|doi=10.7592/FEJF2006.33.kriku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fulfill the second condition of a joke, Raskin introduces different categories of script opposition. A partial list includes: actual (non-actual), normal (abnormal), possible (impossible), good (bad), life (death), obscene (non-obscene), money (no money), high (low) stature.&lt;ref&gt;Raskin (1985), pp. 113 - 114.&lt;/ref&gt; A complete list of possible script oppositions for jokes is finite and culturally dependent. For example, Soviet political humor does not use the same scripts to be found in [[Jewish humor]].&lt;ref&gt;Raskin (1985), see Table of Contents.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for all jokes, in order to generate the humor a connection between the two scripts contained in a given joke must be established. "...one cannot simply juxtapose two incongruous things and call it a joke, but rather one must find a clever way of making them make pseudo-sense together".&lt;ref name="Triezenberg"&gt;Katrina E. Triezenberg (2008). "Humor in Literature", pg. 537. In ''Primer of Humor Research'', ed. Victor Raskin. Mouton de Gruyter: Berlin, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General Theory of Verbal Humor ===
The General Theory of Verbal Humor (GTVH) was proposed by [[Victor Raskin]] and [[Salvatore Attardo]] in the article "Script theory revis(it)ed: joke similarity and joke representation model".&lt;ref name="Script_Revisited"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attardo|first1=S.|last2=Raskin|first2=V.|title=Script theory revis(it)ed: joke similarity and joke representation model|journal=Humor|date=1991|volume=4|issue=3-4|pages=293–347|doi=10.1515/humr.1991.4.3-4.293}}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrated Raskin's ideas of Script Opposition (SO), developed in his Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor [SSTH], into the GTVH as one of six levels of independent Knowledge Resources (KRs).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lew (1996). "An ambiguity-based theory of the linguistic verbal joke in English. A Thesis submitted to the faculty of Adam Mickiewicz University in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy April 1996". Poznan, Poland, unpublished thesis. http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~rlew/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The other 5 KRs had been previously identified in Attardo's five-level joke representation model. See {{cite journal|last1=Hofstadter|first1=D.|last2=Gabora|first2=L.|last3=Raskin|first3=V.|last4=Attardo|first4=S.|title=Synopsis of the Workshop on Humor and Cognition|journal=Humor|date=1989|volume=2|issue=4|pages=417–440|doi=10.1515/humr.1989.2.4.407}}&lt;/ref&gt; These KRs could be used to model individual verbal jokes as well as analyze the degree of similarity or difference between them. The Knowledge Resources proposed in this theory are:&lt;ref name="Attardo"&gt;Salvatore Attardo (1994). ''Linguistic Theories of Humor'', pp. 223 - 226. Mouton de Gruyter: Berlin, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Script Opposition (SO)''' references the script opposition included in Raskin's SSTH. This includes, among others, themes such as real (unreal), actual (non-actual), normal (abnormal), possible (impossible). 
# '''Logical Mechanism (LM)''' refers to the mechanism which connects the different scripts in the joke. These can range from a simple verbal technique like a pun to more complex LMs such as faulty logic or false analogies. 
# '''Situation (SI)''' can include objects, activities, instruments, props needed to tell the story. 
# '''Target (TA)''' identifies the actor(s) who become the "butt" of the joke. This labeling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes of ethnic groups, professions, etc.
# '''Narrative strategy (NS)''' addresses the narrative format of the joke, as either a simple narrative, a dialogue, or a riddle. It attempts to classify the different genres and subgenres of verbal humor. In a subsequent study Attardo expands the NS to include oral and printed humorous narratives of any length, not just jokes.&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Attardo (2001). ''Humorous Texts: A Semantic and Pragmatic Analysis''. Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter&lt;/ref&gt;    
# '''Language (LA) ''' "...contains all the information necessary for the verbalization of a text. It is responsible for the exact wording ...and for the placement of the functional elements." &lt;ref&gt;Attardo (1994), pg. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate their theory, the authors use 7 examples of the light bulb joke, each variant shifted by a single Knowledge Resource.&lt;ref name="Krikmann" /&gt; Each one of the KRs, ordered hierarchically above and starting with the Script Opposition, has the ability to "determine the parameters below themselves, and are determined [circumscribed] by those above themselves. 'Determination' is to be intended as limiting or reducing the options available for the instantiation of the parameter; for example, the choice of the SO [script opposition] &lt;small&gt;DUMB/SMART&lt;/small&gt; will reduce the options available to the generation in the TA (in North America to Poles, etc.)" &lt;ref&gt;Attardo (1994), pg. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of this theory (GTVH) over Raskin's script-based semantic theory (SSTH) is that through the inclusion of the Narrative Strategy (NS) any and all humorous texts can be categorized. Whereas Raskin's SSTH only deals with jokes, the GTVH considers all humorous text from spontaneous one-liners to funny stories and literature. This theory can also, by identifying how many of the Knowledge Resources are identical for any two humorous pieces, begin to define the degree of similarity between the two.

As to the ordering of the Knowledge Resources, there has been much discussion. Willibald Ruch, a distinguished German psychologist and humor researcher,&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Willibald Ruch]]&lt;/ref&gt; wanted to test empirically the ordering of the Knowledge Resources, with only partial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruch|first1=W.|last2=Attardo|first2=S.|last3=Raskin|first3=V.|title=Toward an empirical verification of the General Theory of Verbal Humor|journal=Humor|date=1993|volume=6|issue=2|pages=123–136|doi=10.1515/humr.1993.6.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both the test structure and the results are described in Krikman (2006), pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, both the listed Knowledge Resources in the GTVH and their relationship to each other has proven to be fertile ground in the further investigation of what exactly makes humor funny.&lt;ref name="Graban"&gt;Tarez Samra Graban (2008). "Rhetoric, composition, and humor studies", pg. 425 ff. In ''Primer of Humor Research'', ed. Victor Raskin. Mouton de Gruyter: Berlin, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational-Neural Theory of Humor===

The Computer Model of a Sense of Humor theory was suggested by Suslov in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". I. General Algorithm. Biofizika SSSR 37, 318 (1992) [Biophysics 37, 242 (1992)]; https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2058.&lt;/ref&gt;
Investigation of the general scheme of information processing shows the possibility of a specific malfunction, conditioned by the necessity of a quick deletion from consciousness of a false version. This specific malfunction can be identified with a humorous effect on psychological grounds: it exactly corresponds to incongruity-resolution theory. However, an essentially new ingredient, the role of timing, is added to the well-known role of ambiguity. In biological systems, a sense of humor inevitably develops in the course of evolution, because its biological function consists of quickening the transmission of the processed information into consciousness and in a more effective use of brain resources. A realization of this algorithm in neural networks&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". II. Realization in Neural Networks. Biofizika SSSR 37, 325 (1992) [Biophysics {\bf 37}, 249 (1992)] https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2061.&lt;/ref&gt; justifies naturally Spencer's hypothesis on the mechanism of laughter: deletion of a false version corresponds to zeroing of some part of the neural network and excessive energy of neurons is thrown out to the motor cortex, arousing muscular contractions.

The theory treats on equal footing the humorous effect created by the linguistic means (verbal humor), as well as created visually (caricature, clown performance) or by tickling. The theory explains the natural differences in susceptibility of people to humor, absence of humorous effect from a trite joke, the role of intonation in telling jokes, nervous laughter, etc.
According to this theory, humor has a pure biological origin, while its social functions arose later. This conclusion corresponds to the known fact that monkeys (as pointed out by [[Charles Darwin]]) and even rats (as found recently) possess a sense of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J.|title=Beyond a Joke: From Animal Laughter to Human Joy?|journal=Science|date=2005|volume=308|issue=5718|pages=62–63|doi=10.1126/science.1112066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A practical realization of this algorithm needs extensive databases, whose creation in the automatic regime was suggested recently.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, How to Realize "a Sense of Humour" in Computers? https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3197.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontic-Epistemic Theory of Humor===

The Ontic-Epistemic Theory of Humor (OETC) proposed by P. Marteinson (2006) asserts that laughter is a reaction to a cognitive impasse, a momentary epistemological difficulty, in which the subject perceives that Social Being itself suddenly appears no longer to be real in any factual or normative sense. When this occurs material reality, which is always factually true, is the only percept remaining in the mind at such a moment of comic perception. This theory posits, as in Bergson, that human beings accept as ''real'' both normative immaterial percepts, such as social identity, and neological factual percepts, but also that the individual subject normally blends the two together in perception in order to live by the assumption they are equally real. The comic results from the perception that they are not. This same result arises in a number of paradigmatic cases: factual reality can be seen to conflict with and disprove social reality, which Marteinson calls Deculturation; alternatively, social reality can appear to contradict other elements of social reality, which he calls "Relativisation". Laughter, according to Marteinson, serves to reset and re-boot the faculty of social perception, which has been rendered non-functional by the comic situation: it anesthetizes the mind with its euphoria, and permits the forgetting of the comic stimulus, as well as the well-known function of communicating the humorous reaction to other members of society.&lt;ref&gt;P. Marteinson (2006) ''[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/french/as-sa/editors/origins.html On the Problem of the Comic]'', Legas Press, Ottawa, {{ISBN|978-1-894508-91-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{See also|Sexual selection in human evolution}}
Evolutionary psychologist [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] contends that, from an evolutionary perspective, humour would have had no survival value to early humans living in the savannas of Africa. He proposes that human characteristics like humor evolved by sexual selection. He argues that humour emerged as an indicator of other traits that were of survival value, such as human intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;2001, The Mating Mind, by Geoffrey Miller&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection of mistaken reasoning===
In 2011, three researchers, Hurley, Dennett and Adams, published a book that reviews previous theories of humor and many specific jokes.  They propose the theory that humor evolved because it strengthens the ability of the brain to find mistakes in active belief structures, that is, to detect mistaken reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Hurley, Matthew M., Dennet, Daniel C., and Adams, Reginald B. Jr. |title=Inside Jokes: Using Humor to Reverse-Engineer the Mind|publisher=The MIT Press|year= 2011|isbn=978-0-262-01582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is somewhat consistent with the sexual selection theory, because, as stated above, humor would be a reliable indicator of an important survival trait: the ability to detect mistaken reasoning.  However, the three researchers argue that humor is fundamentally important because it is the very mechanism that allows the human brain to excel at practical problem solving.  Thus, according to them, humor did have survival value even for early humans, because it enhanced the neural circuitry needed to survive.

===Misattribution theory===
[[Misattribution theory of humor|Misattribution]] is one theory of humor that describes an audience's inability to identify exactly why they find a [[joke]] to be funny.  The formal theory is attributed to Zillmann &amp; Bryant (1980) in their article, "Misattribution Theory of Tendentious Humor", published in ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.  They derived the critical concepts of the theory from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious]]'' (note: from a Freudian perspective, wit is separate from humor), originally published in 1905.

===Benign violation theory===
The benign violation theory (BVT) is developed by researchers [[Peter McGraw|A. Peter McGraw]] and Caleb Warren.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; The BVT integrates seemingly disparate theories of humor to predict that humor occurs when three conditions are satisfied: 1) something threatens one's sense of how the world "ought to be", 2) the threatening situation seems benign, and 3) a person sees both interpretations at the same time.

From an evolutionary perspective, humorous violations likely originated as apparent physical threats, like those present in play fighting and tickling. As humans evolved, the situations that elicit humor likely expanded from physical threats to other violations, including violations of personal dignity (e.g., slapstick, teasing), linguistic norms (e.g., puns, malapropisms), social norms (e.g., strange behaviors, risqué jokes), and even moral norms (e.g., disrespectful behaviors). The BVT suggests that anything that threatens one's sense of how the world "ought to be" will be humorous, so long as the threatening situation also seems benign.

There is also more than one way a violation can seem benign. McGraw and Warren tested three contexts in the domain of moral violations. A violation can seem benign if one norm suggests something is wrong but another salient norm suggests it is acceptable. A violation can also seem benign when one is psychologically distant from the violation or is only weakly committed to the violated norm.

For example, McGraw and Warren find that most consumers were disgusted when they read about a church raffling off a Hummer SUV to recruit new members. However, many consumers were simultaneously amused. Consistent with the BVT, people who attended church were less likely to be amused than people who did not. Churchgoers are more committed to the belief that churches are sacred and, consequently, were less likely to consider the church's behavior benign.

===Humor as defense mechanism===

According to [[George Eman Vaillant]]'s (1977) categorization, humor is level IV [[defense mechanism]]: overt expression of ideas and feelings (especially those that are unpleasant to focus on or too terrible to talk about) that gives pleasure to others. Humor, which explores the absurdity inherent in any event, enables someone to "call a spade a spade", while "wit" is a form of displacement (level 3). Wit refers to the serious or distressing in a humorous way, rather than disarming it; the thoughts remain distressing, but they are "skirted round" by witticism.

===Sense of humor, sense of seriousness===
One must have a sense of [[humor]] and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point.&lt;ref name=SRF&gt;{{cite news|title=Seriousness Redeemed by Frivolity: Ayckbourn's Intimate Exchanges|work=Modern Drama|volume=53|issue=4|year=2010|pages=447–470|last1=Dukore|first1=B. F.|doi=10.1353/mdr.2010.0026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yarwood|first1=D. L.|title=When Congress makes a joke: Congressional humor as serious and purposeful communication|journal=Humor|date=2001|volume=14|issue=4|pages=359–394|doi=10.1515/humr.2001.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information. Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, [[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]] in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.&lt;ref name=NSIH&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emerson|first1=J. P.|title=Negotiating the Serious Import of Humor|journal=Sociometry|date=1969|volume=32|issue=2|pages=169–181|doi=10.2307/2786261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphor and metonymy===
Tony Veale, who takes a more formalised computational approach than Koestler, has written on the role of [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]] in humour,&lt;ref&gt;Veale, Tony (2003): "Metaphor and Metonymy: The Cognitive Trump-Cards of Linguistic Humor" [http://afflatus.ucd.ie/Papers/iclc2003.pdf (Afflatus.uce.ie)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Veale|first1=T.|last2=Feyaerts|first2=K.|last3=Brône|first3=G.|title=The cognitive mechanisms of adversarial humor|journal=Humor|date=2006|volume=19|issue=3|pages=305–339|doi=10.1515/HUMOR.2006.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Veale|first1=T.|title=Incongruity in humor: Root cause or epiphenomenon?|journal=Humor|date=2004|volume=17|issue=4|pages=419–428|doi=10.1515/humr.2004.17.4.419}}&lt;/ref&gt; using inspiration from Koestler as well as from [[Dedre Gentner]]'s theory of structure-mapping, [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]]'s theory of [[conceptual metaphor]], and [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]] and [[Gilles Fauconnier]]'s theory of [[conceptual blending]].

===O'Shannon model of humor===
The O'Shannon model of humor (OMOH) was introduced by [[Dan O'Shannon]] in "What Are You Laughing At? A Comprehensive Guide to the Comedic Event", published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Are You Laughing At? A Comprehensive Guide to the Comedic Event|last=O'Shannon|first=Dan|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model integrates all the general branches of comedy into a unified framework. This framework consists of four main sections: ''context'', ''information'', ''aspects of awareness'', and ''enhancers/inhibitors''. Elements of context are in play as reception factors prior to the encounter with comedic information. This information will require a level of cognitive process to interpret, and contain a degree of incongruity (based on predictive likelihood). That degree may be high, or go as low as to be negligible. The information will be seen simultaneously through several aspects of awareness (the comedy’s internal reality, its external role as humor, its effect on its context, effect on other receivers, etc.). Any element from any of these sections may trigger enhancers / inhibitors (feelings of superiority, relief, aggression, identification, shock, etc.) which will affect the receiver’s ultimate response. The various interactions of the model allow for a wide range of comedy; for example, a joke needn’t rely on high levels of incongruity if it triggers feelings of superiority, aggression, relief, or identification. Also, high incongruity humor may trigger a visceral response, while well-constructed word-play with low incongruity might trigger a more appreciative response. Also included in the book: evolutionary theories that account for visceral and social laughter, and the phenomenon of comedic entropy.

=== Unnoticed fall-back to former behavior patterns ===
This model defines laughter as an acoustic signal to make individuals aware of an unnoticed fall-back to former behaviour patterns. To some extent it unifies superiority and incongruity theory. Ticklishness is also considered to have a defined relation to humor via the development of human bipedalism.&lt;ref&gt;Dramlitsch, T., 2018: "The Origin of Humor", {{ISBN|978-1720264637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bergson===
In ''[[Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic]]'', French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], renowned for his philosophical studies on materiality, memory, life and [[consciousness]], tries to determine the laws of the comic and to understand the fundamental causes of comic situations.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, Le Rire, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Rire._Essai_sur_la_signification_du_comique/Avant-propos ''Avant-Propos''] on Wikisource {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; His method consists in determining the causes of comic instead of analyzing its effects. He also deals with laughter in relation to human life, collective imagination and [[art]], to have a better knowledge of society.&lt;ref&gt;Bergson, Henri. ''Le Rire'', [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Rire._Essai_sur_la_signification_du_comique/Pr%C3%A9face "Préface"] on Wikisource {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the theories of the essay is that laughter, as a collective activity, has a social and moral role, in forcing people to eliminate their vices. It is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, as it condemns ludicrous and eccentric behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Bergson, Henri. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4352/4352-h/4352-h.htm ''Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic''], Chapter I (II) - online version on [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this essay, Bergson also asserts that there is a central cause that all comic situations are derived from: that of mechanism applied to life. The fundamental source of comic is the presence of inflexibility and rigidness in life. For Bergson, the essence of life is [[:wikt:movement|movement]], elasticity and [[flexibility (personality)|flexibility]], and every comic situation is due the presence of rigidity and inelasticity in life. Hence, for Bergson the source of the comic is not [[ugliness]] but rigidity.&lt;ref&gt;Bergson, ''Laughter'', Chapter I (III)&lt;/ref&gt; All the examples taken by Bergson (such as a man falling in the street, one person's imitation of another, the automatic application of conventions and rules, absent-mindedness, repetitive gestures of a speaker, the resemblance between two faces) are comic situations because they give the impression that life is subject to rigidity, automatism and mechanism.

Bergson closes by noting that most comic situations are not laughable because they are part of collective habits.&lt;ref&gt;Bergson, ''Laughter'', Chapter I (V)&lt;/ref&gt; He defines laughter as an intellectual activity that requires an immediate approach to a comic situation, detached from any form of [[emotion]] or [[sensibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergson, ''Laughter'', Chapter I (I)&lt;/ref&gt; A situation is laughable when the attention and the [[imagination]] are focused on the resistance and rigidity of the body. Thus somebody is laughable when he or she gives the impression of being a thing or a machine.

In business, '''training simulation''' is a virtual medium through which various types of skills can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, C. and Sawyer, J. (1999). ''Exploring the Learning from an Enterprise Simulation, Journal of Management Development''&lt;/ref&gt; Training simulations can be used in a variety of genres; however they are most commonly&lt;ref&gt;Henfrey, Richard (1989). ''"Executive" simulation'', Executive Development, Vol. 3 Iss: 2&lt;/ref&gt; used in corporate situations to improve [[business]] awareness and [[management]] skills. They are also common in academic environments as an integrated part of a business or management course.

The word [[simulation]] implies an imitation of a real-life process, usually via a computer or other technological device, in order to provide a [[lifelike experience]]. This has proven to be a reliable and successful method of training in thousands of industries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Ellet, Bill (1997). ''TMR Shortlist of Business Simulations'', Training Media Review Publications&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used both to allow specialization in a certain area, and to educate individuals in the workings of the sectors as a whole, making training simulations versatile. Training simulations are not just games;&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). ''Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming''. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) ''The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning''&lt;/ref&gt; their aim is to educate and inform in an exciting and memorable way, rather than purely to entertain.

==Purpose==

Companies across the world regularly use simulations as a tool to teach employees.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Elizabeth, O’Loughlin, Andrew and McFadzean, Elspeth (2005). ''[http://www.pogc.ir/portals/0/maghalat/890706-2.pdf Corporate Entrepreneurship and Innovation Part 2: A Role- and Process-based Approach]'', European Journal of Innovation Management, Vol. 8 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; With the enormous range of simulation-based activities available, it is unsurprising that the specific aims of the sessions vary widely. Some simulations are focused on [[decision making|making decisions]] in a particular area of the business, such as personnel or [[product design]], and these are called ''Functional Simulations''. Others give a general overview of a company and give experience of making executive management decisions, and are called ''Total Enterprise Simulations''.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990).'' [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.1754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations].'' In Gentry (ed.) ''Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning''&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, this classification has become somewhat impractical, as increasing numbers of training simulations are involving both elements, and combining both an overall view of the industry with some decisions relating to specific sectors.

Training Simulations normally form part of a program designed to educate employees or students about the skills needed to operate a business, as well as persuade them to "[[think outside the box]]" and see the bigger picture.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Graham A. ''Home and Away: Application of the Executive Simulation for Education and Training Purposes in Dundee and Malaysia''&lt;/ref&gt; This can make for a better organized, more fluid system in which all employees understand their part in making the company successful.


 
Although the most common use for training simulations is in a [[corporate]] setting,&lt;ref&gt;Declan Doyle, F. William Brown, (2000).

''Using Management Games''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that ‘beating the game’ should not be a primary aim for anyone taking part in a simulation; the focus should be directed towards everyone gaining some useful and relevant knowledge that they can take away and use in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Michael J. R. and Reddy, Peter (2010). ''[http://eprints.aston.ac.uk/20147/1/Butler__Reddy_JEIT_-_Developing_Critical_Understanding_through_EBL_and_Storytelling.pdf Developing Critical Understanding in HRM Students: Using Innovative Teaching Methods to Encourage Deep Approaches to Study]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 34 Iss: 8/9&lt;/ref&gt; If the simulation does have a competitive element, it is to motivate and inspire, rather than encourage any malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;Hynes, Briga, Costin, Yvonne and Birdthistle, Naomi (2011). ''Practice-based Learning in Entrepreneurship Education: A Means of Connecting Knowledge Producers and Users''. Higher Education, Skills and Work-based Learning, Vol. 1 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt; Some training activities are non-competitive to avoid this, however many noted experts in the field state that the rivalry between teams or individuals improves the learning experience and adds a sense of fun and drama into the simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, D. J. (1997). ''Group Competitiveness and Cohesion in a Business Simulation''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 28 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important when working with young people such as students, as they often require an extra boost to keep them entertained, especially when a simulation is run over an extended period.

==Development==

The concept of training employees to have a wider perspective on their position within the workplace has been around for hundreds of years,&lt;ref&gt;Keys, Bernard and Wolfe, Joseph (1990). ''The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research''. Journal of Management, Vol. 16, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; but it is only relatively recently that the idea of creating a simulated environment for trainees to test their abilities and skills has been developed. The first commercially available training simulation was in 1956, and was called ''The Top Management Decision Game'', and was created by the [[American Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). ''Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the market has expanded hugely, with thousands of simulations available based upon hundreds of different industries. Initially simple with just a few choices to make, some simulations have become extremely complex with many different interlinking decisions. When training simulations were first used, they involved paper forms that were filled in by the participants and then compared by the organizer of the exercise. Nowadays, nearly all simulations are [[computer]] based,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, John M. (2007). ''Business Simulations - Do They Have a Place in Training?''&lt;/ref&gt; and involve multi-stage algorithms that calculate performance based on the decisions entered.&lt;ref&gt;Fripp, John (1997). ''A Future for Business Simulations?'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 21 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Most simulations are based around a real [[industry]], and hence they use real data to be as accurate as possible and to provide a realistic experience. However, some remain generic and do not model a particular industry, although these tend to be more useful for younger players or those with absolutely no business knowledge.

==Integrated==

Most corporations and academic courses that contain a training simulation integrate it into an existing or completely new training programme.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (1987). ''A Survey of the Use of Business Games in Academia and Business''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 18 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to get the maximum value from the experience, as well as review the sessions in order to improve them for future use. The structure of a training session would normally be as follows:

* '''Introduction:''' the organizer of the program (plus sometimes a specialist in the training simulation) will meet the participants and give them a brief explanation of the purposes behind the training and what they should hope to achieve.
* '''Lectures:''' sometimes the trainees will also receive one or more lectures around the topics that the simulation will be based on, in order to give them an idea of the type of skills they will need. This is especially important within academia, when the students will often be examined on this section after the event.
* '''The simulation:''' the simulation will then be played, allowing newly acquired knowledge to be tested and skills practiced. A positive atmosphere is vital here to maintain enthusiasm.
* '''Evaluation:''' once the simulation has been completed, it is important to summarize what has been learnt and the effectiveness of the training. Presenting results to others may provide a means of internal assessment, as well as showcasing the players’ achievements.

This integrated [[training]] will allow everyone taking part in the simulation to get the maximum experience possible, as well as being entertaining, exciting and giving them a new perspective on the business world. Many companies that specialize in training simulations also offer to create a special integrated plan unique to the client,&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler, I (2005). ''[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8bc/e727abf8da27f3dc4497b00499129fd31d78.pdf Development of an asset management strategy for a network utility company: Lessons from a dynamic business simulation approach]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 36 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to make the process as streamlined and efficient as possible.

==Benefits==

Since training simulations are available based on such a wide range of different industries, and with thousands of different aims and objectives, it is difficult to outline a specific skill-set that will be improved by taking part in a training simulation. However, skills that good training simulations should build on include:

* '''Business awareness''' – before participating in the training programme, many players will have little idea of how to run a business or what it involves. Simulations allow them to temporarily have control over a virtual company, to see whether their decisions lead them to success or failure!&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Natalia, Escudero, Anna, Barahona, Juan and Leitao, Fernando (2009). ''[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090590910950578 The Effect of Entrepreneurship Education Programmes on Satisfaction with Innovation, Behaviour and Performance]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 33 Iss: 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Time management and organization''' – most simulations contain timed sessions, which will test the candidates’ skill in submitting decisions within the allotted time slot.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Lynn, Marcia and Sigelman, Lee (1991). ''Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; This is an excellent skill for any employee or graduate.
* '''Team coordination''' – the majority of training simulations involve working in groups or teams of people;&lt;ref&gt;Wellington, W. J. and Faria, A. J. (1992). ''An Examination on the Effect of Team Cohesion, Player Attitude and Performance Expectations on Simulation Performance Results''&lt;/ref&gt; improving the abilities to communicate effectively, delegate tasks and diplomatically resolve any situations.
* '''Problem solving''' – simulations will often present tricky circumstances that must be thought through logically to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (2001). ''[http://www.coulthard.com/library/Files/faria_2001_thechangingnatureofbusinesssimulationgamingresearch.pdf The Changing Nature of Business Simulation/Gaming Research: A Brief History]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 32 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Successful resolution of these shows good management skills.
 
If every participant improves in these four key skill areas, the training programme will be a success, and any business should notice an improvement in efficiency and motivation, and students will be inspired and animated.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Simulation Means Better Senior Managers at Heinz'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 23 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Indian name|Ramachandran|Subramanian}}

'''Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran''' (born 10 August 1951) is a [[neuroscientist]] known primarily for his work in the fields of [[behavioral neurology]] and visual [[psychophysics]]. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Neurosciences at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. Ramachandran is the author of several books that have garnered widespread public interest. These include ''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'' (1998), "A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness" (2004) and ''The Tell-Tale Brain'' (2010).

Ramachandran has achieved both professional and popular recognition. He has published papers on a wide variety of topics in neuroscience. His  books, interviews, and lectures have helped build public interest in contemporary neuroscience. In 2011, [[Time Magazine|''Time'']] listed him as one of "the most influential people in the world" on the "Time 100 list".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2066367_2066369_2066125,00.html|title=The 2011 TIME 100 - TIME|last=Insel|first=Thomas|date=2011-04-21|work=Time|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Ramachandran (in accordance with some [[Surnames by country#India|Tamil family name]] traditions, the town of his family's origin, Vilayanur, is placed first) was born in 1951 in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Anthony |title=VS Ramachandran: The Marco Polo of neuroscience |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jan/30/observer-profile-vs-ramachandran |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2014 |publisher=guardian.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/11/brain-games|title=Brain Games|first=John|last=Colapinto|date=4 May 2009|publisher=|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, V.

He then spent two years at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as a research fellow working with [[Jack Pettigrew]].  He was appointed Assistant Professor of Psychology at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1983, and has been a full professor there since 1998.

==Scientific career==

Ramachandran's early research was on human visual perception using psychophysical methods to draw clear inferences about the brain mechanisms underlying visual processing. In the early 1990s Ramachandran began to focus on neurological syndromes such as [[phantom limb]]s, [[body integrity identity disorder]] and the [[Capgras delusion]]. He has also contributed to the understanding of [[synesthesia]]&lt;ref name="Colapinto" /&gt; and is known for inventing the [[mirror box]]. 

Ramachandran is noted for his use of experimental methods that make relatively little use of complex technologies such as [[neuroimaging]]. Despite the apparent simplicity of his approach, he has generated many new ideas about the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jan/30/observer-profile-vs-ramachandran VS Ramachandran: The Marco Polo of neuroscience], [[The Observer]], 29 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has encountered skepticism about some of his theories.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Peter, Book Review, Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Vol. 17, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has responded that "I have—for better or worse—roamed the whole landscape of visual perception, stereopsis, phantom limbs, denial of paralysis, Capgras syndrome, synaesthesia, and many others."&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran,V.S. Author Response, Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Vol. 17, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to his academic research Ramachanran has served as a consultant in areas such as forensic psychology and the neuroscience of weight reduction. In 2007, Ramachandran served as an [[expert witness]] on [[pseudocyesis]] (false pregnancy) at the trial of [[Lisa M. Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;AP,NBC website,Crime and Courts,10/17/2007[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21351116/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/doctor-cites-mental-illness-fetus-theft-suspect/#.W7EuSWhKi01]&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran is currently serving as a consultant to a company (Modius) that is developing weight reduction technology that relies on electrically stimulating parts of the brain that control weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach,Brad,Modius Intends To Buck The Trend Of Weight Loss Solutions With Data-Based Success And FDA Approval,Forbes,Mar 16, 2018,[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradauerbach/2018/03/16/modius-intends-to-buck-the-trend-of-weight-loss-solutions-with-data-based-success-and-fda-approval/#b1a1ccc70bd4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandran is the director of a research group at the University of California, San Diego, known as the Center for Brain and Cognition.&lt;ref name="cbc.ucsd.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbc.ucsd.edu/research.html|title=The Center for Brain and Cognition - Research|website=cbc.ucsd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,912832862001_2066607,00.html|title=V.S.

===Theories and research===

====Phantom limbs====
{{main|Phantom limb}}
When an arm or leg is amputated, patients often continue to feel vividly the presence of the missing limb as a "phantom limb" (an average of 80%). Building on earlier work by [[Ronald Melzack]] (McGill University) and Timothy Pons (NIMH), Ramachandran theorized that there was a link between the phenomenon of phantom limbs and [[neural plasticity]] in the adult [[human brain]]. In 1993, working with T.T. Yang who was conducting [[magnetoencephalography|MEG]] research at the Scripps Research Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/tyang.html Yang, UCSD Faculty web page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331122737/http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/tyang.html |date=31 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran demonstrated that there had been measurable changes in the somatosensory cortex of a patient who had undergone an arm amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-199402000-00010 |pmid=8199341 |title=Noninvasive detection of cerebral plasticity in adult human somatosensory cortex |journal=NeuroReport |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=701–4 |year=1994 |last1=Yang |first1=T.

====Mirror visual feedback / Mirror Therapy====
{{main|Mirror box}}
[[File:Dr. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and psychology student Matthew Marradi holding the original Mirror Box.jpg|thumb|Ramachandran standing next to the original [[mirror box]]]]
Ramachandran is credited with the invention of the mirror box and the introduction of mirror visual feedback (mirror therapy) as a treatment for phantom limb paralysis. Ramachandran found that in some cases restoring movement to a paralyzed phantom limb reduced pain as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0058 |pmid=8637922 |title=Synaesthesia in Phantom Limbs Induced with Mirrors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=263 |issue=1369 |pages=377–86 |year=1996 |last1=Ramachandran |first1=V. S |last2=Rogers-Ramachandran |first2=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic reviews of the research literature on mirror therapy (MT) have arrived at conflicting conclusions about the effectiveness of MT. A 2014 review found that MT can exert a strong influence on the motor network, mainly through increased cognitive penetration in action control.&lt;ref&gt;Deconinck,Smorenburg,Benham,Ledebt,Feltham,Savelsbergh,Reflections on mirror therapy: a systematic review of the effect of mirror visual feedback on the brain,Neurorehabil Neural Repair,2015,May29(4),349-61[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25160567]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2016 review concluded that the level of evidence is insufficient to recommend MT as a first intention treatment for phantom limb pain.&lt;ref&gt;Barbin,Seethaa,Casillasc,Paysantd,Pérennou,Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine,Volume 59, Issue 4, September 2016,Pages270-275&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Neural cross-wiring: synesthesia====
[[File:synaesthesiatest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Synesthetes who experience color when viewing different symbols may quickly identify the presence of the "triangle" in the left-hand image.]]
{{main|Synesthesia}}
Ramachandran was one of the first scientists to theorize that grapheme-color synesthesia arises from a cross-activation between brain regions.&lt;ref name="ramachandran2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramachandran VS, Hubbard EM|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=3–34 |year=2001 |month= |pmid= |doi= |url=http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/Synaesthesia%20-%20JCS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15797557"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.02.008 |pmid=15797557 |title=Individual Differences among Grapheme-Color Synesthetes: Brain-Behavior Correlations |journal=Neuron |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=975–85 |year=2005 |last1=Hubbard |first1=Edward M |last2=Arman |first2=A. Cyrus |last3=Ramachandran |first3=Vilayanur S |last4=Boynton |first4=Geoffrey M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran and his graduate student, Ed Hubbard, conducted research with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] that found increased activity in [[Visual cortex#V4|the color recognition areas of the brain]] in synesthetes compared to non-synesthetes.&lt;ref name="pmid15797557" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16269367"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.012 |pmid=16269367 |title=Neurocognitive Mechanisms of Synesthesia |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=509–20 |year=2005 |last1=Hubbard |first1=Edward M |last2=Ramachandran |first2=V.S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ramachandran has speculated that conceptual metaphors may have a neurological basis in cortical cross-activation, as well. However,the neurological basis of synesthesia is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;Hupel,Jean-Michel,Dojat,Michel,A critical review of the neuroimaging literature on synesthesia,Frontiers In Human Neuroscience,2015,9,103,Published online 2015 Mar 3 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379872/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandran's theories about the role of mirror neurons have attracted a great deal of discussion and debate.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett,Christian, A Calm Look At The Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience -- Mirror Neurons,Wired,Science, 12,13,2013[https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Costandi,Mo,Reflecting on mirror neurons,Neurophilosophy,The Guardian,23 August 2013[https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2013/aug/23/mirror-neurons]&lt;/ref&gt; (Mirror neurons were first reported in a paper published in 1992 by a team of researchers led by [[Giacomo Rizzolatti]] at the [[University of Parma]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-2002-3 |pmid=19760408 |title=Mirror neurons: From discovery to autism |journal=Experimental Brain Research |volume=200 |issue=3–4 |pages=223–37 |year=2009 |last1=Rizzolatti |first1=Giacomo |last2=Fabbri-Destro |first2=Maddalena }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has speculated that research into the role of mirror neurons will help explain a variety of human mental capacities such as empathy, imitation learning, and the evolution of language. In 2000, Ramachandran made a prediction that "mirror neurons will do for psychology what DNA did for biology: they will provide a unifying framework and help explain a host of mental abilities that have hitherto remained mysterious and inaccessible to experiments."&lt;ref name=Jarrett2012PT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-myths/201212/mirror-neurons-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience |title=Mirror Neurons: The Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience? |first=Christian |last=Jarrett |work=Psychology Today |date=10 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, Making Sense of the Brain's Mysteries, American Scientist, On-line Book Review, July–August, 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111014003257/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/making-sense-of-the-brains-mysteries]&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the past ten years, many of the exciting theories about mirror neurons have not held up under scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor,John,Mirror Neurons After a Quarter Century: New light, new cracks,Science In The News (web article)Harvard University,Aug 29,2016[http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/mirror-neurons-quarter-century-new-light-new-cracks/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===="Broken Mirrors" theory of autism====
{{main|Autism#Pathophysiology|l1=Autism: Pathophysiology}}
In 1999, Ramachandran, in collaboration with then post-doctoral fellow Eric Altschuler and colleague Jaime Pineda, hypothesized that a loss of [[mirror neurons]] might be the key deficit that explains many of the symptoms and signs of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=E.L. Altschuler, A. Vankov, E.M. Hubbard, E. Roberts, V.S. Ramachandran and J.A. Pineda |year=2000 |title=Mu wave blocking by observer of movement and its possible use as a tool to study theory of other minds |booktitle=30th Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience |publisher=Society for Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2006 Ramachandran and his colleagues at UC San Diego published a number of articles in support of this theory, which became known as the "Broken Mirrors" theory of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2005.01.014 |pmid=15993757 |title=EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders |journal=Cognitive Brain Research |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=190–8 |year=2005 |last1=Oberman |first1=Lindsay M |last2=Hubbard |first2=Edward M |last3=McCleery |first3=Joseph P |last4=Altschuler |first4=Eric L |last5=Ramachandran |first5=Vilayanur S |last6=Pineda |first6=Jaime A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1106-62 |pmid=17076085 |title=Broken Mirrors: A Theory of Autism |journal=Scientific American |volume=295 |issue=5 |pages=62–9 |year=2006 |last1=Ramachandran |first1=Vilayanur S |last2=Oberman |first2=Lindsay M |bibcode=2006SciAm.295e..62R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.310 |pmid=17338602 |title=The simulating social mind: The role of the mirror neuron system and simulation in the social and communicative deficits of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |issue=2 |pages=310–27 |year=2007 |last1=Oberman |first1=Lindsay M |last2=Ramachandran |first2=Vilayanur S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran and his colleagues did not measure mirror neuron activity directly; rather they demonstrated that children with ASD showed abnormal EEG responses (known as [[Mu wave]] suppression) when they observed the activities of other people. Ramachandran's "broken mirrors hypothesis" explanation for autism remains controversial.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Jarrett,A Calm Look at the Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience - Mirror Neurons,Wired,13 December 2013,[https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fan,Y.T.;Decety,J.;Yang,C.Y.;Liu,J.L.; Cheng,Y, "Unbroken mirror neurons in autism spectrum disorders",Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,26 May 2010 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02269.x/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Xenomelia (Apotemnophilia)====
{{main|Body Identity Integrity Disorder}}
In 2008, Ramachandran, along with David Brang and Paul McGeoch, published the first paper to theorize that [[apotemnophilia]] is a neurological disorder caused by damage to the right [[parietal lobe]] of the brain.&lt;ref name="brang2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e32830abc4d |pmid=18695512 |title=Apotemnophilia: A neurological disorder |journal=NeuroReport |volume=19 |issue=13 |pages=1305–6 |year=2008 |last1=Brang |first1=David |last2=McGeoch |first2=Paul D |last3=Ramachandran |first3=Vilayanur S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rare disorder, in which a person desires the amputation of a limb, was first identified by [[John Money]] in 1977. Building on medical case studies that linked brain damage to syndromes such as [[somatoparaphrenia]] (lack of limb ownership) the authors speculated that the desire for amputation could be related to changes in the right parietal lobe. In 2011 McGeoch, Brang and Ramachandran reported a functional imaging experiment involving four subjects who desired lower limb amputations. MEG scans demonstrated that their right superior parietal lobules were significantly less active in response to tactile stimulation of a limb that the subjects wished to have amputated, as compared to age/sex matched controls. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp-2011-300224 |pmid=21693632 |title=Xenomelia: A new right parietal lobe syndrome |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=1314–9 |year=2011 |last1=McGeoch |first1=P. D |last2=Brang |first2=D |last3=Song |first3=T |last4=Lee |first4=R. R |last5=Huang |first5=M |last6=Ramachandran |first6=V. S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors introduced the word "Xenomelia" to describe this syndrome, which is derived from the Greek for "foreign" and "limb".

As of 2014, there was no medical consensus as to the cause of this condition.&lt;ref&gt;Sedda,Anna,Bottini,Gabriella, Apotemnophilia, body integrity identity disorder or xenomelia?

==Awards and honors==

Ramachandran was elected to a visiting fellowship at [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford]] (1998–1999). In addition, he was a Hilgard visiting professor at [[Stanford University]] in 2005. He has received honorary doctorates from Connecticut College (2001) and the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2006.02.024 |title=EEG evidence for mirror neuron activity during the observation of human and robot actions: Toward an analysis of the human qualities of interactive robots |journal=Neurocomputing |volume=70 |issue=13–15 |pages=2194–203 |year=2007 |last1=Oberman |first1=Lindsay M |last2=McCleery |first2=Joseph P |last3=Ramachandran |first3=Vilayanur S |last4=Pineda |first4=Jaime A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran received the annual [[Ramon y Cajal]] award (2004) from the International Neuropsychiatric Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inawebsite.org/ramon-y-cajal-award|title=International Neuropsychiatric Associatio|website=International Neuropsychiatric Associatio}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ariëns Kappers Medal]] from the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences]] for his contributions to Neuroscience (1999).

'''Zemiology''' is the study of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ζημία ''zēmía'', meaning "[[harm]]".&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004"&gt;Hillyard, P. (with C. Pantazis, S. Tombs and D. Gordon) (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
It originated as a [[critique]] of [[criminology]] and the notion of [[crime]]. In contrast with "individual-based harms" such as [[theft]], the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by [[nation state]]s and [[Corporation|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwendinger, H. and Schwendinger, J. (1970) "Defenders of order or guardians of human rights" ''Issues in Criminology''&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxists]] and [[Feminism|feminists]] who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely [[Criminalization|criminalised]] such as [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] misselling, [[poverty]] and [[unemployment]].&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Issue of Crime, Law and Social Change (2007, vol 48: 1-2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zemiological critique of criminology and crime==
Hillyard and Tombs outline a number of criticisms of criminology and crime:&lt;ref&gt;see chap 2 (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Crime has no [[Ontology|ontological]] reality" – Crime is a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] and is based on social judgements. However, there are no central properties that pertain to the notion of crime; therefore, what is a crime will vary across time and space.
* "Criminology perpetuates the myth of crime" – Criminology is based upon the notion of crime, which fails to adequately address the social construction of the concept. Therefore, criminology's continued use of the notion within its frame of analysis perpetuates the myth that crimes are distinct acts that may be understood as separate social phenomena.
* "Crime consists of many petty events" – In a large proportion of reported crimes, the harms endured by victims, if there are any, are minimal.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2015}} Hence Hillyard and Tombs argue that "the definitions of crime in the [[criminal law]] do not reflect the only or the most dangerous of antisocial behaviours."
* "Crime excludes many serious harms" – Many events and incidents which cause serious harm are either not part of the criminal law or, if they could be dealt with by it, are either ignored or handled without resort to it. The undue attention given to events which are defined as crimes distracts attention from more serious harm (such as [[pollution]] or poverty).
* {{Double single}}Crime control' is ineffective" – Hillyard and Tombs have argued that the methods and approach to crime control have patently failed. They believe the criminal justice system is unsuccessful in fulfilling its aims and in reforming criminal offenders. It appears that the criminal justice system sees there is only one solution to crime control, and that is a [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]; however, it is questionable whether this actually resolves certain crimes in society.
* {{Double single}}Crime' gives legitimacy to the expansion of crime control" – Since the early 1990s, governments have emphasised crime control as a key concern, and crime control has increased faster than any other area of public expenditure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Consequently, security firms have increasingly sought to provide services to the burgeoning penal state. It is argued that these private interests have played a key part in the expansion of prison, as means to deal with social problems.
* "Contrasting 'crimes{{Single double}} – The criminal law uses different tests to determine whether a crime has been committed. The principal test is the concept of ''[[mens rea]]'' – the guilty mind – which applies to the individual but not exclusively. However, these tests are not objective and often rely on subjective judgements about an individual's actions. ''Mens rea'' has to be judged by proxy, examining both a person's words and deeds. This becomes an even more complex task when applying the test an organisation, particularly as the harms caused by organisations result from the actions or inactions of a number of individuals and omission rather than intent. Therefore, harms caused by organisations are rarely criminalised.
* "Criminalisation and punishment inflict pain" – The criminal justice system has many stages which inflict pain in a discrete manner: defining, classifying, broadcasting, disposing and punishing the offender. Furthermore, these processes create wider social problems which bear no or little relationship to the initial crime and the original pain that was caused. For example, they may lead to loss of jobs, family problems or [[ostracism]].

==Harms of the criminal justice system==
Hillyard and Tombs argue that the criminal justice system fails to protect people from criminal harms whilst inflicting serious harms on those people who travel through the system. These harms often outweigh the harm caused by the original crime. However, current criminal justice policy within countries like the UK continues to champion the use of prison as a means to deal with social problems. In 2002, the UK prison population was 80,144. The population rate, per hundred thousand of national population, for England and Wales was 139. These figures are high compared to the rest of Europe in terms of overall numbers; however, looking at prison population rate, they are similar to many other countries in Europe. Italy, Spain, France, Romania and Belarus each had prison populations of around 50,000 in 2001–2002. Only Poland and the Ukraine had prison populations higher than that of the UK, at 82,173 and 198,885 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005045/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These rising prison numbers however do not necessarily reflect a rise in crime. Overall, since 1995 there has been a reduction in total crime. The [[British Crime Survey]] has shown that the overall crime experienced by households has declined by 42% which is the equivalent to eight million fewer crimes. More specifically, domestic burglary has fallen by 59%, vehicle theft has decreased by 61% and violent crimes have experienced a reduction of 41%. According to these figures it appears that the reason for the growth in the prison population is not due to a rise in crime.
In spite of the faith demonstrated by politicians in the criminal justice system, it would appear{{Says who|date=April 2015}} that the criminal justice system seems to fail in its own terms. The probability of a criminal re-offending is determined by external factors including having a stable family life, a home and a job. All of these are arguably weakened by a prison sentence. The [[Social Exclusion Task Force|Social Exclusion Unit]] has demonstrated that prison fails to rehabilitate on a dramatic scale with two thirds of prisoners re-offending within 2 years of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifechangeuk.com/PDF%5CSEU%20-%20Reducing%20re-offending%20by%20ex-prisoners.pdf www.lifechangeuk.com: reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a prison place costs £37,000 per annum.

=== Relation of welfare benefits to prison population ===

Concern has been expressed{{By whom|date=April 2015}} that the prison is being used as a mechanism to deal with social problems as spending on welfare benefits and services has decreased. Downes and Hansen argue that a country's welfare spending and prison population are inversely related, meaning that a country with high spending on welfare has a lower prison population and vice versa. Portugal, for example, has 147 prisoners per 100,000 people but spend only 18.2% of their GDP on welfare. This is quite a contrast to Scandinavian states, such as Sweden, whose prison population is 60 prisoners per 100,000 people as they spend 31% of GDP on welfare. During the 1990s the UK, whose spending on welfare is 20.8% GDP, saw an increase of 40% in the number of custodial sentences passed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/opus304.html|title=Welfare and punishment. The relationship between welfare spending and imprisonment|work=crimeandjustice.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is arguably reflected in the composition of the UK's prison population. For example, almost half of the prison population in Britain has been diagnosed with 3 or more mental disorders.&lt;ref name="revdoor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|title=Documents - Revolving Doors Agency|work=revolving-doors.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107032201/http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those prisoners diagnosed with a mental health problem: 50% of these prisoners are not registered with a GP; 42% of men with a psychotic disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 79% of men with a personality disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 46% have been arrested having never received any benefits despite their disorder; over a third are sleeping rough and over two thirds are not in education or training.&lt;ref name="revdoor"/&gt;

==Broadening perceptions of harm==
=== Physical harm ===

The zemiological or social harm approach attempts to broaden public and sociological focus to [[wikt:vicissitude#Noun|vicissitudes]] of daily life in capitalist society; some of these harms, they argue, are more harmful than those caused by crime. Approximately 1,000 people a year are murdered in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk: crime 0607 Summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324214809/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |date=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of events that cause large amounts of physical harm and even death, which are rarely considered crime or criminalised. In the UK there are around 40,000 serious road accidents in the UK every year. This is equivalent to a jumbo jet crashing every month. In 2002 3,431 people were killed on Britain’s roads and 35,976 seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series7/cars.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out - Car Crash|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 81,562 cases of food poisoning were reported and the majority of these cases are believed to have been contracted in food prepared outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2002/feb/campaign www.food.gov.uk campaign]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, The [[Labour Force Survey]] found that 228 people were killed while working due to a work-related incident and 2.2 million people with illnesses in the UK believed their condition was made worse by their past or current job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |title=www.hse.gov.uk |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110181600/http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |archive-date=2014-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing phenomenon affecting workers' health is stress. A report issued by the British [[Health and Safety Executive]] found that 16% of workers were working over 60 hours a week.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Similarly, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] found that 19% of men visited doctors for stress related problems, with that figure rising to 23% in men over 40. Also, the [[Trade Union Congress]] found 10% of work-based personal injury cases were stress-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazards.org/workedtodeath/dropdead.pdf www.hazards.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department of Health]] there were 3500 deaths occurring from the effects of [[Sulfur dioxide#Safety|sulphur dioxide]] and 8100 deaths were caused due to [[Particulate#Health effects|particulate matter]] in the air in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{cite web|url=http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm#results |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174942/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homeowners ===

Equally, the financial costs theft and burglary are outweighed when one considers wider financial harms. For example, thousands of homeowners have been sold [[endowment mortgage]]s without any likely means of repaying them. More than 3 million homeowners face the likelihood that their endowment policy, when it matures, will be worth too little to pay off the mortgage. 60% of endowment mortgages are not on track to cover the original debt and 39,000 complainants looking to receive approximately £126 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/oct/27/endowments.observercashsection|title=Endowed with a sense of fear|author=Helen Monks|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today{{When|date=April 2015}} in Britain 9.5 million people cannot afford adequate housing conditions, 8 million cannot afford one or more essential good, 7.5 million people do not have enough money to attend social activities and 4 million do not receive proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/poverty/pse/sum_find.htm|title=1999 PSE - Summary Findings|work=bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to social harms ==

Whilst the UK and other liberal democracies spend large resources on their respective criminal justice systems, other regulatory and policy responses remain less well funded considering the extent and the serious nature of the harms they seek to prevent. This is illustrated through the following case examples.

=== Regulating the minimum wage ===

The minimum wage was introduced in 1998 to combat the problem of in-work poverty and inequality. The act established for the first time in the UK a minimum hourly rate of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led [[Industrial Tribunal]] claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams ([[Inland Revenue]]). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’,&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34"&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34),&lt;/ref&gt; which include: enforcement order, penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The enforcement order requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.

&lt;ref&gt;Low Pay Commission http://www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/rep_a_p_index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated by the [[Low Pay Commission]] that 146,000–219,000 workers are not receiving the wage they are legally entitled too. It has been suggested that the reasons for relate to the limited resources available to the Inland Revenue Enforcement Teams.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34)&lt;/ref&gt; The Inland Revenue Enforcement Team consists of 16 compliance teams, each with 3 to 8 officers, based in fourteen towns and cities throughout the UK. In 1999 there were 115 Inspectors which meant that a workplace could expect to be inspected once every 30 years.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34" /&gt;

=== Policy responses to inequality ===

Inequality has grown in countries like the UK since the beginning of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is argued that this growth in inequality has had a series of deleterious and harmful effects. These include children’s life chances, mental health, physical health, crime and social well being.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009"&gt;Wilkinson RG, Pickett KE. (2009) ''The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better''. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; Using the example of physical, numerous studies have demonstrated that those from lower socio economic classes have lower life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009" /&gt; For instance a recent{{When|date=April 2015}} research study that investigated differences in health in the 678 electoral wards of the northern region of England found that death rates were four times as high in the poorest 10 per cent of wards as they were in the richest 10 per cent. In the 1980s more and more households fell into poverty and by the early 1990s one in three children lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008"&gt;Toynbee P &amp; Walker D (2008) Unjust rewards. London: Granta&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequality is a harm that is perceived{{By whom|date=April 2015}} as an inherent and largely unpreventable feature of our society. Yet a number of academics attribute the current levels of inequality in the UK to a series of policy decisions that have been made over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"&gt;Gordon, D. &amp;  Pantazis, C. (1997) Breadline Britain in the 1990s. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the growing levels of inequality are numerous. The poorest groups in society have seen their income and wealth affected by developments such as the decreasing value of benefits in real terms, the deregulation of labour markets etc., whilst the rich have seen their wealth grow primarily as a result of the changes made in the UK tax system since 1979.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"/&gt; In particular, the top rate of income tax was cut by the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] in the first post-1979 election budget from 83% to 60%. Then it was cut to 40%. Moreover, tax havens have increased and become common place which has enabled wealthy individuals and companies to avoid taxation regimes. In fact, tax consultants Grant Thornton estimated that the UK’s 54 billionaires paid income tax of only £14.7 million in 2006. At least 32 paid no income tax at all. In contrast, according to the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], £3.4 billion a year would lift enough families out of poverty to hit [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour’s]] pledge of halving child poverty by 2010.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article658376.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating environmental harm ===

It is estimated that 24,000 lives are prematurely ended due to the effects of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513065011/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/ |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these health consequences are estimated to cost the UK £29,000 per life year lost in "good" health, £15,000 per life year lost in "poor" health and £1,900–£2,000 per hospital admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|title=Defra UK-AIR - air pollution information for the UK|work=airquality.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218064758/http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|archive-date=18 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the harm caused by air pollution the UK has a poor record in responding to air pollution. The [[European Union#Environment|European Union]] is currently{{When|date=April 2015}} considering prosecuting the British government for breaching air pollution laws. Air pollution near in a number of locations has been recorded at twice the UN's [[World Health Organization]] maximum recommended level, which has consequently infringed EU air quality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/02/air-pollution-laws-britain-eu|title=UK faces court case over air pollution breaches|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Environment Agency, the UK's principal environmental regulator, has what some{{Who|date=April 2015}} may consider to be a poor record of prosecuting infringements of environmental standards. For example, there were 29,627 "substantiated" pollution incidents in 2003, of which 1337 were considered serious by the agency. However, in the same year the agency prosecuted 266 companies, 61 resulted in fines over £10,000. The average fine for companies was £8,412, down from £8,622 in 2002. There are approximately 20,000 incidents each year in the UK and around 250 prosecutions, which means there is a one in eighty chance of company being prosecuted for these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/|title=Environment Agency - GOV.UK|work=environment-agency.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating health and safety at work ===

Large numbers of people each year lose their lives due to injuries and diseases that result from their work. In 2007–08, 229 workers were killed at work, whilst 136,771 other injuries to employees were reported under [[Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations|RIDDOR]] and 299,000 reportable injuries occurred, according to the Labour Force Survey. In addition, 2.1 million people were suffering from an illness they believed was caused or made worse by their current or past work. It is believed that 2056 people died of [[asbestos]] related diseases contracted through their work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbestos.htm|title=Statistics - Asbestos related disease|work=hse.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these large scale harms, the principal regulatory in the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, has faced continuing cuts, most notably the 2006 £5.6m reduction in the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/commissionimpossible/safetychips.htm|title=HSE is broke - Hazards Magazine issue 96|work=hazards.org|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had major implications for the ability of the HSE to regulate workplaces with a decreasing numbers of regulatory contacts. A recent [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] report argued that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Around 85 per cent of major injuries reported to HSE are never investigated ... there is only so much that the 500 or so inspectors in HSE's Field Operations Division (FOD) can achieve. This means that very serious career-ending accidents go unpunished simply because there is no one to gather the evidence. The number of prosecutions is now half what it was in the early 1990s – this simply means that more employers are getting away with it, not that they are more compliant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003120740/https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm |date=October 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
