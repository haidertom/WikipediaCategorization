      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15245">'''Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)''' is a term adopted by the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). It refers to Article 6 of the Convention’s original text (1992), focusing on six priority areas: education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and international cooperation on these issues. The implementation of all six areas has been identified as the pivotal factor for everyone to understand and participate in solving the complex challenges presented by [[climate change]]. The importance of ACE is reflected in other international frameworks such as the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs, 2015); the Global Action Programme for [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (GAP on ESD, 2014); the [[Aarhus Convention]] (2011); and the Bali Guidelines (2010).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246435e.pdf|title=Action for climate empowerment: Guidelines for accelerating solutions through education, training and public|last=UNESCO and UNFCCC|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UNFCCC|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3100-182-6|location=|pages=6, 14–18, 26, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE calls on governments to develop and implement educational and public awareness programmes, train scientific, technical and managerial personnel, foster access to information, and promote public participation in addressing climate change and its effects. It also urges countries to cooperate in this process, by exchanging good practices and lessons learned, and strengthening national institutions. This wide scope of activities is guided by specific objectives that, together, are seen as crucial for effectively implementing climate adaptation and mitigation actions, and for achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Article 6 has been part of the UNFCCC since the Convention’s text was adopted on 9 May 1992. The importance of international cooperation in achieving Article 6 was emphasised in article 10(e) of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto protocol]], adopted in 1997. In New Delhi, 2002, the eleventh [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] (COP 11) adopted the ‘New Delhi Work Programme’ (2002–2007) –to serve as a flexible framework for country-driven action on Article 6 in addressing the specific needs and circumstances of Parties, and reflecting their national priorities and initiatives. In 2007, COP 13 (in Bali) amended the New Delhi work programme and extended it for five years (2007-2012) and requested that regional workshops be organized by the UNFCCC secretariat as part of the review of the work programme, and to share lessons learned and best practices. Workshops were held in Europe (2009), Asia and the Pacific (2009), Small Island Developing States (2010), Africa (2010), and Latin America and the Caribbean (2010).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Doha, 2012, COP 18 adopted the eight-year Doha Work Programme on Article 6 of the UNFCCC (2012-2020). This programme invites Parties to designate and provide support, including technical and financial support, and access to information and materials to a National Focal Point for Article 6 of the UNFCCC. Furthermore, Parties agreed to organize an annual in-session Dialogue on Article 6 of the UNFCCC to present and enhance the relevant work. Since 2013, the annual Dialogue has provided a platform for Parties, representatives of relevant bodies established under the UNFCCC and relevant experts, practitioners and stakeholders to share their experiences and exchange ideas, best practices and lessons learned regarding the implementation of the Doha Work Programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In June 2015, at the 3rd annual dialogue on Article 6 in Bonn, it was decided that efforts related to the implementation of Article 6 would be referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE): a user-friendly, and unmistakable term for referring to Article 6 of the UNFCCC, as opposed to the very important Article 6 of the [[Paris Agreement]]. COP 20 In Lima, December 2014 adopted the ‘Lima Ministerial Declaration on Education and Awareness-raising’, reaffirming the importance of Article 6 of the UNFCCC in meeting its ultimate objective and in promoting climate-resilient [[sustainable development]]. In 2015 at COP 21 (Paris) governments agreed to cooperate in taking measures, as appropriate, to enhance climate change-related education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information, recognizing the importance of these steps to enhance actions under the [[Paris Agreement]]. In 2016, the 4th annual dialogue on ACE was held in Bonn and the intermediate review of the Doha Work Programme was completed. The final review of the Doha Work Programme will be carried out in 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
The 5th annual dialogue on ACE was held in Bonn on the 15 and 16 May with the topics 'education', 'training' and 'international cooperation'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/education_and_outreach/dialogues/items/10123.php 5th Dialogue on Action for Climate Empowerment] United Nations Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

== The six elements of ACE ==
ACE addresses all six priority areas of Article 6: education, training, public awareness, public access to information, public participation, international cooperation. Education enables people to understand the causes and consequences of climate change, to make informed decisions and to take appropriate actions to address climate change.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016. ''UNESCO action on climate change working document prepared in conjunction with the drafting of the updated UNESCO strategy for action on climate change''. UNESCO Task Force on Climate Change. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco&lt;/nowiki&gt;. org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SC/pdf/Climate_Change_TF_Working_Docu- ment_09-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Training provides the technical skills and advanced knowledge needed to support the transition to green economies and sustainable, climate-resilient societies. Successful public awareness campaigns engage communities and individuals in the common effort needed to carry out national and international climate change policies. Ensuring public participation in decision-making and public access to information provides people with the tools and opportunities they need to play a more active role. These elements can all be strengthened through international cooperation. Governments and organizations can support each other with resources, ideas and inspiration for developing climate action programmes.&lt;ref&gt;UN CC:iNet. (n.d.)

== Guiding principles for ACE activities ==
Section B (14) of the Doha Work Programme provides guiding principles on the approach to and characteristics of ACE activities. While all 9 points listed in Section B (14) are important, it is pertinent to emphasize (d), adopting a gender and intergenerational approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== A gender approach ===
A gender approach means ensuring that climate actions are gender-responsive and promote women’s participation in decision-making. While women make up approximately 50% of the world population, in many countries women are less able to cope with – and are more exposed to – the adverse effects of climate change because they have lesser economic, political and legal clout.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP. 2013. ''Overview of linkages between gender and climate change.'' Overview of linkages between gender and climate change. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/&lt;/nowiki&gt; dam/undp/library/gender/Gender%20and%20Environment/PB1-AP-Overview-Gen- der-and-climate-change.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, supporting women’s empowerment and drawing on their experiences, knowledge and skills will make climate change responses more effective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Intergenerational ===
Intergenerational refers to engaging people of all ages in finding solutions for climate change, taking into special consideration the vulnerabilities of youth and the elderly, who have a reduced capacity to cope independently. Future generations are likely to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, yet they are also the least represented in current decisions on climate action.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;WRI. 2015. ''Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up''. World Resources Institute. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.wri.org/publication/building-climate-equity&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[world population]] is ageing very quickly. By 2050 approximately 1 in 5 people will be over the age of 60; the number of those aged 80 and older is expected to quadruple.&lt;ref&gt;UN DESA. 2002. ''World Population Ageing: 1950-2050''. United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to youth and the elderly, other vulnerable people such as women and traditionally marginalized groups (such as [[indigenous peoples]], [[ethnic minorities]] and people with disabilities) have limited capacity to engage in policy-making, and risk being overlooked if their needs are not explicitly included in planning. Formal decision-making structures strive to ensure the participation of those most vulnerable and least represented, recognizing that specialized efforts need to be invested in engaging vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== International frameworks related to ACE ==

=== Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ===
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goals}}

At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit on 25 September 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets to end poverty, inequality and injustice, and tackle climate change by 2030. The SDGs build on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), eight anti-poverty targets that the world committed to achieving by 2015. The new SDGs, and the broader sustainability agenda, go much further than the MDGs. Three of the 17 goals and two associated targets have particular relevance for ACE: 
* '''Goal 4: Quality Education''': Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, and particularly Target 4.7: “By 2030 ensure all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including among others through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development.” 
* '''Goal 13: Climate Action''': Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, and particularly Target 13.3: “Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.” 
* '''Goal 16: Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies''', and particularly Target 16.10: “Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements” and Target 16.7: “Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (GAP on ESD) ===
{{See also|Education for sustainable development#Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (GAP on ESD)}}

The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development took place from 2005 to 2014, with the goal of emphasizing education in all its forms (formal, non-formal and informal) as an indispensable element for achieving sustainable development. In November 2014, as the official follow-up to the DESD, UNESCO launched the Global Action Programme (GAP) for ESD with the overall objective to scale up action on ESD worldwide. Due to its strong linkages with sustainable development, the GAP on ESD provides an excellent framework for understanding the types of education, training and public awareness initiatives conducive to enabling people of all ages to understand and implement solutions for solving the complex problems presented by climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Aarhus Convention ===
{{Main|Aarhus Convention}}

The Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) provides the main international framework regulating such matters. The Aarhus Convention grants public rights and imposes obligations on governmental authorities regarding, inter alia, public participation in environmental decision-making. In 2015, the Maastricht Recommendations on Promoting Effective Public Participation in Decision-making in Environmental Matters were published as a practical tool to improve public participation in environmental decision-making, including good practice recommendations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== UNEP Bali Guidelines on Principle 10 ===
In order to catalyze and accelerate action to implement Principle 10 of the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|Rio Declaration]], governments adopted the Guidelines for the Development of National Legislation on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters at the 11th Special Session of the UNEP Governing Council/ Global Ministerial Environmental Forum in Bali, Indonesia. These voluntary guidelines demonstrate a willingness by governments to engage the public more thoroughly at all levels to protect and manage the environment and related resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10307">The '''Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI)''' is a comprehensive source of information on agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) statistics.

==Overview==
ASTI compiles, analyzes, and publicizes data on institutional developments, investments, and capacity trends in agricultural R&amp;D in [[Developing country|low- and middle-income countries]] worldwide. ASTI has published a broad set of country briefs and regional synthesis reports that describe general human and financial capacity trends in agricultural [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] at national, regional, and global levels. 

ASTI comprises a network of national, regional, and international agricultural R&amp;D agencies and is hosted and facilitated by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI). ASTI is currently funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].

==Importance of agricultural R&amp;D data==

Greater investment in [[Agricultural science|agricultural research]] could make a  significant contribution to increasing agricultural production to the levels required to feed the [[World population|world’s growing population]]. Furthermore, additional investments in agricultural research are required to address emerging challenges, such as increasing weather variability, adaptation to [[Global warming|climate change]], [[Water stress|water scarcity]], and increased price volatility in global markets. Despite this growing attention to the agricultural sector and the role of agricultural research, many low- and middle-income countries continue to struggle with serious and deepening capacity and funding constraints in their agricultural research and higher education systems. 

Quantitative information is fundamental to understanding the contribution of agricultural science and technology (S&amp;T) to agricultural growth. Indicators derived from such information allow the performance, inputs, and outcomes of agricultural S&amp;T systems to be measured, monitored, and benchmarked. These indicators assist S&amp;T stakeholders in formulating policy, setting priorities, and undertaking strategic planning, monitoring, and evaluation. They also provide information to governments, policy research institutes, universities, and private-sector organizations involved in public debate on the state of agricultural S&amp;T at national, regional, and international levels.

==Activities==

ASTI’s recent work has primarily focused on the following activities:
* initiating institutional survey rounds in [[Subsaharan Africa]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the [[Asia Pacific]], and the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]];
* developing and maintaining a comprehensive, [http://www.asti.cgiar.org user-friendly website] offering access to primary data sources; and
* building a network of national, regional and international partners to facilitate data collection efforts and the dissemination of outputs.

===Products===

[[Image:ASTI-DataTool-snapshot.jpg|thumb|right|300x300px|Screenshot of the ASTI Datatool]]
In 2009 ASTI launched a [http://www.asti.cgiar.org/data/ web application] that allows its users to display different ASTI indicators by country and plot two indicators against each other.

ASTI’s current indicators include
* trend data on agricultural scientist numbers and total investments in agricultural research by the government, higher education, and nonprofit sectors of developing countries; and
* additional short-term or yearly data on numbers of scientists by degree status and gender, support-staff numbers, funding sources, categories of spending (salaries, operating costs, and capital investments), and research focus by agricultural subsector and theme, as well as by crop and livestock item.

Publications include regional and global analyses of agricultural R&amp;D investments, and country briefs and fact sheets presenting national data.

===How does ASTI collect its data?===

ASTI’s methodology is unique in that it combines first-hand data from a wide range of agricultural R&amp;D agencies in low- and middle-income countries with relevant, secondary data on [[Developed country|high-income countries]] for comparative purposes. 

ASTI datasets are collected and processed using internationally accepted definitions and statistical procedures developed by the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD)]] and the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]]. ASTI relies on its in-country partners to identify all agencies involved in agricultural R&amp;D, to disseminate ASTI survey forms to them, and to coordinate the necessary follow-up.

==Results and Impacts==

[[Image:Total-AgResearch-Spending.jpg|thumb|left|300x300px|Chart showing total spending on agricultural research]]
In 2000, the world spent 39.5 billion dollars (in 2005 PPP prices, that is in inflation-adjusted terms) on agricultural R&amp;D. The '''private''' sector was estimated to account for 41 percent of this total, the vast majority of which was performed in industrialized countries (96 percent). In contrast, only 6 percent of total investments in the developing world were derived from private firms. 

[[Image:Total-Public-AgResearch-Spending.doc.jpg|thumb|right|400x400px|Total public agricultural research expenditures by income class and region, 1981 and 2000]]
In 2000, global '''public''' agricultural research investments totaled $23 billion in 2005 PPP dollars. This sum represents a 47 percent increase over the 1981 total of $16 billion. Although spending by the high-income countries as a whole continued to grow in absolute terms, their share of global spending decreased from 62 to 57 percent over the 1981-2000 period. In contrast, the share of spending by low-income countries increased from 9 to 11 percent and the share of middle-income countries increased from 29 to 32 percent over the same timeframe. Of the 2000 global total, the developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region combined invested $4.8 billion in 2000, compared to $2.7 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean, $1.2 billion for West Asia and North Africa, and $1.2 billion for Sub-Saharan Africa. Agricultural R&amp;D spending for China and the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has grown considerably since 2000. After a period of declining investments in public agricultural R&amp;D, the Latin America and the Caribbean region also experienced an increase in total agricultural R&amp;D spending in 2006, comparable to the mid-1990s level.

The government sector is still providing most of the funding to agricultural research in the developing world, but funding sources can differ tremendously at the country level. Donor funding still plays an important role in most Sub-Saharan African countries and a handful of countries in Asia. In 2000/01 the main government agricultural research agencies in 23 Sub-Saharan African countries for which data were available obtained 35 percent of their funding through donor loans and contributions, which was considerably higher than the corresponding shares in the other regions. Funding generated through internally generated funds, including contractual arrangements with private and public enterprises, as well as funding by producer organizations have gained prominence in recent years across the developing world.

The institutional composition of agricultural R&amp;D has become increasingly diversified over the past few decades. Although the government sector continues to dominate the execution of public agricultural research, the higher-education sector has gained prominence in a large number of developing countries. Despite the increasing share of the higher-education sector as a whole, the individual capacity of many individual higher-education agencies remains small. Nonprofit organizations such as producer organizations, marketing boards, foundations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are increasingly relevant elements of national and global agricultural research. Although in absolute numbers—total FTE researchers more than doubled in LAC and SSA during their respective periods—they continue to account for a small share of public agricultural research.

'''Arno Nadel''' (October 5, 1878 – March 1943) was a Jewish [[musicologist]], [[composer]], [[playwright]], [[poet]], and [[painter]].

== Early life ==
Nadel was born in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], (at the time of his birth, part of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]]) to an [[Orthodox Jewish]] family.

== Career ==
In 1890, Nadel moved from Lithuania to Germany. At the age of 12, Nadel studied in [[Königsberg]], [[Germany]], under the cantor [[:de:Eduard Birnbaum|Eduard Birnbaum]]. He also studied with conductor and composer Robert Schwalm.&lt;ref name=UnivHamburg-Bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schipperge|first1=Thomas|title=Arno Nadel|url=http://www.lexm.uni-hamburg.de/object/lexm_lexmperson_00002835|website=[[Universität Hamburg]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, when he was 17 years old,&lt;ref name=PaloAltoReview-TaoistPoetry&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wasserman|first1=Martin|title=Arlo Nadel and His Taoist Poetry|url=http://www.accd.edu/pac/english/pareview/arlo.htm|website=Palo Alto Review|publisher=[[Palo Alto College]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010911000615/http://www.accd.edu/pac/english/pareview/arlo.htm|archivedate=11 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to Berlin and enrolled in the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]]. He studied with composer Ludwig Mendelssohn and Max Lowengard.&lt;ref name=UnivHamburg-Bio /&gt;

After graduating he worked at the Kottbusser Ufer Synagogue ([[:de:Synagoge Fraenkelufer|Synagoge am Kottbusser Ufer]]) as an educator and choirmaster. In 1916, he became choir director of the Jewish community of Berlin which included the supervision of music at all Berlin synagogues.&lt;ref name=German-JewishMusic-Nadel-2013&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Frühauf|editor1-first=Tina|title=German-Jewish Organ Music: An Anthology of Works from the 1820s to the 1960s|date=2013|publisher=A-R Editions, Inc.|location=Middleton, Wisconsin|ISBN=978-0-895-79761-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lh7X_rjAinoC&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;ots=DOQ0iPIula&amp;dq=Robert%20Schwalm%20jewish&amp;pg=PR18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 July 2015|pages=xviii-xix|OCLC=830812812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadel was also a very prolific playwright and poet. Starting in 1918, Nadel took up painting as well, painting several self-portraits and biblical scenes.

In 1922, at the request of Jewish leadership, Nadel worked for years on an anthology of synagogue music, ''Kompendium Hallelujah! Gesänge für den jüdischen Gottesdienst'', which he finished in 1938 and intended to publish in seven volumes.&lt;ref name=LBI-EricMandellCollection&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Mandell Collection, 1963-1964, AR 4408|url=http://access.cjh.org/1361613|website=[[Leo Baeck Institute]]|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=InternetArchive-Digitized-EricMandell&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Mandell Collection|url=https://www.archive.org/stream/ericmandellf001#page/n7/mode/1up|website=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HebUnivJerusalem-Nadel-Bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Arno Nadel|website=Jewish Music Research Centre|publisher=[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]|url=http://www.jewish-music.huji.ac.il/content/arno-nadel|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he was deported, Nadel was able to leave his large collection of old Jewish [[liturgical]] materials with a non-Jewish neighbor,&lt;ref name=PassportJewishMusic-1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heskes|first1=Irene|title=Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions, and Culture|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|ISBN=978-0-313-38911-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFpOGhL3qV8C&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;ots=6NPKNdpM3n&amp;dq=eric%20mandell%20collection&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q=nadel&amp;f=false|pages=7–8|accessdate=27 July 2015|OCLC=615600454}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which survived and were purchased by his friend Eric Mandell. What remains of these materials is held at [[Gratz College]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=WorldORT-Nadel-Bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frühauf|first1=Tina|title=Arno Nadel|website=Music and the Holocaust|publisher=[[World ORT]]|url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/places/camps/central-europe/buchenwald/arno-nadel/|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Nadel was married to Beate Anna Nadel.&lt;ref name=Bundesarchiv-MemorialBookBeate-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadel, Beate Anna – Memorial Book: Victims of the Persecution of Jews under the National Socialist Tyranny in Germany 1933–1945|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/en1122984|website=[[Bundesarchiv]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YadVashem-Testimony-1998&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowey|first1=Ester|title=Page of Testimony: Arno Nadel|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/names/nameDetails.html?itemId=1411637&amp;language=en|website=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=5 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a resident of [[Schöneberg]] quarter of Berlin. In November 1938, he was sent to the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=Bundesarchiv-MemorialBookArno-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadel, Arno – Memorial Book: Victims of the Persecution of Jews under the National Socialist Tyranny in Germany 1933–1945|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/en1123081|website=[[Bundesarchiv]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nadel was lucky enough to get papers to leave for England, he was too frail to make the trip. In March 1943, he and his wife were deported to the [[Auschwitz]] [[extermination camp]].&lt;ref name=Bundesarchiv-MemorialBookArno-2015 /&gt; He died there the same year.&lt;ref name=WorldORT-Nadel-Bio /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bundesarchiv-MemorialBookArno-2015 /&gt;

{{Wiktionary|ascendency}}

'''Ascendency''' is a quantitative attribute of an [[ecosystem]], defined as a function of the ecosystem's [[trophic network]].  Ascendency is derived using mathematical tools from [[information theory]].  It is intended to capture in a single index the ability of an ecosystem to prevail against [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] by virtue of its combined organization and size.

One way of depicting ascendency is to regard it as "organized power", because the index represents the magnitude of the power that is flowing within the system towards particular ends, as distinct from power that is dissipated willy-nilly. Almost half a century earlier, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922) had suggested that a system's capacity to prevail in evolution was related to its ability to capture useful power. Ascendency can thus be regarded as a refinement of Lotka's supposition that also takes into account how power is actually being channeled within a system.

In mathematical terms, ascendency is the product of the aggregate amount of material or energy being transferred in an ecosystem times the coherency with which the outputs from the members of the system relate to the set of inputs to the same components ([[Robert Ulanowicz|Ulanowicz]] 1986).  Coherence is gauged by the [[average mutual information]] shared between inputs and outputs (Rutledge et al. 1976).

Originally, it was thought that ecosystems increase uniformly in ascendency as they developed, but subsequent empirical observation has suggested that all sustainable ecosystems are confined to a narrow "window of vitality" (Ulanowicz 2002). Systems with relative values of ascendency plotting below the window tend to fall apart due to lack of significant internal constraints, whereas systems above the window tend to be so "brittle" that they become vulnerable to external perturbations.

Sensitivity analysis on the components of the ascendency reveals the controlling transfers within the system in the sense of [[Justus von Liebig|Liebig]] (Ulanowicz and Baird 1999). That is, ascendency can be used to identify which resource is limiting the functioning of each component of the ecosystem.

It is thought that autocatalytic feedback is the primary route by which systems increase and maintain their ascendencies (Ulanowicz 1997.)

[[File:Aurora generator starting to smoke.png|thumbnail|right|The diesel generator used in the aurora experiment beginning to smoke.]]

[[Idaho National Laboratory]] ran the '''Aurora Generator Test''' in 2007 to demonstrate how a [[cyberattack]] could destroy physical components of the electric grid.&lt;ref name="CNN article 2007/09/27"/&gt; The experiment used a computer program to rapidly open and close a [[diesel generator]]'s circuit breakers out of phase from the rest of the grid and cause it to explode. This vulnerability is referred to as the ''Aurora Vulnerability''.

This vulnerability is especially a concern because much grid equipment supports using [[Modbus]] and other legacy [[communications protocol]]s that were designed without security in mind. As such, they don't support [[authentication]], [[confidentiality]], or [[Replay attack|replay protection]], which means any attacker that can communicate with the device can control it and use the Aurora Vulnerability to destroy it. This is a serious concern, as the failure of even a single generator could cause widespread outages and possibly [[cascading failure]] of the entire power grid, like what occurred in the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]]. Additionally, even if there are no outages from the removal of a single component (N-1 resilience), there is a large window for a second attack or failure, as it could take more than a year to replace it, because many generators and transformers are custom-built for the substation.

The Aurora vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the out-of-phase opening and closing of the breakers. Some suggested methods include adding functionality in [[Protective relay|protective relays]] to ensure synchronism and adding a time delay for closing breakers.&lt;ref name="Myth or Reality"/&gt; Most modern day generators have many protections against out-of-sync generator breaker operations. Devices such as the IEEE 25 Sync Check relay as well as IEEE 46,47,50, and 53 are commonly used to prevent out-of-phase opening and closing of the breakers from ever happening. In addition the majority of the generator relays used do not have any type of communication they inhibit generator breaker operation by not allowing breaker close circuit from operating.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Experiment ==
To prepare for the experiment, the researchers procured and installed a 2.25 MW generator and connected it to the substation. They also needed access to a programmable digital relay or another device that controls the breaker. That access could have been through a mechanical or digital interface.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 91"/&gt;

In the experiment, the researchers used a cyberattack to open and close the breakers out of sync, to maximize the stress. Each time the breakers were closed, the torque from the synchronization caused the generator to bounce and shake, eventually causing parts of the generator be to ripped apart and sent flying off.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt; Some parts of the generator landed as far as 80 feet away from the generator.&lt;ref name="International Spy Museum, Master Script"/&gt;

The unit was destroyed in roughly three minutes. However, this was only because the researchers assessed the damage from each iteration of the attack. A real attack could have destroyed the unit much more quickly.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt;

The experiment was designated as unclassified, [[For Official Use Only|for official use only]].&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 134"/&gt; On September 27, 2007, CNN published an article based on the information and video DHS released to them,&lt;ref name="CNN article 2007/09/27"/&gt; and on July 3, 2014, DHS released many of the documents related to the experiment as part of an unrelated FOIA request.&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA request"/&gt;

== Vulnerability ==
The Aurora vulnerability is caused by bypassing the [[Protective relay|protective relays]].&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt; This would require knowledge of the switchgear for that particular plant and then access to that gear and then physical jumpers placed to enable this to happen.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Proper security of electrical switchgear rooms will prevent this from happening. While certainly plausible this would be highly unlikely.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

"A close, but imperfect, analogy would be to imagine the effect of shifting a car into Reverse while it is being driven on a highway, or the effect of revving the engine up while the car is in neutral and then shifting it into Drive."&lt;ref name="MuckRock FOIA response documents, page 59"/&gt;

"The Aurora attack is designed to open a circuit breaker, wait for the system or generator to slip out of synchronism, and reclose the breaker, all before the protection system recognizes and responds to the attack... Traditional generator protection elements typically actuate and block reclosing in about 15 cycles. Many variables affect this time, and every system needs to be analyzed to determine its specific vulnerability to the Aurora attack... Although the main focus of the Aurora attack is the potential 15-cycle window of opportunity immediately after the target breaker is opened, the overriding issue is how fast the generator moves away from system synchronism."&lt;ref name="Common Questions and Answers"/&gt;

== Mitigations ==

The Aurora vulnerability is caused by the out-of-sync closing of the protective relays. As such, any mechanism that prevents the out-of-sync closing would mitigate the vulnerability.

One mitigation technique is to add a synchronism-check function to all protective relays that potentially connect two systems together. To implement this, the function must prevent the relay from closing unless the voltage and frequency are within a pre-set range. Additionally, the synchronism-check could monitor the rate of change of the frequency and prevent closing above a set rate.&lt;ref name="Myth or Reality"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==

There was some discussion as to whether Aurora hardware mitigation devices (HMD) can cause other failures. In May 2011, Quanta Technology published an article that used [[Real Time Digital Simulator|RTDS (Real Time Digital Simulator)]] testing to examine the "performance of multiple commercial relay devices available" of Aurora HMDs. To quote: "The relays were subject to different test categories to find out if their performance is dependable when they need to operate, and secure in response to typical power system transients such as faults, power swing and load switching... In general, there were technical shortcomings in the protection scheme’s design that were identified and documented using the real time testing results. RTDS testing showed that there is, as yet, no single solution that can be widely applied to any case, and that can present the required reliability level."&lt;ref name="Quanta Technology Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 2, Spring 2011"/&gt; A presentation from Quanta Technology and [[Dominion Resources|Dominion]] succinctly stated in their reliability assessment "HMDs are not dependable, nor secure."&lt;ref name="Quanta Technology and Dominion July 2011 presentation"/&gt;

Joe Weiss, a cybersecurity and control system professional, disputed the findings from this report and claimed that it has misled utilities. He wrote: "This report has done a great deal of damage by implying that the Aurora mitigation devices will cause grid issues. Several utilities have used the Quanta report as a basis for not installing any Aurora mitigation devices. Unfortunately, the report has several very questionable assumptions. They include applying initial conditions that the hardware mitigation was not designed to address such as slower developing faults, or off nominal grid frequencies. Existing protection will address “slower” developing faults and off nominal grid frequencies (&lt;59 Hz or &gt;61 Hz). The Aurora hardware mitigation devices are for the very fast out-of-phase condition faults that are currently gaps in protection (i.e., not protected by any other device) of the grid."&lt;ref name="Unfettered Blog, September 4, 2013"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">The '''beneficial acclimation hypothesis''' ('''BAH''') is the [[physiology|physiological]] [[hypothesis]] that [[acclimatization|acclimating]] to a particular environment (usually thermal) provides an [[organism]] with advantages in that environment. First formally tested by [[Armand Marie Leroi]], Albert Bennett, and [[Richard Lenski]] in 1994, it has however been a central assumption in historical physiological work that acclimation is [[adaptive]].  Further refined by [[Raymond B. Huey]] and David Berrigan under the [[strong inference]] approach, the hypothesis has been [[Falsifiability|falsified]] as a general rule by a series of multiple hypotheses experiments.

== History and definition ==

Acclimation is a set of [[physiology|physiological]] responses that occurs during an individual's lifetime to chronic laboratory-induced environmental conditions (in contrast to [[acclimatization]]).  It is one component of [[adaptation]]. While physiologists have traditionally assumed that acclimation is beneficial (or explicitly defined it as such), criticism of the [[adaptationist program]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] led to a call for increased robustness in testing [[adaptationist]] hypotheses.&lt;ref name = "Gould"&gt;Gould, S.J and Lewontin, R.C. (1979). ''The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme.'' Proc. Roy. Soc. London B 205. pp. 581-598.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial definition of the BAH, as published in 1994 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Leroi et al., is that &lt;blockquote&gt;“acclimation to a particular environment gives an organism a performance advantage in that environment over another organism that has not had the opportunity to acclimate to that particular environment.”&lt;ref name = "Leroi"&gt;{{citation |authors=Leroi, A.M., Bennett, A.F. and Lenski, R. E. |year=1994 |title=Temperature acclimation and competitive fitness: An experimental test of the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1917–1921 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/91/5/1917.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.5.1917|pmid=8127906 |pmc=43275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; This definition was further reworked in an article in American Zoologist 1999 by Raymond B. Huey, David Berrigan, George W. Gilchrist, and Jon C. Herron.&lt;ref name = "Huey"&gt;Huey, R. B., Berrigan, D., Gilchrist, G.W. and Herron, J.C. (1999). ''Testing the Adaptive Significance of Acclimation: A Strong Inference Approach.'' Am. Zool. 39. pp. 323-336&lt;/ref&gt;  They determined that, following Platt's [[strong inference]] approach, multiple competing hypotheses were needed to properly assess beneficial acclimation.  These included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. '''Beneficial Acclimation'''. Acclimating to a particular environment confers [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantages in that environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2.''' Optimal Developmental Temperature'''. There is an ideal temperature to develop at so individuals reared at an optimal temperature compete better in all environments. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3. '''Colder (bigger) Is Better.''' In [[ectotherms]], individuals reared in colder environments tend to develop to a larger body size. These individuals therefore have a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantage in all environments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4. '''Warmer (smaller) Is Better.''' The inverse of '''Colder Is Better'''. Smaller individuals have a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;5. '''Developmental Buffering.''' Development temperature does not affect adult [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Experimental tests ==

The majority of tests of the beneficial adaptation hypothesis have, following [[Krogh's principle]], centered on the model organisms ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref name = "Huey" /&gt; More specifically, experimental tests have centered on easily  measured temperature adaptation (although other systems have been studied; see &lt;ref name = "Huey"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kristensen"&gt;Kristensen, T.N., Hoffmann, A. A., Overgaard, J., Sorensen, J.G., Hallas, R., and Loeschke, V. (2008). ''Costs and Benefits of Cold Acclimation in Field-Released Drosophila.'' PNAS. 105 (1). pp. 216-221.3.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Of the several experimental tests of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, most have rejected it as a universal rule (see reviews &lt;ref name = "Huey" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Woods"&gt;Woods, H.A. and Harrison, J.F. (2002). ''Interpreting Rejections of the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis: When is Physiological Plasticity Adaptive?'' Evolution. 56(9). pp. 1863-1866.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wilson"&gt;Wilson, R. S. and Franklin, C. E. (2002).'' Testing the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis.'' TREE. 17(2). pp. 66-70.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Initial experiments by Leroi ''et al.'', the first scientists to address this problem, tested only the beneficial acclimation hypothesis and not the subsequent hypotheses developed by Huey ''et al.''&lt;ref name = "Leroi" /&gt;  Colonies of ''E. coli'' were acclimated for seven generations in two different temperature conditions: 32&amp;nbsp;°C and 41.5&amp;nbsp;°C.  Colonies were then competed against each other at those temperatures.  He found that, agreeing with the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, colonies acclimated at 32&amp;nbsp;°C competed better at 32&amp;nbsp;°C. However, at 41.5&amp;nbsp;°C, colonies acclimated at 32&amp;nbsp;°C competed better as well. This led to the authors' rejection of the generality of beneficial acclimation.&lt;ref name = "Leroi" /&gt;
Huey ''et al.'' examined four previously conducted studies, applying the five competing hypotheses, and found that none of the results of the studies could be entirely explained by beneficial acclimation. Instead, a combination of hypotheses were required to explain the observed patterns of acclimation.&lt;ref name = "Huey" /&gt;

== Why acclimation is not beneficial ==

While it seems intuitive that acclimation would provide benefits to individuals, the majority of empirical tests of the hypothesis have rejected its general application.  Why then is acclimation not beneficial? H. Arthur Woods and Jon F. Harrison examined the possible reasons in a 2002 ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'' paper.&lt;ref name = "Woods" /&gt;  They suggested that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The timescale of [[adaptation]] is much longer than that of environmental variation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Environmental cues for timing of adaptive acclimation are unreliable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3. It may cost more to adapt than not to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4. [[wikt:Migration|Migration]] by adjacent populations may swamp out [[genes]] for adaptive acclimation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==

In response to continuing rejections of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, a number of common criticisms of experimental tests have been developed:&lt;ref name = "Huey" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Woods" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wilson"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The majority of studies have actually been examining developmental acclimation.  That is, rather than acclimating an adult individual and testing, they suggest that developmental switches triggered by particular temperatures result in a different mechanism of acclimation. More recently, it has been found that adult acclimation and developmental acclimation lead to support for different hypotheses.&lt;ref name = "Kristensen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Most studies have included stressful temperatures. Acclimation to those temperatures may decrease [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] in an individual.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;3. Finally, a variety of traits are examined in these studies that may only be indirectly linked to fitness. For example, examining [[longevity]] as a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] measure in ''D. melanogaster'' may be irrelevant since [[fertility]] declines rapidly with age in this species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Current state ==

The majority of studies have concluded the beneficial acclimation hypothesis is not true in all cases, and that alternate hypotheses should be tested.  In addition to this, recent  studies of the hypothesis have provided additional complications, such as trade-offs evident only in field environments&lt;ref name = "Kristensen" /&gt; and interactions with behavior and [[Biological life cycle|life history]] traits.&lt;ref name = "Deere"&gt;Deere, J.A. and Chown, S.L. (2006). ''Testing the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis and Its Alternatives for Locomotor Performance.'' Am. Nat. 168(5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Marais"&gt;Marais, E. and Chown, S.L. (2008). ''Beneficial Acclimation and the Bogert Effect.'' Ecol. Lett. 11. pp. 1027:1036.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of developmental and [[phenotypic plasticity]] continues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15161">[[File:Parmigianino 004.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna with the Long Neck]]'', by [[Parmigianino]]. As in other [[Mannerist]] works, the proportions of the body - here the [[neck]] - are exaggerated for artistic effect.]]
While there is significant variation in anatomical proportions between people, there are many references to '''body proportions''' that are intended to be canonical, either in [[art]], [[measurement]], or [[medicine]].

In [[measurement]], body proportions are often used to relate two or more measurements based on the body.  A [[cubit]], for instance, is supposed to be six [[palm (unit)|palms]]. A [[span (unit)|span]] is taken to be 9 inches and was previously considered as half a cubit. While convenient, these ratios may not reflect the physiognomic variation of the individuals using them.

Similarly, in [[art]], body proportions are the study of relation of [[human body|human]] or animal body parts to each other and to the whole.  These ratios are used in depictions of the figure (to varying degrees naturalistic, idealized or stylized), and may become part of an [[aesthetic canon]] within a culture.

==Basics of human proportions==
[[Image:Braus 1921 1.png|thumb|upright=0.6&lt;!--size for very long image--&gt;|Human proportions marked out in an illustration from a 20th-century anatomy text-book. Hermann Braus, 1921]]

It is important in [[figure drawing]] to draw the human figure in proportion. Though there are subtle differences between individuals, human proportions fit within a fairly standard range, though artists have historically tried to create idealised standards, which have varied considerably over different periods and regions. In modern figure drawing, the basic unit of measurement is the 'head', which is the distance from the top of the head to the chin. This unit of measurement is reasonably standard, and has long been used by artists to establish the proportions of the human figure.  [[Ancient Egyptian art]] used a canon of proportion based on the "fist", measured across the knuckles, with 18 fists from the ground to the hairline on the forehead.  This was already established by the [[Narmer Palette]] from about the 31st century BC, and remained in use until at least the conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] some 3,000 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. Stevenson, and Simpson, William Kelly. ''The Art and Architecture of Ancient Egypt'', pp. 12-13 and note 17, 3rd edn. 1998, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0300077475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportions used in figure drawing are:{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

* An average person is generally 7-and-a-half heads tall (including the head).
* An ideal figure, used when aiming for an impression of nobility or grace, is drawn at 8 heads tall.
* A [[heroic]] figure, used in the heroic for the depiction of [[gods]] and [[superheroes]], is eight-and-a-half heads tall.  Most of the additional length comes from a bigger chest and longer legs.

A study using Polish participants by Sorokowski found 5% longer legs than an individual used as a reference was considered most attractive.&lt;ref name=tws19jan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.09.002 |title=Adaptive preferences for leg length in a potential partner |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=86–91 |year=2008 |last1=Sorokowski |first1=Piotr |last2=Pawlowski |first2=Boguslaw }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded this preference might stem from the influence of leggy runway models.&lt;ref name="Sorokowski"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09709274.2010.11906309 |title=Attractiveness of Legs Length in Poland and Great Britain |journal=Journal of Human Ecology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=145 |year=2017 |last1=Sorokowski |first1=Piotr }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sorokowski study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Marco Bertamini{{who|date=March 2016}} felt were unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt;

Another study using British and American participants, found ''mid-ranging'' leg-to-body ratios to be most ideal.&lt;ref name="Frederick"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2009.09.001 |pmid=19822462 |title=The influence of leg-to-body ratio (LBR) on judgments of female physical attractiveness: Assessments of computer-generated images varying in LBR |journal=Body Image |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=51–5 |year=2010 |last1=Frederick |first1=David A |last2=Hadji-Michael |first2=Maria |last3=Furnham |first3=Adrian |last4=Swami |first4=Viren }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Swami et al. of American men and women showed a preference for men with legs as long as the rest of their body and women with 40%{{clarify|date=March 2016}} longer legs than the rest of their body&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2006.08.003 |pmid=18089235 |title=The leg-to-body ratio as a human aesthetic criterion |journal=Body Image |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=317–23 |year=2006 |last1=Swami |first1=Viren |last2=Einon |first2=Dorothy |last3=Furnham |first3=Adrian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researcher concluded that this preference might be influenced by American culture where long-legged women are portrayed as more attractive.&lt;ref name="Swami" /&gt; The Swami et al. study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Marco Bertamini felt were unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Bertamini"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0099320 |title=The effect of leg length on perceived attractiveness of simplified stimuli |journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=233–50 |year=2009 |last1=Bertamini |first1=Marco |last2=Bennett |first2=Kate M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertamini also criticized the Swami study for only changing the leg length while keeping the arm length constant.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt; Bertamini's own study which used stick figures mirrored Swami's study, however, by finding a preference for leggier women.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt;

Another common measurement of related to leg-to-body ratio is sitting-height ratio (SHR). Sitting height ratio is the ratio of the head plus spine length to total height which is highly correlated to leg-to-body ratio. SHR has been found to be very different between individuals of different ancestry. It has been reported that individuals with African ancestry have on average longer leg length, i.e. lower SHR than individuals of European ancestry.&lt;ref name="LegLengthBeauty"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bogin | first1 = B. | last2 = Varela-Silva | first2 = MI | date = Mar 2010 | title = Leg length, body proportion, and health: a review with a note on beauty | url = | journal = Int J Environ Res Public Health | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 1047–75 | doi=10.3390/ijerph7031047 | pmid=20617018 | pmc=2872302}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2015 revealed that this difference is mainly due to genetic differences and the SHR difference between African and European individuals is as large as 1 standard deviation.&lt;ref name="SHR"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.02.018 |pmid=25865494 |pmc=4570286 |title=Genome-wide Analysis of Body Proportion Classifies Height-Associated Variants by Mechanism of Action and Implicates Genes Important for Skeletal Development |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=695–708 |year=2015 |last1=Chan |first1=Yingleong |last2=Salem |first2=Rany M |last3=Hsu |first3=Yu-Han H |last4=McMahon |first4=George |last5=Pers |first5=Tune H |last6=Vedantam |first6=Sailaja |last7=Esko |first7=Tonu |last8=Guo |first8=Michael H |last9=Lim |first9=Elaine T |last10=Franke |first10=Lude |last11=Smith |first11=George Davey |last12=Strachan |first12=David P |last13=Hirschhorn |first13=Joel N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle men and thin women===
A 1999 study found that "the (action) figures have grown much more muscular over time, with many contemporary figures far exceeding the muscularity of even the largest human bodybuilders," reflecting an American cultural ideal of a super muscular man.&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pope|first=Harrison|author2=Roberto Olivardia|author3=Amanda Gruber|author4=John Borowiecki|date=1998-05-26|title=Evolving Ideals of Male Body Image as Seen Through Action Toys|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|volume=26|issue=1|doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-108x(199907)26:1&lt;65::aid-eat8&gt;3.3.co;2-4|pmid=10349585|pages=65–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female dolls reflect the cultural ideal of thinness in women.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;

The ancient Greek sculptor [[Polykleitos]] (c.450–420 BC), known for his ideally proportioned bronze ''[[Doryphoros]]'', wrote an influential ''Canon'' describing the proportions to be followed in sculpture.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=Journal of Hellenic Studies |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") creating a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]]. Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body, scaling this length up repeatedly by {{radic|2}} to obtain the ideal size of the other phalanges, the hand, forearm, and upper arm in turn.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal| author=Tobin, Richard | title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos | journal=American Journal of Archaeology | volume=79 | issue=4 | date=October 1975 | pages=307–321 | doi=10.2307/503064| jstor=503064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business simulation''' is [[simulation]] used for [[business]] training, education or analysis. It can be [[scenario]]-based or [[Number|numeric]]-based.

Most business simulations are used for business acumen training and development. Learning objectives include: strategic thinking, decision making, problem solving, financial analysis, market analysis, operations, teamwork and leadership.&lt;ref name="bizsims"&gt;[http://www.bizsims.edu.au/ Online Business Simulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The business gaming community seems lately to have adopted the term '''business simulation game''' instead of just '''gaming''' or just '''simulation'''. The word '''simulation''' is sometimes considered too mechanistic for educational purposes. '''Simulation''' also refers to activities where an optimum for some problem is searched for, while this is not usually the aim of an educational game. On the other hand, the word '''game''' can imply time wasting, not taking things too seriously and engaging in an exercise designed purely for fun. The concept of '''simulation gaming''' seems to offer the right combination and balance between the two.&lt;ref name="info.tse.fi"&gt;Lainema (2003). Enhancing Organizational Business Process Perception – Experiences from Constructing and Applying a Dynamic Business Simulation Game. Turku School of Economics, Series A-5:2003. {{ISBN|951-564-139-X}}. Online: http://info.tse.fi/julkaisut/vk/Ae5_2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation gaming is also the term that the educational gaming community has adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblat, Cathy Stein (1988).

== Games and business simulation games ==
Partly, the terminology of [[business simulation game]]s is not well established. The most common term used is '''[[business game]]''' but several other terms are also in use. Here we will define the most common terms used in context of (computer-based) business learning environments.

Klabbers (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 16-33&lt;/ref&gt; notes that gaming is sometimes associated with something that is frivolous, just for the fun of it. This hampers its scientific endeavor and the more serious connotations of gaming in the scientific arena. The term game is used to describe activities in which some or all of these characteristics are prominent:&lt;ref name="Elgood, Chris 1996"&gt;Elgood, Chris (1996). Using Management Games. 2nd edition, Gower Press, Aldershot, Hampshire, England&lt;/ref&gt;
* human, humanly controlled, opponents, whose actions have an effect upon each other and upon the environment,
* an emphasis on competitiveness and winning,
* an emphasis on pleasure, humour and enjoyment,
* a repetitive cycle of making decisions and encountering a result, allowing the hope of improvement and 'doing better next time'.

Games are played when one or more players compete or cooperate for payoffs, according to an agreed set of rules. Players behave as themselves though they may well display exceptional behavior.&lt;ref name="Jaques, David 1995 pp. 21-38"&gt;Jaques, David (1995). Games, Simulations and Case Studies – A Review. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 21-38&lt;/ref&gt; Games are social systems and they include actors (players), rules and resources, which are the basic building blocks of social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (2001). Bridging information &amp; knowledge society: potentials of gaming. In Rahnu, L. (ed.) Bridging the Information and Knowledge Societies. Tartu University Press, Tartu, Estonia&lt;/ref&gt; In each game, the players (actors) interact with one another, while applying different rules, and utilizing different resources.&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (2003). Interactive Learning of What? In Percival, Godfrey, Laybourn and Murray (eds.) The International Simulation and Gaming Yearbook, Vol. 11, pp. 257-266. Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsuchiya and Tsuchiya&lt;ref&gt;Tsuchiya, Tomoaki and Tsuchiya, Shigehisa (1999). The Unique Contribution of Gaming/Simulation: Towards Establishment of the Discipline. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 46-57&lt;/ref&gt; note that the simulation gaming community is still struggling to establish itself as a discipline, although 35 years have passed since the International Simulation and Gaming Association ('''ISAGA''') was established. To be a discipline, simulation gaming needs a theory, methodology, and application and validation. Of these, forming a theory is the most difficult challenge. Similar comments come from Wolfe and Crookall.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Joseph and Crookall, David (1998). Developing a Scientific Knowledge of Simulation/Gaming. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 29, No. 1, pp. 7-19&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to prior research they conclude that the educational simulation gaming field has been unable to create a generally accepted typology, let alone taxonomy, of the nature of simulation gaming. According to them this is unfortunate because the basis of any science is its ability to discriminate and classify phenomena within its purview, based on underlying theory and precepts. Without this, the field has been stuck, despite its age, at a relatively low level of development.

In most cases, the terms '''business (simulation) game''' and '''management (simulation) game''' can be used interchangeably and there is no well-established difference between these two terms. Greenlaw et al.&lt;ref name="Greenlaw, Paul S. 1962"&gt;Greenlaw, Paul S., Herron, Lowell W. and Rawdon, Richard H. (1962). Business Simulation in Industrial and University Education. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; determine a business game (or business simulation) as ''a sequential decision-making exercise structure around a model of a business operation, in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation''. The descriptions given for a management game, for example, by Forrester&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay W. (1961). Industrial Dynamics. The M.I.T. Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, London&lt;/ref&gt; and Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, New York&lt;/ref&gt; do not differ from the previous. However, Elgood&lt;ref name="Elgood, Chris 1996"/&gt; determines that in a management game profit is not the dominant measure of success. Keys and Wolfe&lt;ref name="Keys 1990 pp. 307-336"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keys | first1 = Bernard | last2 = Wolfe | first2 = Joseph | year = 1990 | title = The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 307–336 | doi=10.1177/014920639001600205}}&lt;/ref&gt; define a management game as a simplified simulated experiential environment that contains enough verisimilitude, or illusion of reality, to include real world-like responses by those participating in the exercise.

Gredler&lt;ref&gt;Gredler, Margaret E. (1996). Educational Games and Simulations: A Technology in Search of a (Research) Paradigm. In Jonassen, David H. (ed.) Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology. Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; divides experiential simulations into the following four categories:
# Data management simulations,
# Diagnostic simulations,
# Crisis management simulations, and
# Social-process simulations.
Business simulation games are most often of the first kind. A participant in a data management simulation typically functions as a member of a team of managers or planners. Each team is managing a company allocating economic resources to any of several variables in order to achieve a particular goal.

Business strategy games are intended to enhance students' decision-making skills, especially under conditions defined by limited time and information.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Marcia Lynn and Sigelman, Lee (1991). Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction. Sage Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt; They vary in focus from how to undertake a corporate takeover to how to expand a company's share of the market. Typically, the player feeds information into a computer program and receives back a series of optional or additional data that are conditional upon the player's initial choices. The game proceeds through several series of these interactive, iterative steps. As can be noted, this definition does not consider continuous (real-time) processing an alternative.

In business simulation games players receive a description of an imaginary business and an imaginary environment and make decisions – on price, advertising, production targets, etc. – about how their company should be run. A business game may have an industrial, commercial or financial background (Elgood, 1996). Ju and Wagner&lt;ref name="Wagner, Christian 1997 pp. 78-92"&gt;Ju, Edward and Wagner, Christian (1997). Personal Computer Games: Their Structure, Principles, and Applicability for Training. The DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems, Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 78-92&lt;/ref&gt; mention that the nature of business games can include decision-making tasks, which pit the player against a hostile environment or hostile opponents. These simulations have a nature of strategy or war games, but usually are very terse in their user interface. Other types of managerial simulations are resource allocation games, in which the player or players have to allocate resources to areas such as plant, production, operations, marketing, and human resources, in order to produce and sell goods.

According to Senge and Lannon&lt;ref&gt;Senge, P. M. and Lannon, C. (1997). Managerial Microworlds. Technology Review, Vol. 93, Issue 5, pp. 62-68&lt;/ref&gt; in '''managerial microworlds''' – like business simulation games – unlike in the actual world, managers are free to experiment with policies and strategies without fear of jeopardizing the company. This process includes the kind of reflection and inquiry for which there is no time in the hectic everyday world. Thus, Senge and Lannon argue, managers learn about the long-term, systemic consequences of their actions. Such "virtual worlds" are particularly important in team learning. Managers can learn to think systemically if they can uncover the subtle interactions that thwart their efforts.

Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; in 1971 gives quite a detailed view of the contents, structure, and operating of management games. Today, this description by Naylor is still valid for most of the business simulation games. Business simulation games are built around a hypothetical oligopolistic industry consisting of three to six firms, whose decision-makers or managers are the participants of the game. Each firm or team is allocated a specific amount of resources in the form of cash, inventories, raw materials, plant and equipment, and so forth. Before each operating period the players make decisions. Naylor mentions that these decisions can concern, e.g., price, output, advertising, marketing, raw material acquisition, changes in plant capacity, and wage rate. This information is read into a computer that has been programmed on the basis of a set of mathematical models that provide a link between the operating results and operating decisions of the individual firms, as well as the external environment (the market). On the basis of '''(a)''' a set of behavioral equations, such as demand and cost functions, and a set of accounting formulas that have been programmed into the computer, and '''(b)''' the individual decisions of each firm, operating results are generated by the computer in the form of printed reports – for example, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, production reports, sales reports, and total industry reports – at the end of each operating period. Usually the environment can be changed by the administrator of the game by altering the parameters of the operating characteristics of the game. In each case, the firms find it necessary to react according to the magnitude and the nature of the change imposed by the external environment. Naylor mentions that some of the more complicated and more realistic games even permit multiple products, plants, and marketing areas, stochastic production periods, stochastic demand, labor negotiations, and the sale of common stock. For more information about this topic see Lainema (2003).&lt;ref name="info.tse.fi"/&gt;

== History ==
The first use of games for education and development was the war game simulations in China in about 3,000 B.C. These games bore a vague similarity to the early 17th century chess.&lt;ref name="Keys 1990 pp. 307-336"/&gt; In the Western world, war games date back to at least the German Kriegspiel of the mid-nineteenth century (Faria and Dickinson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faria | first1 = A. J. | last2 = Dickinson | first2 = John R. | year = 1994 | title = Simulation Gaming for Sales Management Training | url = | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 47–59 | doi=10.1108/02621719410050183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faria and Dickinson note that different war games have also been conducted in Japan before the Second World War and war games have been long used by the British and the Americans to test battle strategies. Military officers trained with war games in the 1930s and 1940s started to use their military training to manage civilian businesses. Some of the business game evolution can be traced to a 1955 Rand Corporation game, which simulated the U.S. Air Force inventory management within its supply system.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. R. (1959). Learning from Experience in Business Decision Games. California Management Review, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 92-107&lt;/ref&gt; Greenlaw et al.&lt;ref name="Greenlaw, Paul S. 1962"/&gt; state that business simulation exercises may be considered an outgrowth of earlier developments in three fields: military war gaming, operations research, and educational role-playing.

According to Naylor,&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; the use of games in business and economics goes back to 1956 when the American Management Association developed the first so-called management decision-making game, called the Top Management Decision Game. Faria and Dickinson and Greenlaw et al. also find this the first widely known business decision-making simulation, although Greenlaw et al. date the origin of the game to 1957 and further specify that it was the first non-military competitive business game. Greenlaw et al. note that the Top Management Decision Simulation stimulated the design and use of dozens of other games. In this simulation five teams of players operated firms competing in a hypothetical, one-product industry. Teams made quarterly decisions covering price, production volume, budgets, research and development, advertising, and sales force and could request selected marketing research information. During the period 1955-1957 only one or two new games appeared each year (Faria, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Faria, Anthony J. (1990). Business Simulation Games after Thirty Years: Current Usage Levels in the United States. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 36-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid growth in the number of business games occurred over the years from 1958 to 1961. Greenlaw et al. had made a summary of some business games available by the beginning of the 1960s. The summary includes 89 different business games or different versions of a certain business game developed by industrial firms, business associations, educational institutes, or governmental units. Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; mentions already in 1971 that hundreds of management games have been developed by various universities, business firms, and research organizations. These management games have been used both for research purposes and for training people in diverse disciplines such as management, business operation, economics, organization theory, psychology, production management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Also Faria (1990) and Dickinson note that the number of simulation games grew rapidly in the 1960s. McRaith and Goeldner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McRaith | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Goeldner | first2 = C. R. | year = 1962 | title = A Survey of Marketing Games | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 26 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; list 29 marketing games, of which 20 had been developed by business firms and nine by academians for university teaching. In 1969 Graham and Gray&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. G., and Gray, C. F. (1969). Business Games Handbook. American Management Association, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; listed nearly 200 business games of different varieties. Horn and Cleaves&lt;ref&gt;Horn, R. E., and Cleaves, A. (1980). The Guide to Simulation/Games for Education and Training. Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, CA&lt;/ref&gt;  provided a description of 228 business games. Faria (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A.J. (1989). Business Gaming: Current Usage Levels. Management Development Review, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 58-66&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that over 200 simulations were in use in the United States in over 1,700 business schools. Overall, taking advantage of computer games in education increased enormously through the 1960s to the 1980s, see for example Ju and Wagner.&lt;ref name="Wagner, Christian 1997 pp. 78-92"/&gt;

At the end of the 1980s Faria (1990) estimated that there were approximately 228 games available in the United States, and that there were around 8,500 instructors using business games. At that point Faria also believes that there is a large and growing number of business schools instructors and business firm users of simulation games. Still, Faria estimated that only 12.5% of all US business firms with training and development managers used computerized business games.

The penetration of business gaming in academia is fuelled by the following factors:&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Thomas F. (1995). Strategy Support during a Business Game using an Expert System. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 87-101&lt;/ref&gt; the increase in student numbers, the increase in new courses, increased adoption of methods supporting diverse learning styles, and the increasing availability of technology. Dickinson and Faria&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, John R. and Faria, A. J. (1995). Simulation Gaming for Sales Management Training and a Demonstration. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 99-109&lt;/ref&gt; state that in US over 200 business games are being used by nearly 9,000 teachers at over 1,700 colleges offering business programmes.

Larsen and Lomi&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Erik and Lomi, Alessandro (1999). System Dynamics and the 'New Technology' for Organizational Decisions: From Mapping and Simulation to Learning and Understanding. European Management Journal, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 117-119&lt;/ref&gt; describe the shift of the objectives of management gaming. They state that until the early 1980s simulation was used to forecast the behavior of a variety of sub-system level variables, ranging from the cash flow and financial performance of a company, to the inflation and unemployment rates of an economy. They state further, that during the last 15 years a new way of thinking about simulation emerged. Instead of focusing on predicting, simulation progressively became a tool to help management teams understand their company and industry's problems and opportunities. Simulations could prepare for the future and reduce the sensitivity of possible strategies to changes in alternative frames of reference – or mental models. Larsen and Lomi further note, that the emphasis of computer-based simulation models has shifted:
# from predicting the future, to understanding how multiple possible futures might be linked to decisions and actions that must be taken today, and
# from designing the best strategy, to analyzing how robust our preferred strategy would be under different assumptions about how the future might unfold, or about how the past actually produced the events that we perceive.

In the late 1990s, training and consulting companies began designing and customizing business simulations for individual companies to augment their corporate leadership development programs. The business simulations often focused on strategy and business acumen. The business simulations allowed participants to test their decision-making skills, make mistakes, and safely learn from their experience. Some refer to this type of employee education as "[[experiential learning]]".  By 2000, business simulations were available that blended the traditional business acumen (financial) skills  with the softer – interpersonal – skills required for effective leadership development.

==Scenario simulations ==
In a [[business game]] or business simulation game, a scenario is played out in a simulated environment and the learner or user is asked to make individual or team based decisions on how to act in the simulations. Often multiple choice alternatives are used and the scenario is played out following a branching tree based on which decisions the learner makes. Throughout or at certain intervals feedback is provided. These are similar to [[role-play]] simulations.

==Numeric simulations ==
A numeric simulation can mimic a whole company on a high level or it can be more detailed and mimic specific organizational units or processes. In a numeric simulation the learner or user makes decisions by pulling levers and dialers as well as through inputting numbers. The decisions are processed and the outcomes are calculated and shown in reports and graphs, e.g. price and volume as well as number of employees can be decisions and the outcome can be viewed in e.g. an [[income statement]], a [[balance sheet]] and a [[cash flow statement]]. [[Feedback]] is given throughout the simulation or at certain intervals, such as when a year has passed. Many numeric business simulations include elements of competition against other participants or against computer generated competitors.

== Types of business simulation games ==
Business simulation games can be classified according to several properties. The first taxonomies were introduced already in the beginning of the 1960s (see e.g. Greenlaw et al., 1962). Here we introduce the taxonomy from Biggs,&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990). Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 23-35&lt;/ref&gt; which is practically identical with the taxonomy from Greenlaw et al.

== The simulation gaming process ==
Business simulation game developers regard their artifacts to be learning environments. When arguing for this, they most often refer to [[David A. Kolb|David A. Kolb's]] influential work in the field of [[experiential learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, David (1984). Experiential Learning: Experience the Source of Learning and Development. Prentice-Hall, Inc, Englewood Cliffs&lt;/ref&gt; During the last decades ideas from [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] and authentic e-learning have also provided new perspectives for considering the role of business simulations in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lainema, T. (2009). Perspective Making – Constructivism as a Meaning Structure for Simulation Gaming. Simulation &amp; Gaming: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Theory, Practice and Research, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 48-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="authenticlearning"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://authenticlearning.info/# |title=Authentic e-Learning |access-date=2015-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313190110/http://authenticlearning.info/# |archive-date=2015-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The activities carried out during a simulation game training session are:&lt;ref&gt;Villegas, Jaime (1997). Simulation Supported Industrial Training: A Method for Increasing the Competence of People in Companies. Saunders, Peter and Cox, Benita (eds.) The International Simulation and Gaming Yearbook, Volume 5: Research into Simulations in Education. Kogan Page, London, pp. 144-164&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoretical instruction: the teacher goes through certain relevant aspects of a theory and participants can intervene with questions and comments.
* Introduction to the game: the participants are told how to operate the computer and how to play the game.
* Playing the game: participants get the opportunity to practice their knowledge and skills by changing different parameters of the game and reflecting on the possible consequences of these changes. Permanent contact with the participants is advisable, as well as keeping the training going to maintain a positive atmosphere and to secure that the participants feel engaged.
* Group discussions: Each of the participants is given a possibility to present and compare their results from the game with the results of others. The participants are encouraged to present their results to others. The teacher should continually look for new ways of enriching the discussions and to help the participants to find the connection between the game results and the problems in real world. The quality of this group discussion plays a relevant role in the training as it will affect the participants' transfer of knowledge and skills into the real world.

The last phase in the list above is usually called debriefing. Debriefing is the most important part of the simulation/gaming experience.&lt;ref&gt;Crookall, David (1995). Preface: Debriefing the Profession and Professionalizing Debrifing. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 7-12&lt;/ref&gt; We all learn from experience, but without reflecting on this experience the learning potential may be lost. Simulation gaming needs to be seen as contrived experiences in the learning cycle, which require special attention at the stages of reflection and generalization.&lt;ref name="Jaques, David 1995 pp. 21-38"/&gt;

Thiagarajan&lt;ref&gt;Thiagarajan, Sivasailam (1995). Guidelines for Conducting a Debriefing Session and for Developing a Debriefing Guide. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 43-49&lt;/ref&gt; lists six phases of debriefing, presented as a flexible suggestion and not as rigid requirements:
# How do you feel? Gives the participants an opportunity to get some of their strong feelings about the simulation game off their chest.
# What happened? Makes it possible for the participants to compare and to contrast participant recollections and to draw some general conclusions during the next phase.
# What did you learn? Encourage the generation and testing of different hypotheses. Ask the participants to come up with general principles based on their experiences from the game and to offer evidence to support or to reject the principles.
# How does this relate to the real world? Encourage a discussion of the relevance of the game to the participants' real world workplace.
# What if…? Encourage the participants to apply their insights to new contexts.
# What next? Participants use their insights to come up with strategies for the simulation game and for the workplace.

Van Ments&lt;ref&gt;van Ments, Morry (1996). Role Playing: Playing a Part or a Mirror to Meaning. In Saunders, Percival and Vartiainen (eds.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 4: Games and Simulations to Enhance Quality Learning. Kogan Page, London&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the aim of debriefing is to: deal with factual errors and to tie up loose ends (including scoring); draw out general conclusions about the session; and deduce general lessons which can be extrapolated to the real world. Furthermore, the participants should not be allowed to conclude what was learned without receiving feedback (Gentry, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, James W. (1990). What is Expeiential Learning? In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 9-20&lt;/ref&gt; The participants need to articulate their perception of what was learned, and the instructor needs to put things into a broader perspective. Gentry also expresses that process feedback is much more valuable than outcome feedback. As games are less-than-perfect representations of the real world, it should be the decision process used that needs to be applauded or critiqued, not the gaming outcome.
The importance of reflection, debriefing and feedback highlight the need for business simulations to supported by carefully considered learning outcomes, pedagogy and assessment tasks. Student factors such as low motivation to engage and prior skill weaknesses can undermine the ability of authentic assessment regimes to achieve the purported learning benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vos|first1=Lynn|title=Simulation games in business and marketing education: How educators assess student learning from simulations|journal=The International Journal of Management Education|date=2015|volume=13|page=16|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811715000026|accessdate=23 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.ijme.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Online Business Simulations Project funded by the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching has developed a range of resources to help educators embed simulations into their classes.&lt;ref name="bizsims" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="933">'''Cand.scient.pol.''' (i.e. [[Latin]] ''candidatus/candidata scientiarum politicarum'', also translated into Danish as ''kandidat i statskundskab'',&lt;ref&gt;http://studier.ku.dk/kandidatuddannelser/statskundskab/&lt;/ref&gt; "candidate of political science") is a candidate's degree, viz. an advanced degree, in [[political science]], awarded by several Danish universities. The degree currently requires 5 years of studies, historically 6 years. The current 5-year degree is, since 2009, translated into English as "Master of Science in Political Science".

The equivalent degree used in Norway (until 2008) was called [[cand.polit.]] In Denmark, cand.polit. is a degree in economics.

20% of all members of parliament hold a cand.scient.pol. degree.

In addition, centralspindlin's interaction with the [[ESCRT#ESCRT-III|ESCRT III]] allows for abscission to occur.&lt;ref name="cytokinesis" /&gt;

== Structure ==

Centralspindlin is a heteroteramer consisting of two different subunit proteins:&lt;ref name="cytokinesis" /&gt;
# A [[KIF23]] dimer (Kinesin 6 motor protein, also known as MKLP1 in mammals and ZEN-4 in ''C. elegans'')
::Consists of a motor domain linked to a parallel coiled coil and a globular region by a linker
# A [[RACGAP1]] dimer (Also known as MgcRacGAP in mammals or CYK-4 in ''C. elegans'')
::Contains a coiled-coil and an important RhoGAP domain
Both KIF23 and RacGAP1 dimerize via their parallel coiled coil domain.&lt;ref name="Ms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner et al. [http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/early/2007/10/17/mbc.E07-05-0468.full.pdf "Cooperative assembly of CYK-4/MgcRacGAP and ZEN-4/MKLP1 to form the centralspindlin complex"], ''Molecular Biology of the Cell'', 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Centralspindlin oligomerizes in order to link the mitotic spindle with the plasma membrane&lt;ref name="cytokinesis" /&gt; The sequences mediating interactions between KIF23 and RacGAP1 are highly variable between species. However, a high affinity interaction between these subunits is essential for the proper functioning of the Centralspindlin complex.&lt;ref name="complex" /&gt;

=== Subunits ===

'''KIF23''' interacts with microtubules at sites of overlap,&lt;ref name="Ms" /&gt; linking the centraspindlin complex to the mitotic spindle.
'''RacGAP1''' recruits [[ECT2]] to the central spindle.&lt;ref name="research" /&gt; ECT2 is a Guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for [[RhoA]]. Cytokinesis is initiated when RhoA is activated by ECT2.&lt;ref name="ect2"&gt;Tatsumoto et al [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2169345/pdf/9909086.pdf "Human Ect2 Is an Exchange Factor for Rho Gtpases, Phosphorylated in G2/M Phases, and Involved in Cytokinesis"], ''[[Journal of Cell Biology]]'', 29 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
RacGAP1 is also involved in tethering the central spindle to the plasma membrane. Without this interaction, cytokinesis cannot occur.&lt;ref name="cslink" /&gt;

'''''Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified''''' or the '''''Washing Away of Wrongs''''' is a [[Chinese literature|Chinese book]] written by [[Song Ci]] in 1247&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Hsi-yüan chi-lu|page=186|last=Uematsu|first=Tadashi|last2=(transl. T. Nakayama)|editor-last=Balazs|editor-first=Etienne|editor-link=Étienne Balazs|editor2-last=Hervouet|editor2-first=Yves|editor2-link=Yves Hervouet|title=A Sung Bibliography|publisher=[[The Chinese University Press]]|year=1978|isbn=962-201-158-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1276) as a handbook for coroners. The author combined many historical cases of [[forensic science]] with his own experiences and wrote the book with an eye to avoiding injustice. The book was esteemed by generations of officials, and it was eventually translated into English, German, Japanese, French and other languages.

It is the first ever written book of forensic science.

==Content==
Different versions of the book exist, but the earliest existing version was published during the Yuan Dynasty, containing fifty-three chapters in five volumes. The first volume describes the imperial decree issued by Song Dynasty on the inspection of bodies and injuries. The second volume contains notes and methods on post-mortem examinations. The third, fourth, and fifth volumes detail the appearances of corpses from various causes of death and methods of treatments to certain injuries of a wounded person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Song Ci and his Xi Yuan Ji Lu | publisher = Huaxia Jingwei Wang| url = http://big5.huaxia.com/wh/gjzt/2007/00571994.html| accessdate = 2007-09-01 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Song Ci ruled regulation about autopsy report for court, how to protect the evidence in the examining process, the reason why workers must show examination to public impartiality;&lt;ref&gt;Song, Ci, and Brian E. McKnight. The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. p 161.&lt;/ref&gt; how to wash dead body for examining the different reasons of death. At that time, the book had given methods to distinguish suicide or pretending suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Song, Ci, and Brian E. McKnight. The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. p 79-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In the book, Ci said:'''''
&lt;blockquote&gt;The particulars of each case must be recorded in the doctor’s own handwriting. No one else is allowed to write his [[autopsy]] report. A coroner must not avoid performing an autopsy just because he detests the stench of corpses. A coroner must refrain from sitting comfortably behind a curtain of [[incense]] that masks the stench, letting his subordinates do the autopsy unsupervised, or allowing a petty official to write his autopsy report, otherwise any potential inaccuracy is unchecked and uncorrected.” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''He also said:'''''
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Should there be any inaccuracy in an autopsy report, injustice would remain with the deceased as well as the living. A wrongful death sentence without justice may claim one or more additional lives, which would in turn result in [[feud|feuds and revenges]], prolonging the tragedy. In order to avoid any miscarriage of justice, the coroner must immediately examine the case personally.”

In ''The Washing Away of Wrongs'', the first documented [[Forensic entomology|forensic entomology]] case is reported.&lt;ref name=Benecke&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benecke M. | title=A brief history of forensic entomology | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2001 | volume=120 | issue=1–2 | pages=2–14 | pmid=11457602  | doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00409-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1235 A.D., a stabbing occurred in a Chinese village. By testing different blades on an animal carcass, it was determined that the wound was caused by a sickle. After further questioning, the investigator had all villagers bring their [[sickle]]s and lay them out before the crowd. [[Blow-fly|Blow flies]] were attracted to a single sickle because invisible remnants of blood and tissue still adhered to it. The owner of the alleged sickle later broke down and confessed the crime. In other areas of the text, the author demonstrates knowledge of blow fly activity on bodies relative to those orifices infested, the time of infestation, and the effect of trauma on attractiveness of tissue to such insects.

Brian McKnight describes the murder case involving the sickle as thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A local peasant from a Chinese village was found murdered, hacked to death by a hand sickle. The use of a sickle, a tool used by peasants to cut the rice at harvest time, suggested that another local peasant worker had committed the murder. The local magistrate began the investigation by calling all the local peasants who could be suspects into the village square. Each was to carry their hand sickles to the town square with them. Once assembled, the magistrate ordered the ten-or-so suspects to place their hand sickles on the ground in front of them and then step back a few yards. The afternoon sun was warm and as the villagers, suspects, and magistrates waited, bright shiny metallic green flies began to buzz around them in the village square. The shiny metallic colored flies then began to focus in on one of the hand sickles lying on the ground. Within just a few minutes many had landed on the hand sickle and were crawling over it with interest. None of the other hand sickles had attracted any of these pretty flies. The owner of the tool became very nervous, and it was only a few more moments before all those in the village knew who the murderer was. With head hung in shame and pleading for mercy, the magistrate led the murderer away. The witnesses of the murder were the brightly metallic colored flies known as the blow flies which had been attracted to the remaining bits of soft tissue, blood, bone and hair which had stuck to the hand sickle after the murder was committed. The knowledge of the village magistrate as to a specific insect group's behavior regarding their attraction to dead human tissue was the key to solving this violent act and justice was served in ancient China.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, Neal H.

The '''easiness effect''' is the claim that as a result of [[popular science|science popularization]] [[layperson|laypeople]] develop an overconfident scientific understanding. This results in science-related decision-making that reflects a misunderstanding of popular science rather than the judgment of professional scientists.{{R|"Scharrer"}}

== Context ==
Rainer Bromme and Susan Goldman, writing in the ''[[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]]'' describe the context, stating "Challenges to understanding science include determining the relevance of information, the tentativeness of scientific truth, distinguishing between scientific and nonscientific issues, and determining what is true and what is false."{{R|"Bromme"}}

Scotty Hendricks, a contributing writer to BigThink.com, notes that popular science writers might have to start considering the effect that their work has on the general public.{{R|"Hendricks2016"}}

== Evidence ==
Scharrer and her co-authors studied the claimed effect by inviting laypeople to read popular science articles and/or articles with more scientific detail, publishing their results in ''[[Public Understanding of Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Scharrer" /&gt; The subjects were then interviewed to judge their scientific opinions and confidence in those opinions, in relation to the material that they had read. Scharrer's team inferred that there was a statistically significant effect of scientific overconfidence and willingness to override expert opinion.{{R|"Scharrer"}}

In some of their experiments, Scharrer's team attempted to counteract the easiness effect by explicitly warning subjects of the complexity and controversiality of the scientific material presented. They found that the easiness effect disappeared partially but not completely.{{R|"Scharrer"}} The researchers suggest that it has to do mostly with writing style. Popular articles condense the science and speak with certainty whereas an academic paper speaks mostly in terms of probability. Hence reading mostly popularizations leads to overconfidence in the results.{{R|"Hendricks2016"}}

== Countermeasures ==
Scharrer and her co-authors recommended "explicitly highlighting topic complexity and controversiality" in order to reduce the easiness effect, and additionally
recommended "a need for further educating the public on the division of cognitive labor and its implications for making judgments" and adding to formal science education the notion that "making reliable judgments often requires deference to scientific experts".{{R|"Scharrer"}}
== Commentary ==
Mark Carnall of [[The Guardian]] said that the expanded access that laypeople have to simplified explanations of scientific facts may be the cause of their rising distrust in experts. The partial understanding they get from the "easy-to-digest science stories" from the media and bad [[science communication]] would give them confidence to reject the actual claims that scientists make.  He expresses the concern that "[[alternative facts]]" exploit this effect to confuse what scientific facts really are and highlights the importance of critical thinking skills to counter this phenomenon.{{R|"Guardian_Carnall"}}

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}
[[File:Ecosan smaller.jpg|thumb|Ecosan concept showing a separation of flow streams, treatment and reuse]]

'''Ecological sanitation''', commonly abbreviated as '''ecosan''' (also spelled '''eco-san''' or '''EcoSan'''), is an approach to [[sanitation]] provision which aims to safely [[Reuse of excreta|reuse excreta]] in [[agriculture]]. It desires to "close the loop" mainly for the [[plant nutrient|nutrients]] and [[organic matter]] between sanitation and agriculture. One of the aims is to minimise the use of [[non-renewable resource]]s. When properly designed and operated, ecosan systems provide a hygienically safe system to convert human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil, and water to be returned to the land.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Definition ==
The definition of ecosan has varied in the past. In 2012, a widely accepted definition of ecosan was formulated by Swedish experts: "Ecological [[sanitation]] systems are systems which allow for the safe recycling of nutrients to crop production in such a way that the use of [[non-renewable resource]]s is minimized. These systems have a strong potential to be [[sustainable sanitation]] systems if technical, institutional, social and economic aspects are managed appropriately."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Elisabeth Kvarnström, Linus Dagerskog, Anna Norström and Mats Johansson (2012) [http://www.siani.se/resources/report/nutrient-reuse-solution-multiplier Nutrient reuse as a solution multiplier] (SIANI policy brief 1.1), A policy brief by the SIANI Agriculture-Sanitation Expert Group, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2012, ecosan has often been associated with [[urine diversion]] and in particular with [[urine-diverting dry toilet|urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs)]], a type of [[dry toilet]]. For this reason, the term "ecosan toilet" is widely used when people mean a UDDT.&lt;ref&gt;Rieck, C., von Münch, E., Hoffmann, H. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/874 Technology review of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) - Overview on design, management, maintenance and costs]. Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ecosan concept should not be limited to one particular type of toilet. Also, UDDTs can be used without having any reuse activities in which case they are not in line with the ecosan concept (an example being the 80,000 UDDTs implemented by eThekwini Municipality near Durban, South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;Roma, E., Holzwarth, S., Buckley, C. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/791 Large-scale peri-urban and rural sanitation with UDDTs, eThekwini Municipality (Durban), South Africa] - Case study of sustainable sanitation projects. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Use of the term "ecosan" ===
The term "ecosan" was first used in 1995 and the first project started 1996 in Ethiopia, by an NGO called Sudea. A trio, Dr Torsten Modig, Umeå University, Almaz Terrefe, teamleader, and Gunder Edström, hygiene expert, chose an area in a dense urban area as a starting point.They used urine diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) coupled with reuse activities.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the ecosan concept, human [[excreta]] and [[wastewater]] is regarded as a potential resource – which is why it has also been called "resource oriented sanitation". The term "productive sanitation" has also been in use since about 2006.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Comparison with the term "sustainable sanitation" ===
The definition of ecosan is focusing on the health, environment and resource aspect of [[sustainable sanitation]]. Thus ecosan is not, per se, sustainable sanitation, but ecosan systems can be implemented in a sustainable way and have a strong potential for sustainable sanitation, if technical, institutional, social and economical aspects are cared for appropriately. Ecosan systems can be "unsustainable" for example if there is too little user acceptance or if the costs of the system are too high for a given target group of users, making the system financially unsustainable in the longer term.

==Overview==

[[File:EcoSanRes (2005). Closing the loop on Sanitation..jpg|thumb|Poster by EcoSanRes program: Closing the loop on Sanitation (2005)]]

[[File:Ecosan closing the loop poster by CREPA.jpg|thumb|Ecosan closing the loop poster (in French), by the NGO CREPA in 2005, UDDTs are used in this example]]The main objectives of ecological sanitation are to reduce the health risks related to sanitation, [[contaminated water]] and waste; to prevent [[groundwater pollution]] and [[surface water]] pollution; and to reuse nutrients or energy contained within wastes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book | author=GTZ, IWA | year=2003 | title=Ecosan - closing the loop - Proceedings of the 2nd international symposium, 7th–11th April 2003, Lübeck, Germany | publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH and International Water Association (IWA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resource recovery ===
{{Further|Resource recovery}}
The statement in the definition of ecosan to "safely recycle" includes hygienic, microbial and chemical aspects. Thus, the recycled human excreta product, in solid or liquid form, shall be of high quality both concerning pathogens and all kind of hazardous chemical components. The statement "use of non-renewable resources is minimised" means that the gain in resources by recycling shall be larger than the cost of resources by recycling.

Ecosan is based on an overall concept of material flows as part of an ecologically and economically sustainable wastewater management system tailored to the needs of the users and to the respective local conditions. It does not favour a specific sanitation technology, but is rather a certain philosophy in handling substances that have so far been seen simply as wastewater and water-carried waste for disposal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Reuse as fertilizer ====
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
Right from the start, the first proponents of ecosan systems had a strong focus on increasing agricultural productivity (via the [[reuse of excreta]] as [[fertilizer]]s) and thus improving the nutritional status of the people at the same time as providing them with safe sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;Esrey, S., Andersson, I., Hillers, A., Sawyer, R. (2001). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/788 Closing the Loop - Ecological sanitation for food security]. Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Disease reduction was meant to be achieved not only by reducing infections transmitted via the [[fecal-oral route]] but also by reducing [[malnutrition in children]]. This link between [[WASH]], nutrition, a disease called environmental enteropathy (or tropical [[enteropathy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = J. H. | year = 2009 | title = Child undernutrition, tropical enteropathy, toilets, and handwashing | url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1792 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9694| pages = 1032–1035 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60950-8 | pmid=19766883}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[stunted growth]] of children has risen to the top of the agenda of the [[WASH]] sector since about 2013.

Agricultural trials around the world have shown measurable benefits of using treated excreta in agriculture as a fertilizer and [[soil conditioner]]. This applies in particular to the use of [[urine]]. Reuse trials in [[Zimbabwe]] showed positive results for using urine on green, leafy plants such as spinach or maize as well as fruit trees.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Morgan, P. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/989 Ecological toilets - Start simple and upgrade from arborloo to VIP]. Harare, Zimbabwe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, P. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1285 Trees as recyclers of nutrients present in human excreta - Main tree report]. Aquamor,  and Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in Finland indicated that the use of urine and the use of urine and wood ash "could produce 27% and 10% more red beet root biomass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Surendra K.|title=Human Urine and Wood Ash as Plant Nutrients for Red Beet (Beta vulgaris) Cultivation: Impacts on Yield Quality|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=58|issue=3|pages=2034–2039|doi=10.1021/jf9029157|pmid=20050665|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urine has been proven in many studies to be a valuable, relatively easy to handle fertilizer, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and important micro-nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Richert, A., Gensch, R., Jönsson, H., Stenström, T., Dagerskog, L. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/757 Practical guidance on the use of urine in crop production]. Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phosphorus recovery ====
Another aspect that ecosan systems are trying to address is the possible upcoming shortage of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;Schröder, J., Cordell, D., Smit, A., Rosemarin, A. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1587 Sustainable use of phosphorus]. Plant Research International, Wageningen, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus has an important role for plant growth, and therefore in fertilizer production, but is a limited mineral resource.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Association (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1591 A rock and hard place - Peak phosphorus and the threat to our food security]. Soil Association, Bristol, UK&lt;/ref&gt; The situation is similar for potassium. Known mineral phosphate rock reserves are becoming scarce and increasingly costly to extract – this is also called the "[[peak phosphorus]]" crisis. One review of global phosphate supply suggested that if collected, phosphate in urine could supply 22% of the total demand.&lt;ref name="MihelcicFry2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mihelcic|first1=James R.|last2=Fry|first2=Lauren M.|last3=Shaw|first3=Ryan|title=Global potential of phosphorus recovery from human urine and feces|journal=Chemosphere|volume=84|issue=6|year=2011|pages=832–839|issn=0045-6535|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.046|pmid=21429554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
Benefits of ecosan systems include:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
* Minimizing the introduction of [[pathogen]]s from human excreta into the [[water cycle]] (groundwater and surface water) - for example [[groundwater pollution]] by [[pit latrine]]s.  
* Conservation of resources through lower water consumption, substitution of mineral fertilizer and minimization of [[water pollution]].
*  Less reliance on mined phosphorus and other non-renewable resources for fertilizer production.
* Reduced consumption of energy in fertilizer production: [[Urea]] is a major component of urine, yet we produce vast quantities of urea by using [[fossil fuels]]. By properly managing urine, treatment costs as well as fertilizer costs can be reduced.

==Challenges==
The ecosan approach has been criticised for being overly focused on reuse in agriculture, whilst neglecting some of the other criteria for [[sustainable sanitation]]. In fact, ecosan systems can be "unsustainable", for example, if there is too little user acceptance or if the costs of the system are too high for a given target group of users, making the system financially unsustainable in the longer term.

Some proponents of ecosan have been criticised as being too dogmatic, with an over-emphasis on environmental resource protection rather than a focus on public health protection and provision of sanitation at a very low cost (for example [[Urine-diverting dry toilet|UDDTs]], which some people call "ecosan toilets", may be more expensive to build than pit latrines, even if in the longer term they are cheaper to maintain).

The safety of ecosan systems in terms of pathogen destruction during the various treatment processes is a continuous topic of debate between proponents and opponents of ecosan systems. However, the publication of the WHO Guidelines on Reuse, with its multiple barrier concept, has gone a long way in establishing a common framework for safe reuse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the question remains whether ecosan systems can ever be scaled up to reach millions of people and how they can be made sufficiently safe to operate. The initial excitement in the early 2000s by the ecosan pioneers has changed into a realization that changing attitudes and behaviours in sanitation takes a lot of patience.

Acknowledgement for ecosan came with the awarding of the&amp;nbsp;[[Stockholm Water Prize]]''' '''in 2013 to Peter Morgan, a pioneer of handpumps and ventilated pit latrines (VIPs) in addition to ecosan-type toilets&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, P. (2007). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/195 Toilets That Make Compost - Low-cost, sanitary toilets that produce valuable compost for crops in an African context]. Stockholm Environment Institute, {{ISBN|978-9-197-60222-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Arborloo]], the Skyloo and the Fossa alterna). Peter Morgan is renowned as one of the leading creators and proponents of ecological sanitation solutions, which enable the safe [[Reuse of excreta|reuse of human excreta]] to enhance soil quality and crop production. His ecosan-type toilets are now in use in countries across the globe, centred on converting a sanitary problem into a productive resource.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Also many of the research projects that the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] have been funding since about 2011 in sanitation are dealing with resource recovery – this might well be a legacy of the ecosan concept, even if the term "ecosan" is not used by these researchers.

Ecosan offers a flexible framework, where centralised elements can be combined with decentralised ones, waterborne with dry sanitation, [[high-tech]] with [[low-tech]], etc. By considering a much larger range of options, optimal and economic solutions can be developed for each particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jenssen, P., Heeb, J., Huba-Mang, E., Gnanakan, K., Warner, W., Refsgaard, K., Stenström, T., Guterstam, B., Alsen, K. (2004). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/184 Ecological Sanitation and Reuse of Wastewater - A thinkpiece on ecological sanitation.] The Agricultural University of Norway&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies used in ecosan systems often - but not always - include elements of source separation, i.e. keeping different waste streams separate, as this can make treatment and safe reuse easier.

The most common technology used in ecosan systems is the [[urine-diverting dry toilet]], but ecosan systems can also use other technologies, such as vacuum toilets coupled with [[biogas]] plants, [[constructed wetland]]s, [[composting toilet]]s and so forth.

Examples of ecosan projects worldwide can be found in a list published by [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]] in 2012, as well as in those case studies published by the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] that are focused on reuse activities.&lt;ref&gt;GIZ (2012).

== History ==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}

=== Excreta reuse in dry sanitation systems ===

The recovery and use of urine and feces in "dry [[sanitation]] systems", i.e. without sewers or without mixing substantial amounts of water with the excreta, has been practiced by almost all cultures. The reuse was not limited to agricultural production. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], for example, were aware of the [[bleach]]ing attribute of the [[ammonia]] within urine and used it to whiten clothing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many traditional agricultural societies recognized the value of human waste for [[soil fertility]] and practised the "dry" collection and [[reuse of excreta]]. This enabled them to live in communities in which nutrients and organic matter contained in excreta were returned to the soil. Historical descriptions about these practices are sparse, but it is known that excreta reuse was practiced widely in Asia (for example in China, Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Korea) but also in Central and South America. However, the most renowned example of the organised collection and use of human excreta to support food production is that of China.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, AD (2003). Feed or feedback: agriculture, population dynamics and the state the planet. International Books. Utrecht, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90 5727 048X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of "[[night soil]]" as a fertilizer was recognized with well-developed systems in place to enable the collection of excreta from cities and its transportation to fields. The Chinese were aware of the benefits of using excreta in crop production more than 2500 years ago, enabling them to sustain more people at a higher density than any other system of agriculture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In Mexico the [[Aztec]] culture collected human excreta for agricultural use. One example of this practice has been documented for the Aztec city of [[Tenochtitlan]] which was founded in 1325 and was one of the last cities of pre-Hispanic Mexico (conquered in 1521 by the Spanish): The population placed the sweepings in special boats moored at docks around the city. Mixtures of sweepings and excreta were used to fertilize the chinampas (agricultural fields) or to bolster the banks bordering the lake. Urine was collected in containers in all houses, then mixed with mud and used as a fabric dye. The Aztecs recognized the importance of recycling nutrients and compounds contained in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becerril | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Jiménez | first2 = B. | year = 2007 | title = Potable water and sanitation in Tenochtitlan: Aztec culture | url = http://www.iwaponline.com/ws/00701/ws007010147.htm | journal = Water Science and Technology: Water Supply | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 147–154 | doi = 10.2166/ws.2007.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Peru, the Incas had a high regard for excreta as a fertilizer, which was stored, dried and pulverized to be utilized when planting maize.&lt;ref name="Luethi book"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Lüthi|first1 = C.|title = Sustainable sanitation in cities : a framework for action|date = 2011|publisher = Papiroz Publ.

In the Middle Ages, the use of excreta and [[greywater]] in agricultural production was the norm. European cities were rapidly urbanizing and sanitation was becoming an increasingly serious problem, whilst at the same time the cities themselves were becoming an increasingly important source of agricultural nutrients. The practice of directly using the nutrients in excreta and wastewater for agriculture therefore continued in Europe into the middle of the 19th century. Farmers, recognizing the value of excreta, were eager to get these fertilizers to increase production and urban sanitation benefited.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lüthi, C., Panesar, A., Schütze, T., Norström, A., McConville, J., Parkinson, J., Saywell, D., Ingle, R. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1019 Sustainable sanitation in cities: a framework for action]. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA), International Forum on Urbanism (IFoU), Papiroz Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was also called [[gong farmer]] in England but carried many health risks for those involved with transporting the excreta and [[faecal sludge|fecal sludge]].

Traditional forms of sanitation and excreta reuse have continued in various parts of the world for centuries and were still common practice at the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Even as the world became increasingly more urbanised, the nutrients in excreta collected from urban sanitation systems without mixing with water were still used in many societies as a resource to maintain soil fertility, despite rising population densities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Decline in recovery of nutrients from human excreta in dry systems ===
Recovery of nutrients from excreta in non-sewered sanitation systems was addressing the sanitation problems in settlements in Europe and elsewhere and was contributing to securing agricultural productivity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the practice did not become the dominant approach to urban sanitation in the 20th century and was gradually replaced with sewer-based sanitation systems without nutrient recovery (apart from agricultural reuse of [[sewage sludge]] in some cases) – at least for cities that can afford it.

There were four main driving factors that led to the demise in the recovery and use of excreta and greywater from European cities in the 19th century:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Growth of urban settlements and increasing distance from agricultural fields.
* Increasing water consumption and use of flush toilet: Water flushing greatly increased the volume of sewage, at the same time diluting the nutrients, making it virtually impossible for them to be recovered and reused as they previously were.
* Production of cheap synthetic fertilizers, making any efforts to recover and reuse the nutrients and organic material from the large volumes of sewage obsolete.
*  Political intervention as a consequence of the perceived need for a change with regards to how to deal with odorous substances: Up until the end of the nineteenth century the dominant theory on the spread of illness was the [[miasma theory]]. This theory stated that everything that smelled had to be gotten rid of because inhaling bad smells was thought to lead to illness. 
The use of (odorous) animal [[manure]] in agriculture has continued through to this day, probably because the odour of manure was not thought to contribute to human illnesses.

The recovery of nutrients from wastewater still continues in two forms: 
* [[reclaimed water|Wastewater reuse]] or [[resource recovery]]: Use of raw, treated or partially treated wastewater for irrigation in agriculture (with the associated health risks if it is done in an improper way which is often the case in developing countries); and 
* Application of [[sewage sludge]] to agricultural lands which is not without controversy in many industrialised countries due to the risks of polluting soils with heavy metals and micropollutants if not managed properly (see [[biosolids]]).

=== Research from 1990s onwards ===

The [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (Sida) funded the "SanRes R&amp;D programme" during 1993 to 2001 which lay the foundation for the subsequent "EcoSanRes programme" carried out by [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] (2002–2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Eds.|last2 = Simpson-Hébert|first2 = co-authors: Uno Winblad, Mayling|title = Ecological sanitation|date = 2004|publisher = Stockholm Environment Institute|location = Stockholm|isbn = 978-9188714985|page = iii|edition = 2., rev. and enlarged|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemarin, A. (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1968 EcoSanRes Programme - Phase Two 2006-2010]. Joint seminar of DWA and GTZ, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; A publication by Sida called "Ecological sanitation" in 1998 compiled the knowledge generated to date about ecosan in a popular book which was published as a second edition in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Eds.|last2 = Simpson-Hébert|first2 = co-authors: Uno Winblad, Mayling|title = Ecological sanitation|date = 2004|publisher = Stockholm Environment Institute|location = Stockholm|isbn = 978-9188714985|page = 67|edition = 2., rev. and enlarged|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book has also been translated into Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;Esrey, S., Gough, J., Rapaport, D., Sawyer, R., Simpson-Hébert, M., Vargas, J., Winblad, U. (1998). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/818 Ecological Sanitation (in Chinese)]. SIDA, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; French&lt;ref&gt;Esrey, S., Gough, J., Rapaport, D., Sawyer, R., Simpson-Hébert, M., Vargas, J., Winblad, U. (1998). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/868 Assainissement écologique (in French)] - Ecological sanitation. Département des Ressources Naturelles et de l'Environnement.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Winblad, U. (1999). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/412 Saneamiento ecológico (in Spanish)] - Ecological Sanitation. SIDA, FES&lt;/ref&gt;

The German government enterprise [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]] also had a large "ecosan program" from 2001 to 2012. Whilst the term "ecosan" was preferred in the initial stages of this program, it was from 2007 onwards more and more replaced by the broader term "[[sustainable sanitation]]". In fact, the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] was founded in 2007 in an attempt to broaden the ecosan concept and to bring together various actors under one umbrella.

Research into how to make reuse of urine and feces safe in agriculture was carried out by Swedish researchers, for example Hakan Jönsson and his team, whose publication on "Guidelines on the Use of Urine and feces in Crop Production"&lt;ref&gt;Joensson, H., Richert Stintzing, A., Vinneras, B., Salomon, E. (2004). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/187 Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production]. Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; was a milestone which was later incorporated into the WHO "Guidelines on Safe Reuse of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater" from 2006.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater] - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple barrier concept to reuse, which is the key cornerstone of this publication, has led to a clear understanding on how excreta reuse can be done safely.

=== Workshops and conferences ===
Initially, there were dedicated "ecosan conferences" to present and discuss research on ecosan projects: 
* A first workshop on ecological sanitation was held in Balingsholm, Sweden in 1997, where all the then established ecosan experts, such as Håkan Jönsson, Peter Morgan (winner of the 2013 [[Stockholm Water Prize]]),&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.siwi.org/prizes/stockholmwaterprize/laureates/2013-2/|title = Sanitation innovator named 2013 Stockholm Water Prize Laureate|date = 2013|accessdate = 13 July 2015|website = |publisher = Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Sawyer, George Anna Clark and Gunder Edström participated. 
* Workshop in Mexico in 1999 with the title "Closing the Loop - Ecological sanitation for food security"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Steven A. |last1=Esrey|title=Closing the loop ecological sanitation for food security|date=2001|publisher=SIDA|location=[Stockholm]|isbn=978-9158689350}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Ecosan conference in Bonn, Germany in 2000
* First international ecosan conference in Nanning, China in 2001
* Second ecosan conference in Lübeck Germany in 2003&lt;ref&gt;GTZ, IWA (2003). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2090 Ecosan - closing the loop - Proceedings of the 2nd international symposium], 7th –11th April 2003, Lübeck, Germany. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH and International Water Association (IWA)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Third ecosan conference in Durban, South Africa in 2005
* Ecosan conference in Fortaleza, Brazil called "International Conference on Sustainable Sanitation - Water and Food Security for Latin America" in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/conference-materials-2/2007/117-conference-qwater-and-food-security-for-latin-americaq-brazil-2007|title = "Water and Food Security for Latin America", Fortaleza|date = 2007|accessdate = 13 July 2015|website = Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|publisher = SuSanA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then the ecosan theme has been integrated into other [[WASH]] conferences, and separate large ecosan conferences have no longer been organised.

=== Disputes amongst experts ===

During the 1990s, when the term ecosan was something new, discussions were heated and confrontational.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Supporters of ecosan claimed the corner on containment, treatment and reuse. The proponents of conventional sanitation systems on the other side defended [[pit latrine]]s and waterborne [[Sewerage|sewage systems]]. Ecosan supporters criticised conventional sanitation for contaminating waterways with nutrients and pathogens.&amp;nbsp;Since about 2007, the two opposing sides have slowly found ways of dealing with each other, and the formation of the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] in that year has further helped to provide a space for all sanitation actors to meet and push into the same direction of sustainable sanitation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Examples ==
* Sweden is the leader in Europe to put ecosan into practice at a larger scale. For example, [[Tanum Municipality]] in Sweden has introduced urine separation toilets due to their very rocky and challenging terrain initially, and later also to recover phosphorus. 
* Sweden has also made it possible in 2013 to certify safe and sanitized blackwater (urine and human excreta) from blackwater systems and for further use as a recognized fertilizer. Such blackwater systems could be vacuum toilets or septic tanks. The criteria for the certification have been developed by the Swedish Institute for Agricultural and Environmental Engineering and may pave the way for farmers to use human waste for agricultural production. The Federation of Swedish Farmers have been active in this development. Furthermore, the Swedish EPA in their last proposal in 2014 has downgraded the hygiene risk associated with urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer6400/978-91-620-6580-5.pdf?pid=9620|title = Swedish EPA|date = |accessdate = 18 October 2014|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the normal storage requirement for hygienic quality for large scale use of urine was 6 months. Now they propose decreasing this to one month.
* Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) ran a large worldwide ecosan research programme called "Ecosanres" from 2001 to 2011. One of the "dry ecosan" pilot projects (i.e. with using [[dry toilet]]s) of this programme was a large scale implementation of [[urine-diverting dry toilet|UDDTs]] in multi-story buildings together with other technologies to allow resource recovery from excreta.&lt;ref&gt;McConville, J., Rosemarin, A. (2012).

Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt; This project was called the Erdos Eco-Town Project in a town called Erdos in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. It was a collaboration between the Dongsheng District government in Erdos and the Stockholm Environment Institute and aimed to save water and provide sanitation services in this drought-stricken and rapidly urbanizing area of northern China. For a variety of technical, social and institutional reasons, the UDDTs were removed after only a few years and the project failed to deliver in the area of nutrient recovery. This project is now well documented  and has raised more awareness of the challenges and disadvantages of "urban ecosan".&lt;ref&gt;Flores, A. (2010).

* [[Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods|SOIL]] in [[Haiti]] built what they call "ecosan toilets" (UDDTs) as part of the emergency relief effort following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. More than 20,000 Haitians are currently using SOIL ecological sanitation toilets and SOIL has produced over 400,000 liters of [[compost]] as a result.&lt;ref&gt;SOIL (2011).

They predominantly work in [[Tamil Nadu]] (India), where the Tamil Nadu State Government provides subsidies for their work. Wherever the Need have also constructed ecosan in other parts of rural [[India]], [[Kenya]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. According to their website, heir ecosan projects have positively affected 50,000 people in the developing world.
* The NGO CREPA which was operating in the French-speaking [[West Africa]] region (now called WSA – Water and Sanitation in Africa) was very active in ecosan promotion from 2002–2010 with a strong focus on UDDTs coupled with reuse in agriculture, especially in [[Burkina Faso]].

The '''equivalent width''' of a [[spectral line]] is a measure of the area of the line on a plot of [[luminous intensity|intensity]] versus [[wavelength]]. It is found by forming a rectangle with a height equal to that of continuum emission, and finding the width such that the area of the rectangle is equal to the area in the spectral line. It is a measure of the strength of spectral features that is primarily used in [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name = "co"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carroll, Bradley |author2=Ostlie, Dale | title = An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics | publisher = Pearson Addison-Wesley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-321-44284-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zaSpQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Formally, the equivalent width is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;W_\lambda = \int (1 - F_\lambda / F_0) d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = "formation_of_stars"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stahler, Steven |author2=Palla, Francesco | title = The Formation of Stars | publisher = [[Wiley-VCH]] | isbn = 3-527-40559-3 | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx98QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; represents the continuum intensity on either side of the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] (or [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]) feature, while &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the intensity across the entire wavelength range of interest. Then &lt;math&gt;W_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the width of a hypothetical line which drops to an intensity of zero and has the "same integrated flux deficit from the continuum as the true one."&lt;ref name="formation_of_stars"/&gt; This equation can be applied to either emission or absorption, but when applied to emission, the value of &lt;math&gt;W_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and so the absolute value is used.

==Applications==
The equivalent width is used as a quantitative measure of the strength of spectral features. The equivalent width is a convenient choice because the shapes of spectral features can vary depending upon the configuration of the system which is producing the lines. For instance, the line may experience [[Doppler broadening]] due to motions of the gas emitting the photons. The photons will be shifted away from the line center, thus rendering the height of the emission line a poor measure of its overall strength. The equivalent width, on the other hand, "measures the fraction of energy removed from the spectrum by the line," regardless of the broadening intrinsic to the line or a detector with poor [[spectral resolution|resolution]].&lt;ref name="spitzer"&gt;{{cite book | author = Spitzer, Lyman | title = Physical Processes in the Interstellar Medium | publisher = Wiley-VCH | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-471-02232-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YPG3AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the equivalent width can in many conditions yield the number of absorbing or emitting atoms.&lt;ref name = "co"/&gt;

For example, measurements of the equivalent width of the [[Balmer series|Balmer alpha]] transition in [[T Tauri star]]s are used in order to classify individual T Tauri stars as being classical or [[Weak-lined T Tauri star|weak-lined]].&lt;ref name="formation_of_stars"/&gt; Also, the equivalent width is used in studying [[star formation]] in [[Lyman series|Lyman alpha]] [[galaxy|galaxies]], as the equivalent width of the Lyman alpha line is related to the star formation rate in the galaxy.&lt;ref name="lae"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15859.x |author1=Dijkstra, Mark |author2=Westra, Eduard | title = Star formation indicators and line equivalent width in Lya galaxies | journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume = 401 | issue = 4 | pages = 2343–2348 | year = 2010 | bibcode = 2010MNRAS.401.2343D|arxiv = 0911.1357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent width is also used in many other situations where a quantitative comparison between line strengths is needed.

The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''.

==Movement repertoire==
The [[gesture]]s in the eurythmist's movement repertoire relate to the sounds and rhythms of speech, to the tones and rhythms of music and to "soul experiences", such as joy and sorrow. Once these fundamental repertoire elements are learned, they can be composed into free artistic expressions. The eurythmist also cultivates a feeling for the qualities of straight lines and curves, the directions of movement in space (forward, backward, up, down, left, right), contraction and expansion, and color. The element of color is also emphasized both through the costuming, usually given characteristic colors for a piece or part and formed of long, loose fabrics that accentuate the movements rather than the bodily form, and through the lighting, which saturates the space and changes with the moods of the piece.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

Eurythmy's aim is to bring the artists' expressive movement and both the performers' and audience's feeling experience into harmony with a piece's content;&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädogogik'', Böhlau Verlag, {{ISBN|3-412-01898-8}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; eurythmy is thus sometimes called "visible music" or "visible speech", expressions that originate with its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], who described eurythmy as an "art of the soul".

Most eurythmy today is performed to [[European classical music|classical (concert) music]] or texts such as [[poetry]] or stories. Silent pieces are also sometimes performed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

===Eurythmy with music===
When performing eurythmy with music (also called ''tone eurythmy''), the three major elements of music, [[melody]], [[harmony]] and [[rhythm]], are all expressed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;  The melody is primarily conveyed through expressing its rise and fall; the specific [[pitch (music)|pitches]]; and the [[interval (music)|intervallic qualities]] present.  Harmony is expressed through movement between tension and release, as expressions of dissonance and consonance, and between the more inwardly directed minor mood and the outwardly directed major mood.  Rhythm is chiefly conveyed through livelier and more contoured movements for quick notes, slower, dreamier movements for longer notes; in addition, longer tones move into the more passive (listening) back space, quicker tones into the more active front space.

Breaths or pauses are expressed through a larger or smaller movement in space, giving new impulse to what follows.  Beat is conveyed through greater emphasis of downbeats, or those beats upon which stress is normally placed.  Beat is generally treated as a subsidiary element. Eurythmy has only occasionally been done to popular music, in which beat plays a large role.

The timbre of individual instruments is brought into the quality both of the tonal gestures and of the whole movement of the eurythmist.  Usually there will be a different eurythmist or group of eurythmists expressing each instrument, for example in chamber or symphonic music.

A piece's [[choreography]] usually expresses elements such as the major or minor key, the shape of the melody line, the interplay between voices or instruments and the relative dominance of one or another voice or instrument.  Thus, musicians can often follow even the finest details of their part in the movements of the eurythmists on stage.  Particular musical forms (e.g. the [[sonata]]) can have special characteristic choreographic expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurythmy with spoken texts===
Eurythmy is often performed with spoken texts such as poetry, stories or plays. ''Speech eurythmy'' includes such elements as the [[phoneme|sounds of speech]], [[rhythm]]s, poetic [[meter (poetry)|meter]]s, [[grammar]] and mood. In speech eurythmy, all the sounds of language have characteristic gestural qualities: the sound of an 'A' is open due to the position of the articulators during the vowel. A 'k' sounds sharper due to the manner of articulation of the consonant, that it is a plosive. Note that it is the audible sounds themselves, not the letters of the written language, that are expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{npsn|date=April 2014}}[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Steiner on eurythmy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eurythmy was conceived in 1911 when a widow brought her young daughter, Lory Smits, who was interested in movement and dance, to the [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]] [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Due to the recent loss of her father, it was necessary for the girl to find a career. Steiner's advice was sought; he suggested that the girl begin working on a new art of movement. As preparation for this, she began to study human anatomy, to explore the human step,  to contemplate the movement implicit in Greek sculpture and dance, and to find movements that would express spoken sentences using the sounds of speech. Soon a number of other young people became interested in this form of expressive movement.

During these years, Steiner was writing a new drama each year for performance at the [[Anthroposophical Society]]'s summer gatherings; beginning in 1912, he began to incorporate the new art of movement into these dramas. When the Society decided to build an artistic center in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]] (this later became known as the [[Goetheanum]]) a small stage group began work and offered weekly performances of the developing art. [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], Steiner's wife, who was a trained actress and speech artist, was given responsibility for training and directing this ensemble. This first eurythmy ensemble went on tour in 1919, performing across [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Alan Stott, ''Eurythmy: its Birth and Development'', {{ISBN|0-9541048-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner saw eurythmy as a unique expression of the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] impulse:
{{quote|It is the task of Anthroposophy to bring a greater depth, a wider vision and a more living spirit into the other forms of art. But the art of Eurythmy could only grow up out of the soul of Anthroposophy; could only receive its inspiration through a purely Anthroposophical conception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Rudolf Steiner's "Lecture on Eurythmy" August 26, 1923]&lt;/ref&gt;|Rudolf Steiner}}

According to Steiner: ''In eurythmy we present in the form and movement of the human organism a direct external proof of a man's share in the life of the supersensible world. When people do eurythmy they are linked directly with the supersensible world. Whenever art is formed from a truly artistic conviction it bears witness to the connection of the human being with the supersensible world.'' (Dornach, 12 September 1920) &lt;ref&gt;Biesantz/Klingborg, The Goetheanum: Rudolf Steiner's Architectural Impulse (London, 1979), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Steiner gave two intensive workshops on different aspects of eurythmy; transcripts of his talks during these workshops are published as ''Eurythmy as Visible Speech'' and ''Eurythmy as Visible Singing''.

Eurythmy ensembles in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] and at the Goetheanum soon became established parts of the cultural life of Europe. The Goetheanum ensemble was recognized with a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris Expo]] of 1937/8. The Stuttgart training and ensemble, led by [[Else Klink]], had to close in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] period but reopened shortly after the close of [[World War II]]. There are now training centers and artistic ensembles in many countries.&lt;ref name="Stott"/&gt;

===Etymology===
The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''. The term was used by Ancient Greek and Roman architects to refer to the harmonious proportions of a design or building;&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka, ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', Sheen and Ward, NY 1946, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''eurythmy'' was used from the 17th to 19th century to refer not only to harmonious architectural proportions, but also to "rhythmical order or movement" and "a graceful proportion and carriage of the body".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/65086 "Eurhythmy"], Oxford English Dictionary, accessed 1/14/14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurythmy as a performing art==
There are notable eurythmy ensembles in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]]; [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]; [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]; [[London]], [[England]]; [[Järna]], [[Sweden]], and [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] (near [[New York City]]). All of these groups both perform locally and tour internationally. Many smaller performing groups also exist [http://www.eurythmie-info.de/Buehnen.htm (see list)]. High schools that have their own performing ensembles include the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120313232919/http://www.sfwaldorf.org/high-school/arts/eurythmy-troupe San Francisco Waldorf High School ensemble].

==Pedagogical eurythmy==
When the first [[Waldorf School]] was founded in 1919, eurythmy was included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Stockmeyer, ''Rudolf Steiner's Curriculum for Waldorf Schools'', Steiner Schools Fellowship, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly recognized as a successful complement to [[gymnastics]] in the school's movement program and is now taught in most Waldorf schools, as well as in many non-Waldorf pre-school centers, kindergartens and schools. It is taught to all ages from pre-schools through high school and into college. Its purpose is to awaken and strengthen the expressive capacities of children through movement, stimulating the child to bring [[imagination]], [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] and [[concept]]ualization to the point where they can manifest these as "vital, moving forms" in physical space.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; It is also thought to improve balance, coordination, concentration, rhythm, and form an awareness of patterns.

Eurythmy pedagogical exercises begin with the straight line and curve and proceed through successively more complicated geometric figures and choreographed forms, developing a child's coordination and concentration. An extensive set of special exercises has also been developed for pedagogical purposes.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; These include metamorphosing geometric patterns and dynamic movement sequences.

Rods or balls are sometimes used in exercises to develop precision in movement, to expand the experience of space, develop precise balance, and to objectify the movement experience. The rods are usually approximately the length of an arm; the balls are of a size to fit comfortably in one hand. Both are generally made of copper, a material receptive to warmth.

Though there are some independent post-graduate trainings for pedagogical eurythmy, this aspect is frequently included in courses focusing on artistic work.

According to the precepts of anthroposophic medicine, a human has four aspects which need to be treated: spirit, soul, life and matter.&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt; Eurythmy is one of the practices said to act on the "life" aspect, and is claimed to effect an "improvement of health related life functions".&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt; A person receiving eurthymy therapy moves under the guidance of a eurythmy therapist, who will have been trained two years beyond the four-year fundamental course in eurythmy.

The '''Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of Oxford''', co-ordinates the teaching of [[theology]] at the [[University of Oxford]], England. It is part of Oxford's [[Humanities Division, University of Oxford|Humanities Division]].

The Theology Faculty Centre was at 34 [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']] in central [[Oxford]]. It is now on the second floor of the Gibson Building in the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]].

== History ==
One of the first series of lectures delivered at [[Oxford University]] was on theology.  As early as 1193, [[Alexander Neckam]] from [[St Albans]] gave biblical and moral lectures on the [[Psalms of David]] and the [[Wisdom of Solomon]]. One of the first university buildings was the [[Divinity School, Oxford|Divinity School]], begun in 1423 specifically for theology lectures.

The modern theological faculty emerges during the reform of the University of Oxford in the nineteenth century. The Final Honour School of Theology -  as a route to the Bachelor of Arts degree - was introduced in 1869. Up until then, theological study was the reserve of graduates and those seeking ordination in the [[Church of England]], who would attend a short series of lectures by the Regius Professors on basic divinity; its focus was on the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], [[Joseph Butler]]'s ''Analogy of Religion'' and a knowledge of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]. Although an honour school in theology was recommended from as early as 1853, it was not until the late 1860s, amidst concerns about the declining influence of the Established Church in the university, that [[Edward Pusey]] and [[Henry Parry Liddon]] began to advocate the introduction of a separate School of Theology responsible for the training of Anglican ordinands. Its curriculum was biblical and historical in its focus, with its first examinations requiring knowledge of scripture, ecclesiastical history and patristics, dogmatic and symbolic theology, apologetics, liturgy and sacred criticism.

The faculty remained as a stronghold of the Church of England well into the 20th century, with denominatinal restrictions on the higher theological degrees (the Bachelor of Divinity and the Doctor of Divinity) and examiners in the Final Honour School of Theology only being abolished in 1920 and 1922 respectively. Still, three of the regius professorships are tied to canonries at [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]], requiring their holders to be in ordained in the Church of England or in a church in communion with the Church of England. A  significant proportion of the faculty's students are preparing for ordination, either as candidates for the B.A. or the B.Th.

Despite the faculty's historic obligations to the Church of England, the foundation of Nonconformist and Roman Catholic institutions in Oxford from the late 19th century onwards, alongside changing academic and ecclesiastical attitudes towards theological study, resulted in the gradual transformation of theology from a purely professional discipline into an aspect of humanistic study.

During the 20th century, Oxford established itself as an internationally significant centre of theological study with important contributions from [[S. R. Driver]], [[William Sanday (theologian)|William Sanday]], [[C. H. Turner]], [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|B. H. Streeter]], [[Norman Powell Williams|N.&amp;nbsp;P. Williams]], [[R. H. Lightfoot]], [[G. R. Driver]], [[Austin Farrer]], [[Maurice Wiles]], [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] and [[Arthur Peacocke]]. Although the department has, more recently, introduced examination papers in modern systematic theology, world religions and even separate postgraduate master's degrees in the study of religion, the Final Honour School of Theology remains primarily focused on biblical and historical study. Each undergraduate devotes at least half of his or her degree to the study of the Old Testament, New Testament, the development of Christian doctrine to AD 451 and modern Christian doctrine. Candidates can then choose four further papers from a wide selection of topics in biblical studies, history, doctrine and world religions.

''Fake or Fortune?'' was created by [[art dealer]] and [[art history|art historian]] [[Philip Mould]] and producer Simon Shaw, inspired by Mould’s book ''Sleuth'' (2009), which was the programme’s working title during the development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/print-edition/2017/august/2304/interview/behind-the-scenes-at-fake-or-fortune/|title=Behind the scenes at Fake or Fortune? {{!}} Antiques Trade Gazette|last=Media|first=ATG|website=www.antiquestradegazette.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-presented by Mould and [[journalism|journalist]] [[Fiona Bruce]], with specialist research carried out by Dr. [[Bendor Grosvenor]] during the first five seasons.

==Synopsis==
In each episode Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce focus their attention on a painting (or a group of paintings), usually related to one particular artist. Season 7, episode 5 saw the show tackle their first [[sculpture]], a work attributed to [[Alberto Giacometti]]. The team, assisted by [[Bendor Grosvenor]] in series 1 to 5, investigate the paintings on a number of fronts: establishing the provenance of the piece by working backwards from present day to the time of the work's creation; on a forensic level, with investigation and scientific tests on the materials used to help establish specific time frames; and examining the unique painting styles and quirks of the artist. This evidence is then presented to established authorities to help demonstrate the legitimacy of the work and its possible addition to the relevant [[catalogue raisonné]].

| ShortSummary    = Experts determined whether three works - ''Lady with Dogs'', ''Darby and Joan'' and ''Crowd Scene'' - were genuine paintings by [[L. S. Lowry]] or forgeries. They had been bought in the 1960s by a Cheshire businessman, Gerald Ames. Lowry was described as "probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers." Experts analysed the paint used in one of the paintings, but the white paint did not match the flake white Lowry claimed to have always used. Lowry claimed to have only used five colours, [[White lead|flake white (lead white)]], [[ivory black]], [[Vermilion|vermillion red]], [[Prussian blue]] and [[yellow ochre]], produced by [[Winsor &amp; Newton]]. Photographic evidence from the 1950s, however, showed that he had experimented with both [[titanium white]] and [[zinc white]]: ''Darby and Joan'' contained traces of zinc white. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0612kxh/fake-or-fortune-series-4-1-lowry |title=BBC iPlayer - Fake or Fortune? - Series 4: 1.

| ShortSummary    = Charles Henty seeks to validate the provenance of two inherited paintings, one by [[Alfred Munnings]] and one, putatively by [[Winston Churchill]], discovered in a coal hole of a house in [[Ebury Street]]. Having suffered the death of his uncle, Charles wishes to sell the paintings to fund the continuation of a working farm in France.

Philip Mould visits David Coombs, a leading expert on the art of Churchill, who is unconvinced by the painting on account of the unfamiliarly well painted figures. He is particularly concerned by the colouring which, he feels, is tonally dissimilar to Churchill's accepted oeuvre. Having travelled to [[France]], the team discover, thanks to Luc Tombeur, that the painting is not of [[Èze]], as originally thought, but of the Fountain of Saint-Paul in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]]. They are introduced to Joy Lutenbacher, who recalls that her aunt, Joan Smith, witnessed Churchill paint the fountain. Bendor Grosvenor also finds evidence in a 1949 newsreel that Churchill painted the scene. Finally, Lutenbacher provides a signed photo of Churchill that had been given to Joan Smith, dated October 1945. Despite this evidence, Coombs' initial 'serious misgivings' have not disappeared, and he decides to include the painting in his [[catalogue raisonné]], although only in the 'Mysteries' section.

Munnings' painting ''[[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]] Winter Landscape'' is found to be of a scene of which the artist was particularly fond and painted more than five times. In a twist of fate, the church depicted in the painting is the final resting place of a notorious art forger, [[Tom Keating]], who was known to have forged Munnings' work. However, this is a mere coincidence and experts Lorian Peralta-Ramos and Dr Bill Teatheredge agree that the painting should be accepted as a work by Munnings.

| ShortSummary       = A [[portrait]] purportedly done by [[Lucian Freud]] is brought to the attention of the team. However, an outright denial by Freud himself looms over the team; the artist claimed he never painted the artwork under investigation. Faced with repudiating the words of the artist himself, the team trace the painting back to Freud's time during his teenage years at [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]], just before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Fiona finds out through both a previous work's history and through an interview with Freud's daughter that Freud didn't consider works he finished himself to be worthy of his attention, especially ones where someone else had done work on his artwork, suggesting a reason for his denial. Despite the hope of [[DNA evidence]] by an embedded hair in the painting not panning out, notes from Freud's [[solicitor]] and forensic evidence of the paint and the paint strokes indicate most of the painting was done by one hand, possibly done on an abandoned canvas that already was painted beforehand at the art school Freud attended and then discarded to the side. In the end, when presented with the collected evidence, a panel of three experts on Freud's work deem the painting to have been mostly done by Freud, significantly increasing its value at auction.

| ShortSummary       = A woman asks the team to prove [[Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary|a work]], housed at Castle of Park in [[Aberdeenshire]], was painted by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The painting was acquired by the woman's husband when he worked for [[Christie's]] back in the 1980s, but he never managed to get it authenticated before he died. Delaroche did paint Saint Amelia as a royal commission done for [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Maria Amalia]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I]], before they were deposed in 1848. The artwork could thus be a [[lost work]] from the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. The alternative Philip needs to investigate is if it is instead a (legitimate) copy done by contemporary painters or printmakers, as Delaroche proved popular to replicate. Bendor reveals at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in [[Surrey]], where [[Queen Victoria]] offered the deposed couple refuge from the Revolution, that the artwork in question did reach English shores, as it is prominently displayed in a painting of Amalia's bedroom by historical watercolour artist [[Joseph Nash]]. Differences in colour to known copies of the painting are scientifically explained by pigment degradation. Though the team is unable to establish the provenance between the death of Maria Amalia's son in 1896 and the 1980s purchase, the painting is still deemed to be a genuine Delaroche and the lost work of Maria Amalia. In an 11th hour surprise, the appraiser reveals a letter written by Delaroche where he details how he was disgusted at the pitiful state of the picture when he saw it looking over the commission of a [[stained glass window]] version of his artwork and he undertakes the task of restoring the picture back to its former state, thus explaining the rest of the artifacts revealed by the forensic analysis.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2016|07|31|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       =  A [[Lincolnshire]] resident asks the team to investigate a sketch that is purported to be done by [[Auguste Rodin]]. Known primarily for sculptures like ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Thinker]]'', Rodin was also accomplished as an artist in other forms, his best known work being a series of [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] of a [[Royal ballet of Cambodia|Cambodian dance troupe]] that toured in Paris around the turn of the 20th century. The drawing was inherited from the owner's mother while she was living in Mexico in the 1940s after doing some work for the interior of a restaurant. Bendor's research reveals that of an estimated 150 Cambodian sketches done by Rodin, 120 are in the [[Musee Rodin]] and 21 authentic works are in other museums, which leaves fewer than 10 in private hands. In addition, Rodin was an often-counterfeited artist in both his sculptures and artwork. The name [[Ernest Durig]] pops up in the research: at the time, he was known as a respectable sculptor and art dealer, but long after the drawing was given to the owner's mother, Durig was exposed as a prolific forger of Rodin; his name was most recently at the center of a Rodin sketches forgery scandal at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 2014. Going to the Musée Rodin, Fiona finds out that the dancers had mesmerized Rodin so much that one series of sketches was done on wrapping paper obtained from a [[greengrocer]], due to his forgetting his sketch paper. When looking at several other sketches, Philip latches on to a particular technique of Rodin, where he blotted the watercolours with minimal strokes while making the dancers seem to be floating. Denied access to a cache of Durig sketches at [[MoMA]] for comparison, a signature expert casts more doubt, leading Fiona to reveal that Rodin would leave it up to recipients of his sketches to make their own signature, as he couldn't be cared to sign his works. The appraiser who revealed the Rodin fakes at the Musée d'Orsay deems the sketch to be not by Rodin, but by the forger Durig.

| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2017|09|10|df=yes}}
| ShortSummary       = The team investigate two possible works by [[Paul Gauguin]] which have been brought to their attention. One appeared to be the first pencil sketch for Gauguin's Tahitian masterpiece ''[[When Will You Marry?|When Will you Marry?]].'' It had been bought by the viewer's art historian grandfather, but its authenticity was in doubt because it appeared to be a copy of a sketch in Gauguin's notebook. The team establish provenance that takes it back to Gauguin and show that it had been cut from the sketchbook sometime between 1916 and 1932. It is accepted as genuine by the Wildenstein Institute.

The second possible Gauguin is a still life depicting a bowl of fruit which had been sold as a genuine Gauguin several times and had appeared in a [[catalogue Raisonne]]. However, the signature and dedication had been added after the original paint had dried and the signature did not appear genuine. The sale in which it had first appeared included a number of works now attributed to other artists. Connoisseurship also raises doubts about the style and Mould and Bruce conclude that it is not genuine.

The painting is not included, however, in the current catalogue raisonné compiled by expert Patricia Reed. A wealth of new scientific and documentary evidence was collected, including provenance to a previous wealthy London art-collector, [[x-ray]] evidence to show the board had originally borne a painting of [[freesia]]s (missing from Nicolson's catalogue), and a comparison of the pigments in the paint with traces left in an original painting box owned by Nicolson's grandson.

| ShortSummary       =  Two sketchbooks found in a garden shed in [[Saint-Émilion]] were given to a teenage boy, Alain, by his grandmother in 1965. Although she never revealed their origin, they were thought to be the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Alain waited 50 years before presenting the sketches to the committee responsible for authenticating the work of Toulouse-Lautrec. The committee did not accept them as authentic and concluded they were the work of another artist [[René Princeteau]]. The sketchbooks contain images of women, horses, sailors, soldiers and dogs, not the subjects for which Toulouse-Lautrec is best known. Some of the pages are dated 1880, when Toulouse-Lautrec would have been just a teenager. The team travel to [[Albi]] in southern France, where Toulouse-Lautrec was born, and visit his family home, Chateau du Bosc, where he spent much of his youth. Compelling technical analysis is provided by print expert Harriet Stratis from [[Chicago]] who reports that the sketchbooks match those already known to be by Toulouse-Lautrec and that some sheets have tiny pin-pricks in each corner, which are a distinctive feature of the artist's hand. The committee does not provide a clear decision either way, but offers to re-examine the books at a later date.

Philip meets Moore's only child Mary, who says she can see her father's hand in the sketch. Forensic tests on the ink used in the sketch are inconclusive, but [[infrared]] analysis reveals more sketches on the back of the paper. Fiona discovers that in the early 1930s [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], the man who amassed the hoard, worked as a museum curator and exhibited works by Moore who, at the time, was less appreciated at home in Britain. Furthermore, Gurlitt later became one of only four dealers asked to sell off what the Nazis branded as [[degenerate art]] on the international market, purchasing some for himself. When the team find an accurate description of the sketch, they can link one of Gurlitt's purchases to what was exhibited years before, thus establishing an unbroken provenance. In the end the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] accepts the sketch as a genuine Moore.

| ShortSummary      = The team investigates two rare portraits of [[black British]] subjects from the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures which are highly unusual in their positive depiction of black sitters at a time when Britain was still heavily engaged in [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]]. 

The first case is a double portrait featuring [[Dido Elizabeth Belle|Dido Belle]], a former slave who became a member of the aristocratic Mansfield family, and her cousin Lady Elizabeth. The painting is on display at [[Scone Palace]] in Scotland and was commissioned by the first [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Dido Belle's guardian, sometime in the late 1770s or early 1780s. The [[Abolitionism|abolishionist]] Mansfield, a judge, had ruled in the infamous case of the [[Zong massacre]]. The painting's original attribution, to [[Johan Zoffany]], is considered wrong, but the identity of the actual artist is unclear. The second painting, even more unusual, is of two beautifully-dressed black girls holding a book in what appears to be a tropical landscape. Early clues suggest this could be a political painting, perhaps connected to the campaign to abolish slavery in British colonies. The signature was not legible.

In the end, forensic and other evidence revealed the first portrait to be by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]] and the second by [[Emma Soyer|Emma Jones]].

Philip visits the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]] at the University of East Anglia, where he learns more about how the cast would have been produced. The investigation leads Fiona to France where the current owner's grandmother modelled at the same time and place where Giacometti worked. Without a clear trail of evidence linking the piece to the sculptor, however, the team changes its approach, and discovers that one of the genuine ''Gazing Head'' plasters is considered lost by its British owner, the estate of [[Sidney John Woods|S. J. Woods]], suggesting that it might be possible the piece was purchased from Woods rather than in Paris. 

When the piece and the collected evidence is presented to the [[Giacometti Foundation]] in Paris, the first response is that further studies needed to be made. After several months - the episode was originally scheduled to be aired as part of series 6&lt;ref name="Giacometti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mouldgiacometti" /&gt; - their provisional findings conclude the piece was once an original sculpture by Giacometti, but that the damage sustained may prevent them from accepting it as a genuine work.

Describing the outcome of the first episode of series one as a "scandal", Sam Wollaston writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' found the programme "incredibly interesting" and praised it "for being about just one case in which you can become totally involved, instead of flitting between three, which is what so many documentaries seem to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=TV review: ''Fake or Fortune?''; ''The Marriage Ref''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/19/tv-review-fake-or-fortune|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Ceri Radford was described as being "flabbergasted" at the result of the first episode, but concluded her review by saying: "This may have been a disappointing finale, but it at least confirmed that this aesthetically pleasing, quietly enjoyable new series isn't afraid to thwart expectations."&lt;ref name="Radford" /&gt; [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] in ''[[The Independent]]'' had a mixed view as a result of the presentation of the facts, saying: "It was full of cliffhanger tension and thrilling moments of discovery.

Reviewing an episode of the seventh season, Michael Hogan of The Telegraph wrote "Arts programming is an increasingly endangered beast on prime time television.

{{Love sidebar|types}}
'''Friendship''' is a relationship of mutual [[affection]] between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford Dictionary Press |title=Definition for friend |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/friend |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friendship is a stronger form of [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal bond]] than an association. Friendship has been studied in academic fields such as [[Communication studies|communication]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[philosophy]]. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including [[social exchange theory]], [[equity theory]], [[relational dialectics]], and [[attachment styles]].

Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of such bonds. Such characteristics include affection; [[kindness]], [[love]], [[virtue]], [[sympathy]], [[empathy]], [[honesty]], [[altruism]], [[loyalty]], mutual [[understanding]] and [[compassion]], enjoyment of each other's company, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings to others, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend.

==Developmental psychology==
===Childhood===
[[Image:Childhood friends at a carnival.jpg|thumb|Childhood friends]]
The understanding of friendship in children tends to be more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremner|first1=J. Gavin|title=An Introduction to Developmental Psychology|date=May 8, 2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405186520|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-YGCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|498}}{{efn|In comparison to older respondents, who tend to describe friendship in terms of psychological rather than mostly physical aspects.&lt;ref name="bremner"/&gt;{{rp|498}}}} These friendships provide opportunity for [[Play (activity)|playing]] and practicing [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]].&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}} Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like [[sharing]], and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}}&lt;ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"&gt;Newman, B. M. &amp; Newman, P.R. (2012). Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach. Stanford, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/childhood-friends-most-important-friends/1063153/|title=Your Childhood Friendships Are The Best Friendships You'll Ever Have|last=|first=|date=17 Jun 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.&lt;ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"/&gt;

Based upon the reports of teachers and mothers, 75% of preschool children had at least one friend. This figure rose to 78% through the [[fifth grade]], as measured by co-nomination as friends, and 55% had a mutual best friend.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|247}} About 15% of children were found to be chronically friendless, reporting periods without mutual friends at least six months.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|250}}

Potential benefits of friendship include the opportunity to learn about empathy and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2013|title= What Friends Teach Children|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201305/what-friends-teach-children}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coaching from parents can be useful in helping children to make friends. [[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] describes three key ingredients of children's friendship formation: (1) openness, (2) similarity, and (3) shared fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 1)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 2)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 3)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can also help children understand social guidelines they haven't learned on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, N. M. &amp; Kennedy-Moore, E. (2003). The Unwritten Rules of Friendship: Simple Strategies to Help Your Child Make Friends.

Academic Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and others, Kennedy-Moore outlines developmental stages in children's friendship, reflecting an increasing capacity to understand others' perspectives: "I Want It My Way", "What's In It For Me?", "By the Rules", "Caring and Sharing", and "Friends Through Thick and Thin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= Children's Growing Friendships|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201202/childrens-growing-friendships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[File:Bhutan, Friends - Flickr - babasteve.jpg|thumb|Two friends in Bhutan]]
In adolescence, friendships become "more giving, sharing, frank, supportive, and spontaneous." Adolescents tend to seek out peers who can provide such qualities in a [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocal relationship]], and to avoid peers whose problematic behavior suggest they may not be able to satisfy these needs.&lt;ref name="reisman"/&gt; Relationships begin to maintain a focus on shared values, [[loyalty]], and common interests, rather than physical concerns like proximity and access to play things that more characterize childhood.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

A study performed at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] examined over 9,000 American adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing, fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that adolescents were less likely to engage in problem behavior when their friends did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had good [[mental health]]. The opposite was found regarding adolescents who did engage in problematic behavior. Whether adolescents were influenced by their friends to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those friends, and whether they and their friendship groups "fit in" at school.&lt;ref&gt;Crosnoe, R., &amp; Needham, B. (2004) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15015689 Holism, contextual variability, and the study of friendships in adolescent development]. [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers from [[Purdue University]] found that friendships formed during [[Higher education|post-secondary education]] last longer than friendships formed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Glenn (August 7, 2007). [http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2007b/070807SparksFriendship.html Study shows what makes college buddies lifelong friends]. [[Purdue University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
[[File:3 barefoot females smiling and sitting on a bench.jpg|thumb|Friendships in adulthood]]
Friendship in adulthood provides companionship, affection, as well as emotional support, and contributes positively to mental well-being and improved physical health.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schulz|first1=Richard|title=The Encyclopedia of Aging: Fourth Edition, 2-Volume Set|date=2006|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=9780826148445|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgS29D0Mr4gC|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|426}}

Adults may find it particularly difficult to maintain meaningful friendships in the workplace. "The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Alex|title=Friends of a Certain Age: Why Is It Hard To Make Friends Over 30?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 25, 2012|date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults value the financial security of their jobs more than friendship with coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Susan|title=Workplace Friendships: Asset or Liability?|url=http://career-advice.monster.com/in-the-office/workplace-issues/workplace-friendships-asset-or-liab/article.aspx|website=[[Monster.com]]|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of adults have an average of two close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8876376/Most-adults-have-only-two-close-friends.html|title=Most adults have 'only two close friends'|date=November 8, 2011|last=Willis|first=Amy|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 11, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies with adults suggest that friendships and other supportive relationships do enhance self-esteem.&lt;ref name="www2.psych.purdue.edu"&gt;Berndt, T. J. (2002). [http://www2.psych.purdue.edu/~berndt/Friendship%20quality%20and%20social%20development.pdf Friendship Quality and Social Development]. American Psychological Society. [[Purdue University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Older adults===
[[Old age|Older adults]] continue to report high levels of personal satisfaction in their friendships as they age, and even as the overall number of friends tends to decline. This satisfaction is associated with an increased ability to accomplish [[activities of daily living]], as well as a reduced decline in [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], decreased instances of hospitalization, and better outcomes related to [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;{{rp|427}} The overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blieszner|first1=Rosemary|last2=Adams|first2=Rebecca G.|title=Adult Friendship|date=Jun 10, 1992|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780803936737|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGs5DQAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

As on review phrased it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Research within the past four decades has now consistently found that older adults reporting the highest levels of happiness and general well being also report strong, close ties to numerous friends.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Jon F.|last2=Federowicz|first2=Molly|last3=Nussbaum|first3=Paul D.|title=Brain Health and Optimal Engagement for Older Adults|date=February 9, 2010|publisher=Editorial Aresta S.C.|isbn=9788493744007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwxrMe5Fo6QC|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As family responsibilities and vocational pressures lessen, friendships become more important. Among the elderly, friendships can provide links to the larger community, serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members.&lt;ref name="yearbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burleson|first1=Brant R.|title=Communication Yearbook 19|date=Mar 22, 2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780415873178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8mMAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32-3}} Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction. Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Exploring-Lifespan-Development-3E/9780205957385.page|title=Pearson – Exploring Lifespan Development, 3/E|author=Laura E. Berk|year=2014|pages=696|isbn=9780205957385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental issues==

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships, due to a limited ability to build [[social skills]] through [[observational learning]], difficulties attending to [[social cues]], and because of the social impacts of [[impulsive behavior]] and a greater tendency to engage in behavior that may be seen as disruptive by their peers.&lt;ref name="hoza"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiener|first1=Judith|last2=Schneider|first2=Barry H.|title=A multisource exploration of the friendship patterns of children with and without learning disabilities|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=2002|volume=30|issue=2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11369370|pages=127–41|accessdate=26 September 2017|pmid=12002394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 review, no treatment was identified which effectively address peer functioning in children with ADHD, and treatments which addressed other aspects of the disorder were not found to eliminate issues related to peer functioning.&lt;ref name="hoza"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoza|first1=Betsy|title=Peer Functioning in Children With ADHD|journal=''Journal of Pediatric Psychology''|date=June 7, 2007|volume=32|issue=6|pages=101–106|doi=10.1016/j.ambp.2006.04.011|pmid=17261489|pmc=2572031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
Certain symptoms of [[autism spectrum]] disorders can interfere with the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack of [[social skills]]. Children with autism have been found to be more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with some sort of a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon |first2=Marjorie |last3=Aviezer|first3=Anat|last4=Heung|first4=Kelly|last5=Gazit|first5=Lilach|last6=Brown|first6=John|last7=Rogers|first7=Sally J.|title=Children with Autism and Their Friends: A Multidimensional Study of Friendship in High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=3 January 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=135–150|doi=10.1007/s10802-007-9156-x|pmid=18172754}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a lack of social skills that would usually inhibit friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon|first2=Marjorie|last3=Rogers|first3=Sally J.|title=Predicting Friendship Quality in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Typical Development|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=29 December 2009|volume=40|issue=6|pages=751–761|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0928-8|pmid=20039110|pmc=2864904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Frankel et al. showed that parental intervention and instruction plays an important role in such children developing friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Fred|last2=Myatt|first2=Robert|last3=Sugar|first3=Catherine|author3-link=Catherine Sugar|last4=Whitham|first4= Cynthia|last5=Gorospe|first5=Clarissa M.|last6=Laugeson|first6=Elizabeth|title=A Randomized Controlled Study of Parent-assisted Children's Friendship Training with Children having Autism Spectrum Disorders|journal= Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=8 January 2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=827–842|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0932-z|pmid=20058059|pmc=2890979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. Paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate friendships and guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rossetti|first1=Zachary|first2=Deborah|last2=Goessling|title=Paraeducators' Roles in Facilitating Friendships Between Secondary Students With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorders or Developmental Disabilities|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|date=July–August 2010|volume=42|series=6|pages=64–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lessons and training may help peers of children with autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', bullying is most likely to occur against children with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s who have the most potential to live independently. Such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with full autism, but they are more likely to be [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to [[social cue]]s, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|title=School Bullies Prey on Children With Autism|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/school-bullies-prey-on-children-with-autism/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down syndrome===
Children with [[Down syndrome]] have increased difficulty forming friendships. They experience a [[language delay]] causing them to have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play ''alongside'' a friend but not ''with'' them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.&lt;ref&gt;"Recreation &amp; Friendship." Recreation &amp; Friendship – National Down Syndrome Society. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Health==
Studies have found that strong social supports improve a persons's prospects for good health and longevity. Conversely, loneliness and a lack of social supports have been linked to an increased risk of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], viral [[infection]]s, and [[cancer]], as well as higher mortality rates overall. Two researchers have even termed friendship networks a "behavioral [[vaccine]]" that boosts both physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Friendship, social support, and health. 2007 Sias, Patricia M; Bartoo, Heidi. In L'Abate, Luciano. ''Low-cost approaches to promote physical and mental health: Theory, research, and practice''.

There is a large body of research linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large [[Prospective cohort study|prospective studies]] that follow people over time, and while there may be a [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.&lt;ref&gt;Social networks and health: It's time for an intervention trial. 2005. Jorm, Anthony F. Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health. Vol 59(7) Jul 2005, 537–538.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
The lack of friendship has been found to play a role in increasing risk of [[suicidal ideation]] among female adolescents, including having more friends who were not themselves friends with one another. However, no similar effect was observed for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friendships play key role in suicidal thoughts of girls, but not boys|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2004-01/osu-fpk010604.php|website=EurekAlert!|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=26 September 2017|date=January 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bearman|first1=Peter S.|last2=Moody|first2=James|title=Suicide and Friendships Among American Adolescents|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=January 1, 2004|volume=94|issue=1|pages=89–95|doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.1.89|pmid=14713704|pmc=1449832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having few or no friends is a major indicator in the diagnosis of a range of [[mental disorders]].&lt;ref name="reisman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisman|first1=John M.|title=Friendship and its Implications for Mental Health or Social Competence|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=September 1, 1985|volume=5|issue=3|pages=383–91|doi=10.1177/0272431685053010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher friendship quality directly contributes to self-esteem, self-confidence, and social development.&lt;ref name="www2.psych.purdue.edu"/&gt; A [[World Database of Happiness|World Happiness Database]] study found that people with close friendships are happier, although the absolute number of friends did not increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23097143 | work=BBC News | title=Can we make ourselves happier? | date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other studies have suggested that children who have friendships of a high quality may be protected against the development of certain disorders, such as anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brendgen | first1 = M. | last2 = Vitaro | first2 = F. | last3 = Bukowski | first3 = W.

==Dissolution==
The dissolution of a friendship may be viewed as a personal rejection, or may be the result of natural changes over time, as friends grow more distant both physically and emotionally. The disruption of friendships has been associated with increased [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anger]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and may be highly stressful events, especially in childhood. However, potential negative effects can be mitigated if the dissolution of a friendship is replaced with another close relationship.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|248}}

==Demographics==
Friends tend to be more similar to one another in terms of age, gender, behavior, [[substance abuse]], personal disposition, and academic performance.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|248}}&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;{{rp|426}}&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;{{rp|55–6}} In [[Multiculturalism|ethnically diverse]] countries, there is broad evidence that children and adolescents tend to form friendships with others of the same race or ethnicity, beginning in [[preschool]], and peaking in middle or late childhood.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelazo|first1=Philip David|title=The Oxford Handbook of Developmental Psychology, Vol. 2: Self and Other|date=Mar 14, 2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199958474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5m_D4NYVRI8C|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|264}}

===Gender differences===
In general, female-female friendship interactions among children tend to be more focused on interpersonal connections and [[social support|mutual support]], while male-male interaction tends to be more focused on [[social status]], and may actively discourage the expression of emotional needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Margaret|title=Developmental Psychology: A Student's Handbook|date=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781841691923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yLl11fWXr8C|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320-2}} Females report more anxiety, jealousy, and relational victimization and less stability related to their friendships, and males report higher levels of physical victimization. Although males and females tend to report comparative levels of satisfaction with their friendships.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|249–50}}

Among older adults, women tend to be more socially adept than their male peers, and many older men may rely upon a female companion, such as a spouse, in order to compensate for their comparative lack of social skills.&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

==In animals==
{{see also|Ethology|Altruism in animals|Sociobiology}}
[[File:CUTE FRIENDSHIP.JPG|thumb|A man with a squirrel]]
Friendship is also found among animals of higher intelligence, such as higher [[mammal]]s and some [[bird]]s. Cross-species friendships are common between humans and [[domestic animal]]s. Cross-species friendships may also occur between two non-human animals, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Research by McLennan measured the heart rates of [[cattle]], and showed that the cows were more stressed when alone or with an unfamiliar cow than they were with friends, lending support to the idea that cows are social animals, capable of forming close bonds with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heifer so lonely: How cows have best friends and get stressed when they are separated|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2011124/Cows-best-friends-stressed-separated.html|accessdate=19 March 2012|newspaper=Mail Online|date=5 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fuzzy subalgebras''' theory is a chapter of [[fuzzy set theory]]. It is obtained from an interpretation in a multi-valued logic of axioms usually expressing the notion of [[subalgebra]] of a given [[algebraic structure]].

== Definition ==

Consider a first order language for algebraic structures with a [[Unary operator|monadic predicate]] symbol S. Then a ''fuzzy subalgebra'' is a [[fuzzy model]] of a theory containing, for any ''n''-ary operation h, the axioms

&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1, ..., \forall x_n (S(x_1) \land ..... \land S(x_n) \rightarrow S(h(x_1, ..., x_n))&lt;/math&gt;

and, for any constant c, S(c).

The first axiom expresses the closure of S with respect to the operation h, and the second expresses the fact that c is an element in S. As an example, assume that the [[valuation structure]] is defined in [0,1] and denote by &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; the operation in [0,1] used to interpret the conjunction. Then a fuzzy subalgebra of an algebraic structure whose domain is D is defined by a fuzzy subset {{nobreak|s : D → [0,1]}} of D such that, for every d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in D, if '''h''' is the [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the n-ary operation symbol h, then

* &lt;math&gt;s(d_1) \odot... \odot s(d_n) \leq s(\mathbf{h}(d_1,...,d_n))&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if '''c''' is the interpretation of a constant c such that s('''c''') = 1.

A largely studied class of fuzzy subalgebras is the one in which the operation &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the minimum. In such a case it is immediate to prove the following proposition.

'''Proposition.''' A fuzzy subset s of an algebraic structure defines a fuzzy subalgebra if and only if for every λ in [0,1], the [[closed cut]] {x ∈ D : s(x)≥ λ} of s is a subalgebra.

== Fuzzy subgroups and submonoids ==

The fuzzy subgroups and the fuzzy submonoids are particularly interesting classes of fuzzy subalgebras. In such a case a fuzzy subset ''s'' of a monoid (M,•,'''u''') is a '''fuzzy submonoid''' if and only if

# &lt;math&gt;s(\mathbf{u})=1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;s(x) \odot s(y) \leq s(x \cdot y)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the [[neutral element]] in A.

Given a group G, a '''fuzzy subgroup''' of G is a fuzzy submonoid s of G such that 
* s(x) ≤ s(x&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

It is possible to prove that the notion of fuzzy subgroup is strictly related with the notions of [[fuzzy equivalence]]. In fact, assume that S is a set, G a group of transformations in S and (G,s) a fuzzy subgroup of G. Then, by setting 

* e(x,y) = Sup{s(h) : h is an element in G such that h(x) = y}

we obtain a fuzzy equivalence. Conversely, let e be a fuzzy equivalence in S and, for every transformation h of S, set 

* s(h)= Inf{e(x,h(x)): x∈S}.

Then s defines a fuzzy sub[[group of transformation]] in S. In a similar way we can relate the fuzzy submonoids with the fuzzy orders.

In [[management]] literature, '''gap analysis''' involves the comparison of actual performance with potential or desired performance{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}. If an organization does not make the best use of current resources, or forgoes investment in [[Capital (economics)|capital]] or technology, it may produce or perform below an idealized potential. This concept is similar to an economy's production being below the [[production possibilities frontier]].

Gap analysis identifies gaps between the [[operations research|optimized]] [[Resource allocation|allocation]] and integration of the inputs (resources), and the current allocation-level. This may reveal areas that can be improved. Gap analysis involves determining, documenting, and improving the difference between business requirements and current capabilities. Gap analysis naturally flows from [[benchmarking]] and from other assessments. Once the general expectation of performance in an industry is understood, it is possible to compare that expectation with the company's current level of performance. This comparison becomes the gap analysis.  Such analysis can be performed at the strategic or at the operational level of an organization.

Gap analysis is a formal study of what a [[business]] is doing currently and where it wants to go in the future.  It can be conducted, in different perspectives, as follows:
# [[Organization]] (e.g., Human Resources)
# Business direction
# [[Business process]]es
# [[Information technology]]

Gap analysis provides a foundation for measuring investment of time, money and human resources required to achieve a particular outcome (e.g. to turn the salary payment process from paper-based to paperless with the use of a system). Note that "GAP analysis" has also been used{{by whom?|date=June 2015}} as a means of classifying how well a product or solution meets a targeted need or set of requirements. In this case, "GAP" can be used as a ranking of "Good", "Average" or "Poor". (This terminology appears in the [[PRINCE2]] project management publication from the [[Office of Government Commerce|OGC (Office of Government Commerce)]].)
  
The need for new products or additions to existing lines may emerge from portfolio analysis, in particular from the use of the Boston Consulting Group [[Growth-share matrix]]&amp;mdash;or the need may emerge from the regular process of following trends in the requirements of consumers. At some point, a gap emerges between what existing products offer and what the consumer demands. The organization must fill that gap to survive and grow.
  
Gap analysis can identify gaps in the market. Thus, comparing forecast profits to desired profits reveals the ''planning gap''. This represents a goal for new activities in general, and new products in particular.  
The planning gap can be divided into three main elements:{{huh?|date=June 2015}}

==Usage gap==
The usage gap is the gap between the total potential for the market and actual current usage by all consumers in the market. Data for this calculation includes:
* Market usage
* Existing usage

==Existing usage==
Existing consumer usage makes up the total current market, from which market shares, for example, are calculated. It usually derives from marketing research, most accurately from panel research, but also from adhoc work. Sometimes it may be available from figures that governments or industries have collected. However, these are often based on categories that make bureaucratic sense but are less helpful in marketing terms. The ''''usage gap'''' is thus:  
: usage gap = market potential – existing usage 
  
This is an important calculation. Many, if not most, marketers accept existing market size&amp;mdash;suitably projected their forecast timescales&amp;mdash;as the boundary for expansion plans. Though this is often the most realistic assumption, it may impose an unnecessary limit on horizons. For example: the original market for video-recorders was limited to professional users who could afford high prices. Only after some time did the technology extend to the mass market.
  
In the public sector, where service providers usually enjoy a monopoly, the usage gap is probably the most important factor in activity development. However, persuading more consumers to take up family benefits, for example, is probably more important to the relevant government department than opening more local offices.
  
Usage gap is most important for brand leaders. If a company has a significant share of the whole market, they may find it worthwhile to invest in making the market bigger. This option is not generally open to minor players, though they may still profit by targeting specific offerings as market extensions.
  
All other gaps relate to the difference between existing sales (market share) and total sales of the market as a whole. The difference is the competitor share. These gaps therefore, relate to competitive activity.

==Product gap==
The ''product gap''—also called the ''segment'' or ''positioning gap''—is that part of the market a particular organization is excluded from because of product or service characteristics. This may be because the market is segmented and the organization does not have offerings in some segments, or because the organization positions its offerings in a way that effectively excludes certain potential consumers—because competitive offerings are much better placed for these consumers.
  
This segmentation may result from deliberate policy. Segmentation and positioning are powerful marketing techniques, but the trade-off—against better focus—is that market segments may effectively be put beyond reach. On the other hand, product gap can occur by default; the organization has thought out its positioning, its offerings drifted to a particular market segment.
  
The product gap may be the main element of the planning gap where an organization can have productive input; hence the emphasis on the importance of correct positioning.

==Use to develop a better process==
A gap analysis can also be used to analyze gaps in processes and the gulf between the existing outcome and the desired outcome.
This step process can be illustrated by the example below:
* Identify the existing process: fishing by using fishing rods
* Identify the existing outcome: we can manage to catch 20 fish per day
* Identify the desired outcome: we want to catch 100 fish per day
* Identify and document the gap: it is a difference of 80 fish
* Identify the process to achieve the desired outcome: we can use an alternative method such as using a fishing net
* Develop the means to fill the gap: acquire and use a fishing net
* Develop and prioritize Requirements to bridge the gap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clients.criticalimpact.com/go.cfm?a=1&amp;b=190498&amp;c=24428&amp;f=7027524de51ceed3ef5797149eaa845b522d9f0eaa681b4f |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120053323/http://clients.criticalimpact.com/go.cfm?a=1&amp;b=190498&amp;c=24428&amp;f=7027524de51ceed3ef5797149eaa845b522d9f0eaa681b4f |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-20 |title=Business Analyst &amp;#124; Do We Need a Mature GAP Analysis? |website=Clients.criticalimpact.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gap analysis can also be used to compare one process to others performed elsewhere, which are often identified through benchmarking. In this usage, one compares each process side-by-side and step-by-step and then notes the differences. One then analyzes each deviation to determine if there is any benefit to changing to the alternate process. The results of this analysis (in the context of the benefits and detriments of changing processes) may support the maintenance of the current process, the wholesale adoption of an alternate process, or a fusion of different aspects of each process.

'''Gauge vector–tensor gravity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Exirifard|first=Qasem|title=GravitoMagnetic force in modified Newtonian dynamics|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|date=27 August 2013|volume=2013|issue=08|pages=046–046|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2013/08/046|arxiv=1107.2109|bibcode=2013JCAP...08..046E}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''GVT''') is a relativistic generalization of [[Mordehai Milgrom]]'s [[modified Newtonian dynamics]] (MOND) paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgrom|first=M.|title=A modification of the Newtonian dynamics as a possible alternative to the hidden mass hypothesis|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1 July 1983|volume=270|pages=365|doi=10.1086/161130|bibcode=1983ApJ...270..365M}}&lt;/ref&gt; where gauge fields cause the MOND behavior. The former covariant realizations of MOND such as the Bekenestein's [[tensor–vector–scalar gravity]] and the Moffat's [[scalar–tensor–vector gravity]] attribute MONDian behavior to some scalar fields.  GVT is the first example wherein the MONDian behavior is mapped to the gauge vector fields.
The main features of GVT can be summarized as follows:
* As it is derived from the [[action principle]], GVT respects [[conservation laws]];
* In the [[weak-field approximation]] of the spherically symmetric, static solution, GVT reproduces the MOND acceleration formula;
* It can accommodate [[gravitational lens]]ing.
* It is in total agreement with the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] in the strong and Newtonian gravities.
Its dynamical degrees of freedom are:
* Two [[gauge field]]s:  &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu}, \widetilde{B}_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;;
* A metric, &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Details==

The physical geometry, as seen by particles, represents the [[Finsler geometry]]–Randers type:

:&lt;math&gt;ds = \sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu} + \left (B_\mu + \widetilde{B}_\mu \right ) dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt; 

This implies that the orbit of a particle with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; can be derived from the following effective action:

:&lt;math&gt;S= m \int d\tau \left (\frac{1}{2}  \dot{x}^\mu \dot{x}^\nu  g_{\mu\nu}+ \left (B_\mu+\widetilde{B}_\mu \right ) \dot{x}^\mu  \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The geometrical quantities are Riemannian. GVT, thus, is a bi-geometric gravity. 

===Action===
The metric's action coincides to that of the Einstein–Hilbert gravity:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{\text{Grav}} = \frac{1}{16 \pi G} \int d^4 x  \, \sqrt{-g} R&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar constructed out from the metric. The action of the gauge fields follow:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
S_{B}  &amp;= -\frac{1}{16 \pi G\kappa \ell^2} \int d^4x \sqrt{- g}\, L \left (\frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu} \right ) \\
S_{\widetilde{B}}  &amp;= -\frac{1}{16 \pi G\widetilde{\kappa} \widetilde{\ell}^2} \int d^4x \sqrt{- g}\, L \left (\frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} \right ) 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

where L has the following [[MOND]] asymptotic behaviors

:&lt;math&gt; L(x) =  \begin{cases} x &amp;  x \gg 1 \\ \frac{2}{3}|x|^{\frac{3}{2}} &amp; x \leqslant 1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\kappa, \widetilde{\kappa}&lt;/math&gt; represent the coupling constants of the theory while &lt;math&gt;\ell, \widetilde{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; are the parameters of the theory and &lt;math&gt;\ell &lt; \widetilde{\ell}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Coupling to the matter===
Metric couples to the energy-momentum tensor. The matter current is the source field of both gauge fields. The matter current is

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu = \rho u^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;u^\mu&lt;/math&gt; represents the four velocity.

==Regimes of the GVT theory==
GVT accommodates the Newtonian and MOND regime of gravity; but it admits the post-MONDian regime. 
===Strong and Newtonian regimes===
The strong and Newtonian regime of the theory is defined to be where holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L \left (\frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu} \right ) &amp;= \frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu}\\
L \left (\frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} \right ) &amp;= \frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The consistency between the [[gravitoelectromagnetism]] approximation to the GVT theory and that predicted and measured by the [[Einstein–Hilbert gravity]] demands that 

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa + \widetilde{\kappa} =0&lt;/math&gt;

which results in 
 
:&lt;math&gt;B_\mu+\widetilde{B}_\mu = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

So the theory coincides to the Einstein–Hilbert gravity in its Newtonian and strong regimes.

===MOND regime===
The MOND regime of the theory is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L \left (\frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu} \right ) &amp;= \left|\frac{\ell^2}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu}\right|^\frac{3}{2}\\
L \left (\frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} \right ) &amp;= \frac{\widetilde{\ell}^2}{4} \widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So the action for the &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; field becomes aquadratic. For the static mass distribution, the theory then converts to the AQUAL model of gravity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bekenstein| first=J.|author2=Milgrom, M.|title=Does the missing mass problem signal the breakdown of Newtonian gravity?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1 November 1984| volume=286 |pages=7 |doi=10.1086/162570|bibcode=1984ApJ...286....7B}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the critical acceleration of

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{4\sqrt{2}\kappa c^2}{\ell}&lt;/math&gt;

So the GVT theory is capable of reproducing the flat rotational velocity curves of galaxies. The current observations do not fix &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt; which is supposedly of order one.  
  
===Post-MONDian regime=== 
The post-MONDian regime of the theory is defined where both of the actions of the &lt;math&gt;B_{\mu}, \widetilde{B}_\mu &lt;/math&gt; are aquadratic. The MOND type behavior is suppressed in this regime due to the contribution of the second gauge field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10131">'''Genetic epidemiology''' is the study of the role of [[genetics|genetic]] factors in determining health and disease in families and in populations, and the interplay of such genetic factors with environmental factors. Genetic epidemiology seeks to derive a statistical and quantitative analysis of how genetics work in large groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fundamentals of Genetic Epidemiology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VC7BAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 1993-01-01|isbn = 9780195052886|language = en|first = Muin J.|last = Khoury|first2 = Terri H.|last2 = Beaty|first3 = Bernice H.|last3 = Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The use of the term ''Genetic epidemiology'' emerged in the mid 1980s as a new scientific field.

In formal language, genetic epidemiology was defined by [[Newton Morton]], one of the pioneers of the field, as "a science which deals with the [[etiology]], distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives and with inherited causes of disease in populations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Morton |first= N. E. |date=1982 | title=Outline of Genetic Epidemiology |publisher=Karger| location= New York| isbn=3-8055-2269-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely allied to both [[molecular epidemiology]] and [[statistical genetics]], but these overlapping fields each have distinct emphases, societies and journals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One definition of the field closely follows that of [[Behavioural genetics|behavior genetics]], defining genetic epidemiology as "the scientific discipline that deals with the analysis of the familial distribution of traits, with a view to understanding any possible genetic basis", and that "seeks to understand both the genetic and environmental factors and how they interact to produce various diseases and traits in humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Genetic Epidemiology Defined|url = http://www.biostat.wustl.edu/gems/definition.shtml|website = www.biostat.wustl.edu|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMJ: British Medical Journal|BMJ]] adopts a similar definition, "Genetic epidemiology is the study of the aetiology, distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives and of inherited causes of disease in populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic epidemiology|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/320/7244/1257|journal = BMJ|date = 2000-05-06|issn = 0959-8138|pmid = 10797040|pages = 1257–1259|volume = 320|issue = 7244|doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7244.1257|language = en|first = Jaakko|last = Kaprio|pmc=1117994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As early as the 4th century BC, [[Hippocrates]] suggested in his essay “On Airs, Waters, and Places” that factors such as behavior and environment may play a role in disease. Epidemiology entered a more systematic phase with the work of [[John Graunt]], who in 1662 tried to quantify mortality in London using a statistical approach, tabulating various factors he thought played a role in mortality rates. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] is considered to be the father of epidemiology, and was the first to use statistics to discover and target the cause of disease, specifically of cholera outbreaks in 1854 in London. He investigated the cases of cholera and plotted them onto a map  identifying the most likely cause of cholera, which was shown to be contaminated water wells.

=== Modern history ===
Modern genetics began on the foundation of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work. Once this became widely known, it  spurred a revolution in studies of hereditary throughout the animal kingdom; with studies showing genetic transmission and control over characteristics and traits. As gene variation was shown to affect disease, work began on quantifying factors affecting disease, accelerating in the 20th century. The period since the second world war saw the greatest advancement of the field, with scientists such as [[Newton Morton]] helping form the field of genetic epidemiology as it is known today, with the application of modern genetics to the statistical study of disease, as well as the establishment of large-scale epidemiological studies such as the [[Framingham Heart Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice - An Introduction to Applied Epidemiology and Biostatistics|last = |first = |publisher = U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 1, 7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, epidemiology played a part in strategies for the worldwide eradication of naturally occurring smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epidemiology in the Global Eradication of Smallpox|url = http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/1/25|journal = International Journal of Epidemiology|date = 1972-03-20|issn = 0300-5771|pmid = 4669176|pages = 25–30|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/ije/1.1.25|language = en|first = D. A.|last = Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Traditionally, the study of the role of genetics in disease progresses through the following study designs, each answering a slightly different question:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorak.info/epi/genetepi.html |title=Introduction to Genetic Epidemiology | author= M. Tevfik Dorak | date=2008-03-03| accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Familial aggregation]] studies: Is there a genetic component to the disease, and what are the relative contributions of genes and environment?
* [[Genetic segregation|Segregation]] studies: What is the [[dominance relationship|pattern of inheritance]] of the disease (e.g. dominant or recessive)?
* [[Genetic linkage|Linkage]] studies: On which part of which [[chromosome]] is the disease gene located?
* [[Genetic association|Association]] studies: Which [[allele]] of which gene is associated with the disease?

This traditional approach has proved highly successful in identifying [[monogenic disorder]]s and locating the genes responsible.

More recently, the scope of genetic epidemiology has expanded to include common diseases for which many genes each make a smaller contribution ([[polygenic disorder|polygenic]], [[multifactorial or multigenic disorder]]s). This has developed rapidly in the first decade of the 21st century following completion of the [[Human Genome Project]], as advances in [[genotyping]] technology and associated reductions in cost has made it feasible to conduct large-scale [[genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] that genotype many thousands of [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s in thousands of individuals. These have led to the discovery of many [[genetic polymorphism]]s that influence the risk of developing many common diseases.

== Approaches ==
Genetic epidemiological research follows 3 discreet steps, as outlined by M.Tevfik Dorak''':'''
# Establishing that there is a genetic component to the disorder.
# Establishing the relative size of that genetic effect in relation to other sources of variation in disease risk (environmental effects such as intrauterine environment, physical and chemical effects as well as behavioral and social aspects).
# Identifying the gene(s) responsible for the genetic component.
These research methodologies can be assessed through either family or population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTRODUCTION TO GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY [M.Tevfik DORAK]|url = http://www.dorak.info/epi/genetepi.html|website = www.dorak.info|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Athruzsidewalk.jpg|thumb|Sidewalks are a common form of hardscaping]]
'''Hardscape''' refers to [[hard landscape materials]] in the [[built environment]] structures that are incorporated into a landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hardscape|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hardscape|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can include paved areas, driveways, [[retaining walls]], sleeper walls, stairs, walkways, and any other landscaping made up of hard wearing materials such as wood, stone, concrete etc. as opposed to [[softscape]], the [[horticulture|horticultural]] elements of a [[landscape]].

Hard landscaping involves projects that cover the entirety of the yard and that are necessary before soft landscaping features come into play. Hard landscaping is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the "bricks and mortar", and so only once this is completed can the landscaper begin to focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft landscaping such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting color schemes. One key feature of hard landscaping is to do with the absorption of water – something that is of great importance given the climate. Hard landscaping ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall is not an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through hard landscaping, coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that the yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space, rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are soft landscaping options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is achieved through hard landscaping.

From an [[urban planning]] perspective, hardscapes can include very large features, such as paved roads, driveways or fountains, and even small pools. Most [[water feature]]s are hardscapes because they require a barrier to retain the water, instead of letting it drain into the surrounding soil.

Hardscaping allows the erection of man-made landscaping features that would otherwise be impossible due to [[soil erosion]], including some that compensate for large amounts of human traffic that would cause wear on bare earth or grass. For example, sheer vertical features are possible.

Without nearby bare soil, or natural drainage channels or culverts, hardscape with an [[impervious surface]] requires artificial methods of [[drainage]] or [[surface runoff]] to carry off the water that would normally be absorbed into the ground as [[groundwater]] and prevent premature wear to itself. Lack of capacity, or poorly planned or executed drainage or grading of the surface can cause problems after severe storms or heavy extended periods of rain fall, such as flooding, washout, mud flows, sink holes, accelerated erosion, [[wet rot]] to wood elements, drowning of plants trees and shrubs, and even foundation problems to an adjacent home such as cracking the foundation, basement flooding due to water infiltration, and pest infiltration, such as ants and other insects entering through damaged areas.

==Regulations and licensing==

===Australia===
Hardscape landscaping in Queensland,&lt;ref&gt;Queensland Building and Construction Commission, http://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is a licensed qualification called Structural Landscaping, which is divided into two classes of licenses: Trade Contractor Structural Landscaper, and a Builder restricted to Structural Landscaping, referred to as the "jack of all trades" due to its large scope of works. These Structural Landscaping licenses include the erection and fabrication of decking, fences, carports, pergolas, paving and the construction of retaining walls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4361">A '''hypervariable region''' ('''HVR''') is a location within [[nuclear DNA]] or the [[D-loop]] of [[mitochondrial DNA]] in which [[base pair]]s of [[nucleotide]]s repeat (in the case of nuclear DNA) or have substitutions (in the case of mitochondrial DNA).  Changes or repeats in the hypervariable region are highly [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]].

==Mitochondrial==
[[File:Map of the human mitochondrial genome.svg|thumb|300px|Human mitochondrial genome showing hypervariable regions I to III (green boxes) located in the control region (CR ; grey box).]]

There are two mitochondrial hypervariable regions used in human mitochondrial [[genealogical DNA test]]ing.  HVR1 is considered a "low resolution" region and HVR2 is considered a "high resolution" region. Getting HVR1 and HVR2 DNA tests can help determine one's [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|haplogroup]]. In the revised [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]] of the human mitogenome, the most variable sites of HVR1 are numbered 16024-16383 (this subsequence is called HVR-I), and the most variable sites of HVR2 are numbered 57-372 (''i.e.,'' HVR-II) and 438-574 (''i.e.,'' HVR-III).&lt;ref name="vanOven2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Oven M, Kayser M |title=Updated comprehensive phylogenetic tree of global human mitochondrial DNA variation |journal=Human Mutation |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=E386–94 |date=February 2009 |pmid=18853457 |doi=10.1002/humu.20921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phylotree"&gt;''PhyloTree mt''.

In some [[bony fish]]es, for example certain [[Protacanthopterygii]] and [[Gadidae]], the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] evolves remarkably slowly. Even functional mitochondrial [[gene]]s accumulate mutations faster and more freely. It is not known whether such hypovariable control regions are more widespread. In the [[Ayu]] (''Plecoglossus altivelis''), an [[East Asia]]n protacanthopterygian, control region [[mutation]] rate is not markedly lowered, but sequence differences between [[subspecies]] are far lower in the control region than elsewhere. This phenomenon completely defies explanation at present.&lt;ref&gt;Takeshima, Hirohiko; Iguchi, Kei-ichiro &amp; Nishida, Mutsumi (2005): Unexpected Ceiling of Genetic Differentiation in the Control Region of the Mitochondrial DNA between Different Subspecies of the Ayu ''Plecoglossus altivelis''.

[[File:Ecozone Indomalaya.svg|thumb|400px|The Indomalayan realm]]

The '''Indomalayan realm''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s. It extends across most of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and into the southern parts of [[East Asia]].

Also called the '''Oriental realm''' by [[biogeography|biogeographers]], Indomalaya extends from [[Afghanistan]] through the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]] to lowland southern [[China]], and through [[Indonesia]] as far as [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Bali]], and [[Borneo]], east of which lies the [[Wallace line]], the realm boundary named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] which separates Indomalayan from [[Australasian realm|Australasia]]. Indomalaya also includes the [[Philippines]], lowland [[Taiwan]], and [[Japan]]'s [[Ryukyu Islands]].

Most of Indomalaya was originally covered by forest, mostly [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]], with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] predominant in much of India and parts of Southeast Asia. The tropical moist forests of Indomalaya are mostly dominated by trees of the [[dipterocarp]] family (Dipterocarpaceae).

== Major ecological regions ==

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) divides Indomalayan realm into three bioregions, which it defines as "geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)".

=== Indian Subcontinent ===
The Indian Subcontinent bioregion covers most of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. The [[Hindu Kush]], [[Karakoram]], [[Himalaya]], and [[Patkai]] ranges bound the bioregion on the northwest, north, and northeast; these ranges were formed by the collision of the northward-drifting Indian subcontinent with Asia beginning 45 million years ago. The Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya are a major biogeographic boundary between the subtropical and tropical flora and fauna of the Indian subcontinent and the temperate-climate [[Palearctic]] realm.

=== Indochina ===
The Indochina bioregion includes most of mainland [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Cambodia]], as well as the subtropical forests of southern [[China]].

=== Sunda shelf and the Philippines ===
{{main article|Sundaland}}
{{main article|Ecoregions of the Philippines}}

[[Malesia]] is a botanical province which straddles the boundary between Indomalaya and Australasia. It includes the [[Malay Peninsula]] and the western Indonesian islands (known as [[Sundaland]]), the Philippines, the eastern Indonesian islands, and New Guinea. While the Malesia has much in common botanically, the portions east and west of the [[Wallace Line]] differ greatly in land animal species; Sundaland shares its fauna with mainland Asia, while terrestrial fauna on the islands east of the Wallace line are derived at least in part from species of Australian origin, such as [[marsupial]] mammals and [[ratite]] birds.

== History ==
The flora of Indomalaya blends elements from the ancient supercontinents of [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]]. Gondwanian elements were first introduced by India, which detached from Gondwana approximately 90 [[mya (unit)|MYA]], carrying its Gondwana-derived flora and fauna northward, which included [[cichlid]] fish and the [[flowering plant]] [[family (biology)|families]] [[Crypteroniaceae]] and possibly Dipterocarpaceae. India collided with Asia 30-45 MYA, and exchanged species. Later, as [[Australia-New Guinea]] drifted north, the collision of the Australian and Asian plates pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which were separated from one another by narrow straits, allowing a botanic exchange between Indomalaya and [[Australasia realm|Australasia]]. Asian rainforest flora, including the dipterocarps, island-hopped across Wallacea to New Guinea, and several Gondwanian plant families, including [[podocarp]]s and [[araucaria]]s, moved westward from Australia-New Guinea into western Malesia and Southeast Asia.

== Flora and fauna ==
Two orders of mammals, the [[colugo]]s (Dermoptera) and [[treeshrew]]s (Scandentia), are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the realm, as are families Craseonycteridae ([[Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat]]), [[Diatomyidae]], [[Platacanthomyidae]], Tarsiidae ([[tarsier]]s) and Hylobatidae ([[gibbon]]s). Large mammals characteristic of Indomalaya include the [[leopard]], [[tiger]]s, [[Bubalus|water buffalos]], [[Asian Elephant]], [[Indian Rhinoceros]], [[Javan Rhinoceros]], [[Malayan Tapir]], [[orangutan]]s, and [[gibbon]]s.

Indomalaya has three endemic bird families, the Irenidae ([[fairy bluebird]]s), [[Megalaimidae]] and Rhabdornithidae ([[Philippine creeper]]s). Also characteristic are [[pheasant]]s, [[Pitta (bird)|pittas]], [[Old World babbler]]s, and [[flowerpecker]]s.

'''Industrial archaeology''' (IA) is the systematic study of material evidence associated with the [[industry|industrial]] past.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Archaeology: Principles and Practice, Peter Neaverson and Marilyn Palmer, Routledge, 1998, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence, collectively referred to as [[industrial heritage]], includes buildings, machinery, artifacts, sites, infrastructure, documents and other items associated with the production, manufacture, extraction, transport or construction of a product or range of products. The field of industrial archaeology incorporates a range of disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[construction]], [[engineering]], [[historic preservation]], [[museology]], [[technology]], [[urban planning]] and other specialties, in order to piece together the history of past industrial activities.&lt;ref name="siahq1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/about/aboutthesia.html |title=About the Society for Industrial Archeology (SIA) |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific interpretation of material evidence is often necessary, as the written record of many industrial techniques is often incomplete or nonexistent. Industrial archaeology includes both the examination of standing structures and sites that must be studied by an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Texture of Industry, Robert B. Gordon and Patrick M. Malone, Oxford University Press, 1994, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of industrial archaeology developed during the 1950s in [[Great Britain]], at a time when many historic industrial sites and artifacts were being lost throughout that country, including the notable case of [[Euston Arch]] in [[London]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, with the rise of national [[cultural heritage]] movements, industrial archaeology grew as a distinct form of archaeology, with a strong emphasis on preservation, first in Great Britain, and later in the United States and other parts of the world. During this period, the first organized national industrial heritage inventories were begun, including the Industrial Monuments Survey in England and the [[Historic American Engineering Record]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/heritage-at-risk/industrial-heritage-at-risk/protecting-industrial-sites/ |title=Protecting Industrial Sites |publisher=English-heritage.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a number of regional and national IA organizations were established, including the North American-based [[Society for Industrial Archeology]] in 1971, and the British-based [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]] in 1973. That same year, the ''First International Conference on the Conservation of Industrial Monuments'' was held at [[Ironbridge]] in [[Shropshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://histoire-cnrs.revues.org/1778 |title=The industrial heritage in Britain – the first fifty years, Keith Falconer |doi=10.4000/histoire-cnrs.1778 |publisher=Histoire-cnrs.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference led, in 1978, to the formal establishment of [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]] (commonly known as "TICCIH") as a worldwide organization for the promotion of industrial heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siahq.org/ticcih/TICCIH_SIA_Agreement.pdf |title=Agreement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of these and other IA groups are generally a diverse mix of professionals and amateurs who share a common interest in promoting the study, appreciation and preservation of [[industrial heritage]] resources.&lt;ref name="siahq1"/&gt;

==IA topics and sites==
[[File:Boott mill rooftop view.jpg|thumb|[[Boott Cotton Mills]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], restored as part of the [[Lowell National Historic Park]], established the 1970s largely through the efforts of industrial archaeologists.]]
Industrial archaeology covers a wide range of topics, from early [[ironworks]] and water-powered mills to large modern factories, as well as ancillary sites and structures such as worker housing, warehouses and infrastructure.
&lt;br /&gt;
IA topics generally fall into one of four categories: 
*'''Extractive''' (also known as "basic materials", which includes mining, quarrying, petroleum, lumbering, etc.), 
*'''Manufacturing''' (mills and factories, including their power systems and machinery), 
*'''Public utilities''' (water, sewer, electric, gas, etc.), and 
*'''Transport''' (canals, railways, roads, aviation, bridges, tunnels, etc.).

Additionally, the topic of '''power generation''' (water, wind, steam, electric, etc.), while applicable to each of the four major IA categories, is sometimes considered its own category.

The work of industrial archaeologists has led to greater public awareness of [[industrial heritage]], including the creation of industry museums and the inclusion of sites on national and international historic cultural registers in many parts of the world. Notable examples include the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust|Ironbridge Gorge Museums]], [[Engelsberg Ironworks]] and [[Lowell National Historical Park]], among many others.

===Early developments===
One of the earliest forerunners of the mid-20th century IA-movement was the Sheffield Trades Technical Societies, established in 1918 at the [[University of Sheffield]] to preserve elements of that city's industrial history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topforge.co.uk/Magazines/Society.htm |title=Sheffield Trades Historical Society |publisher=Topforge.co.uk |date=1993-10-16 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the [[Newcomen Society]] was founded in Great Britain to foster the study of the history of engineering and technology, including many relics of the [[industrial revolution]], such as steam engines, canals, iron bridges, machinery, and other historical artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcomen.com/?page_id=30 |title=About Newcomen |publisher=Newcomen.com |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newcomen Society also established the ''Journal of Industrial Archaeology'' in 1964, first national IA-publication in the UK.&lt;ref name="industrial-archaeology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrial-archaeology.org/aba86.htm |title=A major change in human evolution |publisher=Industrial-archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early development was the formation of the [[Cornish Engines Preservation Committee]] (CEPC) in 1935, to rescue the [[Levant Mine and Beam Engine]] in [[Cornwall]].

During the early 20th century, the [[historic preservation]] movement in the [[United States]] was still in its infancy. Most of the historic sites that received any attention were related to presidents and political figures, or the early [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]]. However, in 1925, one of the first industrial museums in the [[United States]] opened at [[Old Slater Mill]], in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], at the site of the first successful [[textile mill]] in the country, built in 1793. The museum was founded by a group of business leaders with ties to the [[New England]] textile industry, during a period of decline due to Southern competition. The Old Slater Mill Association had the foresight to restore the old mill to its early 19th century appearance, and fill it with a representative collection of textile machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slatermill.org/museum/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=Slater Mill |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Old Slater Mill]] was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]]. In the early 1970s, Paul E. Rivard, then the director of the Old Slater Mill museum was one of the key figures in the founding of the [[Society for Industrial Archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/about/siahistory.html |title=The roots of the Society for Industrial Archeology |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable example of an early industrial archaeology site (one that predates the widespread IA-movement), is the [[Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site]] in [[Saugus, Massachusetts]]. It is the site of the first integrated iron works in North America, and was reconstructed in the 1950s after extensive archaeological excavations that began in the late 1940s by [[Roland W. Robbins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/sair/historyculture/index.htm |title=The Significance of Saugus Iron Works to the United States and the World |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings of the IA movement===
The term “industrial archaeology” was popularised in Great Britain in 1955 by Michael Rix of [[Birmingham University]], who wrote an article in ''The Amateur Historian'', about the need for greater study and preservation of 18th and 19th century industrial sites and relics of the British [[industrial revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;World Industrial Archaeology, Kenneth Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, [[Council for British Archaeology]] (CBA) established an industrial archaeology research committee.&lt;ref name="industrial-archaeology1"/&gt; The CBA soon developed a standardized record card for industrial monuments, which it distributed to volunteer groups around the UK. In 1965, the National Record of Industrial Monuments (NRIM) was created as a central archive for the record cards that had been collected by Angus Buchanan at the [[University of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Archaeology:A Handbook, Palmer, Nevell &amp; Sissons, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, a number of local industrial archaeology groups had been formed in the UK, including the Gloucestershire Society for Industrial Archaeology in 1963, the Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society in 1967, and the [[Greater London Industrial Archaeology Society]] in 1968, among others. The primary mission of these local IA groups during this period was recording the remaining relics of industrial history, especially those deemed to be most at risk from urban redevelopment schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Mason |url=http://www.glias.org.uk/ |title=GLIAS |publisher=GLIAS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the condition of the site or artifact, recording typically consists of compiling a brief summary of the site's history through available records, including old maps or photographs, followed by detailed onsite measurements, drawings and photographs of the existing conditions of the site. Generally, a report is prepared and copies are filed in a public archive for the benefit of future generations. Most recording trips are intended to obtain a general overview of existing conditions, and are not meant to be an exhaustive study.

One of the first areas to be the subject of a systematic study of industrial archaeology was the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] in [[Shropshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. This landscape developed from the 17th century as one of the first industrial landscapes in the world, and by the 18th century had a range of extractive industries as well as extensive [[iron]] making, [[ceramic]] manufacturing, and a series of early railways. The Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust was established in 1967, and the significance of the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] was recognized in 1986 with its designation as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/371 |title=Ironbridge Gorge - UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, British journalist [[Kenneth Hudson]] published the first IA text, titled ''Industrial archaeology: an introduction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Industrial_archaeology.html?id=C4xIAAAAMAAJ |title=Industrial archaeology: an introduction, Google books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later in April 1967, Hudson spoke at a seminar at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at what is considered the birth of the IA-movement in the United States. The seminar, which was attended by an audience of historic preservationists, museum professionals and others, focused on what was being done to promote the study of industrial archaeology in Great Britain and in Europe, and what needed to be done in the United States.&lt;ref name="siahq2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/about/aboutthesia/history.html |title=The Birth of the SIA and Reminiscences by Some of its Founders |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, a number of select historic industrial sites had been recorded by the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS), which until then had mainly concentrated its efforts on architecturally significant sites. In 1967, the notable ''New England Textile Mills Survey'' (NETMS) was performed under the HABS umbrella, led by Robert M. Vogel, curator of the Division of Mechanical and Civil at the Smithsonian Museum of History and Technology. The NETMS was the first large-scale, industrial recording project by HABS.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Robert M., ''Historical Archaeology'', The New England Textile Mill Survey, Vol. 1, 1967, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the ''New England Textile Mill Survey II'' in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Sande, Ted, ''Technology and Culture'', The National Park Service and the History of Technology: The New England Textile Mill Survey, Vol. 14, No. 3, July 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The full reports from the 1967 and 1968 textile mill surveys are now available for public viewing on the Library of Congress website, including the [[Amoskeag Millyard]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], which was drastically altered soon after the survey was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/nh0041/ |title=Amoskeag Millyard, Canal Street, Manchester, Hillsborough County, NH |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the 1967 and 1968 mill surveys led to the formation of the [[Historic American Engineering Record]] (HAER) in 1969, in conjunction with the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. Since then, thousands of industrial / engineering sites and structures throughout the United States have been recorded by HAER, and are on record at the [https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/ Library of Congress] for public benefit.

===1970s-1980s===
By the early 1970s, industrial archaeology was, for the most part, being practiced in a few select countries by amateurs and professionals with different backgrounds and objectives. While much had been accomplished during the preceding decade, the "new" field of industrial archaeology was still struggling to gain acceptance as a true scholarly pursuit. In October 1971, a group of representatives from various museums, universities, and government organizations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] met in [[Washington, D.C.]] to establish a means to improve the exchange of ideas and information. The result was the first national-level, IA-related [[academic society]] in the world; the [[Society for Industrial Archeology]] (SIA). It was decided that the name of the Society would take on the US-Government's spelling of ''"archeology"'', instead of "archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saa.org/ForthePublic/Resources/OtherUsefulResources/Whyaretheretwodifferentspellingsarchaeology/tabid/1078/Default.aspx |title=Why are there two different spellings: archaeology and archeology? |publisher=Saa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first SIA newsletter was published in January 1972, with Robert M. Vogel as editor. In April of that same year the new group held its first annual conference in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="siahq2"/&gt; In 1975, the SIA introduced its [[academic journal]], [[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]], with [[Emory Kemp]] as editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/iajournal/pubs1.html |title=Contents of past issues of IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]] (AIA) was founded in Great Britain. It brought together the numerous local IA-groups that had been formed throughout the country.&lt;ref name="industrial-archaeology1"/&gt; The AIA publishes a newsletter, ''Industrial Archaeology News'', along with its academic journal, ''Industrial Archaeology Review'', introduced in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrial-archaeology.org/aiareview.htm |title=Industrial Archaeology Review |publisher=Industrial-archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many AIA members have been active in promoting the mission of IA throughout Europe and the rest of the world.

With the rapid decline of many established industries in North America and Europe during the 1970s, industrial archaeologists began to take on a new role of recording and preserving recently closed sites, as opposed to antique relics from earlier periods. Among the notable projects during this decade was the successful transformation of [[Sloss Furnaces]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] after it shut down in 1971 into an open air industrial museum. Sloss Furnaces was declared a NHL in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slossfurnaces.com/ |title=Sloss Furnaces National Historic Landmark |publisher=Slossfurnaces.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum opened in 1983 and offers a variety of educational and civic programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowewrite |first=Christina |url=http://www.bwcitypaper.com/Articles-i-2009-01-08-226311.113121-The-History-of-Sloss-Furnaces.html |title=The History of Sloss Furnaces |publisher=Bwcitypaper.com |date=2009-01-08 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[I.A.Recordings]] was founded by a small group of volunteers in the UK, to record past and present industries on film and video, as a resource for future generations.

During the 1980s, the scope of the field of industrial archaeology in Great Britain shifted away from what was taken place in North America, where the theories of social archaeology that were developed in the [[historical archaeology]] field began to be applied to the study of industrial sites. British industrial archaeologists meanwhile mainly focused on the recording of the technical aspects of sites and artifacts. One key development during this period was the shift toward thematic studies of monuments by type, including three initial textile mill surveys in [[Greater Manchester]], [[Yorkshire]] and eastern [[Cheshire]] led by Keith Falconer.&lt;ref name="industrial-archaeology1"/&gt;

===Since 1990===
Since 1990, there has been an ever-increasing awareness of the importance of industrial heritage, confirmed most prominently by the addition of numerous industrial sites to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. Many preserved industrial sites have become a vital part of [[heritage tourism]], including the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] (ERIH), established in 1999. Based on the success of the ''Route der Industriekultur'' in [[Ruhr]], [[Germany]], the ERIH has expanded to consist of sixteen routes in seven countries, with plans for new routes in additional countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erih.net/topmenu/about-erih.html |title=About ERIH |publisher=Erih.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of industrial sites that have been preserved and [[Adaptive reuse|converted to other uses]] such as apartments, public spaces or museums instead of being demolished is also a testament to the efforts of industrial archaeologists.

Industrial archaeology has gradually gained acceptance in the academic arena. In the UK, where the field developed largely from the efforts of volunteer researchers, the emergence of developer-funded projects in the past two decades has led to an increased presence of professional practitioners, with the application of theoretical archaeology methods such as [[landscape archaeology]] to the industrial setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orange |first=Hilary |url=https://www.academia.edu/583642/Industrial_Archaeology_Its_Place_Within_the_Academic_Discipline_the_Public_Realm_and_the_Heritage_Industry |title=Industrial Archaeology: Its Place Within theAcademic Discipline, the Public Realm and theHeritage Industry |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while many university [[archaeology]] departments now include the industrial period in their degree courses, industrial archaeology remains a fairly limited field of study, with few dedicated industrial archaeology programs, such as those offered at [[Michigan Technological University]] and the [[Ironbridge Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ticcih.org/university.htm University Courses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426161532/http://www.ticcih.org/university.htm |date=April 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread appreciation of the importance of industrial heritage by the general public is still lacking in many areas, as the subject often maintains the perception of being "not old enough" to truly be considered [[archaeology]]. Additionally, there are often negative associations with neglected or abandoned industrial sites, including the social, economic and environmental consequences ("[[brownfield]]" sites). As with other history-based fields, one of the continuing challenges of industrial archaeologists throughout the world is the competition for ever-decreasing public funding for their research, educational and preservation projects. The sheer number of historic industrial sites and limited funding often means that many are still being lost to neglect, fire and demolition.

In 2003, the ''Nizhny Tagil Charter'' was adopted by [[TICCIH]] at its XII Congress in [[Nizhny Tagil, Russia]]. It is the international standard for the study, documentation, conservation and interpretation of the [[industrial heritage]].

==IA organizations==
There are national industrial archaeology societies in many countries. They bring together people interested in researching, recording, preserving and presenting industrial heritage. Industrial architecture, mineral extraction, heritage-based tourism, power technology, [[adaptive reuse]], and transport history are just some of the themes that are investigated by society members. Most groups publish periodic newsletters and host a variety of conferences, seminars and tours of IA-sites and still-active industries (known as process tours).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/tours/siatours.html |title=The Society for Industrial Archeology Annual Conference and Tours |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://industrial-archaeology.org/aconf08.htm |title=AIA-events |publisher=Industrial-archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924105841/http://industrial-archaeology.org/aconf08.htm |archivedate=2013-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IA organizations may also be involved in advising on historic conservation matters, or advising government units on revision or demolition of significant sites or buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">In art, '''Institutional Critique''' is the systematic inquiry into the workings of art institutions, such as galleries and museums, and is most associated with the work of artists like [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Andrea Fraser]], [[John Knight (artist)]], [[Adrian Piper]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], and [[Hans Haacke]] and the scholarship of [[Alexander Alberro]], [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], [[Birgit Pelzer]], and [[Anne Rorimer]].&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/institutional-critique&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moca.org/exhibition/1965-1975-reconsidering-the-object-of-art&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional Critique takes the form of temporary or nontransferable approaches to painting and sculpture, architectural alterations and interventions, and performative gestures and language intended to disrupt the otherwise transparent operations of galleries and museums and the professionals who administer them. Examples would be [[Neile Toroni]] making imprints of a No. 50 brush at 30cm intervals directly onto gallery walls as opposed to applying the same mark to paper or canvas;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renaissancesociety.org/exhibitions/366/niele-toroni/&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Burden's ''Exposing the Foundation of the Museum'' (1986), in which he made an excavation in a gallery of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, to expose the literal concrete foundation of the building;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moca.org/collection/work/exposing-the-foundation-of-the-museum&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Andrea Fraser]] inhabiting the persona of an archetypical museum docent in the form of a live performance or video document.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewadsworth.org/threehistoriesfraser/&lt;/ref&gt; Assumptions about the aesthetic autonomy of painting and sculpture, the neutral context of the [[white cube]], and the objective delivery of information are explored as subjects of art, mapped out as discursive formations, and (re)framed within the context of the museum itself. As such, Institutional Critique seeks to make visible the social, political, economic, and historical underpinnings of art. Institutional Critique questions the false distinction between taste and disinterested aesthetic judgement, revealing that taste is an institutionally cultivated sensibility that differs depending on the intersection of any one person's class, ethnic, sexual, or gender subject positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=7&amp;id_b=573&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

Institutional Critique is a practice that emerged from the developments of [[Minimalism]] and its concerns with the phenomenology of the viewer; formalist art criticism and art history (e.g. [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried (art critic)|Michael Fried]]); [[conceptual art]] and its concerns with language, processes, and administrative society; and the critique of authorship that begins with [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel Foucault]] in the late 1960s and continues with the advent of [[appropriation art]] in the 1970s and its upending of long-held notions of authorship, originality, artistic production, popular culture, and identity.  Institutional critique is often site-specific and is contemporaneous with the advent of artists who eschewed gallery and museum contexts altogether to build monumental earthworks in the landscape, notably [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Walter de Maria]], and [[Robert Smithson]]. Institutional critique is also associated with the development of post-structuralist philosophy, [[critical theory]], [[literary theory]], [[feminism]], gender studies, and [[critical race theory]].

== Artists ==

Artists associated with Institutional Critique since the 1960s include [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[John Knight (artist)]], [[Christopher D'Arcangelo]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], [[Adrian Piper]], and [[Martha Rosler]]. Artists active since the 1980s include [[Louise Lawler]], [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], [[Renée Green]], [[Group Material]], [[Andrea Fraser]], [[Fred Forest]], [[Christian Philipp Müller]], [[Aaron Flint Jamison]], and [[Mark Dion]]. 

In the early 1990s, influenced in large part by Daniel Buren, [[Jacques Tati]], [[Roland Barthes]], and the participatory sculptures of [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], a loose affiliation of artists including [[Liam Gillick]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]] engaged the institution of art in a convivial manner. These artists, gathered under the rubric of [[Relational Aesthetics]] by critic [[Nicholas Bourriaud]], saw galleries and museums as sites of social interaction and the spontaneous creation of works of art characterized by their contingent temporality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayrevue.com/en/traffic-espaces-temps-de-lechange/&lt;/ref&gt; The collegial atmosphere of these open-ended situations was quite distinct from the more confrontational strategies of Buren, Haacke, [[Jenny Holzer]], and [[Barbara Kruger]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Claire-Bishop_Antagonism-and-Relational-Aesthetics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sachabaumann.com/shes-krafty-diary/2004/2/12/traffic-control-joe-scanlan-on-social-space-and-relational-a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Brian Goeltzenleuchter]], [[Matthieu Laurette]], [[Tameka Norris]], [[Tino Sehgal]], [[Carey Young]], and others have taken a critical eye to the art museum and its role as a public and private institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thingsthatfall.com/fair-use.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/maurizio-cattelan-america&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

One of the criticisms of Institutional Critique is that it requires from its audience a familiarity with its esoteric concerns. As with much contemporary music and dance,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/28/alex-ross-modern-classical-music&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.um.es/vmca/proceedings/docs/35.Inma-Alvarez.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Institutional Critique of art is a practice that only specialists in the field—artists, theorists, historians, and critics—are privy to. Due to its sophisticated understanding of modern art and society—and as part of a privileged discourse not unlike other specialized forms of knowledge—art as Institutional Critique can often leave [[layman]] viewers alienated and/or marginalized.

Another criticism of the concept is that it can be a misnomer. Artist [[Andrea Fraser]] (in Artforum) and critic Michael Kimmelman (in The New York Times) have argued, for example, that institutional critique artists work within—and benefit from—the very same institutions they ostensibly critique.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Andrea-Fraser_From-the-Critique-of-Institutions-to-an-Institution-of-Critique.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/25/arts/design/tall-french-visitor-takes-up-residence-in-the-guggenheim.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Massurrealism''' is a [[Portmanteau|portmanteau word]] coined in 1992 by American artist [[James Seehafer]],&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; who described a trend among some [[postmodern art]]ists that mix the aesthetic styles and themes of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]]&amp;mdash;including [[pop art]].&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;Adam. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110519201344/http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=artifact1764 "massurrealism"], Intute:arts and humanities ([[University of Oxford]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]), 17 October 2003. Retrieved 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Seehafer-Untitled-1990.jpg|thumb|right|75px|SFX photography, digital collage]]
Massurrealism is a development of surrealism that emphasizes the effect of technology and mass media on contemporary surrealist imagery.&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; James Seehafer who is credited with coining the term in 1992&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; said that he was prompted to do so because there was no extant definition to accurately characterize the type of work he was doing, which combined elements of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]], the latter consisting of [[technology]] and [[pop art]]&amp;mdash;"a form of technology art."&lt;ref name=lecture&gt;Seehafer, James. [http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm#20_06eng "Discussions: The Artist and Modern Society."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608073616/http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm |date=2008-06-08 }}, lecture on Massurrealism at [[Saint Petersburg State University]], Saint Petersburg Russia, 20 June 2000. Retrieved 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He had begun his work by using a shopping cart, which "represented American mass-consumerism that fuels mass-media", and then incorporated collages of colour [[photocopy|photocopies]] and [[spray paint]]  with the artist's traditional medium of [[oil paint]].&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;

In 1995, he assembled a small group show near [[New York City]] and found a local cyber-cafe, where he started to post material about massurrealism on internet arts news groups, inspiring some German art students to stage a massurrealist show.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; The next year he started his own web site, www.massurrealism.com and began to receive work from other artists, both mixed media and digitally-generated.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; He credits the World Wide Web with a major role in communicating massurrealism,&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; which spread interest from artists in [[Los Angeles]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name=Itinerante&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo3VDEahCg "Conoce más sobre el MASSURREALISMO? - Mexico City"] Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Ketter&gt;[http://www.kettererkunst.de/lexikon/massurrealismus.php "Massurrealismus (Massurrealism)"], Ketterer Kunst Auction House, Munich Germany. Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Seehafer has said:
{{cquote|I am not being credited with inventing a new technique, nor I don't think I should be credited with starting a new art movement, but rather simply coining a word to categorize the type of modern day surrealist art that had been lacking in definition. As a result, word "massurrealism" has received a lot of enthusiasm from artists. Though there are some who feel that defining something essentially limits it, the human condition has always had the need to categorize and classify everything in life.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;}} 

The differentiating factor, according to Seehafer, between surrealism and massurrealism is the foundation of the former in the early 20th century in Europe before the spread of electronic mass media.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; It is difficult to define the visual style of massurrealism, though a general characteristic is the use of modern technology to fuse surrealism's traditional access to the unconscious with pop art's ironic contradictions.&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dfine-art&amp;field-keywords=Massurrealism&amp;rh=i%3Afine-art%2Ck%3AMassurrealism/ "Other Art and related items"], Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[graffiti]] artist [[Banksy]] illicitly hung a rock in the [[British Museum]] showing a caveman pushing a shopping cart, which Shelley Esaak of about.com described as "a nice tribute to James Seehafer and Massurrealism."&lt;ref&gt;Esaak, Shelley.

German artist Melanie Marie Kreuzhof, who describes her work as massurrealistic, was commissioned in 2004 by the editor of the ''Spectakel Salzburger Festsiele Inside'' magazine to produce an artwork about [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]'s opera [[Die tote Stadt]] at the [[Salzburg Festival]].&lt;ref name=dixon&gt;Dixon, Troy.

'''Media transparency'''(or '''transparent media'''), sometimes also referred to as '''media opacity,'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaisance|first=Patrick Lee|date=2007-06-18|title=Transparency: An Assessment of the Kantian Roots of a Key Element in Media Ethics Practice|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08900520701315855|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|language=en|volume=22|issue=2-3|pages=187–207|doi=10.1080/08900520701315855|issn=0890-0523}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept that ponders on how and why [[Information subsidy|information subsidies]] are being produced, distributed and handled by media professionals, including journalists, editors, public relations practitioners, public affairs specialists, and spokespeople. In short, media transparency reflects the relationship between journalists and news sources. 

==Overview==
Media transparency deals with the openness and accountability of the media and can be defined as a transparent exchange of information subsidies based on the ideas of newsworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global journalism: Survey of international communication.|last=Merrill|first=John|publisher=Longman|year=1995|isbn=0801305128|location=White Plains, NY|pages=77-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;Media transparency is one of the biggest challenges of contemporary everyday media practices around the world as media outlets and journalists constantly experience pressures from advertisers, information sources, publishers, and other influential groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://instituteforpr.org/bribery-news-coverage-2003/|title=International Index of Bribery for News Coverage 2003 {{!}} Institute for Public Relations|date=2011-01-10|work=Institute for Public Relations|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News sources may influence what information is published or not published. Sometimes, published information can also be paid for by news sources, but the end media product (an article, a program, a blog post) does not clearly indicate that the message has been paid or influenced in any way. Such media opacity, or media non-transparency, ruins the trust and transparency between the media and the public and have implications for transparency of new forms of advertising and public relations (such as native advertising and brand journalism).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transparency, Public Relations and the Mass Media:
Combating the Hidden Influences in News Coverage Worldwide|last=Tsetsura|first=Katerina|last2=Kruckeberg|first2=Dean|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351743952|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media transparency is a normative concept and is achieved when: 1) there are many competing sources of information; 2) the method of information delivery is known; and 3) funding of media production is disclosed and publicly available&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Media Bribery ==
The concept has emerged in response to claims of bias in media, and the lack of media transparency can be perceived as a form of corruption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ewasserman.com/2006/05/10/transparency-and-quality-journalism/|title=Transparency and Quality Journalism|date=2006-05-10|work=UNSOCIAL MEDIA|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Media transparency is a means to diminish unethical and illegal practices in the relationships between news sources and the media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipra.org/news/charter-for-media-transparency/|title=IPRA {{!}} Charter for Media Transparency|website=www.ipra.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Indirect payments and influences were defined as “any type of non-monetary reward to a journalist, editor, or media outlet or the existence of a media policy which dictates, encourages indirect payments or influences the financial success and independence of the media outlet or its employees”

==Power==
Academics at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Warwick Business School]], conducting empirical research on the operation and effects of transparent forms of clinical regulation in practice, describe a form of 'spectacular transparency'. They suggest that government policy tends to react to high-profile media 'spectacles', leading to regulatory policy decisions that appear to respond to problems exposed in the media have new perverse effects in practice, which are unseen by regulators or the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D|title=Medical regulation, spectacular transparency and the blame business|journal=Journal of Health, Organization and Management|year=2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=597–610|pmid=21155435|doi=10.1108/14777261011088683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D.|title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which state agents work to influence [[video production]] contradicts the use of those images by news organizations as indexical, objective representations. Because people tend to strongly equate seeing with knowing, video cultivates an inaccurate impression that they are getting the "full picture". It has been said that "what is on the news depends on what can be shown". The case studies for this project demonstrate that what can be shown is often decided in concern with political agents. Essentially, the way the media presents its information creates an illusion of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Angela Block, [http://hij.sagepub.com/content/14/2/257.full.pdf+html "Who's Minding the Gate? : Pool Feeds, Video Subsidies, and Political Images"], "The International Journal of Press and Politics", April 2009.

[[File:MSP430-experimenter boards.jpg|thumb|300px|Photo of two experimenter boards for the [[MSP430]] chipset by [[Texas Instruments]]. On the left the larger chip version, on the right a small version in [[USB]] format.]]
A '''microprocessor development board''' is a printed circuit board containing a [[microprocessor]] and the minimal support logic needed for a [[computer engineer]] to become acquainted with the microprocessor on the board and to learn to program it. It also served users of the microprocessor as a method to prototype applications in products.

Unlike a general-purpose system such as a [[home computer]], usually a development board contains little or no hardware dedicated to a user interface. It will have some provision to accept and run a user-supplied program, such as downloading a program through a [[serial port]] to [[flash memory]], or some form of [[EPROM|programmable memory]] in a socket in earlier systems.

==History==
The reason for the existence of a development board was solely to provide a system for learning to use a new microprocessor, not for entertainment. So everything superfluous was left out to keep costs down. Even an enclosure was not supplied, nor a power supply. This is because the board would only be used in a "laboratory" environment so it did not need an enclosure, and the board could be powered by a typical bench power supply already available to an electronic engineer.

Microprocessor training development kits were not always produced by microprocessor manufacturers. Many systems that can be classified as microprocessor development kits were produced by third parties, one example is the Sinclair [[MK14]], which was inspired by the official [[SC/MP]] development board from [[National Semiconductor]], the "[[NS introkit]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=1147 description of the National Semiconductor ''introkit''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these development boards were not designed for hobbyists, they were often bought by them because they were the earliest cheap microcomputer devices you could buy. They often added all kinds of expansions, such as more memory, a video interface etc. It was very popular to use (or write) an implementation of [[Tiny Basic]]. The most popular microprocessor board, the [[KIM-1]], received the most attention from the hobby community, because it was much cheaper than most other development boards, and you could get more software for it (Tiny Basic, games, assemblers), and cheap expansion cards to add more memory or other functionality.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcomputers.net/kim1.html KIM was very popular with hobbyists&lt;/ref&gt; More articles were published in magazines like "[[Kilobaud Microcomputing (magazine)|Kilobaud Microcomputing]]" that described home-brew software and hardware for the KIM-1 than for other development boards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commodore.ca/gallery/magazines/kim1/where_is_kim_going.htm why Kilobaud published KIM software]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today some chip producers still release "test boards" to demonstrate their chips, and to use them as a "[[reference design]]". Their significance these days is much smaller than it was in the days that such boards, (the [[KIM-1]] being the [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical example) were the only low cost way to get "hands-on" acquainted with microprocessors..

==Features==
The most important feature of the microprocessor development board was the ROM based built-in machine language monitor, or "debugger" as it was also sometimes called. Often the name of the board was related to the name of this monitor program, for example the name of the monitor program of the KIM-1 was "Keyboard Input Monitor", because the ROM based software allowed entry of programs without the rows of cumbersome toggle switches that older systems used. The popular 6800 based systems often used a monitor with a name with the word "bug" for "debugger" in it, for example the popular "[[MIKBUG]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Input was normally done with a hexadecimal keyboard, using a [[machine language monitor]] program, and the display only consisted of a 7-segment display. Backup storage of written assembler programs was primitive: only a cassette type interface was typically provided, or the serial [[teleprinter|Teletype]] interface was used to read (or punch) a [[papertape]].&lt;ref&gt;http://retro.hansotten.nl/index.php?page=micro-kim Micro-KIM is a retro remake of the KIM for which many programs are available that were originally released on papertape&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the board has some kind to expansion connector that brought out all the necessary CPU signals, so that an engineer could build and test an experimental interface or other electronic device.

External interfaces on the bare board were often limited to a single [[RS-232]] or [[current loop]] serial port, so a [[dumb terminal|terminal]], printer, or Teletype could be connected.

One particularly influential painter of "naïve art" was [[Henri Rousseau]] (1844–1910), a French [[Post-Impressionist]] who was discovered by [[Pablo Picasso]].

==Characteristics==
Naïve art&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaïa ''L'Art naïf'' éd. Parkstone International {{ISBN|9781859956687}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often seen as [[outsider art]] that is by someone without formal (or little) training or degree.  While this was true before the twentieth century, there are now [[Art school|academies]] for naïve art. Naïve art is now a fully recognized art genre, represented in art galleries worldwide.

The characteristics of naïve art are an awkward relationship to the formal qualities of painting, especially not respecting the three rules of the perspective (such as defined by the ''Progressive Painters of the Renaissance''):
# Decrease of the size of objects proportionally with distance,
# Muting of colors with distance,
# Decrease of the precision of details with distance,
The results are:
# Effects of perspective geometrically erroneous (awkward aspect of the works, children's drawings look, or medieval painting look, but the comparison stops there)
#  Strong use of pattern, unrefined color on all the plans of the composition, without enfeeblement in the background,
# An equal accuracy brought to details, including those of the background which should be shaded off.
Simplicity rather than subtlety are all supposed markers of naïve art. It has, however, become such a popular and recognizable style that many examples could be called ''pseudo-naïve''.

Whereas naïve art ideally describes the work of an artist who did not receive  formal education in an [[art school]] or [[academy]], for example [[Henri Rousseau]] or [[Alfred Wallis]], 'pseudo naïve' or 'faux naïve' art describes the work of an artist working in a more imitative or self-conscious mode and whose work can be seen as more imitative than original.

Strict naïvety is unlikely to be found in contemporary artists, given the expansion of [[Autodidactism]] as a form of education in modern times. Naïve categorizations are not always welcome by living artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Amy|title=Lure of the Naïve|url=http://amygellerillustration.com/assets/thesis.pdf|website=amygellerillustration.com/|accessdate=July 12, 2016|ref=page 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[translation|first1=[text] Natalia Brodskaia ;|last2=Darton]|first2=adaptation Mike|title=Naïve art|date=2000|publisher=Parkstone Press|location=New York|isbn=1859953352|page=74|url=https://www.amazon.com/Naive-Schools-Movements-Natalia-Brodskaya/dp/1859953352|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is likely to change as dignifying signals are known. Museums devoted to naïve art now exist in  [[Kecskemét]], [[Hungary]]; [[Riga, Latvia]]; [[Jaen, Spain]]; [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasil]]; [[Musée d’art naïf de Vicq en Île-de-France|Vicq]] [[France]] and [[Paris]].

"Primitive art" is another term often applied to art by those without formal training, but is historically more often applied to work from certain cultures that have been judged socially or technologically "primitive" by Western academia, such as Native American, subsaharan African or Pacific Island art (see [[Tribal art]]). This is distinguished from the self-conscious, "primitive" inspired movement [[primitivism (art)|primitivism]]. Another term related to (but not completely synonymous with) naïve art is [[folk art]].

There also exist the terms "naïvism" and "[[primitivism]]" which are usually applied to professional painters working in the style of naïve art (like [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagraevsky.com/article2_engl.htm Irina Arnoldova. Painter Sergey Zagraevsky: the view of an art critic]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movements ==
Nobody knows exactly when the first naive artists appeared on the scene, as from the very first manifestations of art right up to the days of the "Modern Classic", naive artists quite unconsciously bequeathed us unmistakable signs of their creative activity. At all events, naive art can be regarded as having occupied an "official" position in the annals of twentieth-century art since - at the very latest - the publication of the ''Der Blaue Reiter'', an almanac in 1912. Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc, who brought out the almanac, presented 6 reproductions of paintings by ''le Douanier' Rousseau (Henri Rousseau)'', comparing them with other pictorial examples. However, most experts agree that the year that naive art was "discovered" was 1885, when the painter Paul Signac became aware of the talents of Henri Rousseau and set about organizing exhibitions of his work in a number of prestigious galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wetcanvas.com/Articles/Martens/naive_intro.html|title=WetCanvas: Articles: Jan and Adrie Martens: An Introduction to Naive Art|website=www.wetcanvas.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth Group ===
The [[Earth Group]] (''Grupa Zemlja'') were Croatian artists, [[architect]]s and intellectuals active in Zagreb from 1929 to 1935. The group was [[Marxist]] in orientation and was partly modelled on "[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to more stylized forms, and the emergence of [[Naive painting]]. The group included the painters [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Edo Kovačević]], [[Omer Mujadžić]], [[Kamilo Ružička]], [[Ivan Tabaković]], and [[Oton Postružnik]], the sculptors [[Antun Augustinčić]], [[Frano Kršinić]], and the architect [[Drago Ibler]]. The Earth group searched for answers to social issues.  Their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression, and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles. Rather than producing art for art's sake, they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community. Activities at the group's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day, and in 1935 the group was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hlebine School ===
A term applied to Croatian naive painters working in or around the village of Hlebine, near the Hungarian border, from about 1930. At this time, according to the World Encyclopedia of Naive Art (1984), the village amounted to little more than ‘a few muddy winding streets and one-storey houses’, but it produced such a remarkable crop of artists that it became virtually synonymous with Yugoslav naive painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hlebine School - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095939383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hlebine]] is a small picturesque municipality in the North of Croatia that in 1920s became a setting against which a group of self-taught peasants began to develop a unique and somewhat revolutionary style of painting. This was instigated by leading intellectuals of the time such as the poet [[Antun Gustav Matoš]] and the biggest name in Croatian literature, [[Miroslav Krleža]], who called for an individual national artistic style that would be independent from Western influences. These ideas were picked up by a celebrated artist from Hlebine – [[Krsto Hegedušić]] and he went on to found the Hlebine School of Art in 1930 in search of national “rural artistic expression”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moonproject.co.uk/hlebine-school-of-art-more-than-peasant-doodles/|title=Hlebine School of Art: More than peasant doodles|website=MoonProject|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Generalić]] was the first master of the Hlebine School, and the first to develop a distinctive personal style, achieving a high standard in his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmnu.org/en/vodic.asp|title=The Croatian Museum of Naive Art - Guide to the Permanent Display|last=Otvorena.hr|first=Otvorena mreza -|website=www.hmnu.org|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, the next generation of Hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination. Generalić continued to be the dominant figure, and encouraged younger artists, including his son Josip Generalić.

The Hlebine school became a worldwide phenomenon with the 1952 Venice Biennale and exhibitions in Brazil and Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QujBgAAQBAJ|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Croatia|date=2015-04-07|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465441737|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known naive artists are   [[Dragan Gaži]],  [[Ivan Generalić]],  [[Josip Generalić]],  [[Krsto Hegedušić]],  [[Mijo Kovačić]], [[Ivan Lacković-Croata]],  [[Franjo Mraz]],  [[Ivan Večenaj]] and [[Mirko Virius]].

'''Painting conservation''' is the multidisciplinary and skilled technical practice of conserving and restoring [[paintings]] comprising the three core specialisms of [[easel painting conservation]]&lt;ref&gt;Hill Stoner, J. and Rushfield, R. (Eds.) (2012). Conservation of Easel Paintings, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[wall painting conservation]] and the [[conservation of works on paper]]. Skills, technical approach, relevant scientific knowledge and ethical considerations vary across the specialisms, which each tend to have distinct training programmes and practice groups. Painting conservators recruit knowledge and skills from fields including [[art history]], [[fine art]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[environmental science]]. The process of restoring a painting may, in some instances, return its appearance to a likely original state, as intended by the artist when it was first created. However, in reality, remediating restoration treatments and conservation techniques achieve a spectrum of possible outcomes appropriate to the nature of the damage and deterioration, the fabric and materials of the artwork, historical period and ethical factors. A broad range of treatments can be carried out on easel paintings including the structural repair of canvas that has been torn or degraded by ageing&lt;ref&gt;Bustin, M. and Caley, T. (Eds.) (2003). Alternatives to Lining: Structural Treatment of Paintings on Canvas without Lining, London: UKIC.&lt;/ref&gt; the removal of dirt, cleaning of discoloured varnishes and the infilling and in-painting (or retouching) paint losses. A [[preventive conservation]] approach may also be taken, involving secondary protective measures such as installing moisture barriers to the reverse of frames, [[UV light]] protective glazing or stretcher bar linings&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/02/paintings-on-canvas-lining-and-alternatives#footnote19_7jx14r1&lt;/ref&gt;,  to protect paintings from further deterioration.

__NOTOC__
[[File:Mating Pseudobiceros bedfordi.png|thumb|Two flatworms of the species ''[[Pseudobiceros bedfordi]]'' preparing for penis fencing. ''P. bedfordi'' is exceptional in that it applies sperm onto the partner's skin rather than injecting it.]]
'''Penis fencing''' is a [[mating]] [[ethology|behavior]] engaged in by many species of [[flatworm]], such as ''[[Pseudobiceros hancockanus]]''. Species which engage in the practice are [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]]; each individual has both egg-producing [[ovaries]] and sperm-producing [[testes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/shapeoflife/episodes/hunt_explo2.html |title=Fighting to mate: flatworm penis fencing |author=Leslie Newman |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flatworms "[[fencing|fence]]" using extendable two-headed [[dagger]]-like stylets.  These stylets are pointed (and in some species hooked) in order to pierce their mate's epidermis and inject sperm into the [[Circulatory system|haemocoel]] in an act known as intradermal hypodermic insemination, or [[traumatic insemination]].  Pairs can either compete, with only one individual transferring sperm to the other, or the pair can transfer sperm bilaterally.  Both forms of sperm transfer can occur in the same species, depending on various factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mating behaviour in the sea slug Elysia timida (Opisthobranchia, Sacoglossa): hypodermic injection, sperm transfer and balanced reciprocity|journal = Frontiers in Zoology|date = 2007-07-04|issn = 1742-9994|pmc = 1934903|pmid = 17610714|pages = 17|volume = 4|doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-4-17|first = Valerie|last = Schmitt|first2 = Nils|last2 = Anthes|first3 = Nico K|last3 = Michiels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unilateral sperm transfer ==
One organism will inseminate the other, with the inseminating individual acting as the "father". The sperm is absorbed through pores or sometimes wounds in the skin from the partner's stylet, causing fertilization in the second, who becomes the "mother".&lt;ref name="Michiels"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michiels | first1 = N.K. | last2 = Newman | first2 = L.J. | year = 1998 | title = Sex and violence in hermaphrodites | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = | page = 647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc98/2_14_98/fob2.htm Hermaphrodites duel for manhood], ''Science News Online''.

Parturition, while necessary for successful offspring production, requires a considerable [[parental investment]] in time and energy, and according to [[Bateman's principle]], almost always burdens the "mother".  Thus, from an [[optimality model]] it is usually preferable for an organism to inseminate than to be inseminated.  However, in many species that engage in this form of copulatory competition, each "father" will continue to fence with other partners until it is inseminated.  In ''[[Alderia modesta]]'', individuals will [[Sperm storage|store sperm]] from several "fencing matches" before laying their eggs, and smaller individuals will more often inseminate a larger partner, with larger individuals spending more energy on laying eggs when paired with a smaller partner on the occasion that they transfer sperm unilaterally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/angelonilab/Site/Publications_files/Angeloni2003.pdf|title = Sexual selection in a simultaneous hermaphrodite with hypodermic insemination: body size, allocation to sexual roles and paternity|last = Angeloni|first = Lisa|date = 21 October 2002|journal = Animal Behaviour|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 417–426|doi = 10.1006/anbe.2003.2255|pmid = |access-date = 1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bilateral sperm transfer ==
Commonly, many hermaphroditic species mutually inseminate, or trade sperm, rather than compete, ''[[Chelidonura sandrana]]'' as an example.&lt;ref name="sn" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Evolutionary Conflict: Sperm Wars, Phantom Inseminations|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982205010882|accessdate = 2015-12-02|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.019|volume=15|issue = 19|journal=Current Biology|pages=R801–R803|pmid=16213811 | last1 = Dall | first1 = SR | last2 = Wedell | first2 = N|date = 2005-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tiger flatworm, [[Maritigrella crozierae|''Maritigrella crozieri'']], also transfers sperm bilaterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the geometric probability of mating success in flatworms, Platyhelminthes?|url = http://dspace.nelson.usf.edu/xmlui/handle/10806/11724|website = dspace.nelson.usf.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-02|language = en-US|first = Nguyen|last = Danh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many species that engage in bilateral insemination, sperm trading is conditional.  If one partner "cheats", and does not transfer sperm, the other partner will either prematurely abandon the partner, or will engage in typical mating behavior without transferring sperm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender trading in a hermaphrodite|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098220501105X|journal = Current Biology|date = 2005-10-11|pages = R792–R793|volume = 15|issue = 19|doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.035|first = Nils|last = Anthes|first2 = Annika|last2 = Putz|first3 = Nico K.|last3 = Michiels|pmid=16213807}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other species will alternate which partner transfers sperm, engaging in multiple bouts of fencing with the same partner over time.  In ''[[Alderia modesta|A. modesta]],'' bilateral sperm transfer is the most common, especially in similarly-sized mate pairs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Other uses==
The term is also applied, usually informally, to homosexual activity between two males among [[bonobo]]s; same-sex genital-genital rubbing is used in bonobo society to cement bonds, reduce conflict, and express communal excitement over food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=De Waal |first1=Frans B.M. |title=Bonobo Sex and Society |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bonobo-sex-and-society-2006-06/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[whale]] species also engage in penis fencing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bruce Bagemihl, ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity,'' St. Martin's Press, 1999; {{ISBN|978-0312253776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' provides that any named [[taxon]] in the family group, genus group, or species group have a [[name-bearing type]] which allows the name of the taxon to be objectively applied. The type does not define the taxon: that is done by a taxonomist; and an indefinite number of competing definitions can exist side by sided . Rather, a type is a point of reference.  A name has a type, and a taxonomist (having defined the taxon) can determine which existing types fall within the scope of the taxon. He or she can then use the rules in the Code to determine the [[valid name (zoology)|valid name]] for the taxon.

'''Psophometric voltage''' is a [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] noise [[voltage]] measured with a [[psophometer]] that includes a CCIF-1951&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[weighting filter|weighting network]]. 

''"Psophometric voltage"'' should not be confused with ''"psophometric emf," i.e.'', the emf in a generator or [[line (electrical engineering)|line]] with 600 Ω internal resistance. For practical purposes, the psophometric emf is twice the corresponding psophometric voltage. 

Psophometric voltage readings, ''V'', in millivolts, are commonly converted to [[dBm]](psoph) by dBm(psoph) = 20 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''V''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;57.78.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38436">'''Radiometric dating''' or '''radioactive dating''' is a technique used to [[Chronological dating|date]] materials such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] or [[carbon]], in which trace radioactive [[impurity|impurities]] were selectively incorporated when they were  formed. The method compares the abundance of a naturally occurring [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotope]] within the material to the abundance of its [[Radioactive decay|decay]] products, which form at a known constant rate of decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radioactive dating|file=R05082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of radiometric dating was first published in 1907 by [[Bertram Boltwood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Boltwood, Bertram | year = 1907 | title = The Ultimate Disintegration Products of the Radio-active Elements.

Together with [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic principles]], radiometric dating methods are used in [[geochronology]] to establish the [[geologic time scale]].&lt;ref&gt;McRae, A. 1998. ''Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale: Circular Reasoning or Reliable Tools?'' [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale [[TalkOrigins Archive]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best-known techniques are [[radiocarbon dating]], [[potassium–argon dating]] and [[uranium–lead dating]]. By allowing the establishment of geological timescales, it provides a significant source of information about the ages of [[fossil]]s and the deduced rates of [[evolution]]ary change. Radiometric dating is also used to date [[archaeology|archaeological]] materials, including ancient artifacts.

Different methods of radiometric dating vary in the timescale over which they are accurate and the materials to which they can be applied.

==Fundamentals==

===Radioactive decay===
[[Image:Thorium decay chain from lead-212 to lead-208.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Example of a radioactive [[decay chain]] from lead-212 (&lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) to lead-208 (&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) . Each parent nuclide spontaneously decays into a daughter nuclide (the [[decay product]]) via an [[alpha decay|α decay]] or a [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]]. The final decay product, lead-208 (&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb), is stable and can no longer undergo spontaneous radioactive decay.]]
All ordinary [[matter]] is made up of combinations of [[chemical element]]s, each with its own [[atomic number]], indicating the number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus]]. Additionally, elements may exist in different [[isotope]]s, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of [[neutron]]s in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a [[nuclide]]. Some nuclides are inherently unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will undergo [[radioactive decay]] and spontaneously transform into a different nuclide. This transformation may be accomplished in a number of different ways, including [[alpha decay]] (emission of [[alpha particle]]s) and [[beta decay]] ([[electron]] emission, [[positron]] emission, or [[electron capture]]). Another possibility is [[spontaneous fission]] into two or more nuclides.

While the moment in time at which a particular nucleus decays is unpredictable, a collection of atoms of a radioactive nuclide decays [[exponential decay|exponentially]] at a rate described by a parameter known as the [[half-life]], usually given in units of years when discussing dating techniques. After one half-life has elapsed, one half of the atoms of the nuclide in question will have decayed into a "daughter" nuclide or [[decay product]]. In many cases, the daughter nuclide itself is radioactive, resulting in a [[decay chain]], eventually ending with the formation of a stable (nonradioactive) daughter nuclide; each step in such a chain is characterized by a distinct half-life. In these cases, usually the half-life of interest in radiometric dating is the longest one in the chain, which is the rate-limiting factor in the ultimate transformation of the radioactive nuclide into its stable daughter. Isotopic systems that have been exploited for radiometric dating have half-lives ranging from only about 10 years (e.g., [[tritium]]) to over 100 billion years (e.g., [[samarium-147]]).&lt;ref name="Bernard-Griffiths1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard-Griffiths|first1=J.|last2=Groan|first2=G.|editor1-last=Roth|editor1-first=Etienne|editor2-last=Poty|editor2-first=Bernard|title=Nuclear Methods of Dating|date=1989|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-0-7923-0188-2|pages=53 – 72|chapter=The samarium–neodymium method}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most radioactive nuclides, the half-life depends solely on nuclear properties and is essentially a constant. It is not affected by external factors such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], chemical environment, or presence of a [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or [[electric field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.ns.22.120172.001121 |title=Perturbation of Nuclear Decay Rates |year=1972 |author=Emery, G T |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear Science |volume=22|issue=1 |pages=165–202|bibcode = 1972ARNPS..22..165E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/264340a0 |title=Direct test of the constancy of fundamental nuclear constants |year=1976 |author=Shlyakhter, A.

''How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates'' [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html Usenet Physics FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions are nuclides that decay by the process of electron capture, such as [[beryllium-7]], [[strontium-85]], and [[zirconium-89]], whose decay rate may be affected by local electron density. For all other nuclides, the proportion of the original nuclide to its decay products changes in a predictable way as the original nuclide decays over time. This predictability allows the relative abundances of related nuclides to be used as a [[clock]] to measure the time from the incorporation of the original nuclides into a material to the present.

===Accuracy of radiometric dating===
[[Image:Thermal ionization mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal ionization mass spectrometer]] used in radiometric dating.]]
The basic equation of radiometric dating requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation. The possible confounding effects of contamination of parent and daughter isotopes have to be considered, as do the effects of any loss or gain of such isotopes since the sample was created. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of [[Metasomatism|alteration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(96)00132-X |title=3-D, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar---&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar geochronology in the Paraná continental flood basalt province |year=1996 |author=Stewart, K,, Turner, S, Kelley, S, Hawkesworh, C Kristein, L and Manotvani, M |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=143|issue=1–4 |pages=95–109 |bibcode=1996E&amp;PSL.143...95S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precision is enhanced if measurements are taken on multiple samples from different locations of the rock body. Alternatively, if several different minerals can be dated from the same sample and are assumed to be formed by the same event and were in equilibrium with the reservoir when they formed, they should form an [[isochron dating|isochron]]. This can reduce the problem of [[contamination]]. In [[uranium–lead dating]], the [[concordia diagram]] is used which also decreases the problem of nuclide loss. Finally, correlation between different isotopic dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample. For example, the age of the Amitsoq [[gneiss]]es from western [[Greenland]] was determined to be {{Ma|3.60|million years ago (MA)|error=0.05|round=2}} using uranium–lead dating and {{Ma|3.56|Ma|error=0.10|round=2}} using lead–lead dating, results that are consistent with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalrymple|first1=G. Brent|title=The age of the earth|date=1994|publisher=Stanford Univ. Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804723312}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142&amp;ndash;143}}

Accurate radiometric dating generally requires that the parent has a long enough half-life that it will be present in significant amounts at the time of measurement (except as described below under "Dating with short-lived extinct radionuclides"), the half-life of the parent is accurately known, and enough of the daughter product is produced to be accurately measured and distinguished from the initial amount of the daughter present in the material. The procedures used to isolate and analyze the parent and daughter nuclides must be precise and accurate. This normally involves [[isotope-ratio mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickin|first1=Alan P.|title=Radiogenic isotope geology|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521530170|pages=15&amp;ndash;49|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precision of a dating method depends in part on the half-life of the radioactive isotope involved. For instance, carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. After an organism has been dead for 60,000 years, so little carbon-14 is left that accurate dating cannot be established. On the other hand, the concentration of carbon-14 falls off so steeply that the age of relatively young remains can be determined precisely to within a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Closure temperature===
{{Main article|Closure temperature}}

If a material that selectively rejects the daughter nuclide is heated, any daughter nuclides that have been accumulated over time will be lost through [[diffusion]], setting the isotopic "clock" to zero. The temperature at which this happens is known as the [[closure temperature]] or blocking temperature and is specific to a particular material and isotopic system. These temperatures are experimentally determined in the lab by [[Petrology#Branches|artificially resetting sample minerals]] using a high-temperature furnace. As the mineral cools, the crystal structure begins to form and diffusion of isotopes is less easy. At a certain temperature, the crystal structure has formed sufficiently to prevent diffusion of isotopes. This temperature is what is known as closure temperature and represents the temperature below which the mineral is a closed system to isotopes. Thus an igneous or metamorphic rock or melt, which is slowly cooling, does not begin to exhibit measurable radioactive decay until it cools below the closure temperature. The age that can be calculated by radiometric dating is thus the time at which the rock or mineral cooled to closure temperature.&lt;ref name=Faure&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gunter |last=Faure |title=Principles and applications of geochemistry: a comprehensive textbook for geology students |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]] |year=1998 |pages= |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-02-336450-1 |oclc=37783103}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rollinson&gt;{{Cite book|first=Hugh R. |last=Rollinson |title=Using geochemical data: evaluation, presentation, interpretation |publisher=[[Longman]] |location=[[Harlow]] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=978-0-582-06701-1 |oclc=27937350}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating of different minerals and/or isotope systems (with differing closure temperatures) within the same rock can therefore enable the tracking of the thermal history of the rock in question with time, and thus the history of metamorphic events may become known in detail. This field is known as [[thermochronology]] or thermochronometry.

===The age equation===
[[Image:Sm Nd Great Dyke Isochron.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[Samarium–neodymium dating|Sm/Nd]] Isochron plotted of samples&lt;ref name=Oberthuer&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0301-9268(01)00215-7 |title=Precise U–Pb mineral ages, Rb–Sr and Sm–Nd systematics for the Great Dyke, Zimbabwe—constraints on late Archean events in the Zimbabwe craton and Limpopo belt |year=2002 |author=Oberthür, T, Davis, DW, Blenkinsop, TG, Hoehndorf, A |journal=Precambrian Research |volume=113|issue=3–4 |pages=293–306|bibcode=2002PreR..113..293O }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Great Dyke]], [[Zimbabwe]]. The age is calculated from the slope of the isochron (line) and the original composition from the intercept of the isochron with the y-axis.]]

The mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is&lt;ref name=Faure/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{Cite web|first=W. M. |last=White |year=2003 |title=Basics of Radioactive Isotope Geochemistry |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |url=http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/classes/Geo656/656notes03/656%2003Lecture04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''D'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''N''(''t'') (''e''&lt;sup&gt;''λt''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)

where
:''t'' is age of the sample,
:''D'' is number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the sample,
:''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the original composition,
:''N'' is number of atoms of the parent isotope in the sample at time t (the present), given by ''N''(''t'') = ''N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;e''&lt;sup&gt;-''λt''&lt;/sup&gt;, and
:''λ'' is the [[decay constant]] of the parent isotope, equal to the inverse of the radioactive [[half-life]] of the parent isotope&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/radiometric.html |title=Geologic Time: Radiometric Time Scale |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |date=16 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; times the natural logarithm of 2.

The equation is most conveniently expressed in terms of the measured quantity ''N''(''t'') rather than the constant initial value ''N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The above equation makes use of information on the composition of parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material being tested cooled below its closure temperature. This is well-established for most isotopic systems.&lt;ref name=Rollinson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(75)90088-6 |title=Approximation of terrestrial lead isotope evolution by a two-stage model |date=June 1975 |first=J.

Kramers  |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=207–221 |bibcode=1975E&amp;PSL..26..207S}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, construction of an isochron does not require information on the original compositions, using merely the present ratios of the parent and daughter isotopes to a standard isotope. Plotting an isochron is used to solve the age equation graphically and calculate the age of the sample and the original composition.

==Modern dating methods==
Radiometric dating has been carried out since 1905 when it was [[Age of the Earth#Invention of radiometric dating|invented]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] as a method by which one might determine the [[age of the Earth]]. In the century since then the techniques have been greatly improved and expanded.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt; Dating can now be performed on samples as small as a nanogram using a [[mass spectrometer]]. The mass spectrometer was invented in the 1940s and began to be used in radiometric dating in the 1950s. It operates by generating a beam of [[ion|ionized atoms]] from the sample under test. The ions then travel through a magnetic field, which diverts them into different sampling sensors, known as "[[Faraday cup]]s", depending on their mass and level of ionization. On impact in the cups, the ions set up a very weak current that can be measured to determine the rate of impacts and the relative concentrations of different atoms in the beams.

===Uranium–lead dating method===
{{Main article|Uranium–lead dating}}
[[Image:Pfunze belt concordia.png|thumb|upright=1.8|A concordia diagram as used in [[uranium–lead dating]], with data from the [[Pfunze Belt]], [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(01)90021-1 |title=U-Pb zircon ages from a craton-margin archaean orogenic belt in northern Zimbabwe |year=2001 |first=M.

[[Uranium–lead radiometric dating]] involves using uranium-235 or uranium-238 to date a substance's absolute age. This scheme has been refined to the point that the error margin in dates of rocks can be as low as less than two million years in two-and-a-half billion years.&lt;ref name=Oberthuer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.12.003 |title=The age and petrology of the Chimbadzi Hill Intrusion, NW Zimbabwe: first evidence for early Paleoproterozoic magmatism in Zimbabwe |year=2004 |first=Tawanda D. |last=Manyeruke |author2=Thomas G.

Uranium–lead dating is often performed on the [[mineral]] [[zircon]] (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), though it can be used on other materials, such as [[baddeleyite]], as well as [[monazite]] (see: [[monazite geochronology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2113/104.1.13 |title=SHRIMP baddeleyite and zircon ages for an Umkondo dolerite sill, Nyanga Mountains, Eastern Zimbabwe |year=2001 |first=M.T.D. |last=Wingate |journal=South African Journal of Geology |volume=104|issue=1 |pages=13–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zircon and baddeleyite incorporate uranium atoms into their crystalline structure as substitutes for [[zirconium]], but strongly reject lead. Zircon has a very high closure temperature, is resistant to mechanical weathering and is very chemically inert. Zircon also forms multiple crystal layers during metamorphic events, which each may record an isotopic age of the event. ''In situ'' micro-beam analysis can be achieved via laser [[ICP-MS]] or [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|SIMS]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.286.5448.2289 |title=Isotope Geochemistry: New Tools for Isotopic Analysis |date=December 1999 |first=Trevor |last=Ireland |journal=Science |volume=286 |issue=5448 |pages=2289–2290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its great advantages is that any sample provides two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a half-life of about 700 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination of the age of the sample even if some of the lead has been lost. This can be seen in the concordia diagram, where the samples plot along an errorchron (straight line) which intersects the concordia curve at the age of the sample.

===Samarium–neodymium dating method===
{{Main article|Samarium–neodymium dating}}

This involves the [[alpha decay]] of &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Sm to &lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Nd with a [[half-life]] of 1.06 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; years. Accuracy levels of within twenty million years in ages of two-and-a-half billion years are achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(98)00228-3 |title=A multielement geochronologic study of the Great Dyke, Zimbabwe: significance of the robust and reset ages |date=December 1998 |first=S.

===Potassium–argon dating method===
{{Main article|Potassium–argon dating}}

This involves [[electron capture]] or [[positron]] decay of potassium-40 to argon-40. Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 billion years, and so this method is applicable to the oldest rocks. Radioactive potassium-40 is common in [[mica]]s, [[feldspar]]s, and [[hornblende]]s, though the closure temperature is fairly low in these materials, about 350&amp;nbsp;°C (mica) to 500&amp;nbsp;°C (hornblende).

===Rubidium–strontium dating method===
{{Main article|Rubidium–strontium dating}}

This is based on the beta decay of [[rubidium-87]] to [[strontium-87]], with a half-life of 50 billion years. This scheme is used to date old [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s, and has also been used to date [[moon rock|lunar samples]]. Closure temperatures are so high that they are not a concern. Rubidium-strontium dating is not as precise as the uranium-lead method, with errors of 30 to 50 million years for a 3-billion-year-old sample.

===Uranium–thorium dating method===
{{Main article|Uranium–thorium dating}}

A relatively short-range dating technique is based on the decay of uranium-234 into thorium-230, a substance with a half-life of about 80,000 years. It is accompanied by a sister process, in which uranium-235 decays into protactinium-231, which has a half-life of 32,760 years.

While [[uranium]] is water-soluble, [[thorium]] and [[protactinium]] are not, and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor [[sediment]]s, from which their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. A related method is [[ionium–thorium dating]], which measures the ratio of [[ionium]] (thorium-230) to thorium-232 in ocean sediment.

===Radiocarbon dating method===

Carbon-14, though, is continuously created through collisions of neutrons generated by [[cosmic rays]] with nitrogen in the [[upper atmosphere]] and thus remains at a near-constant level on Earth. The carbon-14 ends up as a trace component in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

A carbon-based life form acquires carbon during its lifetime. Plants acquire it through [[photosynthesis]], and animals acquire it from consumption of plants and other animals. When an organism dies, it ceases to take in new carbon-14, and the existing isotope decays with a characteristic half-life (5730 years). The proportion of carbon-14 left when the remains of the organism are examined provides an indication of the time elapsed since its death. This makes carbon-14 an ideal dating method to date the age of bones or the remains of an organism. The carbon-14 dating limit lies around 58,000 to 62,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Wolfango |last=Plastino |author2=Lauri Kaihola |author3=Paolo Bartolomei |author4=Francesco Bella |year=2001 |title=Cosmic background reduction in the radiocarbon measurement by scintillation spectrometry at the underground laboratory of Gran Sasso |url=http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http%3A%2F%2Fradiocarbon.library.arizona.edu%2FVolume43%2FNumber2A%2Fazu_radiocarbon_v43_n2A_157_161_v.pdf |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=43 |issue=2A |pages=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of creation of carbon-14 appears to be roughly constant, as cross-checks of carbon-14 dating with other dating methods show it gives consistent results. However, local eruptions of [[volcano]]es or other events that give off large amounts of carbon dioxide can reduce local concentrations of carbon-14 and give inaccurate dates. The releases of carbon dioxide into the [[biosphere]] as a consequence of [[industrialization]] have also depressed the proportion of carbon-14 by a few percent; conversely, the amount of carbon-14 was increased by above-ground [[nuclear bomb]] tests that were conducted into the early 1960s. Also, an increase in the [[solar wind]] or the Earth's [[magnetic field]] above the current value would depress the amount of carbon-14 created in the atmosphere.

===Fission track dating method===
{{Main article|fission track dating}}
[[Image:Apatite Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Apatite]] crystals are widely used in fission track dating.]]
This involves inspection of a polished slice of a material to determine the density of "track" markings left in it by the [[spontaneous fission]] of uranium-238 impurities. The uranium content of the sample has to be known, but that can be determined by placing a plastic film over the polished slice of the material, and bombarding it with [[thermal neutrons|slow neutrons]]. This causes induced fission of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, as opposed to the spontaneous fission of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U. The fission tracks produced by this process are recorded in the plastic film. The uranium content of the material can then be calculated from the number of tracks and the [[neutron flux]].

This scheme has application over a wide range of geologic dates. For dates up to a few million years [[mica]]s, [[tektite]]s (glass fragments from volcanic eruptions), and meteorites are best used. Older materials can be dated using [[zircon]], [[apatite]], [[titanite]], [[epidote]] and [[garnet]] which have a variable amount of uranium content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(01)80066-X |title=A titanite fission track profile across the southeastern Archæan Kaapvaal Craton and the Mesoproterozoic Natal Metamorphic Province, South Africa: evidence for differential cryptic Meso- to Neoproterozoic tectonism |date=August 2001 |first=J. |last=Jacobs |author2=R. J. Thomas |journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=323–333|bibcode = 2001JAfES..33..323J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the fission tracks are healed by temperatures over about 200&amp;nbsp;°C the technique has limitations as well as benefits. The technique has potential applications for detailing the thermal history of a deposit.

===Chlorine-36 dating method===
Large amounts of otherwise rare [[chlorine-36|&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl]] (half-life ~300ky) were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of [[nuclear weapon]]s between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and ground water, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.

===Luminescence dating methods===
{{Main article|Luminescence dating}}

Luminescence dating methods are not radiometric dating methods in that they do not rely on abundances of isotopes to calculate age. Instead, they are a consequence of [[background radiation]] on certain minerals. Over time, [[ionizing radiation]] is absorbed by mineral grains in sediments and archaeological materials such as [[quartz]] and [[potassium feldspar]]. The radiation causes charge to remain within the grains in structurally unstable "electron traps". Exposure to sunlight or heat releases these charges, effectively "bleaching" the sample and resetting the clock to zero. The trapped charge accumulates over time at a rate determined by the amount of background radiation at the location where the sample was buried. Stimulating these mineral grains using either light ([[optically stimulated luminescence]] or infrared stimulated luminescence dating) or heat ([[thermoluminescence dating]]) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral.

These methods can be used to date the age of a sediment layer, as layers deposited on top would prevent the grains from being "bleached" and reset by sunlight. Pottery shards can be dated to the last time they experienced significant heat, generally when they were fired in a kiln.

==Dating with decay products of short-lived extinct radionuclides==
Absolute radiometric dating requires a measurable fraction of parent nucleus to remain in the sample rock. For rocks dating back to the beginning of the solar system, this requires extremely long-lived parent isotopes, making measurement of such rocks' exact ages imprecise. To be able to distinguish the relative ages of rocks from such old material, and to get a better time resolution than that available from long-lived isotopes, short-lived isotopes that are no longer present in the rock can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J. Lissauer: ''Planetary Sciences'', page 321. Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-48219-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the solar system, there were several relatively short-lived radionuclides like &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al, &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn, and &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I present within the solar nebula. These radionuclides—possibly produced by the explosion of a supernova—are extinct today, but their decay products can be detected in very old material, such as that which constitutes [[meteorite]]s. By measuring the decay products of extinct radionuclides with a [[mass spectrometer]] and using isochronplots, it is possible to determine relative ages of different events in the early history of the solar system. Dating methods based on extinct radionuclides can also be calibrated with the U-Pb method to give absolute ages. Thus both the approximate age and a high time resolution can be obtained. Generally a shorter half-life leads to a higher time resolution at the expense of timescale.

===The &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I – &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe chronometer===
{{see also|Iodine-129#Meteorite age dating}}
&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I beta-decays to &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe with a half-life of 16 million years. The iodine-xenon chronometer&lt;ref name=IXe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmour|first=J.

Samples are exposed to neutrons in a nuclear reactor.  This converts the only stable isotope of iodine (&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I) into &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe via neutron capture followed by beta decay (of &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;I).  After irradiation, samples are heated in a series of steps and the xenon [[isotopic signature]] of the gas evolved in each step is analysed.  When a consistent  &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe/&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe ratio is observed across several consecutive temperature steps, it can be interpreted as corresponding to a time at which the sample stopped losing xenon.

Samples of a meteorite called Shallowater are usually included in the irradiation to monitor the conversion efficiency from &lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I to &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe.  The difference between the measured &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe/&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe ratios of the sample and Shallowater then corresponds to the different ratios of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I/&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I when they each stopped losing xenon.  This in turn corresponds to a difference in age of closure in the early solar system.

===The &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer===
Another example of short-lived extinct radionuclide dating is the [[Aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer, which can be used to estimate the relative ages of [[chondrules]]. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al decays to &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg with a [[half-life]] of 720 000 years. The dating is simply a question of finding the deviation from the [[natural abundance]] of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg (the product of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al decay) in comparison with the ratio of the stable isotopes &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al/&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg.

The excess of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg (often designated &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg* ) is found by comparing the &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg/&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Mg ratio to that of other Solar System materials.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander N. Krot(2002) Dating the Earliest Solids in our Solar System, Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer gives an estimate of the time period for formation of primitive meteorites of only a few million years (1.4 million years for Chondrule formation).&lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J.

In [[mathematics]], a '''recurrence relation''' is an [[equation]] that [[recursion|recursively]] defines a [[sequence]] or multidimensional array of values, once one or more initial terms are given: each further term of the sequence or array is defined as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the preceding terms.

The term '''[[#Relationship_to_difference_equations_narrowly_defined|difference equation]]''' sometimes (and for the purposes of this article) refers to a specific type of recurrence relation.  However, "difference equation" is frequently used to refer to ''any'' recurrence relation.

==Examples==

===Logistic map===
An example of a recurrence relation is the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

with a given constant ''r''; given the initial term ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; each subsequent term is determined by this relation.

Some simply defined recurrence relations can have very complex ([[chaos theory|chaotic]]) behaviours, and they are a part of the field of mathematics known as [[Nonlinearity|nonlinear analysis]].

Solving a recurrence relation means obtaining a [[closed-form solution]]: a non-recursive function of ''n''.

===Fibonacci numbers===
The recurrence satisfied by the [[Fibonacci number]]s is the archetype of a homogeneous [[linear recurrence]] relation with constant coefficients (see below).  The Fibonacci sequence is defined using the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

with [[initial condition]]s (seed values)

:&lt;math&gt;F_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Explicitly, the recurrence yields the equations
:&lt;math&gt;F_2 = F_1 + F_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_3 = F_2 + F_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_4 = F_3 + F_2&lt;/math&gt;
etc.

We obtain the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which begins
:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The recurrence can be solved by methods described below yielding [[Binet's formula]], which involves powers of the two roots of the characteristic polynomial ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1; the [[generating function]] of the sequence is the [[rational function]]
:  &lt;math&gt;\frac{t}{1-t-t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Binomial coefficients===
A simple example of a multidimensional recurrence relation is given by the [[binomial coefficient]]s &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt;, which count the number of ways of selecting ''k'' elements out of a set of ''n'' elements.
They can be computed by the recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k},&lt;/math&gt;
with the base cases &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{0}=\tbinom{n}{n}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Using this formula to compute the values of all binomial coefficients generates an infinite array called [[Pascal's triangle]]. The same values can also be computed directly by a different formula that is not a recurrence, but that requires multiplication and not just addition to compute:
&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship to difference equations narrowly defined ==
Given an ordered [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{a_n\right\}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; of [[real numbers]]: the '''first difference''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(a_n) = a_{n+1} - a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''second difference''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n) = \Delta(a_{n+1}) - \Delta(a_n),&lt;/math&gt;

which can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n) = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally: the ''' ''k''-th difference''' of the sequence ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta^k(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined recursively as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^k(a_n) = \Delta^{k-1}(a_{n+1}) - \Delta^{k-1}(a_n)=\sum_{t=0}^k \binom{k}{t} (-1)^t a_{n+k-t}.&lt;/math&gt;

(The sequence and its differences are related by a [[binomial transform]].) The more restrictive definition of '''difference equation''' is an equation composed of ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and its ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; differences. (A widely used broader definition treats "difference equation" as synonymous with "recurrence relation".  See for example [[rational difference equation]] and [[matrix difference equation]].)

Actually, it is easily seen that,

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+k} = 
{k\choose 0}a_n + {k\choose 1} \Delta(a_n)  + \cdots + {k\choose k} \Delta^k(a_n).
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a difference equation can be defined as an equation that involves 
''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;'' etc. (or equivalently
''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+2&lt;/sub&gt;'' etc.)

Since difference equations are a very common form of recurrence, some authors use the two terms interchangeably. For example, the difference equation

:&lt;math&gt;3\Delta^2(a_n) + 2\Delta(a_n) + 7a_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to the recurrence relation

:&lt;math&gt;3a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - 8a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus one can solve many recurrence relations by rephrasing them as difference equations, and then solving the difference equation, analogously to how one solves [[ordinary differential equations]].  However, the [[Ackermann number]]s are an example of a recurrence relation that do not map to a difference equation, much less points on the solution to a differential equation.

See [[time scale calculus]] for a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of [[differential equations]].

[[Summation equation]]s relate to difference equations as [[integral equation]]s relate to differential equations.

===From sequences to grids===
Single-variable or one-dimensional recurrence relations are about sequences (i.e. functions defined on one-dimensional grids). Multi-variable or n-dimensional recurrence relations are about n-dimensional grids. Functions defined on n-grids can also be studied with '''partial difference equations'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1klnDGelHGEC Partial difference equations], Sui Sun Cheng, CRC Press, 2003, {{isbn|978-0-415-29884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solving ==

=== Solving homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients ===

{{Main|Constant-recursive sequence|Linear difference equation}}

====Roots of the characteristic polynomial====
An order-''d'' '''homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients'''  is an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_da_{n-d},&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''d'' coefficients ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for all ''i'') are constants, and &lt;math&gt;c_d\ne0&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[constant-recursive sequence]] is a sequence satisfying a recurrence of this form.  There are ''d'' [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for solutions to this recurrence, i.e., the initial values &lt;math&gt;a_0,\dots,a_{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be taken to be any values but then the recurrence determines the sequence uniquely.

The same coefficients yield the [[characteristic polynomial]] (also "auxiliary polynomial")

:&lt;math&gt;p(t)= t^d - c_1t^{d-1} - c_2t^{d-2}-\cdots-c_{d}&lt;/math&gt;
whose ''d'' roots play a crucial role in finding and understanding the sequences satisfying the recurrence. If the roots ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are all distinct, then each solution to the recurrence takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = k_1 r_1^n + k_2 r_2^n + \cdots + k_d r_d^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are determined in order to fit the initial conditions of the recurrence. When the same roots occur multiple times, the terms in this formula corresponding to the second and later occurrences of the same root are multiplied by increasing powers of ''n''. For instance, if the characteristic polynomial can be factored as (''x''−''r'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with the same root ''r'' occurring three times, then the solution would take the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = k_1 r^n + k_2 n r^n + k_3 n^2 r^n.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=2.1.1 Constant coefficients – A) Homogeneous equations|title=Mathematics for the Analysis of Algorithms|first1=Daniel H.|last1=Greene|first2=Donald E.|last2=Knuth|author2-link=Donald Knuth| edition=2nd| publisher=Birkhäuser |page=17 | year=1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the [[Fibonacci number]]s, other constant-recursive sequences include the [[Lucas number]]s and [[Lucas sequence]]s, the [[Jacobsthal number]]s, the [[Pell number]]s and more generally the solutions to [[Pell's equation]].

For order 1, the recurrence
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n}=r a_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
has the solution ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and the most general solution is ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kr&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''. The  characteristic polynomial equated to zero (the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]]) is simply ''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Solutions to such recurrence relations of higher order are found by systematic means, often using the fact that ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a solution for the recurrence exactly when ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r'' is a root of the characteristic polynomial. This can be approached directly or using [[generating function]]s ([[formal power series]]) or matrices.

Consider, for example, a recurrence relation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n}=Aa_{n-1}+Ba_{n-2}.&lt;/math&gt;

When does it have a solution of the same general form as ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''? Substituting this guess ([[ansatz]]) in the recurrence relation, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;r^{n}=Ar^{n-1}+Br^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

must be true for '''all'''&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

Dividing through by ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sup&gt;, we get that all these equations reduce to the same thing:

:&lt;math&gt;r^2=Ar+B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r^2-Ar-B=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation.  Solve for ''r'' to obtain the two roots ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: these roots are known as the [[characteristic root]]s or '''eigenvalues''' of the characteristic equation.  Different solutions are obtained depending on the nature of the roots:  If these roots are distinct, we have the general solution

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda_1^n+D\lambda_2^n&lt;/math&gt;

while if they are identical (when ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), we have

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda^n+Dn\lambda^n&lt;/math&gt;

This is the most general solution; the two constants ''C'' and ''D'' can be chosen based on two given initial conditions ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to produce a specific solution.

In the case of complex eigenvalues (which also gives rise to complex values for the solution parameters ''C'' and ''D''), the use of complex numbers can be eliminated by rewriting the solution in trigonometric form.  In this case we can write the eigenvalues as &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2 = \alpha \pm \beta i.&lt;/math&gt; Then it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda_1^n+D\lambda_2^n&lt;/math&gt;

can be rewritten as&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Alpha C., ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', third edition, McGraw-Hill, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|576–585}}

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = 2 M^n \left( E \cos(\theta n) + F \sin(\theta n)\right) = 2 G M^n \cos(\theta n - \delta),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
  M = \sqrt{\alpha^2+\beta^2} &amp; \cos (\theta) =\tfrac{\alpha}{M} &amp; \sin( \theta) = \tfrac{\beta}{M} \\
  C,D = E \mp F i &amp; &amp; \\
  G = \sqrt{E^2+F^2} &amp; \cos (\delta ) = \tfrac{E}{G} &amp; \sin (\delta )= \tfrac{F}{G}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''E'' and ''F'' (or equivalently, ''G'' and δ)  are real constants which depend on the initial conditions. Using 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1+\lambda_2=2 \alpha = A,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \cdot \lambda_2=\alpha^2+\beta^2=-B,&lt;/math&gt;

one may simplify the solution given above as

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = (-B)^{\frac{n}{2}} \left( E \cos(\theta n) + F \sin(\theta n)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the initial conditions and

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  E &amp;=\frac{-A a_1 + a_2}{B} \\
 F &amp;=-i \frac{A^2 a_1 - A a_2 +2 a_1 B}{B \sqrt{A^2+4B}} \\
\theta &amp;=\arccos \left (\frac{A}{2 \sqrt{-B}} \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In this way there is no need to solve for λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In all cases—real distinct eigenvalues, real duplicated eigenvalues, and complex conjugate eigenvalues—the equation is [[stability theory|stable]] (that is, the variable ''a'' converges to a fixed value [specifically, zero]) if and only if ''both'' eigenvalues are smaller than one in [[absolute value]].  In this second-order case, this condition on the eigenvalues can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Papanicolaou, Vassilis, "On the asymptotic stability of a class of linear difference equations," ''Mathematics Magazine'' 69(1), February 1996, 34&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; to be equivalent to |''A''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2, which is equivalent to |''B''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and |''A''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''B''.

The equation in the above example was [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]], in that there was no constant term.  If one starts with the non-homogeneous recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;b_{n}=Ab_{n-1}+Bb_{n-2}+K&lt;/math&gt;

with constant term ''K'', this can be converted into homogeneous form as follows:  The [[steady state]] is found by setting ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' =&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''b''* to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; b^{*} = \frac{K}{1-A-B}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the non-homogeneous recurrence can be rewritten in homogeneous form as

:&lt;math&gt;[b_n - b^*]=A[b_{n-1}-b^*]+B[b_{n-2}-b^*],&lt;/math&gt;

which can be solved as above.

The stability condition stated above in terms of eigenvalues for the second-order case remains valid for the general ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order case:  the equation is stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the characteristic equation are less than one in absolute value.

Given a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients of order ''d'', let ''p''(''t'') be the [[characteristic polynomial]] (also "auxiliary polynomial")

:&lt;math&gt;t^d - c_1t^{d-1} - c_2t^{d-2}-\cdots-c_{d} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

such that each ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' corresponds to each ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the original recurrence relation (see the general form above). Suppose &amp;lambda; is a root of ''p''(''t'') having [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] ''r''. This is to say that (''t''−λ)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; divides ''p''(''t''). The following two properties hold:

# Each of the ''r'' sequences &lt;math&gt;\lambda^n, n\lambda^n, n^2\lambda^n,\dots,n^{r-1}\lambda^n&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the recurrence relation.
# Any sequence satisfying the recurrence relation can be written uniquely as a linear combination of solutions constructed in part 1 as ''λ'' varies over all distinct roots of&amp;nbsp;''p''(''t'').

As a result of this theorem a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients can be solved in the following manner:

# Find the characteristic polynomial ''p''(''t'').
# Find the roots of ''p''(''t'') counting multiplicity.
# Write ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a linear combination of all the roots (counting multiplicity as shown in the theorem above) with unknown coefficients ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

::&lt;math&gt;a_n = \left (b_1\lambda_1^n + b_2n\lambda_1^n + b_3n^2\lambda_1^n+\cdots+b_r n^{r-1}\lambda_1^n \right )+\cdots+ \left (b_{d-q+1}\lambda_{*}^n + \cdots + b_{d}n^{q-1}\lambda_{*}^n \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:This is the general solution to the original recurrence relation. (''q'' is the multiplicity of λ&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;)

:4. Equate each &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots,a_d&lt;/math&gt; from part 3 (plugging in ''n'' = 0, ..., ''d'' into the general solution of the recurrence relation) with the known values &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots,a_d&lt;/math&gt; from the original recurrence relation. However, the values ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the original recurrence relation used do not usually have to be contiguous: excluding exceptional cases, just ''d'' of them are needed (i.e., for an original homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 3 one could use the values ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  This process will produce a linear system of ''d'' equations with ''d'' unknowns. Solving these equations for the unknown coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots,b_d &lt;/math&gt; of the general solution and plugging these values back into the general solution will produce the particular solution to the original recurrence relation that fits the original recurrence relation's initial conditions (as well as all subsequent values &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; of the original recurrence relation).

The method for solving linear [[differential equations]] is similar to the method above—the "intelligent guess" ([[ansatz]]) for linear differential equations with constant coefficients is ''e''&lt;sup&gt;λ''x''&lt;/sup&gt; where λ is a complex number that is determined by substituting the guess into the differential equation.

This is not a coincidence.  Considering the [[Taylor series]] of the solution to a linear differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infin \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n&lt;/math&gt;

it can be seen that the coefficients of the series are given by the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative of ''f''(''x'') evaluated at the point ''a''. The differential equation provides a linear difference equation relating these coefficients.

This equivalence can be used to quickly solve for the recurrence relationship for the coefficients in the power series solution of a linear differential equation.

The rule of thumb (for equations in which the polynomial multiplying the first term is non-zero at zero) is that:

:&lt;math&gt;y^{[k]} \to  f[n+k]&lt;/math&gt;
and more generally
:&lt;math&gt;x^m*y^{[k]} \to n(n-1)...(n-m+1)f[n+k-m]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example:''' The recurrence relationship for the Taylor series coefficients of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; (x^2 + 3x -4)y^{[3]} -(3x+1)y^{[2]} + 2y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

:&lt;math&gt; n(n-1)f[n+1] + 3nf[n+2] -4f[n+3] -3nf[n+1] -f[n+2]+ 2f[n] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;-4f[n+3] +2nf[n+2] + n(n-4)f[n+1] +2f[n] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This example shows how problems generally solved using the power series solution method taught in normal differential equation classes can be solved in a much easier way.

'''Example:''' The differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;ay'' + by' +cy = 0&lt;/math&gt;

has solution

:&lt;math&gt; y=e^{ax}.&lt;/math&gt;

The conversion of the differential equation to a difference equation of the Taylor coefficients is

:&lt;math&gt;af[n + 2] + bf[n + 1] + cf[n] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that the ''n''th derivative of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ax''&lt;/sup&gt; evaluated at 0 is ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

====Solving via linear algebra====
A linearly recursive sequence y of order n

:&lt;math&gt;y_{n+k} - c_{n-1}y_{n-1+k} - c_{n-2}y_{n-2+k} + \cdots - c_{0}y_{k} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is identical to

:&lt;math&gt;y_{n} = c_{n-1}y_{n-1} + c_{n-2}y_{n-2} + \cdots +c_{0}y_{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Expanded with n-1 identities of kind &lt;math&gt;y_{n-k} = y_{n-k},&lt;/math&gt; this n-th order equation is translated into a [[matrix difference equation]] system of n first-order linear equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\vec y_{n} = \begin{bmatrix}y_n\\y_{n-1}\\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ y_1 \end{bmatrix} =

\begin{bmatrix}
 c_{n-1} &amp; c_{n-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; c_{0} \\
 1       &amp; 0       &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0     \\
 0       &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots &amp;        &amp;\vdots \\
 \vdots  &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp;\vdots \\
 0       &amp; \cdots  &amp; 0      &amp; 1     &amp; 0      \end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}y_{n-1} \\y_{n-2} \\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ y_0 \end{bmatrix} 
= C\ \vec y_{n-1} = C^n \vec y_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by ''n'' applications of the [[companion matrix]], C, to the initial state vector, &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt;. Thereby, n-th entry of the sought sequence y, is the top component of &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n, y_n = \vec y_n[n]&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Eigendecomposition of a matrix#Example|Eigendecomposition]], &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n = C^n\, \vec y_0 = c_1\,\lambda_1^n\,\vec e_1 + c_2\,\lambda_2^n\,\vec e_2 + \cdots + c_n\,\lambda_n^n\,\vec e_n&lt;/math&gt; into eigenvalues, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;, and eigenvectors, &lt;math&gt;\vec e_1, \vec e_2, \ldots, \vec e_n&lt;/math&gt;, is used to compute &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n.&lt;/math&gt; Thanks to the crucial fact that system ''C'' time-shifts every eigenvector, ''e'', by simply scaling its components ''λ'' times,

:&lt;math&gt;C\,\vec e_i = \lambda_i \vec e_i = C \begin{bmatrix}e_{i,n} \\e_{i,n-1} \\ \vdots \\ e_{i,1}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_i\,e_{i,n} \\ \lambda_i\,e_{i,n-1} \\ \vdots \\ \lambda_i\,e_{i,1}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

that is, time-shifted version of eigenvector,''e'', has components ''λ'' times larger, the eigenvector components are powers of ''λ'', &lt;math&gt;\vec e_i = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_i^{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_i^2 &amp; \lambda_i &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^T,&lt;/math&gt; and, thus, recurrent homogeneous linear equation solution is a combination of exponential functions, &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n = \sum_1^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^n\,\vec e_i}&lt;/math&gt;. The components &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; can be determined out of initial conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec y_0 = \begin{bmatrix}y_{0}\\ y_{-1} \\ \vdots\\ y_{-n+1}\end{bmatrix} = \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^0\,\vec e_i} = \begin{bmatrix}\vec e_1 &amp; \vec e_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; \vec e_n\end{bmatrix}\,\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix} = E\, \begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for coefficients,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix} = E^{-1} \vec y_0 = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1^{n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \lambda_n^{n-1} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \lambda_1 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; \cdots &amp;  \lambda_n \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\,\begin{bmatrix}y_{0}\\ y_{-1} \\ \vdots\\ y_{-n+1}\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This also works with arbitrary boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{y_a, y_b, \ldots}_\text{n}&lt;/math&gt;, not necessary the initial ones,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}y_a \\ y_b \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix}\vec y_a[n] \\ \vec y_b[n] \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^a\,\vec e_i[n]} \\ \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^b\,\vec e_i[n]} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix}  =\begin{bmatrix}\sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^a\,\lambda_i^{n-1}} \\ \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^b\,\lambda_i^{n-1}} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \begin{bmatrix}\sum {c_i\,\lambda_i^{a+n-1}} \\ \sum {c_i\,\lambda_i^{b+n-1}} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1^{a+n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{a+n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_n^{a+n-1} \\ \lambda_1^{b+n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{b+n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_n^{b+n-1} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \end{bmatrix}\,\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This description is really no different from general method above, however it is more succinct. It also works nicely for situations like
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
  a_n =a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}\\
  b_n =2a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where there are several linked recurrences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discrete Algorithmic Mathematics|first1=Stephen B.|last1=Maurer|first2=Anthony|last2=Ralston|edition=2nd|publisher=A K Peters|year=1998|isbn=9781568810911|page=609}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solving with z-transforms====
Certain difference equations - in particular, [[Z-transform#Linear constant-coefficient difference equation|linear constant coefficient]] difference equations - can be solved using [[z-transform]]s. The ''z''-transforms are a class of [[integral transform]]s that lead to more convenient algebraic manipulations and more straightforward solutions. There are cases in which obtaining a direct solution would be all but impossible, yet solving the problem via a thoughtfully chosen integral transform is straightforward.

===Solving non-homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients===
If the recurrence is non-homogeneous, a particular solution can be found by the [[method of undetermined coefficients]] and the solution is the sum of the solution of the homogeneous and the particular solutions.  Another method to solve a non-homogeneous recurrence is the method of ''symbolic differentiation''.  For example, consider the following recurrence:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = a_{n} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

This is a non-homogeneous recurrence.  If we substitute ''n'' ↦ ''n''+1, we obtain the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the original recurrence from this equation yields

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} = 2 a_{n+1} - a_n&lt;/math&gt;

This is a homogeneous recurrence, which can be solved by the methods explained above.  In general, if a linear recurrence has the form

:&lt;math&gt; a_{n+k} = \lambda_{k-1} a_{n+k-1} + \lambda_{k-2} a_{n+k-2} + \cdots + \lambda_1 a_{n+1} + \lambda_0 a_{n} + p(n) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; are constant coefficients and ''p''(''n'') is the inhomogeneity, then if ''p''(''n'') is a polynomial with degree ''r'', then this non-homogeneous recurrence can be reduced to a homogeneous recurrence by applying the method of symbolic differencing ''r'' times.

If
:&lt;math&gt;P(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n x^n&lt;/math&gt;
is the generating function of the inhomogeneity, the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;A(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a(n) x^n&lt;/math&gt;
of the non-homogeneous recurrence 
:&lt;math&gt; a_n = \sum_{i=1}^s c_i a_{n-i}+p_n,\quad n\ge n_r,&lt;/math&gt;
with constant coefficients {{math|c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is derived from
:&lt;math&gt; \left (1-\sum_{i=1}^sc_ix^i \right )A(x)=P(x)+\sum_{n=0}^{n_r-1}[a_n-p_n]x^n-\sum_{i=1}^s c_ix^i\sum_{n=0}^{n_r-i-1}a_nx^n.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''P''(''x'') is a rational generating function, ''A''(''x'') is also one. The case discussed above, where ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K'' is a constant, emerges as one example of this formula, with ''P''(''x'') = ''K''/(1−''x''). Another example, the recurrence &lt;math&gt;a_n=10 a_{n-1}+n&lt;/math&gt; with linear inhomogeneity, arises in the definition of the [[schizophrenic number]]s. The solution of homogeneous recurrences is incorporated as ''p'' = ''P'' = 0.

===Solving first-order non-homogeneous recurrence relations with variable coefficients===
Moreover, for the general first-order non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation with variable coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = f_n a_n + g_n, \qquad f_n \neq 0,&lt;/math&gt;
there is also a nice method to solve it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.pccu.edu.tw/%7Emeng/Math15.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705023731/http://faculty.pccu.edu.tw/~meng/Math15.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let

Then

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \left(\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k \right) \left(A_0 + \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac{g_m}{\prod_{k=0}^m f_k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply the formula to &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = (1 + h f_{nh}) a_n + hg_{nh}&lt;/math&gt; and take the limit h→0, we get the formula for first order [[linear differential equation]]s with variable coefficients; the sum becomes an integral, and the product becomes the exponential function of an integral.

===Solving general homogeneous linear recurrence relations===
Many homogeneous linear recurrence relations may be solved by means of the [[generalized hypergeometric series]]. Special cases of these lead to recurrence relations for the [[orthogonal polynomials]], and many [[special function]]s. For example, the solution to

:&lt;math&gt;J_{n+1}=\frac{2n}{z}J_n-J_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

:&lt;math&gt;J_n=J_n(z), &lt;/math&gt;

the [[Bessel function]], while

:&lt;math&gt;(b-n)M_{n-1} +(2n-b-z)M_n - nM_{n+1}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

is solved by

:&lt;math&gt;M_n=M(n,b;z) &lt;/math&gt;

the [[confluent hypergeometric series]]. Sequences which are the solutions of [[P-recursive equation|linear difference equations with polynomial coefficients]] are called [[Holonomic function|P-recursive]]. For these specific recurrence equations algorithms are known which find [[Polynomial solutions of P-recursive equations|polynomial]], [[Abramov's algorithm|rational]] or [[Petkovšek's algorithm|hypergeometric]] solutions. 

===Solving first-order rational difference equations===
{{Main|Rational difference equation}}

A first order rational difference equation has the form &lt;math&gt;w_{t+1} = \tfrac{aw_t+b}{cw_t+d}&lt;/math&gt;. Such an equation can be solved by writing &lt;math&gt;w_t&lt;/math&gt; as a nonlinear transformation of another variable &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; which itself evolves linearly.  Then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;.

==Stability==

===Stability of linear higher-order recurrences===
The linear recurrence of order ''d'',

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_da_{n-d},  &lt;/math&gt;

has the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^d - c_1 \lambda^{d-1} - c_2 \lambda^{d-2} - \cdots - c_d \lambda^0 =0. &lt;/math&gt;

The recurrence is [[Stability theory|stable]], meaning that the iterates converge asymptotically to a fixed value, if and only if the [[eigenvalues]] (i.e., the roots of the characteristic equation), whether real or complex, are all less than [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] in absolute value.

===Stability of linear first-order matrix recurrences===
{{Main|Matrix difference equation}}

In the first-order matrix difference equation

:&lt;math&gt;[x_t - x^*] = A[x_{t-1}-x^*]&lt;/math&gt;

with state vector ''x'' and transition matrix ''A'', ''x'' converges asymptotically to the steady state vector ''x''* if and only if all eigenvalues of the transition matrix ''A'' (whether real or complex) have an [[absolute value]] which is less than&amp;nbsp;1.

===Stability of nonlinear first-order recurrences===
Consider the nonlinear first-order recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;x_n=f(x_{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

This recurrence is [[stability theory|locally stable]], meaning that it [[limit of a sequence|converges]] to a fixed point ''x''* from points sufficiently close to ''x''*, if the slope of ''f''  in the neighborhood of ''x''* is smaller than [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] in absolute value:  that is,

: &lt;math&gt;| f' (x^*) | &lt; 1. &lt;/math&gt;

A nonlinear recurrence could have multiple fixed points, in which case some fixed points may be locally stable and others locally unstable; for continuous ''f''  two adjacent fixed points cannot both be locally stable.

A nonlinear recurrence relation could also have a cycle of period ''k'' for ''k'' &gt; 1.  Such a cycle is stable, meaning that it attracts a set of initial conditions of positive measure, if the composite function

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) := f \circ f \circ \cdots \circ f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

with ''f'' appearing ''k'' times is locally stable according to the same criterion:

: &lt;math&gt;| g' (x^*) | &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''* is any point on the cycle.

In a [[chaos theory|chaotic]] recurrence relation, the variable ''x'' stays in a bounded region but never converges to a fixed point or an attracting cycle; any fixed points or cycles of the equation are unstable.  See also [[logistic map]], [[dyadic transformation]], and [[tent map]].

== Relationship to differential equations ==
When solving an [[ordinary differential equation]] [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerically]], one typically encounters a recurrence relation. For example, when solving the [[initial value problem]]

:&lt;math&gt;y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \ \ y(t_0)=y_0,&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Euler's method]] and a step size ''h'', one calculates the values

:&lt;math&gt;y_0=y(t_0), \ \ y_1=y(t_0+h), \ \ y_2=y(t_0+2h), \ \dots&lt;/math&gt;

by the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;\, y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n,y_n). &lt;/math&gt;

Systems of linear first order differential equations can be discretized exactly analytically using the methods shown in the [[discretization]] article.

== Applications ==

=== Biology ===
Some of the best-known difference equations have their origins in the attempt to model [[population]] dynamics. For example, the [[Fibonacci number]]s were once used as a model for the growth of a rabbit population.

The [[logistic map]] is used either directly to model population growth, or as a starting point for more detailed models of [[population dynamics]]. In this context, coupled difference equations are often used to model the interaction of two or more populations. For example, the Nicholson-Bailey model for a host-[[parasite]] interaction is given by

:&lt;math&gt;N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t e^{-aP_t} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{t+1} = N_t(1-e^{-aP_t}), &lt;/math&gt;

with ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; representing the hosts, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; the parasites, at time&amp;nbsp;''t''.

[[Integrodifference equation]]s are a form of recurrence relation important to spatial [[ecology]]. These and other difference equations are particularly suited to modeling [[voltinism|univoltine]] populations.

===Computer science===
Recurrence relations are also of fundamental importance in [[analysis of algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormen, T. et al, ''Introduction to Algorithms'', MIT Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Sedgewick, F. Flajolet, ''An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms'', Addison-Wesley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; If an [[algorithm]] is designed so that it will break a problem into smaller subproblems ([[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]), its running time is described by a recurrence relation.

A simple example is the time an algorithm takes to find an element in an ordered vector with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements,  in the worst case.

A naive algorithm will search from left to right, one element at a time. The worst possible scenario is when the required element is the last, so the number of comparisons is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

A better algorithm is called [[Binary search algorithm|binary search]]. However, it requires a sorted vector. It will first check if the element is at the middle of the vector. If not, then it will check if the middle element is greater or lesser than the sought element. At this point, half of the vector can be discarded, and the algorithm can be run again on the other half. The number of comparisons will be given by

:&lt;math&gt;c_1=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_n=1+c_{n/2}&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Time complexity|time complexity]] of which will be &lt;math&gt;O(\log_2(n))&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Digital signal processing ===
In [[digital signal processing]], recurrence relations can model feedback in a system, where outputs at one time become inputs for future time. They thus arise in [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) [[digital filter]]s.

For example, the equation for a "feedforward" IIR [[comb filter]] of delay ''T'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + \alpha y_{t - T}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; is the input at time ''t'', &lt;math&gt;y_t&lt;/math&gt; is the output at time ''t'', and α controls how much of the delayed signal is fed back into the output.  From this we can see that

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + \alpha ((1-\alpha) x_{t-T} + \alpha y_{t - 2T})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + (\alpha-\alpha^2) x_{t-T}  + \alpha^2 y_{t - 2T})&lt;/math&gt;

etc.

===Economics===
Recurrence relations, especially linear recurrence relations, are used extensively in both theoretical and empirical economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy L. |last=Stokey |authorlink=Nancy Stokey |first2=Robert E., Jr. |last2=Lucas |authorlink2=Robert Lucas, Jr. |first3=Edward C. |last3=Prescott |authorlink3=Edward C.

The model would then be solved for current values of key variables (interest rate, real GDP, etc.) in terms of [[exogeny|exogenous variables]] and lagged [[endogeneity (economics)|endogenous]] variables.  See also [[time series analysis]].

The '''Religious Education Association''' is the world’s oldest and largest association of scholars and researchers in the field of [[religious education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McBrien|first1=Richard|title=Encyclopedia of Catholicism|date=1995|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=1096–1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boys|first1=Mary|title=Educating in Faith: Maps and Visions|date=1989|publisher=Sheed &amp; Ward|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a nonprofit member association, serving as a professional and learned society for scholars and researchers involved in the field of religious education. It has several hundred members, most of whom are from North America, with a scattering of members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cully, et. al.|first1=Iris|title=Harper's Encyclopedia of Religious Education|date=1990|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=545 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; REA members are university and college professors, independent scholars, secondary teachers, clergy, church educators, curriculum developers, judicatory executives, seminarians, graduate students, and interested lay-people. REA members come from multiple faith traditions, and no tradition, and study a very diverse array of religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Stephen|title=History of the Religious Education Association|date=1983|publisher=Religious Education Press|location=Birmingham, AL|pages=192–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Education Association Presidents|REA's leaders (presidents and executive secretaries)]] are drawn from a distinguished list of educators.

==History==
The REA was founded in 1903 by [[William Rainey Harper]], the first president of the [[University of Chicago]], with the support of the Council of Seventy, a learned society of biblical scholars.&lt;ref&gt;"Form new organization for religious education," ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', June 20, 1903, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archibald|first1=Helen|title=Originating visions and visionaries of the REA|journal=Religious Education|date=Fall 2003|volume=98|issue=4|pages=413–425|doi=10.1080/00344080390244856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keynote speaker at its first convention was [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moran|first1=Gabriel|title=Still to come|journal=Religious Education|date=Fall 2003|volume=98|issue=4|pages=495–502|doi=10.1080/00344080390244829}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years the Association was organized into several groups: Council of religious education, Universities and colleges, Theological seminaries, Churches and pastors, Sunday schools, Secondary public schools, Elementary public schools, Private schools, Teacher-training, Christian associations, Young people’s societies, the Home, Libraries, the Press, Correspondence instructions, Summer assemblies, Religious art, and Music.&lt;ref&gt;"The Religious Education Association," in ''The Biblical World'', Vol. 25, No. 1, p. 70-72, Jan. 1905&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 the Association began to publish the journal ''Religious Education'' under the editorship of Henry Cope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Allen J.|title=100 years of the Religious Education Association|journal=Religious Education|date=Fall 2003|volume=98|issue=4|pages=426–436|doi=10.1080/00344080390238114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 the Association marked its 50th anniversary with a three-day meeting at the University of Pittsburgh that brought together more than 2500 Christian and Jewish educators from the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;"Church educators to mark 50th year," New York Times, 31 October 1953, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 the Association began awarding the William Harper Rainey award to distinguished educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Rainey Harper Award|url=http://www.religiouseducation.net/harper|website=Religious Education Association|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the Association held a major national colloquy on civil religion at which scholars Robert Bellah, Vine DeLoria, Jr., and Michael Novak spoke.&lt;ref&gt;"Educators weigh a 'civil religion,'" New York Times, 27 November 1975, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the Association began awarding the Herman E. Wornom award to distinguished institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herman E. Wornom Award|url=http://www.religiouseducation.net/wornom|website=Religious Education Association|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the REA merged with the Association of Professors and Researchers in Religious Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design for a joint reorganization of REA and APRRE|url=http://www.religiouseducation.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/REA_APRRE_052003.pdf|website=Religious Education Association|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was formed in 1970 from an earlier section of the [[National Council of Churches]]). Yale University holds the archives of the Religious Education Association and its predecessor bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Archives of the Religious Education Association (Record Group #74)|url=http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=divinity:074&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes|website=Yale University Library|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Archives of the Association of Professors and Researchers in Religious Education (Record Group #154)|url=http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=divinity:154&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes|website=Yale University Library|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52398">'''Situated cognition''' is a theory that posits that knowing is inseparable from doing&lt;ref&gt;[[John Seely Brown]], Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Greeno, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; by arguing that all knowledge is situated in activity bound to social, cultural and physical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Greeno &amp; Moore, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this assumption, which requires an [[epistemological]] shift from empiricism, situativity theorists suggest a model of knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual knowledge. In essence, cognition cannot be separated from the context. Instead knowing exists, ''in situ'', inseparable from context, activity, people, culture, and language. Therefore, learning is seen in terms of an individual's increasingly effective performance across situations rather than in terms of an accumulation of knowledge, since what is known is co-determined by the agent and the context. This perspective rejects [[mind–body dualism]], being conceptually similar to [[functional contextualism]], and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[behavior analysis]].

==History==
While situated cognition gained recognition in the field of [[educational psychology]] in the late twentieth century,&lt;ref name="Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989"&gt;Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; it shares many principles with older fields such as [[critical theory]], (Frankfurt School, 1930; Freire, 1968) [[anthropology]] ([[Jean Lave]] &amp; Wenger, 1991), philosophy ([[Martin Heidegger]], 1968), [[critical discourse analysis]] (Fairclough, 1989), and [[sociolinguistics]] theories ([[Bakhtin]], 1981) that rejected the notion of truly objective knowledge and the principles of Kantian [[empiricism]].

Lucy Suchman's work on situated action at Xerox Labs&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plans and situated actions: The problem of human-machine communication|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780521337397|location=Cambridge MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in popularizing the idea that an actor's understanding of how to perform work results from reflecting on interactions with the social and material (e.g. technology-mediated) situation in which she or he acts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|date=January 1993|title=Response to Vera and Simon's Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.1993.17.issue-1/issuetoc|journal=COGNITIVE SCIENCE|volume=17|pages=71–75|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent perspectives of situated cognition have focused on and draw from the concept of identity formation &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; as people negotiate meaning through interactions within communities of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Duguid, 2000; Clancey, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Situated cognition perspectives have been adopted in education,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; instructional design,&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; online communities and artificial intelligence (see Brooks, Clancey). Grounded Cognition, concerned with the role of simulations and embodiment in cognition, encompasses Cognitive Linguistics, Situated Action, Simulation and Social Simulation theories. Research has contributed to the understanding of embodied language, memory, and the representation of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Barsalou, L. Grounded Cognition (2008) Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2008. 59:617–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated cognition draws a variety of perspectives, from an anthropological study of human behavior in the context of technology-mediated work,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or within [[communities of practice]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  to the [[ecological psychology]] of the perception-action cycle&lt;ref&gt;[[James J. Gibson]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and intentional dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Kadar, Sim &amp; Reppenger, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and even research on robotics with work on [[autonomous agent]]s at NASA and elsewhere (e.g., work by W. J. Clancey). Early attempts to define situated cognition focused on contrasting the emerging theory with information processing theories dominant in cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Bredo, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently theorists have recognized a natural affinity between situated cognition, New Literacy Studies and [[new literacies]] research (Gee, 2010). This connection is made by understanding that situated cognition maintains that individuals learn through experiences. It could be stated that these experiences, and more importantly the mediators that affect attention during these experiences is affected by the tools, technologies and languages used by a socio-cultural group and the meanings given to these by the collective group. New literacies research examines the context and contingencies that language and tool use by individuals and how this changes as the Internet and other communication technologies affect literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Leu et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key principles==
===Affordances/effectivities===
[[James J. Gibson]] introduced the idea of [[affordance]]s as part of a relational account of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Perception should not be considered solely as the encoding of environmental features into the perceiver's mind, but as an element of an individual's interaction with her environment (Gibson, 1977). Central to his proposal of an ecological psychology was the notion of affordances. Gibson proposed that in any interaction between an agent and the environment, inherent conditions or qualities of the environment allow the agent to perform certain actions with the environment.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"&gt;Greeno, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the term as properties in the environment that presented possibilities for action and were available for an agent to perceive directly and act upon.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1979/1986"&gt;Gibson 1979/1986&lt;/ref&gt;
Gibson focused on the affordances of physical objects, such as doorknobs and chairs, and suggested that these affordances were directly perceived by an individual instead of mediated by mental representations such as mental models. It is important to note that Gibson's notion of direct perception as an unmediated process of noticing, perceiving, and encoding specific attributes from the environment, has long been challenged by proponents of a more category-based model of perception.

This focus on agent-situation interactions in ecological psychology was consistent with the situated cognition program of researchers such as James G. Greeno (1994, 1998), who appreciated Gibson's apparent rejection of the factoring assumptions underlying experimental psychology. The situated cognition perspective focused on "perception-action instead of memory and retrieval…A perceiving/acting agent is coupled with a developing/adapting environment and what matters is how the two interact".&lt;ref&gt;Young, Kulikowich, &amp; Barab, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;/ref&gt; Greeno (1994) also suggested that affordances are "preconditions for activity," and that while they do not determine behavior, they increase the likelihood that a certain action or behavior will occur.

Shaw, Turvey, &amp; Mace (as cited by Greeno, 1994) later introduced the term effectivities, the abilities of the agent that determined what the agent could do, and consequently, the interaction that could take place. Perception and action were co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which acted 'in the moment' together.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 1979/1986; Greeno, 1994; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the agent directly perceived and interacted with the environment, determining what affordances could be picked up, based on his effectivities. This view is consistent with Norman's (1988) theory of "perceived affordances," which emphasizes the agent's perception of an object's utility as opposed to focusing on the object itself.

An interesting question is the relationship between affordances and mental representations as set forth in a more cognitivist perspective. While Greeno (1998) argues that attunements to affordances are superior to constructs such as [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] and mental models, Glenberg &amp; Robertson (1999) suggested that affordances are the building blocks of mental models.

===Perception (variance/invariance)===
The work of Gibson (1986) in the field of visual [[perception]] greatly influences situated cognition.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"/&gt; Gibson argued that visual perception is not a matter of the eye translating inputs into symbolic representation in the brain. Instead the viewer perceives and picks up on the infinite amount of information available in the environment. Specifically, an agent perceives affordances by discovering the variants, what changes, and more importantly the invariants, what does not change across different situations. Given a specific intention (or intentional set),{{clarify|date=October 2011}} perceptions of invariants are co-determined by the agent and the affordances of the environment, and are then built upon over time.{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

===Memory===
Situated cognition and ecological psychology perspectives emphasize perception and propose that [[memory]] plays a significantly diminished role in the learning process. Rather, focus is on the continuous tuning of perceptions and actions across situations based on the affordances of the environment and the interaction of the agent within that environment (Greeno, 1994). Representations are not stored and checked against past knowledge, but are created and interpreted in activity (Clancey, 1990).

Situated cognition understands memory as an interaction with the world, bounded by meaningful situations, that brings an agent toward a specified goal (intention). Thus, perception and action are co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which act 'in the moment' together.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 1979/1986; Greeno, 1994; Young Kulikowich, &amp; Barab, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the agent directly perceives and interacts with the environment, determining what affordances can be picked up, based on his effectivities, and does not simply recall stored symbolic representations.

===Knowing===
Situativity theorists recast knowledge not as an entity, thing, or noun, but as knowing as an action or verb.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"/&gt; It is not an entity which can be collected as in knowledge acquisition models. Instead knowing is reciprocally co-determined between the agent and environment.&lt;ref name="br2006"&gt;Barab &amp; Roth, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This reciprocal interaction can not be separated from the context and its cultural and historical constructions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Therefore, knowing isn't a matter of arriving at any single truth but instead it is a particular stance that emerges from the agent-environment interaction.&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt;

Knowing emerges as individuals develop intentions&lt;ref&gt;Young, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; through goal-directed activities within cultural contexts which may in turn have larger goals and claims of truth. The adoption of intentions relates to the direction of the agent's attention to the detection of affordances in the environment that will lead to accomplishment of desired goals. Knowing is expressed in the agent's ability to act as an increasingly competent participant in a community of practice. As agents participate more fully within specific communities of practice, what constitutes knowing continuously evolves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, a novice environmentalist may not look at water quality by examining oxygen levels but may consider the color and smell.&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt; Through participation and enculturation within different communities, agents express knowing through action.

===Learning===
Since knowing is rooted in action and can not be decontextualized from individual, social, and historical goals&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt; teaching approaches that focus on conveying facts and rules separately from the contexts within which they are meaningful in real-life do not allow for [[learning]] that is based on the detection of invariants. They are therefore considered to be impoverished methods that are unlikely to lead to transfer. Learning must involve more than the transmission of knowledge but must instead encourage the expression of effectivities and the development of attention and intention&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004b&lt;/ref&gt; through rich contexts&lt;ref&gt;Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; that reflect real life learning processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Learning, more specifically literacy learning is affected by the Internet and other communication technologies as also evidenced in other segments of society. As a result of this youth are recently using affordances provided by these tools to become experts in a variety of domains.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"&gt;Gee, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These practices by youth are viewed as them becoming "pro-ams" and becoming experts in whatever they have developed a passion for.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 2006; Leadbeater &amp; Miller, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Individuals don't just read or write texts, they interact with them, and often these interactions involve others in various socio-cultural contexts. Since [[language]] is often the basis for monitoring and tracking learning gains in comprehension, content knowledge and tool use in and out of school the role of situated cognition in language learning activities is important. Membership and interaction in social and cultural groups is often determined by tools, technologies and [[discourse]] use for full participation. Language learning or literacy in various social and cultural groups must include how the groups work with and interact with these texts.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"/&gt; Language instruction in the context of situated cognition also involves the skilled or novice use of language by members of the group, and instruction of not only the elements of language, but what is needed to bring a student to the level of expert. Originating from emergent literacy,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson &amp; Neuman, 2006; Gee, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; specialist-language lessons examines the formal and informal styles and discourses of language use in socio-cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, 2004; Gee, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A function of specialist-language lessons includes "lucidly functional language", or complex specialist language is usually accompanied by clear and lucid language used to explain the rules, relationships or meanings existing between language and meaning.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"/&gt;

===Legitimate peripheral participation===
According to [[Jean Lave]] and Wenger (1991) [[legitimate peripheral participation]] (LPP) provides a framework to describe how individuals ('newcomers') become part of a community of learners. Legitimate peripheral participation was central to Lave and Wenger's take on situated cognition (referred to as "situated activity") because it introduced socio-cultural and historical realizations of power and access to the way thinking and knowing are legitimated. They stated, "Hegemony over resources for learning and alienation from full participation are inherent in the shaping of the legitimacy and peripherality of participation in its historical realizations" (p.&amp;nbsp;42). Lave and Wenger's (1991) research on the phenomenon of apprenticeship in communities of practice not only provided a unit of analysis for locating an individual's multiple, changing levels and ways of participation, but also implied that all participants, through increased involvement, have access to, acquire, and use resources available to their particular community.

To illustrate the role of LPP in situated activity, Lave and Wenger (1991) examined five apprenticeship scenarios (Yucatec midwives, Vai and Gola tailors, naval quartermasters, meat cutters, and non-drinking alcoholics involved in AA). Their analysis of apprenticeship across five different communities of learners lead them to several conclusions about the situatedness of LPP and its relationship to successful learning. Key to newcomers' success included:

* access to all that community membership entails,
* involvement in productive activity,
* learning the discourse(s) of the community including "talking about and talking within a practice," (p.&amp;nbsp;109), and
* willingness of the community to capitalize on the inexperience of newcomers, "Insofar as this continual interaction of new perspectives is sanctioned, everyone's participation is legitimately peripheral in some respect. In other words, everyone can to some degree be considered a 'newcomer' to the future of a changing community" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Planning vs. action ===
Suchman's book, ''Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-machine Communication'' (1987), provided a novel approach to the study of [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction (HCI)]]. By adopting an anthropological approach to sensemaking and interpretation, Suchman was able to demonstrate how both action and planning were situated in the context of a flow of socially- and materially-mediated activities - an idea that stimulated many of the later conceptualizations of situated cognition. Her studies contrasted the deterministic approach to planning assumed by technology designers with the situated nature of planning as people make sense of the status of their workflow and adjust their course of action accordingly. For example, a photocopier will instruct its user to reload all pages in the original order after a jam, whereas the user understands that they only need to copy the last page again.  By arguing that plans were the result of ongoing processes of prospective/retrospective sense making, Suchman identified the limits of technology system access to relevant social and material resources as a major cause of limitations in how technology supports human work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This position led to a major debate with Vera and Simon (1993), who argued that cognition is based on symbolic representations and that planning must therefore be deterministic, based on a pre-determined repertoire of learned response. Most organizational theorists would now see this debate as reflecting individual/cognitive vs. socially-situated levels of analysis (requiring a similar need for paradigmatic co-existence as [[Wave–particle duality]]). Suchman (1993) argues that planning in the context of work-activity is similar to navigating a canoe through rapids: you know what point on the river you are aiming for, but you constantly adjust your course as you interact with rocks, swells, and currents on the way. As a result many organizational theorists argue that plans can only be viewed as post-hoc justifications of action, while Suchman herself views appears to view plans and actions as interrelated in the moment of action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Representation, symbols, and schemata===
In situated theories, the term "[[Mental representation|representation]]" refers to external forms in the environment that are created through social interactions to express meaning (language, art, gestures, etc.) and are perceived and acted upon in the first person sense. "Representing" in the first person sense is conceived as an act of re-experiencing in the imagination that involves the dialectic of ongoing perceiving and acting in coordination with the activation of neural structures and processes. This form of reflective representation is considered to be a secondary type of learning, while the primary form of learning is found in the "adaptive recoordination that occurs with every behavior".&lt;ref name="clancey1993"&gt;Clancey, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptualizing is considered to be a "prelinguistic" act, while "knowing" involves creative interaction with [[symbol]]s in both their interpretation and use for expression. "Schema" develop as neural connections become biased through repeated activations to reactivate in situations that are perceived and conceived as temporally and compositionally similar to previous generalized situations.&lt;ref name="clancey1993" /&gt;

===Goals, intention, and attention===
[[File:PS Dynamics.jpg|thumb|left|Young-Barab Model (1997)]]The Young-Barab Model (1997) pictured to the left, illustrates the dynamics of intentions and intentional dynamics involved in the agent’s interaction with his environment when problem solving.

Dynamics of Intentions:&lt;ref name=ksy&gt;Kugler et al., 1991; Shaw et al., 1992; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; goal (intention) adoption from among all possible goals (ontological descent). This describes how the learner decides whether or not to adopt a particular goal when presented with a problem. Once a goal is adopted, the learner proceeds by interacting with their environment through intentional dynamics. There are many levels of intentions, but at the moment of a particular occasion, the agent has just one intention, and that intention constrains his behavior until it is fulfilled or annihilated.

Intentional Dynamics:&lt;ref name=ksy /&gt; dynamics that unfold when the agent has only one intention (goal) and begins to act towards it, perceiving and acting.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1979/1986"/&gt; It is a trajectory towards the achievement of a solution or goal, the process of tuning one’s perception (attention). Each intention is meaningfully bounded, where the dynamics of that intention inform the agent of whether or not he is getting closer to achieving his goal. If the agent is not getting closer to his goal, he will take corrective action, and then continue forward. This is the agent’s intentional dynamics, and continues on until he achieves his goal.

===Transfer===
There are various definition of transfer found within the situated cognition umbrella. Researchers interested in social practice often define transfer as increased participation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ecological psychology perspectives define transfer as the detection of invariance across different situations.&lt;ref&gt;Young &amp; McNeese, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, transfer can only "occur when there is a confluence of an individual's goals and objectives, their acquired abilities to act, and a set of affordances for action".&lt;ref&gt;Young et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied cognition===
{{main|Embodied cognition}}
The traditional cognition approach assumes that perception and motor systems are merely peripheral input and output devices.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, 2007; Wilson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[embodied cognition]] posits that the mind and body interact 'on the fly' as a single entity. An example of embodied cognition is seen in the area of robotics, where movements are not based on internal representations, rather, they are based on the robot’s direct and immediate interaction with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, research has shown that embodied facial expressions influence judgments,&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and arm movements are related to a person’s evaluation of a word or concept.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, &amp; Brendl, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter example, the individual would pull or push a lever towards his name at a faster rate for positive words, than for negative words. These results appeal to the embodied nature of situated cognition, where knowledge is the achievement of the whole body in its interaction with the world.

==Externalism==
As to the mind, by and large, situated cognition paves the way to various form of [[externalism]]. The issue is whether the situated aspect of cognition has only a practical value or it is somehow constitutive of cognition and perhaps of consciousness itself. As to the latter possibility, there are different positions. David Chalmers and Andy Clark, who developed the hugely debated model of the extended mind, explicitly rejected the externalization of consciousness.&lt;ref name="clark2008"&gt;Clark, A., (2008), ''Supersizing the Mind'', Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For them, only cognition is extended. On the other hand, others, like Riccardo Manzotti&lt;ref name=clark2008 /&gt; or Teed Rockwell,&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, 2005 #1561&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly considered the possibility to situate conscious experience in the environment.

==Pedagogical implications==
Since situated cognition views knowing as an action within specific contexts and views [[direct instruction]] models of knowledge transmission as impoverished, there are significant implications for pedagogical practices. First, curriculum requires instructional design that draws on apprenticeship models common in real life.&lt;ref name="Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989"/&gt; Second, curricular design should rely on contextual narratives that situate concepts in practice. Classroom practices such as [[project-based learning]] and [[problem-based learning]] would qualify as consistent with the [[situated learning]] perspective, as would techniques such as Case Base Learning, [[Anchored Instruction]], and [[cognitive apprenticeship]].

===Cognitive apprenticeship===
Cognitive apprenticeships were one of the earliest pedagogical designs to incorporate the theories of situated cognition (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship uses four dimensions (e.g., content, methods, sequence, sociology) to embed learning in activity and make deliberate the use of the social and physical contexts present in the classroom (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship includes the enculturation of students into authentic practices through activity and social interaction (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). The technique draws on the principles of Legitimate Peripheral Participation (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and reciprocal teaching (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984; 1989) in that a more knowledgeable other, i.e. a teacher, engages in a task with a more novice other, i.e. a learner, by describing their own thoughts as they work on the task, providing "just in time" scaffolding, modeling expert behaviors, and encouraging reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1985; Scardamalia, Bereiter. &amp; Steinbach, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The reflection process includes having students alternate between novice and expert strategies in a problem-solving context, sensitizing them to specifics of an expert performance, and adjustments that may be made to their own performance to get them to the expert level (Collins &amp; Brown, 1988; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Thus, the function of reflection indicates "co-investigation" and/or abstracted replay by students.&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1983; Collins &amp; Brown, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989) emphasized six critical features of a cognitive apprenticeship that included observation, coaching, [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], modeling, fading, and reflection. Using these critical features, expert(s) guided students on their journey to acquire the cognitive and metacognitive processes and skills necessary to handle a variety of tasks, in a range of situations&lt;ref&gt;Collins et al.,1989&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocal teaching, a form of cognitive apprenticeship, involves the modeling and coaching of various comprehension skills as teacher and students take turns in assuming the role of instructor.

===Anchored instruction===
Anchored instruction is grounded in a story or narrative that presents a realistic (but fictional) situation and raises an overarching question or problem (compare with an essential question posed by a teacher). This approach is designed to 1) engage the learner with a problem or series of related problems, 2) require the learner to develop goals and discover subgoals related to solving the problem(s), and 3) provide the learner with extensive and diverse opportunities to explore the problem(s) in a shared context with classmates. For example, a Spanish teacher uses a video drama series focused on the murder of a main character. Students work in small groups to summarize parts of the story, to create hypotheses about the murderer and motive, and to create a presentation of their solution to the class. Stories are often paired so that across the set students can detect the invariant structure of the underlying knowledge (so 2 episodes about distance-rate-time, one about boats and one about planes, so students can perceive how the distance-rate-time relationship holds across differences in vehicles). The ideal smallest set of instances needed provide students the opportunity to detect invariant structure has been referred to as a "generator set" of situations.

The goal of anchored instruction is the engagement of intention and attention. Through authentic tasks across multiple domains, educators present situations that require students to create or adopt meaningful goals (intentions). One of the educator’s objectives can be to set a goal through the use of an anchor problem.&lt;ref&gt;Barab &amp; Roth, 2006; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of anchored instruction is the Jasper series.&lt;ref&gt;The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990; Young et al., 1997; Young &amp; McNeese, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Jasper series includes a variety of videodisc adventures focused on problem formulation and problem solving. Each videodisc used a visual narrative to present an authentic, realistic everyday problem. The objective was for students to adopt specific goals (intentions) after viewing the story and defining a problem. These newly adopted goals guided students through the collaborative process of problem formulation and problem solving.

===Perceiving and acting in avatar-based virtual worlds===
[[Virtual world]]s provide unique affordances for embodied learning, i.e. hands on, interactive, spatially oriented, that ground learning in experience. Here "embodied" means acting in a virtual world enabled by an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]].

Contextual affordances of online games and virtual environments allow learners to engage in goal-driven activity, authentic interactions, and collaborative problem-solving – all considered in situated theories of learning to be features of optimal learning. In terms of situated assessment, virtual worlds have the advantage of facilitating dynamic feedback that directs the perceiving/acting agent, through an avatar, to continually improve performance.

==Research methodologies==
The situative perspective is focused on interactive systems in which individuals interact with one another and physical and representational systems. Research takes place ''in situ'' and in real-world settings, reflecting assumptions that knowledge is constructed within specific contexts which have specific situational affordances. Mixed methods and qualitative methodologies are the most prominently used by researchers.

In qualitative studies, methods used are varied but the focus is often on the increased participation in specific communities of practice, the affordances of the environment that are acted upon by the agent, and the distributed nature of knowing in specific communities. A major feature of quantitative methods used in situated cognition is the absence of outcome measures. Quantitative variables used in mixed methods often focus on process over product. For example, trace nodes, dribble files, and hyperlink pathways are often used to track how students interact in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Effken, Fajen, Garret &amp; Morris, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of situativity==
In "Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation" Vera and Simon wrote: " ... the systems usually regarded as exemplifying Situated Action are thoroughly symbolic (and representational), and, to the extent that they are limited in these respects, have doubtful prospects for extension to complex tasks"&lt;ref&gt;Vera &amp; Simon, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Vera and Simon (1993) also claimed that the [[information processing]] view is supported by many years of research in which symbol systems simulated "broad areas of human cognition" and that there is no evidence of cognition without representation.

Anderson, Reder and Simon (1996) summarized what they considered to be the four claims of situated learning and argued against each claim from a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] perspective. The claims and their arguments were:
# Claim: Activity and learning are bound to the specific situations in which they occur. Argument: Whether learning is bound to context or not depends on both the kind of learning and the way that it is learned.
# Claim: Knowledge does not transfer between tasks. Argument: There is ample evidence of successful transfer between tasks in the literature. Transfer depends on initial practice and the degree to which a successive task has similar cognitive elements to a prior task.
# Claim: Teaching abstractions is ineffective. Argument: Abstract instruction can be made effective by combining of abstract concepts and concrete examples.
# Claim: Instruction must happen in complex social contexts. Argument: Research shows value in individual learning and on focusing individually on specific skills in a skill set.

Anderson, Reder and Simons summarize their concerns when they say:
"What is needed to improve learning and teaching is to continue to deepen our research into the circumstances that determine when narrower or broader contexts are required and when attention to narrower or broader skills are optimal for effective and efficient learning" (p.&amp;nbsp;10).

===Considerations===
However, it is important to remember that a theory is neither wrong nor right but provides affordances for certain aspects of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sfard | first1 = A | year = 1998 | title = On two metaphors for learning and the dangers of choosing just one | url = | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 4–13 | doi=10.3102/0013189x027002004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lave and Wenger recognized this in their ironic comment, "How can we purport to be working out a theoretical conception of learning without engaging in the project of abstraction [decontextualized knowledge] rejected above?" (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3080">'''Tierra Helada''' (Spanish for "frozen land"), also known as '''Tierra Nevada''' (Spanish for "snowy land"), is a term used in Latin America to refer to the highest places found within the [[Andes]] mountains.

The ''Tierra Helada'' comprises the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[Suni (geography)|suni]]s, [[puna grassland|puna]]s and [[páramo]]s between the [[tree line]] and the [[snow line]]. The term ''tierra helada'' is accurate from a climatological standpoint, as its land is indeed "frozen", situated above the snow line. In the northern Andes, the latter is located at an altitude of approximately 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft (or about 4,500 m).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf Brigitta Schütt (2005); Azonale Böden und Hochgebirgsböden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327182826/http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zech and Hintermaier, 2002"&gt;Zech, W. and Hintermaier-Erhard, G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">'''Traditional transmission''' (also called '''cultural transmission''') is a design feature of [[language]] that the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Charles F. Hockett]] developed to distinguish the features of human language from those of [[animal communication]]. He discovered thirteen features that all human languages have. Animals might communicate with some of the thirteen basic design features of language but never with all of them. Traditional transmission is exemplified by the fact that language is learned in [[social group]]s. Although there is disagreement about how much linguistic capability humans are born with, it is known that the only way that humans learn language and refine its use as they grow is in social settings.

'''Virtual Researcher on Call''' ('''VROC''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] educational program administered by [[Partners in Research]].  The program connects students with knowledge partners — researchers and professionals — in [[health science|health]] and [[natural sciences]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]] ([[STEM fields]]) through [[video conferencing]] and [[podcast|video podcasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroc.ca/video/ VROC Video Podcasts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video conferencing==
Video conferencing technology is used to connect researchers and professionals in the STEM fields with [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school]] classrooms for real time, interactive discussion.

==Partners==
VROC is partnered with over 40 universities, colleges and institutions as well as school boards across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.vroc.ca/vroc/en/partner/| title=Partnered Institutions| publisher=VROC| date=30 August 2010| accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
VROC began with a "Reaching Higher" [[government grant|grant]] from the Ontario [[Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities]] in 2006 under the [[Dalton McGuinty]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2006/04/03/c1712.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html| title=McGuinty Government Investing in Science Students| author=CNW Group| date=3 April 2006| accessdate=4 September 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Partners in Research was awarded a nearly million dollar grant from the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario to teach southern Ontarian students about careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feddevontario.gc.ca/eic/site/723.nsf/eng/00682.html Government of Canada Supports Science and Tech Programming for Southern Ontario Youth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partners in Research hosts a national annual awards reception and ceremony entitled The PIR National Awards to celebrate Canadian research in the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pirweb.org/pir/en/pir-event/| title=PIR National Awards| publisher=Partners in Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from this evening support the Virtual Researcher On Call Program.

==Recognition==
In 2006 VROC was named a "New and Noteworthy Initiative" by the [[Canadian Education Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cea-ace.ca/apps/index.cfm?fuseaction=ini.dspDetails&amp;newsid=9b544723-65bf-6b7c-7d99-97691060d227&amp;year=2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921151908/http://cea-ace.ca/apps/index.cfm?fuseaction=ini.dspDetails&amp;newsid=9b544723-65bf-6b7c-7d99-97691060d227&amp;year=2006| dead-url=yes| archive-date=21 September 2010| title=Virtual Researcher on Call| publisher=Canadian Education Association| date=19 December 2006| accessdate=1 September 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt;
