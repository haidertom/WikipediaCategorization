The 10-year-old WABDL, one of a handful of international lifting organizations, recognized his lift as a national record for Palestine. "I think it was a groundbreaking experience," said Gus Rethwisch, the founder and president of the 4,200-member group. "He's not an activist. He's not political. He's just passionate," Rethwisch said.

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]],&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 52]&lt;/ref&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in [[Prometheus Bound]], places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. [[Diodorus]] mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

Archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the [[Scythian]] women may have inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Worrall|title=Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons-scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Amanda|title=The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/amazon-women-there-any-truth-behind-myth-180950188/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[early modern period]], their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the [[cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks also used some [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them.

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upleft|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]].]]

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]].&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]), but he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mitylene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais ({{lang-grc-gre|Τάναϊς}}) river (modern [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]]), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0400%3Achapter%3D14 Pseudo-Plutarch-XIV, TANAIS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (speculated to be modern [[Terme]], though no ruins exist) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey).
[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaign(s) of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons was at [[Euxine Sea]] (modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name="uchicago2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Paphos]], [[Mitylene]].&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; At [[Patmos]] there was a place called Amazonium.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadiasm.

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Amazons and Scythians'' by [[Otto van Veen]]]]

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Battle of the Amazons - WGA20302.jpg|thumb|310px|''[[The Battle of the Amazons (Rubens)|Battle of the Amazons]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"/&gt; According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"/&gt; Also, he mention that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere ({{lang|grc|Ὀτρηρή}}) and Antiope ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιόπη}}), built a marble temple of Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo17.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 380-390]&lt;/ref&gt; The island mentioned is the [[Aretias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D13 Pliny the Elder, The Natural History-Book VI-Chapter 13.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonauts]] passed by Themiscyra on their journey to [[Colchis]].

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

[[Plutarch]], in his work [[Parallel Lives]]-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainippe, an Amazon who confronted [[Telamon]] in the battle against Heracles' troops.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora" /&gt;

* Amastris, who was believed to be the [[eponym]] of the city previously known as Kromna,&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Amastris&lt;/ref&gt; although the city was actually named after the historical [[Amastrine|Amastris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 12. 3. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anaea, an Amazon whose tomb was shown at the island of [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Anaia&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kynna''. Stephanus does not write out the Amazon's name, simply stating that the town Cynna could have been named "after one of the Amazons".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ephesos, a [[Lydia]]n Amazon, after whom the city of [[Ephesus]] was thought to have been named; she was also said to have been the first to honor [[Artemis]] and to have surnamed the goddess ''Ephesia''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' 402. 8, under ''Ephesos''&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Amazo was thought of as the eponym of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Divina Virago": Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F.

[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==
[[File:Amazone auf Sondermarke.jpg|thumb|Amazon on a special stamp promoting German horse races in the 1930s.]]
[[File:Juliusz Kossak - Amazonka.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juliusz Kossak]] "An Amazon"]]
[[Francisco de Orellana]] gave the [[Amazon river]] its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

'''Angus Lindsay Wright''' is professor [[emeritus]] and one of the founders of the Environmental Studies program at [[California State University, Sacramento]], where he taught from 1972–2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Studies Department |work=Environmental Studies Department |url=http://www.csus.edu/envs/About_us.html#history |publisher=California State University, Sacramento |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929184249/http://www.csus.edu/envs/About_us.html |archivedate=September 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angus Wright, Ph.D. |work=Environmental Studies Department |url=http://www.csus.edu/envs/Faculty-staff/Wright.html |publisher=California State University, Sacramento |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613162322/http://www.csus.edu/envs/Faculty-staff/Wright.html |archivedate=June 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Wes Jackson]] was another of the founders.)

Wright earned his Ph.D. in Latin American History from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1976 with a dissertation on "Market, Land and Class: Southern Bahia, Brazil, 1890–1942." He has done research in [[Mexico]] and [[Brazil]] with the support of [[Fulbright]] and Doherty Research grants.

Wright's first book was ''The Death of Ramon Gonzalez: The Modern Agricultural Dilemma'' (University of Texas Press, 1990). This book is now available in an updated, second edition, published in 2005 by the [[University of Texas Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wright, The Death of Ramón González |url=http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/wrid2p.html|publisher=University of Texas Press |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |work=Catalog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright is the co-author of ''To Inherit the Earth: The Landless Movement and the Struggle for a New Brazil'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Inherit the Earthy |work=Catalog |url=http://www.foodfirst.org/en/store/book/To_Inherit_the_Earth |publisher=Food First! |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608021344/http://www.foodfirst.org/en/store/book/To_Inherit_the_Earth |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2003 by [[Food First|Food First!]]. He joined ecologists [[Ivette Perfecto]] and [[John Vandermeer]] of the University of Michigan to write ''Nature's Matrix: Linking Conservation, Agriculture, and Food Sovereignty'', published in 2009 by [[Earthscan]] Press of London. He has also written numerous articles on environmental history and the social and environmental consequences of agriculture and of property ownership in the Americas.

Wright has served as President and board member of the ''Pesticide Action Network North America'' and the ''Institute for Food and Development Policy ''([[Food First]]) and is Chairman of the Board of [[The Land Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.landinstitute.org/vnews/display.v/ART/2010/02/12/378256fb3{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} for documentation of his change in status from “member of Board” to “Chair of Board”&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the ''Investigative Mechanism'' (an independent citizen review board) of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], he coordinated a study of Latin America's largest hydroelectric plant, [[Yacyreta]]. He continues to lecture frequently at universities around the United States. From 2005 through 2007 he served as a lead author on the [[International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development]], sponsored by the [[United Nations]], the [[World Bank]], and a variety of other institutions and organizations and now available in various forms from [[Island Press]].

His wife [[Mary Mackey]] is a fellow CSU Sacramento academic, poet and novelist.

'''Audio forensics''' is the field of [[forensic science]] relating to the acquisition, analysis, and evaluation of [[sound recording]]s that may ultimately be presented as admissible evidence in a court of law or some other official venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan10/articles/forensics.htm|title=An Introduction To Forensic Audio|author=Phil Manchester|date=January 2010|publisher=Sound on Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maherieee2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maher|first=Robert C.|title=Audio forensic examination: authenticity, enhancement, and interpretation|journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine|volume=26|pages=84–94|date=March 2009|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4806208|doi=10.1109/msp.2008.931080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gelfandwired2007&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/10/audio_forensics |title=Audio Forensics Experts Reveal (Some) Secrets |date=10 October 2007 |author=Alexander Gelfand |publisher=Wired Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408153708/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/10/audio_forensics |archivedate=2012-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio forensic evidence may come from a criminal investigation by law enforcement or as part of an official inquiry into an accident, fraud, accusation of slander, or some other civil incident.&lt;ref name=maherasa2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maher|first=Robert C.|title=Lending an ear in the courtroom:  forensic acoustics|journal=Acoustics Today|volume=11|pages=22–29|date=Summer 2015|url=http://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lending-an-Ear-in-the-Courtroom-Forensic-Acoustics-Forensic-acoustics-deals-with-acquisition-analysis-and-evaluation-of-audio-recordings-to-be-used-as-evidence-in-an-official-legal-inquiry..pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary aspects of audio forensics are establishing the ''authenticity'' of audio evidence, performing [[Forensic audio enhancement|''enhancement'' of audio recordings]] to improve speech intelligibility and the audibility of low-level sounds, and ''interpreting and documenting'' sonic evidence, such as identifying talkers, transcribing dialog, and reconstructing crime or accident scenes and timelines.&lt;ref name=maherieee2009/&gt;

Modern audio forensics makes extensive use of [[digital signal processing]], with the former use of analog filters now being obsolete. Techniques such as [[adaptive filtering]] and [[discrete Fourier transform]]s are used extensively.&lt;ref name="gelfandwired2007" /&gt;

Recent advances in audio forensics techniques include [[voice biometrics]] and [[electrical network frequency analysis]].

{{Lists of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach}}
The '''{{lang|de|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis}}''' ('''BWV'''; {{Lit.}} Bach works catalogue) is a [[Catalogues of classical compositions|catalogue of compositions]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. It was first published in 1950, edited by [[Wolfgang Schmieder]]. The catalogue's second edition appeared in 1990. An abbreviated version of that second edition, known as BWV&lt;sup&gt;2a&lt;/sup&gt;, was published in 1998.

1126 compositions were assigned a BWV number in the 20th century. More compositions were added to the catalogue in the 21st century. The {{lang|de|Anhang}} (Anh.; Annex) of the BWV lists over 200 lost, doubtful and spurious compositions.

==History==
[[File:Loure bach.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The BWV is a [[thematic catalogue]], thus it identifies every movement of every composition by its first measures, like the opening of [[Partita for Violin No. 3 (Bach)|BWV 1006]], movement 2 (Loure) above]]
The first edition of the ''Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis'' was published in 1950. It allocated a unique number to every known composition by Bach. Wolfgang Schmieder, the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following the 19th-century [[Bach Gesellschaft]] (BG) edition for the collation (e.g. BG cantata number = BWV number of the cantata):&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Schmieder]] (editor). ''Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann Sebastian Bach''. Leipzig: Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 1950. Unaltered up unto its eighth printing in 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[List of Bach cantatas|Kantaten (Cantatas)]], BWV 1–224
# [[List of motets by Johann Sebastian Bach|Motetten (Motets)]], BWV 225–231
# [[List of Masses, Mass movements and Magnificats by Johann Sebastian Bach|Messen, Messensätze, Magnificat (Masses, Mass movements, Magnificat)]], BWV 232–243
# [[List of Passions and Oratorios by Johann Sebastian Bach|Passionen, Oratorien (Passions, Oratorios)]], BWV 244–249
# [[List of chorale harmonisations by Johann Sebastian Bach|Vierstimmige Choräle (Four-part chorales)]], BWV 250–438
# [[List of songs and arias by Johann Sebastian Bach|Lieder, Arien, Quodlibet (Songs, Arias and Quodlibet)]], BWV 439–524

# [[List of orchestral works by Johann Sebastian Bach|Orchesterwerke (Works for orchestra)]], BWV 1041–1071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos (BWV 1041–1065) and Overtures (BWV 1066–1071)

# [[List of late contrapuntal works by Johann Sebastian Bach|Musikalisches Opfer, Kunst der Fuge (Musical Offering, Art of the Fugue)]], BWV 1079–1080

The Anhang of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:
* [[BWV Anh. I|I – lost works, or works of which only a tiny fraction had survived]] (Anh. 1–23)
* [[BWV Anh. II|II – works of dubious authenticity]] (Anh. 24–155)
* [[BWV Anh. III|III – works that were once attributed to Bach, but for which it had been established they were not composed by him]] (Anh. 156–189)

Within each section of the Anhang the works are sorted by genre, following the same sequence of genres as the main catalogue.

Schmieder published the BWV's second edition in 1990, with some modifications regarding authenticity discriminations, and more works added to the main catalogue and the Anhang. Several compositions were repositioned in the over-all structure of chapters organised by genre and Anhang sections.&lt;ref&gt;(BWV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ''Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann Sebastian Bach: Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, überarbeitete und erweiterte Ausgabe''. Wiesbaden: Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 1990. {{ISBN|3765102555}} - {{ISBN|978-3765102554}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 [[Alfred Dürr]] and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition. This edition, known as BWV&lt;sup&gt;2a&lt;/sup&gt;, contained a few further updates and collation rearrangements.&lt;ref name="BWV1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Schmieder, Dürr, and Kobayashi|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New additions (Nachträge) to BWV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/BWV&lt;sup&gt;2a&lt;/sup&gt; included:
* [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach#Additions to the main catalogue (BWV 1081–1126)|BWV 1081–1126]]
* [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach#Additions to the Anhang (BWV Anh. 190–213)|BWV Anh. 190–213]]

An upper case R was used as an addition to a BWV number to indicate a [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach#Reconstructions|reconstructed version]], that is a conjectured earlier version of a known composition.

[[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach#21st century (BWV 1127 and higher)|Numbers above BWV 1126]] were added in the 21st century. A new revised version of the ''Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis'' has been announced by the [[Bach Archive]] for publication in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bach-leipzig.de/de/bach-archiv/das-neue-bach-werke-verzeichnis "Das neue Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis: Das revidierte BWV enthält Neuerkenntnisse aus 15 Jahren Bachforschung"] at [[Bach Archive]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers assigned to compositions by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and by others in the ''Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis'' are widely used for the unique identification of these compositions.

[[File:Jakob Jordaens 016.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Jacob Jordaens]], ''The Bean King''. Oil on canvas, ca. 1640- 1645.]]

A '''bean-feast''' was an informal term for a celebratory meal or party, especially an annual summer dinner given by an employer to his or her employees, probably derived from a tradition in the [[Low Countries]] at [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bean-Feast |volume=3 |page=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, colloquially, it describes any festive occasion with a meal and perhaps an outing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beanfeast From Merriam Webster Unabridged Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word, and its shorter form "beano," are fairly common in Britain, less known in the United States. An alternative derivation refers the name to the eating of a dish of beans and bacon, and seems to trace to 1725, when Daniel Day of [[Wapping]], London began to entertain friends near his estate at [[Fairlop]] in [[Essex]] on the first Friday in July.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qlJEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 ''Beauties of England and Wales''], Volume 10, Issue 3, Part 1, By Britton, pub. T. Maiden, 1815&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the beanfeast often took the form of a trip to some beauty spot, where the meal was provided. (e.g. ..''I want a feast, I want a bean feast. Cream buns and doughnuts and fruitcake with no nuts, so good you could go nuts. '' - Veruca Salt, [[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]])

It is derived from the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] feast, at which a [[king cake]] or pie with a special object or "favour" buried in it was a great feature. This remains a common custom in much of Europe and former European colonies; in the US mainly in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tI0eemYCDFgC&amp;pg=PA48 ''Mardi Gras, Gumbo, and Zydeco: Readings in Louisiana Culture''], eds Marcia G. Gaudet, James C. McDonald, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere the favour took various forms, including metal tokens and small pottery figures.  In the Low Countries a bean was usual.  The '''bean king''' for the rest of the night was the person who had the slice of cake containing the bean.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  The king (or queen) was given a paper crown to wear, and appointed various court officials.  When the king took a drink, all the party shouted "the king drinks". The subject was often painted by [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painters]], especially [[Jacob Jordaens]] and [[Jan Steen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/48341/?lng= Hermitage Museum]; [https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-feast-of-the-bean-king/MwEBgGg74T1f2g]; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hTBv607RId8C&amp;pg=PT45 ''Beans: A History''], Ken Albala, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Biogas''' refers to a mixture of different [[gas]]es produced by the breakdown of [[organic matter]] in the absence of oxygen. Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as [[agricultural waste]], [[manure]], [[municipal waste]], [[plant material]], [[sewage]], [[green waste]] or [[food waste]]. Biogas is a [[renewable energy]] source.

Biogas is produced by [[anaerobic digestion]] with [[methanogen]] or [[anaerobic organism]]s, which digest material inside a closed system, or [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of biodegradable materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-fuels-and-energy-factsheet-anaerobic-digestion "NNFCC Renewable Fuels and Energy Factsheet: Anaerobic Digestion"], Retrieved on 2011-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; This closed  system is called an [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digester,]] [[biodigester]] or a [[bioreactor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simgas.com/advantages-of-biogas/how-does-biogas-work/item46|title=How does biogas work?|last=Webdesign|first=Insyde|website=www.simgas.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogas is primarily [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) and [[carbon dioxide]] ({{ CO2}}) and may have small amounts of [[hydrogen sulphide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}), moisture and [[siloxane]]s. The gases [[methane]], [[hydrogen]], and [[carbon monoxide]] ({{chem|CO}}) can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen. This energy release allows biogas to be used as a [[fuel]]; it can be used for any heating purpose, such as cooking. It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/biogas/ |title=Biogas &amp; Engines|publisher=, www.clarke-energy.com|accessdate=  21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogas can be compressed, the same way as [[natural gas]] is compressed to [[compressed natural gas|CNG]], and used to power [[Alternative fuel vehicle|motor vehicles]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17% of vehicle fuel.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/biomethane-fueled-vehicles-the-carbon-neutral-option.html|title= Biomethane fueled vehicles the carbon neutral option|publisher= Claverton Energy Conference  Bath, UK|date= 24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It qualifies for renewable [[energy subsidies]] in some parts of the world. Biogas can be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards, when it becomes bio-methane. Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource because its production-and-use cycle is continuous, and it generates no net carbon dioxide. As the organic material grows, it is converted and used. It then regrows in a continually repeating cycle. From a carbon perspective, as much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of the primary bio-resource as is released, when the material is ultimately converted to energy.

==Production==
{{Main article|Anaerobic digestion}}
The biogas is a renewable energy that can be used for heating, electricity, and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine, such as [[GE Jenbacher]] or [[Caterpillar Inc|Caterpillar]] gas engines.&lt;ref&gt;State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). [http://www.seco.cpa.state.tx.us/re_biomass-manure.htm "Biomass Energy: Manure for Fuel."], 23 April 2009. Web. 3 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; To provide these internal combustion engines with biogas having ample gas pressure to optimize combustion, within the European Union [[ATEX directive|ATEX]] centrifugal [[Fan (machine)|fan]] units built in accordance with the European directive [[ATEX directive|2014/34/EU]] (previously 94/9/EG) are obligatory. These centrifugal fan units, for example [[Combimac]], Meidinger AG or Witt &amp; Sohn AG are suitable for use in [[ATEX directive|Zone 1 and 2]] .

Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat. The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed into biogas. It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser.

[[File:Biogasanlage-01.jpg|thumb|Biogas production in rural Germany]]

Biogas is produced either; 
* As [[landfill gas]] (LFG), which is produced by the breakdown of [[biodegradable waste]] inside a landfill due to chemical reactions and microbes, or 
* As digested gas, produced inside an [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digester]].

Projects such as NANOCLEAN are nowadays developing new ways to produce biogas more efficiently, using iron oxide nanoparticles in the processes of organic waste treatment. This process can triple the production of biogas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00425|title=Creating BIOGAS+: a new technology to improve the efficiency and profitability in the treatment of biowaste|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR. Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biogas plants ===
A ''biogas plant'' is the name often given to an [[anaerobic digester]] that treats farm wastes or energy crops. It can be produced using anaerobic digesters (air-tight tanks with different configurations). These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize [[silage]] or [[biodegradable waste]]s including sewage sludge and food waste. During the process, the micro-organisms transform biomass waste into biogas (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) and [[digestate]].

=== Key processes ===
There are two key processes: [[mesophilic]] and [[thermophilic]] digestion which is dependent on temperature. In experimental work at [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], a 1000-litre digester using [[psychrophiles]] harvested from "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" has produced 200–300&amp;nbsp;liters of methane per day, about 20%–30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="NewSc2785p14"&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dangers ===
The [[air pollution]] produced by biogas is similar to that of [[natural gas]].  The content of toxic [[hydrogen sulfide]] presents additional risks and has been responsible for serious accidents &lt;ref&gt;Incomplete understanding of biogas chemical hazards – Serious gas poisoning accident while unloading food waste at biogas plant, Journal of Chemical Health &amp; Safety, DOI 10.1016/j.jchas.2018.05.004 &lt;/ref&gt; . Leaks of unburned methane are an additional risk, because methane is a potent [[greenhouse gas]].

Biogas can be [[explosive]] when mixed in the ratio of one part biogas to 8–20 parts air. Special safety precautions have to be taken for entering an empty biogas digester for maintenance work. It is important that a biogas system never has negative pressure as this could cause an explosion. Negative gas pressure can occur if too much gas is removed or leaked; Because of this biogas should not be used at pressures below one column inch of water, measured by a pressure gauge.

Frequent smell checks must be performed on a biogas system. If biogas is smelled anywhere windows and doors should be opened immediately. If there is a fire the gas should be shut off at the gate valve of the biogas system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://werkgroepterlinden.be/Biogas.html|title=BIOGAS PROBLEMS|   publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landfill gas is produced by wet organic waste decomposing under anaerobic conditions in a biogas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bioenergy.org.nz/biogas.asp |title=Biogas – Bioenergy Association of New Zealand (BANZ) |publisher=Bioenergy.org.nz |date=29  2006 |accessdate=21 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125053346/http://www.bioenergy.org.nz/biogas.asp |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/lmop/proj/ LFG energy projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103070211/http://www.epa.gov/lmop/proj/ |date=3 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waste is covered and mechanically compressed by the weight of the material that is deposited above. This material prevents oxygen exposure thus allowing anaerobic microbes to thrive. Biogas builds up and is slowly released into the atmosphere if the site has not been engineered to capture the gas. Landfill gas released in an uncontrolled way can be hazardous since it can become explosive when it escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen. The lower [[explosive limit]] is 5% methane and the upper is 15% methane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas/safety/ Safety Page, Beginners Guide to Biogas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217044037/http://www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas/safety/ |date=17 February 2015 }}, www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas. Retrieved 22.10.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The methane in biogas is 28&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; times more potent a [[greenhouse gas]] than carbon dioxide. Therefore, uncontained landfill gas, which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the [[effects of global warming]]. In addition, [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) in landfill gas contribute to the formation of [[Smog#Photochemical smog|photochemical smog]].

===Technical===

[[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic micro-organisms to decompose the organic matter in a sample of material being used in the biodigester as well as the BOD for the liquid discharge allows for the calculation of the daily energy output from a biodigester.

Another term related to biodigesters is effluent dirtiness, which tells how much organic material there is per unit of biogas source. Typical units for this measure are in mg BOD/litre. As an example, effluent dirtiness can range between 800–1200&amp;nbsp;mg BOD/litre in Panama.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

From 1&amp;nbsp;kg of decommissioned kitchen bio-waste, 0.45 m³ of biogas can be obtained. The price for collecting biological waste from households is approximately €70 per ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obrecht|first1=Matevz|last2=Denac|first2=Matjaz|title=Biogas – a sustainable energy source: new measures and possibilities for SLovenia|journal=Journal of Energy Technology|date=2011|issue=5|pages=11–24|url=http://www.fe.um.si/images/jet/jet4-5-internet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of biogas varies depending upon the substrate composition, as well as the conditions within the anaerobic reactor (temperature, pH, and substrate concentration).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biogas/vignettes/predBg_function.pdf|title=Predicting methane and biogas production with the biogas package|last=Hafner|first=Sasha|date=2017|website=CRAN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Landfill gas]] typically has methane concentrations around 50%. Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with 55%–75% methane,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oaktech-environmental.com/Juniper.htm|title=Juniper|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for reactors with free liquids can be increased to 80%–90% methane using [[in-situ]] gas purification techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B.| last2 = Herndon | first2 = F. G.| last3 = Jewell | first3 = W. J.| last4 = Cummings | first4 = R. J.| last5 = White | first5 = T.

The fractional volume of water vapor is a function of biogas temperature; correction of measured gas volume for water vapour content and thermal expansion is easily done via simple mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B.| first2 = R.| first3 = T.| first4 = W. | title = Methods for kinetic analysis of methane fermentation in high solids biomass digesters| last1 = Richards | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 1| issue = 2 | pages =  65–73| year = 1991 | doi = 10.1016/0961-9534(91)90028-B| last2 =    Cummings| last3 =    White| last4 =    Jewell}}&lt;/ref&gt; which yields the standardized volume of dry biogas.

In some cases, biogas contains [[siloxanes]]. They are formed from the [[anaerobic decomposition]] of materials commonly found in soaps and detergents. During combustion of biogas containing siloxanes, [[silicon]] is released and can combine with free oxygen or other elements in the [[combustion gas]]. Deposits are formed containing mostly [[silica]] ({{chem|SiO|2}}) or [[silicates]] ({{chem|Si|''x''|O|''y''}}) and can contain [[calcium]], [[sulfur]], [[zinc]], [[phosphorus]]. Such ''white mineral'' deposits accumulate to a surface thickness of several millimeters and must be removed by chemical or mechanical means.

Practical and cost-effective technologies to remove siloxanes and other biogas contaminants are available.&lt;ref name="BiogasSiloxaneRemoval"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://biogas-digester.com/biogas-technology-lowers-costs.html|title=New Landfill Gas Treatment Technology Dramatically Lowers Energy Production Costs|last=Tower|first=P.|author2=Wetzel, J. |author3=Lombard, X. |date=March 2006|publisher=Applied Filter Technology|accessdate=30 April 2009}}(broken link)&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1000&amp;nbsp;kg (wet weight) of input to a typical biodigester, total solids may be 30% of the wet weight while [[volatile suspended solids]] may be 90% of the total solids. Protein would be 20% of the volatile solids, carbohydrates would be 70% of the volatile solids, and finally fats would be 10% of the volatile solids.

==Benefits of manure derived biogas==
High levels of [[methane]] are produced when manure is stored under anaerobic conditions. During storage and when manure has been applied to the land, [[nitrous oxide]] is also produced as a byproduct of the denitrification process. Nitrous oxide ({{chem|N|2O}}) is 320 times more aggressive as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/lead/toolbox/indust/ghgas.htm Increased Greenhouse Gas Emissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117230623/http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/lead/toolbox/Indust/GHGas.htm |date=17 January 2016 }}'', Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations''&lt;/ref&gt; and methane 25 times more than carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html Overview of Greenhouse Gases, Methane Emissions].'' Climate Change, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 11 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

By converting cow manure into methane biogas via [[anaerobic digestion]], the millions of cattle in the United States would be able to produce 100 billion kiloWatt hours of electricity, enough to power millions of homes across the United States. In fact, one cow can produce enough manure in one day to generate 3 kiloWatt hours of electricity; only 2.4 kiloWatt hours of electricity are needed to power a single 100-Watt light bulb for one day.&lt;ref&gt;State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). "Biomass Energy: Manure for Fuel." State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). State of Texas, 23 April 2009. Web. 3 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by converting cattle manure into methane biogas instead of letting it decompose, global warming gases could be reduced by 99 million metric tons or 4%.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, Michael E and Amanda D Cuellar.

==Applications==
[[File:BioGasBus.png|250px|right|thumb|A biogas bus in [[Linköping|Linköping, Sweden]]]]

Biogas can be used for electricity production on sewage works,&lt;ref name="Administrator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfagy.com/biogas-chp.html|title=Biogas CHP – Alfagy – Profitable Greener Energy via CHP, Cogen and Biomass Boiler using Wood, Biogas, Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Vegetable Oil, Syngas and Straw|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430111432/http://alfagy.com/biogas-chp.html|archive-date=30 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Cogeneration|CHP]] [[gas engine]], where the [[waste heat]] from the engine is conveniently used for heating the digester; cooking; space heating; [[water heating]]; and process heating. If compressed, it can replace [[compressed natural gas]] for use in vehicles, where it can fuel an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[fuel cell]]s and is a much more effective displacer of carbon dioxide than the normal use in on-site CHP plants.&lt;ref name="Administrator" /&gt;

===Biogas upgrading===
Raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly 60% methane and 29% {{chem|CO|2}} with trace elements of {{chem|H|2|S}}: inadequate for use in machinery. The corrosive nature of {{chem|H|2|S}} alone is enough to destroy the mechanisms.&lt;ref name="AbatzoglouBoivin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abatzoglou|first1=Nicolas|last2=Boivin|first2=Steve|title=A review of biogas purification processes|journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining|volume=3|issue=1|year=2009|pages=42–71|issn=1932-104X|doi=10.1002/bbb.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuertasGiraldo2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huertas|first1=J.I.|last2=Giraldo|first2=N.|last3=Izquierdo|first3=S.|title=Removal of H2S and CO2 from Biogas by Amine Absorption|year=2011|doi=10.5772/20039|journal=Mass Transfer in Chemical Engineering Processes|isbn=978-953-307-619-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methane in biogas can be concentrated via a [[biogas upgrader]] to the same standards as fossil [[natural gas]], which itself has to go through a cleaning process, and becomes ''biomethane''. If the local gas network allows, the producer of the biogas may use their distribution networks. Gas must be very clean to reach pipeline quality and must be of the correct composition for the distribution network to accept. [[Carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], and [[particulate]]s must be removed if present.&lt;ref name="AbatzoglouBoivin2009"/&gt;

There are four main methods of upgrading: water washing, pressure swing absorption, selexol absorption, and [[amine gas treating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgc.se/dokument/Evaluation.pdf|title=Nyheter – SGC|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, the use of membrane separation technology for biogas upgrading is increasing, and there are already several plants operating in Europe and USA.&lt;ref name="AbatzoglouBoivin2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf Petersson A., Wellinger A. (2009). Biogas upgrading technologies – developments and innovations. IEA Bioenergy Task 37] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129031426/http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf |date=29 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prevalent method is water washing where high pressure gas flows into a column where the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counter-flow to the gas. This arrangement could deliver 98% methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum 2% methane loss in the system. It takes roughly between 3% and 6% of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system.

===Biogas gas-grid injection===
Gas-grid injection is the injection of biogas into the [[methane grid]] ([[natural gas grid]]). Until the breakthrough of [[micro combined heat and power]] two-thirds of all the energy produced by [[Anaerobic digestion|biogas power plant]]s was lost (as heat). Using the grid to transport the gas to customers, the energy can be used for [[Distributed generation|on-site generation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea//news/article/2008/07/biogas-flows-through-germanys-grid-big-time-53075 |title=Biogas Flows Through Germany's Grid Big Time – Renewable Energy News Article |date=14 March 2012 |publisher= |accessdate=17 June 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314003328/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea//news/article/2008/07/biogas-flows-through-germanys-grid-big-time-53075 |archive-date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy. Typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from 1% to 2%; in electricity transmission they range from 5% to 8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyvortex.com/energydictionary/energy_loss__transmission_loss.html|title=energy loss, transmission loss|publisher=|access-date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before being injected in the gas grid, biogas passes a cleaning process, during which it is upgraded to natural gas quality. During the cleaning process trace components harmful to the gas grid and the final users are removed.&lt;ref name=":1&amp;quot;"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgc.se/ckfinder/userfiles/files/SGC118.pdf|title=Adding gas from biomass to the gas grid|last=|first=|date=|website=Swedish Gas Center|publisher=Swedish Gas Center|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogas in transport===
[[File:Biogas-train-amanda-in-linkoping-2006.JPG|thumb|250px|"Biogaståget Amanda" ("Amanda the Biogas Train") train near [[Linköping]] station, Sweden]]
If concentrated and compressed, it can be used in vehicle transportation. Compressed biogas is becoming widely used in [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and Germany. A biogas-powered train, named Biogaståget Amanda (The Biogas Train Amanda), has been in service in Sweden since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svenskbiogas.se/sb/docs/english/Biogastrain_produktblad_2005.pdf Biogas train in Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929143008/http://www.svenskbiogas.se/sb/docs/english/Biogastrain_produktblad_2005.pdf |date=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friendly fuel trains (30 October 2005) [[New Straits Times]], p. F17.&lt;/ref&gt; Biogas powers automobiles. In 1974, a British documentary film titled ''Sweet as a Nut'' detailed the biogas production process from pig manure and showed how it fueled a custom-adapted combustion engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/96790|title=Bates Car – Sweet As a Nut (1975)|work=BFI|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/bates_car_sweet_as_a_nut/|title=Bate's Car: Sweet as a Nut|author=National Film Board of Canada|work=NFB.ca|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an estimated 12,000 vehicles were being fueled with upgraded biogas worldwide, mostly in Europe.&lt;ref name="What is biogas" /&gt;

===Measuring in biogas environments===
Biogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas (or air) category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream. The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow. Biogas environments include wastewater digesters, landfills, and animal feeding operations (covered livestock lagoons).

Ultrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere. Most of thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking, although there are single-point insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop. They can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations, and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value.

==Legislation==

===European Union===
The European Union has legislation regarding waste management and landfill sites called the [[Landfill Directive]].

Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany now have legislation in force that provides farmers with long-term revenue and energy security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=72 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110323/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=72 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=CHP &amp;#124; Combined Heat and Power &amp;#124; Cogeneration &amp;#124; Wood Biomass Gasified Co-generation &amp;#124; Energy Efficiency &amp;#124; Electricity Generation |publisher=Alfagy.com |accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States legislates against landfill gas as it contains [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]]. The United States [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) requires landfill owners to estimate the quantity of non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) emitted. If the estimated NMOC emissions exceeds 50 tonnes per year, the landfill owner is required to collect the gas and treat it to remove the entrained NMOCs. Treatment of the landfill gas is usually by combustion. Because of the remoteness of landfill sites, it is sometimes not economically feasible to produce electricity from the gas.

==Global developments==

=== United States ===
With the many benefits of biogas, it is starting to become a popular source of energy and is starting to be used in the United States more. In 2003, the United States consumed 147 trillion BTU of energy from "landfill gas", about 0.6% of the total U.S. natural gas consumption.&lt;ref name="What is biogas"&gt;[http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/emerging_biogas_what_is.html What is biogas?], U.S. Department of Energy, 13 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Methane biogas derived from cow manure is being tested in the U.S. According to a 2008 study, collected by the ''Science and Children'' magazine, methane biogas from cow manure would be sufficient to produce 100 billion [[kilowatt hour]]s enough to power millions of homes across America. Furthermore, methane biogas has been tested to prove that it can reduce 99 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions or about 4% of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cuellar, Amanda D and Michael E Webber|title=Cow power: the energy and emissions benefits of converting manure to biogas|year=2008 |journal=Environ. Res. Lett. |volume=3 |page=034002 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/3/034002|issue=3|bibcode=2008ERL.....3c4002C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vermont, for example, biogas generated on dairy farms was included in the CVPS Cow Power program. The program was originally offered by Central Vermont Public Service Corporation as a voluntary tariff and now with a recent merger with Green Mountain Power is now the GMP Cow Power Program. Customers can elect to pay a premium on their electric bill, and that premium is passed directly to the farms in the program. In [[Sheldon, Vermont]], Green Mountain Dairy has provided renewable energy as part of the Cow Power program. It started when the brothers who own the farm, Bill and Brian Rowell, wanted to address some of the manure management challenges faced by dairy farms, including manure odor, and nutrient availability for the crops they need to grow to feed the animals. They installed an anaerobic digester to process the cow and milking center waste from their 950 cows to produce renewable energy, a bedding to replace sawdust, and a plant-friendly fertilizer. The energy and environmental attributes are sold to the GMP Cow Power program. On average, the system run by the Rowells produces enough electricity to power 300 to 350 other homes. The generator capacity is about 300 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;Zezima, Katie. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/businessspecial2/24farmers.html Electricity From What Cows Leave Behind]." ''The New York Times'', 23 September 2008, natl. ed.: SPG9. Web. 1 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hereford, Texas]], cow manure is being used to power an [[ethanol fuel|ethanol power]] plant. By switching to methane biogas, the ethanol power plant has saved 1000 barrels of oil a day. Over all, the power plant has reduced transportation costs and will be opening many more jobs for future power plants that will rely on biogas.&lt;ref&gt;State Energy Conservation Office (Texas).

In [[Oakley, Kansas]], an ethanol plant considered to be one of the largest biogas facilities in North America is using [[Integrated Manure Utilization System]] "IMUS" to produce heat for its boilers by utilizing feedlot manure, municipal organics and ethanol plant waste. At full capacity the plant is expected to replace 90% of the fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process of ethanol and methanol.&lt;ref&gt;Trash-to-energy trend boosts anaerobic digesters [http://finance-commerce.com/2013/10/trash-to-energy-trend-boosts-anaerobic-digesters/]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Western Plains Energy finishing up North America’s largest biogas digester [http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2013/03/13/western-plains-energy-finishing-up-north-americas-largest-biogas-digester/]."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The level of development varies greatly in Europe. While countries such as Germany, Austria and Sweden are fairly advanced in their use of biogas, there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent, especially in Eastern Europe. Different legal frameworks, education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential.&lt;ref name="SEBE Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sebe2013.eu |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141128141840/http://www.sebe2013.eu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 November 2014 |title=About SEBE |publisher= |accessdate=15 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioenergie.fnr.de/fileadmin/bioenergie-beratung/hessen/dateien/archiv_veranstaltungen/konfliktmanagement_maciejczyk_12_2010.pdf |title=404 – Seite nicht gefunden auf Server der Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe e.V.: FNR |publisher= |accessdate=17 June 2016 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the European Biogas Association (EBA) was founded in Brussels as a non-profit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in Europe. EBA's strategy defines three priorities: establish biogas as an important part of Europe’s energy mix, promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential, and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel. In July 2013, it had 60 members from 24 countries across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-biogas.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=4|title=European Biogas Association|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK ===
{{As of|September 2013}}, there are about 130 non-sewage biogas plants in the UK. Most are on-farm, and some larger facilities exist off-farm, which are taking food and consumer wastes.&lt;ref&gt;The Official Information Portal on AD [http://www.biogas-info.co.uk/index.php/ad-map.html 'Biogas Plant Map']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2010, biogas was injected into the UK gas grid for the first time. Sewage from over 30,000 Oxfordshire homes is sent to Didcot [[sewage treatment]] works, where it is treated in an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas, which is then cleaned to provide gas for approximately 200 homes.&lt;ref&gt;Sewage project sends first ever renewable gas to grid [http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/corp/hs.xsl/10982.htm Thames Water]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Green-Energy company [[Ecotricity]] announced their plans to build three grid-injecting digesters.

=== Italy  ===

Usually the biogas plants are directly connected with a CHP which produces electric power by burning the bio methane. The electrical power is then fed into the public power grid.&lt;ref name="IEA 2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass for Power Generation and CHP|url=http://www.iea.org/techno/essentials3.pdf|publisher=IEA|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the total installed electrical capacity of these power plants was 2,291 MW.&lt;ref name="Fachverband Biogas 2011" /&gt; The electricity supply was approximately 12.8 TWh, which is 12.6% of the total generated renewable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy Sources |url=https://wastersblog.com/1653/examples-of-renewable-resources/ |accessdate=6 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogas in Germany is primarily extracted by the co-fermentation of energy crops (called 'NawaRo', an abbreviation of ''nachwachsende Rohstoffe'', German for renewable resources) mixed with manure. The main crop used is corn. Organic waste and industrial and agricultural residues such as waste from the food industry are also used for biogas generation.&lt;ref name="Wieland, P. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieland|first=P.|title=Production and Energetic Use of Biogas from Energy Crops and Wastes in Germany|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p01720g04122n251/fulltext.pdf|journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology|volume=109|pages=263–274|accessdate=5 November 2011|doi=10.1385/abab:109:1-3:263|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, biogas production in Germany differs significantly from the UK, where biogas generated from landfill sites is most common.&lt;ref name="Eurobserv'er 2010"/&gt;

Biogas production in Germany has developed rapidly over the last 20 years. The main reason is the legally created frameworks. Government support of renewable energy started in 1991 with the Electricity Feed-in Act (''StrEG''). This law guaranteed the producers of energy from renewable sources the feed into the public power grid, thus the power companies were forced to take all produced energy from independent private producers of green energy.&lt;ref name="IfnE et al. 2009"&gt;{{cite web |title=Erneuerbare Energien in Deutschland. Rückblick und Stand des Innovationsgeschehens |url=http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/ibee_gesamt_bf.pdf |publisher=IfnE et al. |accessdate=5 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406095722/http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/ibee_gesamt_bf.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the Electricity Feed-in Act was replaced by the [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] (''EEG''). This law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over 20 years. The amount of around 8{{nbsp}}¢/kWh gave farmers the opportunity to become energy suppliers and gain a further source of income.&lt;ref name="Wieland, P. 2003" /&gt;

The German agricultural biogas production was given a further push in 2004 by implementing the so-called NawaRo-Bonus. This is a special payment given for the use of renewable resources, that is, energy crops.&lt;ref name="Wieland, P. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieland|first=P.|title=Biomass Digestion in Agriculture: A Successful Pathway for the Energy Production and Waste Treatment in Germany|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elsc.2006 20128/pdf|publisher=Engineering in Life Science |accessdate=5 November 2011|doi=10.1002/elsc.2006_20128|doi-broken-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the German government stressed its intention to invest further effort and support in improving the renewable energy supply to provide an answer on growing climate challenges and increasing oil prices by the ‘Integrated Climate and Energy Programme’.

This continual trend of renewable energy promotion induces a number of challenges facing the management and organisation of renewable energy supply that has also several impacts on the biogas production.&lt;ref name="Kanning et al. 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanning|first=H.|title=Erneuerbare Energien – Räumliche Dimensionen, neue Akteurslandschaften und planerische (Mit)Gestaltungspotenziale am Beispiel des Biogaspfades|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/907371418487t402/fulltext.pdf|publisher=Raumforschung und Raumordnung|accessdate=5 November 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first challenge to be noticed is the high area-consuming of the biogas electric power supply. In 2011 energy crops for biogas production consumed an area of circa 800,000 ha in Germany.&lt;ref name="FNR 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultivation of renewable Resources in Germany|url=http://www.nachwachsenderohstoffe.de/fileadmin/fnr/images/aktuelles/grafiken /FNR510_Grafik_Anbau_2011_engl__300_rgb.jpg|publisher=FNR|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high demand of agricultural areas generates new competitions with the food industries that did not exist hitherto. Moreover, new industries and markets were created in predominately rural regions entailing different new players with an economic, political and civil background. Their influence and acting has to be governed to gain all advantages this new source of energy is offering. Finally biogas will furthermore play an important role in the German renewable energy supply if good governance is focused.&lt;ref name="Kanning et al. 2009" /&gt;

Biogas in India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpowersystems.co.in/waste-management-and-biogas/|title=GPS Renewables – Waste management through biogas – GPS Renewables|work=GPS Renewables|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518075723/http://www.greenpowersystems.co.in/waste-management-and-biogas/|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been traditionally based on dairy manure as feed stock and these "gobar" gas plants have been in operation for a long period of time, especially in rural India. In the last 2–3 decades, research organisations with a focus on rural energy security have enhanced the design of the systems resulting in newer efficient low cost designs such as the Deenabandhu model.

The Deenabandhu Model is a new biogas-production model popular in India. (''Deenabandhu'' means "friend of the helpless.") The unit usually has a capacity of 2 to 3 cubic metres. It is constructed using bricks or by a [[ferrocement]] mixture. In India, the brick model costs slightly more than the ferrocement model; however, India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy offers some subsidy per model constructed.

Biogas which is mainly methane/natural gas can also be used for generating protein rich cattle, poultry and fish feed in villages economically by cultivating ''[[Methylococcus capsulatus]]'' bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntva.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/04-huslid.pdf |title=BioProtein Production |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112298-food-made-from-natural-gas-will-soon-feed-farm-animals-and-us/ |title=Food made from natural gas will soon feed farm animals – and us |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cargill.com/2016/new-venture-selects-cargill-tennessee-to-produce-feedkind |title=New venture selects Cargill’s Tennessee site to produce Calysta FeedKind® Protein |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can be  put to use in cheaper production of [[algae oil]] or [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] from [[algaculture]] particularly in tropical countries like India which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/01/20150121-algenol.html#more |title=Algenol and Reliance launch algae fuels demonstration project in India |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/ExxonMobil-Announces-Breakthrough-In-Renewable-Energy.html |title=ExxonMobil Announces Breakthrough In Renewable Energy |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union government of India is implementing many schemes to utilise productively the agro waste or biomass in rural areas to uplift rural economy and job potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/indrapratha-gas-mahindra-mahindra-join-hands-to-stop-stubble-burning/62986917|title=Indrapratha Gas, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra join hands to stop stubble burning|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/modi-govt-plans-gobar-dhan-scheme-to-convert-cattle-dung-into-energy/63028408|title=Modi govt plans Gobar-Dhan scheme to convert cattle dung into energy|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these plants, the non edible biomass or waste of edible biomass is converted in to high value products without any water pollution or [[green house gas]] (GHG) emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/672719/calysta-feedkind.pdf |title=Assessment of environmental impact of FeedKind protein |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a key source of cooking fuel in urban India and its prices have been increasing along with the global fuel prices. Also the heavy subsidies provided by the successive governments in promoting LPG as a domestic cooking fuel has become a financial burden renewing the focus on biogas as a cooking fuel alternative in urban establishments. This has led to the development of prefabricated digester for modular deployments as compared to RCC and cement structures which take a longer duration to construct. Renewed focus on process technology like the Biourja process model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpowersystems.co.in/monitoring-methodology/|title=GPS Renewables – Monitoring Methodology – GPS Renewables|work=GPS Renewables|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has enhanced the stature of medium and large scale anaerobic digester in India as a potential alternative to LPG as primary cooking fuel.

In India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of [[manure]] in small-scale digestion facilities is called [[Biogas#Gobar gas|gobar gas]]; it is estimated that such facilities exist in over 2 million households in India, 50,000 in Bangladesh and thousands in Pakistan, particularly North Punjab, due to the thriving population of livestock. The digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a pipe connection. The manure is directed to the pit, usually straight from the cattle shed. The pit is filled with a required quantity of [[wastewater]]. The gas pipe is connected to the kitchen fireplace through control valves. The combustion of this biogas has very little odour or smoke. Owing to simplicity in implementation and use of cheap raw materials in villages, it is one of the most environmentally sound energy sources for rural needs. One type of these system is the Sintex Digester. Some designs use [[vermiculture]] to further enhance the slurry produced by the biogas plant for use as compost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/skgsangha|title=Biogas plants provide cooking and fertiliser|work=Ashden Awards, sustainable and renewable energy in the UK and developing world|accessdate=15 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927224851/http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/skgsangha|archive-date=27 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pakistan, the Rural Support Programmes Network is running the Pakistan Domestic Biogas Programme&lt;ref name="pakenergysolution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakenergysolution.com/|title=PAK-ENERGY SOLUTION|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has installed 5,360 biogas plants&lt;ref name="PakBioGasPlants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brecorder.com/pakistan/industries-a-sectors/213512-5360-bio-gas-plants-installed-in-12-districts.html|title=5,360 bio-gas plants installed in 12 districts|work=Business Recorder|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has trained in excess of 200 masons on the technology and aims to develop the Biogas Sector in Pakistan.

In Nepal, the government provides subsidies to build biogas plant at home.

===China===
The Chinese have experimented with the applications of biogas since 1958. Around 1970, China had installed 6,000,000 digesters in an effort to make [[agriculture]] more efficient. During the last years the technology has met high growth rates. This seems to be the earliest developments in generating biogas from agricultural waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/china-biogas.html Biogas in China.  Retrieved 27 October 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In developing nations===
Domestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry, the fermented manure. This technology is feasible for small-holders with livestock producing 50&amp;nbsp;kg manure per day, an equivalent of about 6 pigs or 3 cows. This manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant. Toilets can be connected. Another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process. With an optimum at 36 C° the technology especially applies for those living in a (sub) tropical climate. This makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable.&lt;ref name="Roubík"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roubík|first=Hynek|last2=Mazancová|first2=Jana|last3=Banout|first3=Jan|last4=Verner|first4=Vladimír|date=2016-01-20|title=Addressing problems at small-scale biogas plants: a case study from central Vietnam|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615013426|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=112, Part 4|pages=2784–2792|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on size and location, a typical brick made fixed dome biogas plant can be installed at the yard of a rural household with the investment between US$300 to $500 in Asian countries and up to $1400 in the African context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghimire|first=Prakash C.|date=2013-01-01|title=SNV supported domestic biogas programmes in Asia and Africa|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148112000699|journal=Renewable Energy|series=Selected papers from World Renewable Energy Congress – XI|volume=49|pages=90–94|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A high quality biogas plant needs minimum maintenance costs and can produce gas for at least 15–20 years without major problems and re-investments. For the user, biogas provides clean cooking energy, reduces indoor air pollution, and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection, especially for women and children. The slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity.&lt;ref name="Roubík"/&gt;

Domestic biogas technology is a proven and established technology in many parts of the world, especially Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snvworld.org/en/Documents/20060209%20Article%20on%20Biogas%20Asia%20in%20Renewable%20Energy.pdf|title=SNV World|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries in this region have embarked on large-scale programmes on domestic biogas, such as China&lt;ref name="China Biogas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/china-biogas.html|title=China – Biogas|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India.

== Society and culture ==

In the 1985 Australian film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'' the post-apocalyptic settlement Barter town is powered by a central biogas system based upon a piggery. As well as providing electricity, methane is used to power Barter's vehicles.

"Cow Town", written in the early 1940s, discuss the travails of a city vastly built on cow manure and the hardships brought upon by the resulting methane biogas. Carter McCormick, an engineer from a town outside the city, is sent in to figure out a way to utilize this gas to help power, rather than suffocate, the city.

The Biogas production is providing nowadays new opportunities for skilled employment, drawing on the development of new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00426|title=Generating new employment opportunities [Social Impact]|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR.

[[File:Testudo kleinmanni.jpg|thumb|A [[Negev tortoise]] (''Testudo werneri''), a critically endangered species of [[tortoise]] endemic to the [[Negev Desert]] of Southern [[Israel]].]]
'''Cheloniology''' ({{IPAc-en|k|əl|oʊ|n|iː|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}), less commonly known as '''testudinology''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɛ|s|t|uː|d|ɪ|n|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}), is the scientific study of [[turtles]]. It is a specific branch of [[herpetology]]. The word cheloniology comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chelone'', "turtle" and ''logos'', "knowledge". Testudinology, on the other hand, comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''testudo'', "tortoise" and the Greek ''logos'', meaning "knowledge". An individual who studies turtles is known as a '''cheloniologist''' or a '''testudinologist'''.

==Fields of study==

Cheloniologists study turtles, which are members of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Testudines'' (also called ''Chelonii''{{cn|date=January 2018}}). This includes freshwater turtles, [[sea turtles]], [[tortoises]], and [[terrapins]]. Professionally, members of this order are commonly called '''chelonians''', as opposed to any of the other names previously mentioned. This cuts down on much confusion, as the distinctions between turtles, tortoises, and terrapins are more [[linguistic]] than they are [[biological]]. All are very closely related.

Within cheloniology, scientists study a wide range of topics including chelonian anatomy, behavior, ecology, evolution, disease, conservation, and many others. Cheloniologists may specialize in one or more of these fields, rather than in general cheloniology.

==Background==

Cheloniology is rooted in [[biology]] and [[zoology]], specifically in [[herpetology]]. As degrees in cheloniology itself are unheard of in universities and colleges, cheloniologists commonly have degrees in the above fields, as well as [[biochemistry]], [[paleozoology]], [[marine biology]], and others.

==Discoveries==

Cheloniologists have somewhat recently discovered that chelonians' organs display [[negligible senescence]]. This discovery has prompted researchers to do more investigation into the chelonian [[genome]] and its impacts on longevity.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Phylogeny of extant chelonians==

The following [[phylogeny]] of [[extant taxon|extant]] chelonians is based on the work of Crawford et al. (2015)&lt;ref name="Crawford et al. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crawford, Nicholas G. |display-authors=et al. |year=2015 |title=A phylogenomic analysis of turtles |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=83 |issue= |pages=250–257 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2014.10.021 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790314003819#articles |pmid=25450099}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Guillon et al.

==Conservation of chelonians==

At somewhere between 48 and 54% of all 330 or so chelonian species being threatened, they are at a much higher risk of [[extinction]] than many other [[vertebrates]]. Of the around 250 species of freshwater and terrestrial turtles, 117 species are considered [[Threatened]], 73 are either [[Endangered]] or [[Critically Endangered]] and 1 is Extinct. All 7 species of [[sea turtles]] are endangered, with some considered critically endangered. Of the 58 species belonging to the [[Testudinidae]] [[family (biology)|family]], 33 species are Threatened, 18 are either Endangered or Critically Endangered, 1 is Extinct in the wild and 7 species are Extinct. 71% of all tortoise species are either gone or almost gone. [[Asia|Asian]] species are the most endangered with around 75% being considered threatened,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Hylton |first=H. |title=Keeping U.S. Turtles Out of China |magazine=Time |date=May 8, 2007 |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1618565,00.html |accessdate=1 November 2012 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely followed by the five endemic species from [[Madagascar]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''Child displacement''' is the removal or separation of [[children]] from their parents and immediate [[family]] or settings in which they have initially been [[Child rearing|reared]]. Displaced children includes varying categories of children who experience separation from their families and social settings due to several varied reasons. These populations include children separated from their [[parent]]s, [[refugees]],&lt;ref name= "Alfredson"&gt;Alfredson, Lisa, (2002) 'Child Soldiers, Displacement and Human Security', 4 Disarmament Forum pp. l 7-27&lt;/ref&gt; children sent to [[boarding school]]s,&lt;ref name="EU-Canada"&gt;[http://www.sws.soton.ac.uk/cwab/Session6/ICWs62.htm CWAB - Session 6.2 - Reasons for displacement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320151456/http://www.sws.soton.ac.uk/cwab/Session6/ICWs62.htm |date=2012-03-20 }} European Union – Canada project Child welfare across borders (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internally displaced person|Internally displaced persons or IDP]]s, and [[asylum seekers]].&lt;ref name="Alfredson"/&gt; Thus child displacement refers to a broad range of factors due to which children are removed from their parents and social setting. This include [[persecution]], [[war]], armed conflict and disruption and separation for varied reasons.&lt;ref name="Alfredson"/&gt;

According to [[UNHCR]] (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) as of (2002) there were approximately 22 million displaced children in the world. Several of whom are displaced for a very long time spanning years. Children in worst affected areas in armed conflict or disruption face an average of 6 to 7 years of displacement.&lt;ref name="Alfredson"/&gt;

The internationally accepted and acknowledged definition of a "[[child]]" is anyone who is under the age of 18 regardless of any context.&lt;ref name="Alfredson"/&gt;

==Forms of displacement==
* Internal Displacement – involves relocation of children from areas or geographical locations caught in strife during [[civil war]] or armed conflicts. Currently there are about 13.5 million internally displaced children around the world.&lt;ref name="idmc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004D404D/(httpPages)/6E780F0E0FE6BA1AC1257214003D980E?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529055232/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004D404D/%28httpPages%29/6E780F0E0FE6BA1AC1257214003D980E?OpenDocument |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Planned Displacement – includes relocation of children away from their parents by Government as per policy e.g.: [[Native American boarding schools|American Indian Boarding schools]], removal from non custodial parent because of divorce proceedings, separation due to boarding school,&lt;ref name="EU-Canada"/&gt; relocation of children with [[Kinship|relatives]] ([[kinship]] care) for economic or social reasons, removal of children from family by [[law enforcement]] for judicial reasons. Purposeful displacement includes relocation of children from areas of conflict in order to avoid recruitment into war.&lt;ref name="Alfredson"/&gt;
* Displacement in large scale – involves refugees, asylum seekers, and [[Military use of children|child soldiers]]&lt;ref name="Alfredson"/&gt;

==Psychological effects of separation and disruption in parent–child relationships==
[[Psychologists]] and social-behavioral scientists agree that children thrive better both [[Psychology|psychologically]] and [[Human development (biology)|developmentally]] in two rather than one parent families.&lt;ref name= "Amato"&gt;Amato, P. R. (2000) The consequences of [[divorce]] for adults and children. Journal of Marriage and the Family, 62, 1269-1287&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby (1969) stated that there is a critical period that was sensitive to the development of attachment, during which attachment is easily formed between the child and its parents.&lt;ref name= "Bowlby"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969) Attachment and Loss: Vol I Attachment. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Early research on adoptions gives support to this view,&lt;ref name= "Yarrow"&gt;Yarrow, L. J. &amp; Goodwin, M (1973) The immediate impact of separation: Reactions of infants to a change in mother figures. In L. J. Stone, H. T. Smith, &amp; L. B. Murphy (Eds), The competent infant (pp. 1032-1040). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; though scholars state that the sensitive period is actually quite extensive.&lt;ref name= "Rutter"&gt;Rutter, M (1972) Maternal Deprivation Reassessed. London:Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; This might imply that children need longer period of interaction with their parents than previously thought.

===Effects on attachment development===

The development of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] occurs as a result of the process of reciprocal interaction between parent and the child. This reciprocal interaction helps the child to discriminate its parents from others and helps develop emotional relationships with its parents.&lt;ref name= "Lamb"&gt;Lamb, M (2003) "Child development and the Law" in Handbook of Psychology, Vol 6 p559-577.&lt;/ref&gt; Infant-parent attachment helps to develop psychological security, self-confidence and enables the development of trust in other Humans.&lt;ref name= "Ainsworth"&gt;Ainsworth, M.D.S., Blehar, M., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S (1978) Patterns of attachment. Hillsdale, New Jersey:Relbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lamb2"&gt;Lamb, M.E. (1981) The development of social expectations in the first year of life. In M. E. Lamb &amp; L. R. Sherrod (Eds.), Infant social cognition: Empirical and theoretical considerations (pp. 155-175). Hillsdale, N.J: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of time spend together is not the only factor that influences the development of attachments. Some threshold level of interaction is also needed for attachment to develop. Opportunities for regular interaction is important for the development of attachment.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; Children in both single-parent and two-parent families seem to be better adjusted when they enjoy warm and affirmative interactions with two parents who are actively involved.&lt;ref name= "Gilbreth"&gt;Amato, P.R. &amp; Gilbreth (1999). Nonresident fathers and children's well-being: A meta-analysis.  Journal of marriage and the Family, 61: 557-573.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical literature shows that children need regular interaction with attachment figures in order to maintain relationships.&lt;ref name= "Lamb3"&gt;Lamb, M. E. (2002a). Infant-father attachments and their impact on child development. In C. S. Tamis-LeMonda &amp; N. Cabrera (Eds.), Handbook of father involvement: Multidisciplinary perspectives (pp. 93–117). Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Extended separation of the child from either of the parent is detrimental as it hinders the development of attachment and relationship between the child and the parent.&lt;ref name= "Bowlby2"&gt;Bowlby J (1973). Separation: Anxiety &amp; Anger. Attachment and Loss (vol. 2); (International psycho-analytical library no.95). London: Hogarth Press. {{ISBN|0-7126-6621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this reason that it becomes extremely difficult to re-establish relationship between child and parents once it is disrupted.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; For this reason it is best to avoid such disruptions.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; A child's relationship with its parents has significant influence on the nature of social, psychological and emotional development of the child.&lt;ref name= "Lamb4"&gt;Lamb, M. E., Hwang, C. P., Ketterlinus, R. D., &amp; Fracasso, M. P. (1999). Parent-child relationships: Development in the context of the family. In M. H. Bornstein &amp; M. E. Lamb (Eds.), Developmental psychology: An advanced textbook (4th ed., pp. 411-450). Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research also shows that disruption in relationship between child and its parents has adverse effects on a child's development.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; Those children who are hindered from having stable and regular interaction and meaningful relationship with either of the parent are at a higher potential of psychological risk.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; Thus children are more likely and able to attain their psychological potential when they are able to have healthy and regular relationship with both their parents.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt;

The ideal situation of relationship between children and parents is one in which there is everyday interaction between the child and its parents.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; This includes interaction in various family and social contexts like play, basic care, limit setting, putting to bed etc. Everyday activities promotes and maintains the development of trust and helps to strengthen and deepen parent–child relationships.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt;

===Divorce and separation form non-custodial parent===

In terms of divorce and separation adverse effects have been noted due to severed father-child relationship.&lt;ref name= "Lamb5"&gt;Lamb, M. E. (2002b). Noncustodial fathers and their children. In C. S. TamisLeMonda &amp; N. Cabrera (Eds.), Handbook of father involvement: Multidisciplinary perspectives (pp. 169–184). Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in terms of separation due to divorce it is important to maintain regular interaction between child and both parents. It is therefore unfortunate that in contemporary practice relationship is not fostered between the child and the non custodial parent in divorce proceedings.&lt;ref name= "Maccoby"&gt;Maccoby, E. E., and R. H. Mnookin. 1992. Dividing the Child: Social and Legal Dilemmas of Custody. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Peters"&gt;Peters H. E. (1997) Child custody and monetary transfers in divorce negotiations: Reduced form and simulation results. Unpublished manuscript, Department of Economics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  So when it is beneficial, children face potential risk due to removal from or disappearance of their non custodial fathers.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; This risk is added on with the other baggage of problems that occurs due to divorce including financial burden and less social support.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; For Children separation from parents is stressful and painful.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt;

===Long-term impact of separation of child from its parents===

The [[NICHD]] study of Early child care was designed to assess the long-term outcomes of non parental care giving.  [[Non Parental care]] giving involved both relatives (kinship care) and non relatives ([[Day care]]). The NICHD study was based on the ecological theory of [[Uri Bronfenbrenner]] (1979).&lt;ref name= "Bronfenbrenner"&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). The ecology of human development. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the effects of family and child care revealed that the characteristics of the family and the nature and quality of the mothers relationship with the child was a significantly better predictor of children's outcome.&lt;ref name= "Fitzgerald"&gt;Fitzgerald, H., Mann, T., Cabrera, N., &amp; Wong, M. (2003). Diversity in caregiving contexts. In R. Lerner, A. Easterbrooks, &amp; J. Mistry (Eds.), Handbook of psychology, Vol 6: Developmental psychology (pp. 135-167). Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;
Prolonged separations from parents have profound disruptive influence on children's development. Such prolonged separations include separations due to death, institutionalization which entails sending a child to live in an institution or setting without parents, divorce and desertion of the child by parent and hospitalization or prolonged absence due to illness.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;  Prolonged exposure to poor institutional care could lead to despair, apathy and deficit in social responsiveness.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt; According to Rutter (1979).&lt;ref name= "Rutter2"&gt;Rutter, M (1979) [[Maternal Deprivation]], 1972-1978: New Findings, new concepts, new approaches, Child Development, 50, 283-305&lt;/ref&gt; it is the failure to develop [[secure attachment]] with parents that leads to problems in social responsiveness.&lt;ref name= "Rutter2"/&gt; [[Institutionalization]] is extreme form of separation of the child from its parents.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

====Emotional abuse====
Considerable negative impact occurs to a child due to neglect.&lt;ref name= "Deegener"&gt;Deegener, Günther (2002) ‘Child Abuse', in International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioural Sciences (eds) Smelser, N.J.; &amp; Baltes, P.B. Oxford, England : Elsevier, Vol. 3 pp 1672- 1676&lt;/ref&gt; Outright rejection, intimidation, or isolation of the child are forms of emotional [[child abuse]].&lt;ref name="Deegener"/&gt;

====Sleeper effect====
With the view that children develop through [[adolescence]] by building on prior periods and that some effects of early experiences during child rearing might manifest later on in what is called as "Sleeper effect". It may be seen that effects of [[child rearing]] may be seen even later.&lt;ref name= "Vandell"&gt;Vandell, D. L., Belsky, J., Burchinal, M., Steinberg, L., Vandergrift, N., &amp; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network. (2010). Do effects of early child care extend to age 15 years? Child Development, 81, 737–756.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stained glass conservation''' refers to the protection and preservation of historic [[stained glass]] for present and future generations.  It involves any and all actions devoted to the prevention, mitigation, or reversal of the processes of deterioration that affect such glass works and subsequently inhibit individuals' ability to access and appreciate them, as part of the world's collective cultural heritage.  It functions as a part of the larger practices of cultural heritage conservation ([[conservation-restoration]]) and [[architectural conservation]].

Stained glass is lauded as one of the most beautiful and compelling forms of architectural decoration; however, it is also one of the most vulnerable (Brown et al. 2002, xi).  The fabric of the glass itself, the paint or stain used to decorate it, and even the metal framework used to hold the design together are all at risk for deterioration, and will likely require conservation work to ensure their long-term survival. Historic [[glazing (window)|glazing]] is subject to damage caused by continued exposure to [[pollution]] and the elements, on top of that resulting from inherent problems, such as the innate fragility of glass and any potential chemical instability of the materials involved (Brown et al. 2002, xi; Rauch 2004).  Deterioration does not always occur gradually and may also occur suddenly and catastrophically, as the result of [[natural disasters]] (e.g. fire, extreme weather), accidents (e.g. improper handling, removal or treatment), or malicious damage (e.g. vandalism) (Brown et al. 2002, xi; Vogel et al. 2007).

Owing to the delicate nature of the materials, and the incalculable historic and aesthetic value of stained glass work, any and all treatments should be planned and performed by professional conservators and craftspeople, who have been specially trained in the peculiarities of the medium.  While preservation is the shared responsibility of all involved, including visitors, caretakers, and other stakeholders, it is imperative that professionals are consulted to ensure the continued integrity of the physical materials and their associated significance.  For this reason, all projects should begin with a conservation plan that incorporates research in such topics as the history of the windows or building, the materials involved, and past alterations, as a key element of all conservation decisions.  The type of conservation treatment employed should reflect this research, as well as the needs of the building as a whole, and should ''always'' be documented for reference in the future (CVMA 2004).

For information on the creation, construction, and history of stained glass windows see [[Stained glass]].

==Deterioration of stained glass==

The primary aim of conservation is to slow the rate of deterioration, caused by various factors, to the point where the loss of significance, such as historic information and/or aesthetic value can be kept to a minimum (Pye 2001, Ch. 5).  However, in the case of stained glass, these efforts are complicated by the nature of the medium itself.  This is because a stained glass window, is a 'complex object' in that it is made from more than one component material, each with its own inherent risks and conservation needs (Pye 2001, 80).  In addition to the most obvious component, glass, all windows will typically involve some sort paint or stain as decoration, metal strips, or 'cames' used to join the pieces of glass together, waterproofing materials, and fixing systems or frameworks used for additional support (Brown et al. 2002; Vogel et al. 2007). The condition of each component is important for the overall preservation of the window, as deterioration within one material can affect the others with varying degrees of severity.

===Causes===

The vast majority of stained glass was originally created to function as part of the building envelope, separating the interior of the structure from exterior environmental conditions.  As a result, most historic glazing that has been left in situ is subjected to a constant onslaught of harmful conditions including (but not limited to): UV light from sunlight, extreme weather conditions, indoor and outdoor man-made pollution, and biological damage caused by pests such as pigeons, bats, and various micro-organisms (Rauch 2004, 3).  As a result, panels often become encrusted with thick layers of dirt that eventually become quite firmly affixed, and can even begin to intermingle with the underlying, corroded layers of paint (Rauch 2004, 3).  Environmental influences also play a role in the continuing deterioration of metal cames and frameworks, which can cause significant structural damage. In addition to these environmental stressors, further deterioration can also result from the myriad of other factors that influence the materials out of which the window is constructed, such as vibration from building use and the remains of previous treatments and repairs that have since deteriorated and increased the corrosion processes of other materials (Rauch 2004, 3).

===Deterioration of the glass===
[[File:Glass trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 2 – Faded faces on a panel form Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK.]]
Although glass as a material is known for its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass.  Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or pocking of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3).  This opacification occurs as water seeps through the subsequent cracks, causing the formation of opaque syngenite and gypsum crystals that block light from filtering through the previously translucent glass (Rauch 2004, 3).  As these crystals continue to grow, they pose an even greater danger to the glass, eventually breaking through the surface and dislodging the delicate paint layer, or even causing cracks (Rauch 2004, 4).  Glass plates can also darken or cloud as the result of the oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).

===Breakdown of paints, enamels, stains===

As previously mentioned, the paint/stain layer may suffer as the result of deterioration within the fabric of the glass itself; however, this fragile layer is at risk for other types of damage as well.  Painted surfaces that would have been applied to glass cold and fired on, are especially vulnerable to damage from condensation or weathering, if they were fired improperly during the production process (Vogel 2007, 7).  This is often the case with the fading or disappearance of fine detail, such as faces, in figural stained glass art (fig. 2). Over time, enamels can begin to flake off of glass panels, and certain types or colours of stains can discolour with continued UV exposure, all of which significantly alters the aesthetic impact of the work as a whole (Brown et al. 2002, 18–19; Vogel et al. 2007, 7).

===Structural deformation and deterioration===
[[File:Clerestory trinity church.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 3 – The leaded clerestory windows of Holy Trinity Church have been weakened by time and the elements.]]
The breakdown of the skeletal structure that holds the glass in place, such as damage to tracery and the corrosion of metal cames and fixing systems, often poses the greatest, imminent risk to stained glass work (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  Although stone elements are not prone to excessive change due to environmental conditions, this is not the case with metals, which are much more likely to deteriorate from prolonged exposure to the elements.  For example, the cames that make up the matrix of a stained glass window, for which lead and zinc were most commonly used, undergo quite a bit of thermal expansion and contraction, eventually resulting in metal fatigue, which in turn weakens the joints between the plates, causing whole panels to deform or simply fall apart (Vogel et al. 2007, 8).  Additionally, metal matrixes and frames may weaken with stress, such as that which has occurred at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK, where years of wind buffeting the leaded clerestory windows has endangered the structural integrity of not only the glazing, but also, the upper portion of building itself (fig. 3) (Friends of Shakespeare's Church 2009).

==Creating a conservation plan==

In many ways, proper conservation is as much about research and documentation as it is about 'hands-on' conservation treatments and restoration (Sloan 1993, 27).  The conservator must be familiar with not only the general materials with which he or she is working, but also the details specific to the project at hand, in order to understand and address the needs of a particular window or building.  Using this knowledge, conservators can develop a conservation plan that can be used throughout the project, to ensure that all decisions are made with the aims of the project and the needs of the object in mind (CVMA 2004).

===Basic conservation philosophy===

In J. Sloan's discussion of stained glass conservation in the United States, the author gives the following list of ethical and philosophical criteria to be applied to the conservation of stained glass (Sloan 1993, 13):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# All materials and procedures should be reversible without affecting the piece ... .
# All intervention must be the least required to achieve the desired end.
# Original materials should be retained so far as is possible.
# All conditions, procedures, materials and processes must be recorded.
# The hand or style of the conservator should not be visible to the casual observer on the object.  However, all restoration should be discernable to future conservators.
# The conservator is ethically bound to provide the highest quality restoration within his [or her] power without regard for his [or her] personal opinion of the value ... of the object.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While this list is not exhaustive, it does illustrate the basic foundations upon which responsible conservation decisions should be made.  Of utmost importance in this list are the fundamental ideas of minimal intervention and reversibility of treatment, both of which are necessary to ensure that the overall integrity of the windows, as historic and artistically valuable objects, is not compromised.

===Research===

Owing to the incredible amount of chemical and methodological variability to be found when dealing with stained glass, research into the general production habits of pertinent regions or eras may provide clues that can help conservators understand the overall significance of the piece, anticipate what to expect from the materials, and determine how to proceed (Sloan 1993, 28; Vogel 2007, 5).  For example, a conservator working on a set of windows in the United States, will want to ascertain whether the glass was produced before, during, or after the mid-19th century, as changes to general glass composition were made during this time that could influence the types of impurities—and subsequently, some of the deterioration—to be expected (Vogel et al. 2007, 7).  This research phase should also include a full condition report on the current condition of the stained glass that includes a record of any and all evidence of past intervention or repair (CVMA 2004).

===Decision making and implementation===

Decisions should be made using the information gathered during research, and implemented by experienced conservators.  Caretakers and project managers should be responsible for screening conservators/studios effectively, while the conservators themselves are responsible for advocating on behalf of the stained glass during any negotiations.  As much as possible, benefit to the historic glazing should come before all other considerations (Vogel et al. 2007, 1).  At all stages, steps should be taken to ensure that the actions taken are in keeping with the aims of the conservation plan.

===Documentation===

Proper documentation plays an extremely important role throughout this entire process and should be considered obligatory.  All aspects of this process including preliminary research, condition surveys, conservation plans, and all the methods and materials used throughout treatment should be duly recorded, and the documents be preserved and made accessible in the long-term for future reference (CVMA 2004).

==Types of treatments==

In general it is best to keep interventive treatments at a minimum: minor signs of age are an integral part of the character of the structure and its history (Pye 2001, 96; Vogel et al. 2007, 9).  However, more serious damage that either detracts from the aesthetic or practical functions of the glass, or indicates active deterioration may require more extensive treatment.

===Cleaning===

Careful cleaning of stained glass can be a very effective means of improving its overall condition, because its appearance and function are so heavily dependent on its ability to transmit light.  Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of corroded glass, nearly all cleaning treatments can cause changes in the surface of the glass that can expedite corrosion rates, or damage delicate paint layers (Romich et al. 2000).  Thus, cleaning efforts should not necessarily be concerned with the complete removal of all encrustrations, but rather the careful thinning of these layers to a point where light can be transmitted through the glass at an acceptable level (Rauch 2004, 5).  The simplest cleaning can be performed using carefully applied deionised water, although other mechanical or chemical means are often necessary, and must always be done slowly, in a controlled and focused manner (Rauch 2004, 5–6; Vogel et al. 2007, 9–10).  Scalpels or a micro-jet process* can be used to gradually, mechanically thin out these encrustations layer by layer, in the lab.  Conversely, poultices or gel pads steeped in a non-ionic detergent or EDTA can be applied to the surface of the glass for long periods of time for “deep, focused cleaning” (Rauch 2004, 6).  With any of these methods, care must be taken to ensure the stability of painted layers, before treatment can take place.  In the event that these layers appear particularly friable, it is necessary to clean the glass delicately with cotton swabs, and in more extreme cases, manually affix the original paint lines to the surface, under a microscope, by applying small tiny drops of resin at specific points (Rauch 2004, 6; Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  Care should be taken not to remove any later over-painting without due consideration, as such layers may have historic value, in their own right (Rauch 2004, 7).

===Repairs and replacements===

Within conservation, repairs are meant to last, but should also be as reversible as possible, in keeping with the general ethical guidelines of modern conservation practice (Sloane 1993, 13).  In the context of stained glass, repairs can involve treatment of the glass itself, treatment of missing areas, or structural consolidation of the matrix or surrounding architectural fabric.

Broken glass is typically repaired in one of three ways: copper foiling (thin copper tape that is applied to both sides of the break and then soldered); epoxy edge-gluing; and silicone edge-gluing.  Each of these has its own inherent benefits and problems.  For instance, copper foiling produces a strong, reversible, attractive repair, but is unsuitable for use with unstable glass because of the heat involved in the application process.  Epoxy edge-gluing on the other hand is strong and nearly invisible, but deteriorates in direct sunlight, while silicone edge-gluing dries clear and is easily reversible, but unfortunately refracts light differently from glass, making such repairs more readily apparent (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).

Missing areas can be filled or replaced but should be done so with caution.  All additions must be marked as such, and documented.  Ultimately, “it is nearly always better to use an imperfect original piece of glass than to replace it” (Vogel et al. 2007, 12).  Modern replacement of glass with “exact” replicas is virtually impossible, and goes against conservation philosophy by potentially clouding viewers' perception of the original.  Instead it is preferable to use similarly coloured, but clearly differentiated glass in order to preserve the aesthetic effect of the stained glass without sacrificing the integrity of the original (Rauch 2004, 7; Vogel et al. 2007, 11).

Structurally speaking it is most important to keep the frame intact and in good condition, to ensure the overall safety of the window (Vogel et al. 2007, 10).  That being said, the original materials that make up this matrix are also integral aspects of the historic value and artistic design of the panel and should be preserved.  Steps should always be taken to ensure that panels retain their current matrix whenever possible, rather than opting for replacement (CVMA 2004).

===Protective glazing===

[[File:Protective grill.JPG|thumb|200px|Figure 5 – A protective grill on the gothic-style windows of a chapel in London, UK.]]
Protective glazing is one of the few ways conservators can attempt to preventively conserve stained glass in situ.  While this practice can offer many benefits, as with most other treatments, it is not without drawbacks.  Ideally, the installation of protective glazing can “relieve the stained glass of its function as a weather shield […], protect it against mechanical and atmospheric damage, and […] prevent condensation on the surface of the stained glass,” thus minimising the need for interventive conservation (CVMA 2004). Unfortunately, in practice this is not always the case, and it is well known that unsuitable, or improperly ventilated protective glazing can actually create an overly hot or humid microclimate around the historic glass that increases the rate of deterioration (Vogel et al. 2007, 13).  Alternatively, protective screens or grills can be installed on the exterior of windows to prevent mechanical damage like vandalism, however this can have a significant, negative impact on the aesthetic value of the windows from both the exterior and interior (figs. 4–5).

==Other options and considerations==
[[File:Conservation yorkminster.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Figure 6 – A view of the conservation-related scaffolding around the east end of York Minster, York, UK.]]
In some cases, a project may be so extensive that it requires the complete removal of a panel, or set of panels from public view, which in turn raises other considerations concerning public access.  An excellent example of such a case is the current, on-going project to conserve York Minster funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), which raises the question: how do conservators accommodate the needs of the living, functioning Minster, without compromising conservation goals (fig. 6) (Rosewell 2008a)?  [[File:Windowreplica yorkminster.JPG|thumb|150px|Figure 7 – A digitally produced replica of the Great East Window of York Minster.]] For instance, upon the removal of the Great East Window from public view (for up to ten years), a solution was needed to combat the sudden gloom of the Minster's interior.  Ultimately, a remarkable life-sized, digital replica was produced to brighten the “visual 'black hole' that remains” while conservation work is taking place, thus facilitating the aims of conservators by minimising the detrimental effects of losing the visual impact window on the interior (fig. 7) (Rosewell 2008b).  This is not the first time that York Minster has employed a variety of methods to maintain and increase public access while also facilitating the conservation of its stained glass legacy.  Currently, conserved sections of panels that have been permanently removed from their original context due to conservation concerns can be viewed on display near the choir (fig. 8).  Although it is rare that a perfect solution to these concerns can be found, it is a necessary part of conservation planning to take public interest and access into consideration.

'''Dead zones''' are [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] (low-[[oxygen]]) areas in the world's [[ocean]]s and [[List of lakes by area|large lakes]], caused by "excessive nutrient pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life in bottom and near-bottom water. (NOAA)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, many of these sites were naturally occurring.  However, in the 1970s, [[oceanographer]]s began noting increased instances and expanses of dead zones. These occur near inhabited [[coastline]]s, where [[aquatic life]] is most concentrated. (The vast middle portions of the oceans, which naturally have little life, are not considered "dead zones".)
[[File:Non Dead Zone vs Dead Zone.svg|thumb|Dead zones are bodies of water that do not have sufficient oxygen (3) levels in order to support most marine life. Dead zones are caused by oxygen-depleting factors which include, but are not limited to, human pollution (4). This is a process called eutrophication, where oxygen levels decrease as elements such nitrogen and phosphorus increase. A healthy river will have increased amounts of oxygen for consumption by organisms (1). As nitrogen increases, algae (5) produce large amounts of oxygen, but die from increased nitrogen. Decomposers then use all of the remaining oxygen decomposing the algae, resulting in no oxygen left and no oxygen being produced (2).]]

In March 2004, when the recently established [[UN Environment Programme]] published its first [[UN Environment Programme|Global Environment Outlook Year Book]] (''GEO Year Book 2003''), it reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans where [[marine life]] could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometre (0.4&amp;nbsp;mi²), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometres (27,000&amp;nbsp;mi²). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diaz" /&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|260px|right|'''Dead zones''' are often caused by the [[Decomposition|decay]] of [[algae]] during [[algal bloom]]s, like this one off the coast of [[La Jolla, San Diego, California]].]]
[[File:The affect of climate on ecological dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Climate has a significant impact on the growth and decline of ecological dead zones. During spring months, as rainfall increases, more nutrient-rich water flows down the mouth of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, as sunlight increases during the spring, algal growth in the dead zones increases dramatically. In fall months, tropical storms begin to enter the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and break up the dead zones, and the cycle repeats again in the spring.]]

Aquatic and marine dead zones can be caused by an increase in nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) in the water, known as [[eutrophication]]. These chemicals are the fundamental building blocks of single-celled, plant-like organisms that live in the water column, and whose growth is limited in part by the availability of these materials. Eutrophication can lead to rapid increases in the density of certain types of these [[phytoplankton]], a phenomenon known as an [[algal bloom]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Limnologist]] Dr. [[David Schindler]], whose research at the [[Experimental Lakes Area]] led to the banning of harmful phosphates in detergents, warned about algal blooms and dead zones, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s haven't gone away; they've moved west into an arid world in which people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of what little freshwater there is to be had here....This isn't just a prairie problem. Global expansion of dead zones caused by algal blooms is rising rapidly."&lt;ref&gt;

The major groups of algae are [[Cyanobacteria]], [[green algae]], [[Dinoflagellates]], [[Coccolithophore]]s and [[Diatom#Algae_and_plants|Diatom algae]]. Increase in input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom. Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]. Other algae are consumed and hence do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cees.iupui.edu/Research/Water_Resources/CIWRP/Algae_Information/Presentations/2010-06-17-Symposium/2010-06-17_Lehman-Whole_Lake_Experiments.pdf  "Whole Lake Experiment, Ford Lake, Prof Lehman"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, www.cees.iupui.edu, 2010-06-17&lt;/ref&gt; Dead zones can be caused by natural and by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Use of chemical [[fertilizer]]s is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22301669 Corn boom could expand 'dead zone' in Gulf] msnbc.msn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region,&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years.

Additionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column. For example, enclosed bodies of water, such as [[fjords]] or the [[Black Sea]], have shallow sills at their entrances, causing water to be stagnant there for a long time.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean have lowered oxygen concentrations which are thought to be in regions where there is minimal circulation to replace the oxygen that is consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Pickard, G.L. and Emery, W.J. 1982. Description Physical Oceanography: An Introduction. Pergamon Press, Oxford, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; These areas are also known as oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). In many cases, OMZs are permanent or semipermanent areas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Remains of organisms found within [[sediment]] layers near the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] indicate four hypoxic events before the advent of synthetic fertilizer. In these sediment layers, [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]]-tolerant species are the most prevalent remains found. The periods indicated by the sediment record correspond to historic records of high river flow recorded by instruments at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Changes in ocean circulation triggered by ongoing [[climate change]] could also add or magnify other causes of oxygen reductions in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Mora2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mora |first1=C. |title=Biotic and Human Vulnerability to Projected Changes in Ocean Biogeochemistry over the 21st Century |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=11 |pages=e1001682 |year=2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001682|display-authors=etal |pmid=24143135 |pmc=3797030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, a report suggested that the US [[meat industry]] and agroeconomic system are predominantly responsible for the largest-ever dead zone in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/01/meat-industry-dead-zone-gulf-of-mexico-environment-pollution|title=Meat industry blamed for largest-ever 'dead zone' in Gulf of Mexico|last=Milman|first=Oliver|date=2017-08-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Soil [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and leached [[nitrate]], exacerbated by agricultural land management and tillage practices as well as manure and synthetic [[fertilizer]] usage, contaminated water from the Heartland to the Gulf of Mexico.

==Effects==

Low oxygen levels recorded along the [[Gulf Coast]] of [[North America]] have led to reproductive problems in fish involving decreased size of reproductive organs, low egg counts and lack of spawning.

In a study of the Gulf [[killifish]] by the [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] done in three bays along the Gulf Coast, fish living in bays where the oxygen levels in the water dropped to 1 to 2 parts per million (ppm) for three or more hours per day were found to have smaller [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]]. The male gonads were 34% to 50% as large as males of similar size in bays where the oxygen levels were normal (6 to 8 ppm). Females were found to have ovaries that were half as large as those in normal oxygen levels. The number of eggs in females living in hypoxic waters were only one-seventh the number of eggs in fish living in normal oxygen levels.&lt;ref&gt;Landry, C.A., S. Manning, and A.O. Cheek. 2004. Hypoxia suppresses reproduction in Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis. e.hormone 2004 conference. Oct. 27–30. New Orleans.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish raised in laboratory-created hypoxic conditions showed extremely low [[hormone|sex hormone]] concentrations and increased elevation of activity in two [[gene]]s triggered by the hypoxia-inductile factor (HIF) [[protein]]. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF pairs with another protein, ARNT. The two then bind to DNA in cells, activating genes in those plant cells.

Under normal oxygen conditions, ARNT combines with estrogen to activate genes. Hypoxic cells ''in vitro'' did not react to estrogen placed in the tube. HIF appears to render ARNT unavailable to interact with estrogen, providing a mechanism by which hypoxic conditions alter reproduction in fish.&lt;ref&gt;Johanning, K., et al. 2004. Assessment of molecular interaction between low oxygen and estrogen in fish cell culture. Fourth SETAC World Congress, 25th Annual Meeting in North America. Nov. 14–18. Portland, Ore.&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be expected that fish would flee the potential suffocation, but they are often quickly rendered unconscious and doomed.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Slow moving bottom-dwelling creatures like clams, lobsters and oysters are unable to escape. All colonial animals are extinguished. The normal re-mineralization and recycling that occurs among [[benthos|benthic]] life-forms is stifled.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Despite most other life forms being killed by the lack of oxygen, [[jellyfish]] can thrive and are sometimes present in dead zones in vast numbers. These jellyfish blooms produce mucus and waste, leading to major changes in [[food web]]s in the ocean. The organic carbon is metabolised by bacteria which return it to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide in what has been termed a "jelly carbon shunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yong |first1=Ed |title=Jellyfish shift ocean food webs by feeding bacteria with mucus and excrement |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/06/06/jellyfish-shift-ocean-food-webs-by-feeding-bacteria-with-mucus-and-excrement/ |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that future changes in oxygen could affect most marine ecosystems and have socio-economic ramifications due to human dependency on marine goods and services.&lt;ref name=Mora2013/&gt;

In the 1970s, marine dead zones were first noted in settled areas where intensive economic use stimulated scientific scrutiny: in the U.S. East Coast's [[Chesapeake Bay]], in Scandinavia's [[strait]] called the [[Kattegat]], which is the mouth of the [[Baltic Sea]] and in other important Baltic Sea fishing grounds, in the [[Black Sea]], and in the northern [[Adriatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Marine Biology |author=Karleskint; Turner; and Small |publisher=Brooks/Cole |page=4|date=2013 |edition=4|isbn=978-1133364467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of [[South America]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[New Zealand]]. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news|author=David Perlman, Chronicle Science Editor |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/15/MNLD12ADSN.DTL |title=Scientists alarmed by ocean dead-zone growth |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diaz"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spreading Dead Zones and Consequences for Marine Ecosystems |doi=10.1126/science.1156401 |date=2008-08-15|last1=Diaz|first1=R.

===Baltic Sea===
{{main|Baltic Sea hypoxia}}

Researchers from Baltic Nest Institute published in one of [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] issues reports that the dead zones in the Baltic Sea have grown from approximately 5,000 km2 to more than 60,000 km2 in recent years.

Some of the causes behind the elevated increase of dead zones can be attributed to the use of fertilizers, large animal farms, the burning of fossil fuels, and effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balticnest.org/balticnest/activities/news/news/deadzoneshaveincreasedbymorethan10foldinthelastcentury.5.3186f824143d05551ad52e7.html|title=Dead zones have increased by more than 10-fold in the last century - Baltic Nest Institute|date=2014-04-01|website=www.balticnest.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth River, Virginia===
The [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] estuary is important for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia]], [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] and [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. It has been polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus, but also toxic deposits from the shipbuilding industry, the military, the world's largest coal export facility, refineries, loading docks, container-repair facilities and others, so fish had been "offlimits since the 1920s". In 1993, a group formed to clean it up, adopting the [[mummichog]] as a mascot, and has removed thousands of tons of contaminated sediment. In 2006, a 35-acre biological dead zone called Money Point was dredged out, and this let fish return, and the wetland recover&lt;ref&gt;Rona Kobell [http://www.bayjournal.com/article/elizabeth_river_rises_from_the_depths Elizabeth River rises from the depths. Dedicated group is slowly bringing one of nation's most polluted rivers back to life.] Bay Journal, July 01, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lake Erie===

A dead zone exists in the central part of [[Lake Erie]] from east of [[Point Pelee]] to [[Long Point, Ontario|Long Point]] and stretches to shores in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=05-P13-00040&amp;segmentID=8|title= Dead Zones}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zone has been noticed since the 1950s to 1960s, but efforts since the 1970s have been made by Canada and the US to reduce runoff pollution into the lake as means to reverse the dead zone growth. Overall the lake's oxygen level is poor with only a small area to the east of Long Point that has better levels. The biggest impact of the poor oxygen levels is to lacustrine life and fisheries industry.

===Lower St. Lawrence Estuary===

A dead zone exists in the Lower [[St. Lawrence River]] area from east the [[Saguenay River]] to east of [[Baie Comeau]], greatest at depths over {{convert|275|m|ft}} and noticed since the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/Publications/article/2005/01-12-2005-eng.htm |title=Will "Dead Zones" Spread in the St. Lawrence River? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626205148/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/Publications/article/2005/01-12-2005-eng.htm |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concerns for Canadian scientists is the impact of fish found in the area.

===Oregon===
Off the coast of [[Cape Perpetua]], Oregon, there is also a dead zone with a 2006 reported size of 300 square miles (780&amp;nbsp;km²).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This dead zone only exists during the summer, perhaps due to wind patterns. The Oregon coast has also seen hypoxic water transporting itself from the continental shelf to the coastal embayments. This has seemed to cause intensity in several areas of Oregon's climate such as upwelled water containing oxygen concentration and upwelled winds.&lt;ref&gt;Griffis, R. and Howard, J. [Eds.]. 2013.

====Size ====
The area of hypoxic bottom water that occurs for several weeks each summer in the Gulf of Mexico has been mapped most years from 1985 through 2017. The size varies annually from a record high in 2017 when it encompassed more than 22,730 sq kilometers (8,776 square miles) to a record low in 1988 of 39 sq kilometers (15 square miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Nancy Rabalais]] of the [[Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium]] in [[Cocodrie, Louisiana]] predicted the dead zone or [[hypoxic zone]] in 2012 will cover an area of 17,353 sq kilometers (6,700 square miles) which is larger than Connecticut; however, when the measurements were completed, the area of hypoxic bottom water in 2012 only totaled 7,480 sq kilometers. The models using the nitrogen flux from the Mississippi River to predict the "dead zone" areas have been criticized for being systematically high from 2006 to 2014, having predicted record areas in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2013 that were never realized.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney et al.  Predictions Wrong Again on Dead Zone Area – Gulf of Mexico Gaining Resistance to Nutrient Loading.  https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1307/1307.8064.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In late summer 1988 the dead zone disappeared as the great drought caused the flow of Mississippi to fall to its lowest level since 1933. During times of heavy flooding in the Mississippi River Basin, as in 1993, ""the "dead zone"
dramatically increased in size, approximately {{convert|5000|km|0|abbr=on}} larger than the previous year".&lt;ref&gt;

====Economic impact====
Some assert that the dead zone threatens lucrative commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. "In 2009, the dockside value of commercial fisheries in the Gulf was $629 million. Nearly three million recreational fishers further contributed about $10 billion to the Gulf economy, taking 22 million fishing trips."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article_pf.asp?ID=3252 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411221020/http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article_pf.asp?ID=3252 |archivedate=2016-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}} Scientists are not in universal agreement that nutrient loading has a negative impact on fisheries.

====History====

Shrimp trawlers first reported a 'dead zone' in the Gulf of Mexico in 1950, but it was not until 1970 when the size of the hypoxic zone had increased that scientists began to investigate.&lt;ref name="The Gulf of Mexico's Hypoxic Zone"&gt;{{cite report

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1950, the conversion of forests and wetlands for agricultural and urban developments accelerated. "Missouri River Basin has had hundreds of thousands of acres of forests and wetlands (66,000,000 acres) replaced with agriculture activity [. . .] In the Lower Mississippi one-third of the valley's forests were converted to agriculture between 1950 and 1976." &lt;ref name="The Gulf of Mexico's Hypoxic Zone"/&gt;

In July 2007, a dead zone was discovered off the coast of [[Texas]] where the [[Brazos River]] empties into the Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Tony |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a4Tb2AFv6CRk&amp;refer=home |title=Exclusive |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609030628/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive |archivedate=2010-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007==
The [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] calls for the production of {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} of renewable fuels by 2022, including {{convert|15|e9USgal|m3}} of corn-based ethanol, a tripling of current production that would require a similar increase in corn production.&lt;ref name="Potera, 2008"&gt;{{cite news | last = Potera | first = Carol | title = Corn Ethanol Goal Revives Dead Zone Concerns | work = Environmental Health Prospectives | date = June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the plan poses a new problem; the increase in demand for corn production results in a proportional increase in nitrogen runoff. Although nitrogen, which makes up 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, is an inert gas, it has more reactive forms, two of which (nitrate and ammonia) are used to make fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Economist, 2008"&gt;{{cite news | title = Dead Water | work = Economist | date = May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to {{Citation/make link|http://cropsci.illinois.edu/faculty/below/|Fred Below}}, a professor of crop physiology at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], corn requires more nitrogen-based fertilizer because it produces a higher grain per unit area than other crops and, unlike other crops, corn is completely dependent on available nitrogen in soil. The results, reported 18 March 2008 in [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], showed that scaling up corn production to meet the {{convert|15|e9USgal|m3|adj=on}} goal would increase nitrogen loading in the Dead Zone by 10–18%. This would boost nitrogen levels to twice the level recommended by the Mississippi Basin/Gulf of Mexico Water Nutrient Task Force ([[Mississippi River Watershed Conservation Programs]]), a coalition of federal, state, and tribal agencies that have monitored the dead zone since 1997. The task force says a 30% reduction of nitrogen runoff is needed if the dead zone is to shrink.&lt;ref name="Potera, 2008" /&gt;

==Reversal==
Dead zones are reversible, though the extinction of organisms that are lost due to its appearance is not. The [[Black Sea]] dead zone, previously the largest in the world, largely disappeared between 1991 and 2001 after fertilizers became too costly to use following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the demise of centrally planned economies in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]]. Fishing has again become a major economic activity in the region.&lt;ref name="Mee 2006"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mee | first = Laurence | title = Reviving Dead Zones | work = Scientific American | date = November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Black Sea "cleanup" was largely unintentional and involved a drop in hard-to-control fertilizer usage, the U.N. has advocated other cleanups by reducing large industrial emissions.&lt;ref name="Mee 2006"/&gt; From 1985 to 2000, the [[North Sea]] dead zone had nitrogen reduced by 37% when policy efforts by countries on the [[Rhine|Rhine River]] reduced sewage and industrial emissions of nitrogen into the water. Other cleanups have taken place along the [[Hudson River]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93619388 'Dead Zones' Multiplying In World's Oceans] by John Nielsen. 15 Aug 2008, Morning Edition, NPR.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

The chemical [[aluminium sulfate]] can be used to reduce phosphates in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/fhp/papers/alum_brochure.pdf |title=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128030217/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/fhp/papers/alum_brochure.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''decree''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: '''''decretum''''', from ''decerno'', "I judge")  is, in a general sense, an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. In the usage of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], it has various meanings. Any [[papal Bull]], [[papal brief|Brief]], or [[Motu Proprio]] is a decree inasmuch as these documents are legislative acts of the [[Pope]]. In this sense the term is quite ancient.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Pope Siricius]] speaks (Ep. i, ad Himer., c. ii) of the ''decreta generalia'' of [[Pope Liberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Congregations]] were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which come under their particular jurisdiction, but were forbidden from continuing to do so under [[Pope Benedict XV]] in 1917. Each [[ecclesiastical province]], and also each [[diocese]] may issue decrees in their periodical [[synods]] within their sphere of authority. 
==Canon 29 definition==
{{further|Jurisprudence of canon law #Lex}}
Canon 29 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law offers a definition of general decrees:
{{quote|General decrees, by which a competent legislator makes common provisions for a community capable of receiving a law, are true laws and are regulated by the provisions of the canons on laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4.HTM Canon 29], [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]; accessed 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The canon reproduces substantial elements (later deleted) of the original draft of what would become canon 7.&lt;ref name=Exegetical261&gt;''Exegetical commentary'', pg. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; This canon incorporates a definition which takes its inspiration from [[Thomas Aquinas]]' definition of human law found in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.&lt;ref name=Exegetical261/&gt;

==Codifications==
{{see also|Decretal}}
The word is also used to denote certain specified collections of church law, e.g. [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s Decree (''[[Decretum Gratiani]]''). In respect of the general legislative acts of the pope there is never doubt as to the universal extent of the obligation; the same may be said of the decrees of a General Council, e.g. those of the [[First Vatican Council]]. 

The Council of Trent was the first to apply the term indiscriminately to rulings concerning faith and discipline (''decreta de fide, de reformatione'').

==Decrees of Roman curial congregations==
{{Roman Curia}}
{{main|Congregation (Roman Curia)}}
{{see also|1917 Code of Canon Law}}
The Roman Congregations were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which came under their particular jurisdiction. The decrees of the [[congregation (Roman Curia)|Roman Congregations]] (q. v.) are certainly binding in each case submitted for judgment. But there are varying opinions as to whether such judgment is to be taken as a rule or general law applying to all similar cases. The common opinion is that when the decisions are enlargements of the law (''declaratio extensiva legis'') the decisions do not bind except in the particular case for which the decree is made. If, however, the decision is not an enlargement, but merely an explanation of the law (''declaratio comprehensiva legis''), such decree binds in similar cases.
===Benedict XV's restriction of curial decrees===
[[File:Cover of a copy of the 1917 Codex Iuris Canonici (Code of Canon Law).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hardcover of the ''1917 Code of Canon Law'']]
On 15 September 1917, by the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Cum Iuris Canonici'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XV]] made provision for a Pontifical Commission charged with interpreting the code and making any necessary modifications as later legislation was issued. New laws would be appended to existing canons in new paragraphs or inserted between canons, repeating the number of the previous canon and adding ''bis'', ''ter'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, §III ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. "canon 1567''bis''" in the style of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]) so as not to subvert the ordering of the code, or the existing text of a canon would be completely supplanted. The numbering of the canons was not to be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'' pgs. 62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Roman Congregations]] were forbidden to issue new general decrees, unless it was necessary, and then only after consulting the Pontifical Commission charged with amending the code. The congregations were instead to issue Instructions on the canons of the code, and to make it clear that they were elucidating particular canons of the code.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, §§II-III ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; This was done so as not to make the code obsolete soon after it was promulgated. The 1917 Code was very rarely amended, and then only slightly.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'' pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular law==
The decrees of a national council may not be promulgated until they have received the approval of the pope. The decrees of a provincial synod have no force until they have been approved by Rome. This approval is twofold: ordinary (''in formâ communi''), and specific (''in formâ specificâ''). The former means that there is nothing which needs correction in the decrees of the synod, and they thereby have force in the province. This is the approval generally given to such decrees. If approval is given in ''formâ specificâ'' the decrees have the same force as if they emanated from the Apostolic See, though they are binding only in the province for which they are made. 

The decrees of a diocesan bishop deal with the administration and good order of his diocese. If they are made during a synod, they are diocesan laws, are usually known as "diocesan statutes", or "synodal statutes", and bind until revoked by the bishop or his successor. If the decrees are extra-synodal, they have force only during the lifetime of the bishop or until he revokes them himself.

'''Depiction''' is reference conveyed through pictures. Basically a picture refers to its object through a non-linguistic two-dimensional scheme. A picture is not writing or notation. A depictive two-dimensional scheme is called a [[picture plane]] and may be constructed according to [[descriptive geometry]] where they are usually divided between ''projections'' (orthogonal and various oblique angles) and ''perspectives'' (according to number of vanishing points). Pictures are made with various materials and techniques, such as painting, drawing, or prints (including photography and movies) mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, and collages of unusual and disparate elements. Occasionally, picture-like features may be recognised in simple inkblots, accidental stains, peculiar clouds or a glimpse of the moon, but these are special cases, and it is controversial whether they count as genuine instances of depiction.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Robert Hopkins (1998), "Picture, Image, Experience" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, sculpture and theatrical performances are sometimes said to depict, but this requires a broad understanding of 'depict', as simply designating a form of representation that is not linguistic or notational. The bulk of studies of depiction however deal only with pictures. While sculpture and performance clearly represent or refer, they do not strictly picture their objects. 
 
Objects pictured may be factual or fictional, literal or metaphorical, realistic or idealised and in various combination. Idealised depiction is also termed schematic or stylised and extends to icons, diagrams and maps. Classes or styles of picture may abstract their objects by degrees, conversely, establish degrees of the concrete (usually called, a little confusingly, figuration or figurative, since the 'figurative' is then often quite literal). Stylisation can lead to the fully abstract picture, where reference is only to conditions for a picture plane – a severe exercise in self-reference and ultimately a sub-set of pattern.

But just ''how'' pictures function remains controversial. Philosophers, art historians and critics, perceptual psychologists and other researchers in the arts and social sciences have contributed to the debate and many of the most influential contributions have been interdisciplinary. Some key positions are briefly surveyed below.

== Resemblance ==

Traditionally, depiction is distinguished from denotative meaning by the presence of a [[mimesis|mimetic]] element or resemblance. A picture resembles its object in a way a word or sound does not. Resemblance is no guarantee of depiction, obviously. Two pens may resemble one another but do not therefore depict each other. To say a picture resembles its object especially is only to say that its object is that which it especially resembles; which strictly begins with the picture itself. Indeed, since everything resembles something in some way, mere resemblance as a distinguishing trait is trivial. Moreover, depiction is no guarantee of resemblance to an object. A picture of a dragon does not resemble an actual dragon. So resemblance is not enough.

Theories have tried either to set further conditions to the kind of resemblance necessary, or sought ways in which a notational system might allow such resemblance. It is widely believed that the problem with a resemblance theory of depiction is that resemblance is a symmetrical relation between terms (necessarily, if x resembles y, then y resembles x) while in contrast depiction is at best a non-symmetrical relation (it is not necessary that, if x depicts y, y depicts x). If this is right, then depiction and resemblance cannot be identified, and a resemblance theory of depiction is forced to offer a more complicated explanation, for example by relying on experienced resemblance instead, which clearly is an asymmetrical notion (that you experience x as resembling y does not mean you also experience y as resembling x).&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Hopkins (1998), Christopher Peacocke (1987) 'Depiction', in Philosophical Review 96(3):383-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued, however, that the concept of resemblance is not exclusively a relational notion, and so that the initial problem is merely apparent.&lt;ref&gt;John Hyman (2012), 'Depiction', in Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 71:129-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In art history, the history of actual attempts to achieve resemblance in depictions is usually covered under the terms "[[realism (arts)|realism]]", [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]]", or "[[illusionism]]".

== Illusion ==

The most famous and elaborate case for resemblance modified by reference, is made by art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960) ''Art and Illusion'' (Oxford: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1963) Meditations on a Hobbyhorse (Oxford, Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. ''The Image and the Eye'' (Oxford and New York: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance in pictures is taken to involve illusion. Instincts in [[visual perception]] are said to be triggered or alerted by pictures, even when we are rarely deceived. The eye supposedly cannot resist finding resemblances that accord with illusion. Resemblance is thus narrowed to something like the seeds of illusion. Against the one-way relation of reference Gombrich argues for a weaker or labile relation, inherited from [[:wikt:substitution|substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960): pp 80-98, (1982): pp 278–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures are thus both more primitive and powerful than stricter reference.

But whether a picture can deceive a little while it represents as much seems gravely compromised. Claims for innate dispositions in sight are also contested. Gombrich appeals to an array of psychological research from [[James J. Gibson]], R. L. Gregory, John M. Kennedy, Konrad Lorenz, Ulric Neisser and others in arguing for an 'optical' basis to perspective, in particular (see also [[perspective (graphical)]]. Subsequent cross-cultural studies in depictive competence and related studies in child-development and vision impairment are inconclusive at best.

Gombrich's convictions have important implications for his popular history of art,&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1995), The Story Of Art 16th ed. (London: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment and priorities there. In a later study by John Willats (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Willats, John, (1997), ''Art and Representation: New Principles In The Analysis Of Pictures'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; on the variety and development of picture planes, Gombrich's views on the greater realism of perspective underpin many crucial findings.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (1995), pp. 133, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual invariants ==

A more frankly behaviouristic view is taken by the perceptual psychologist [[James J. Gibson]],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J., 'The Ecological approach to Visual Perception in Pictures' Leonardo, 1978, 11, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; partly in response to Gombrich. Gibson treats visual perception as the eye registering necessary information for behaviour in a given environment. The information is filtered from light rays that meet the retina. The light is called the stimulus energy or sensation. The information consists of underlying patterns or 'invariants' for vital features to the environment.

Gibson's view of depiction concerns the re-presentation of these invariants. In the case of illusions or trompe l'oeil, the picture also conveys the stimulus energy, but generally the experience is of perceiving two sets of invariants, one for the picture surface, another for the object pictured. He pointedly rejects any seeds of illusion or substitution and allows that a picture represents when two sets of invariants are displayed. But invariants tell us little more than that the resemblance is visible, dual invariants only that the terms of reference are the same as those for resemblance

== Seeing-in ==

A similar duality is proposed by the philosopher of art [[Richard Wollheim]]. He calls it 'twofoldness'.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard (1987), ''Painting as an Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson) pp 46-7, 72-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Our experience of the picture surface is called the 'configurational' aspect, and our experience of the object depicted the 'recognitional'. Wollheim's main claim is that we are simultaneously aware of both the surface and the depicted object. The concept of twofoldness has been very influential in contemporary analytic aesthetics, especially in the writings of [[Dominic Lopes]]&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, Dominic (2005), Sight and Sensibility: Evaluating Pictures (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Bence Nanay]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanay, Bence (2005), 'Is Twofoldness Necessary for Representational Seeing?', British Journal of Aesthetics 45(3): 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, illusion is forestalled by the prominence of the picture surface where an object is depicted. Yet the object depicted quite simply ''is'' the picture surface under one reading, the surface indifferent to picture, another. The two are hardly compatible or simultaneous. Nor do they ensure a reference relation.

Wollheim introduces the concept of 'seeing-in' to qualify depictive resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim (1987), pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing-in is a psychological disposition to detect a resemblance between certain surfaces, such as inkblots or accidental stains, etc. and three-dimensional objects. The eye is not deceived, but finds or projects some resemblance to the surface. This is not quite depiction, since the resemblance is only incidental to the surface. The surface does not strictly refer to such objects. Seeing-in is a necessary condition to depiction, and sufficient when in accordance with the maker's intentions, where these are clear from certain features to a picture. But seeing-in cannot really say in what way such surfaces resemble objects either, only specify where they perhaps first occur.

Wollheim's account of how a resemblance is agreed or modified, whereby maker and user anticipate each other's roles, does not really explain how a resemblance refers, but rather when an agreed resemblance obtains.

== Other psychological resources ==

The appeal to broader psychological factors in qualifying depictive resemblance is echoed in the theories of philosophers such as Robert Hopkins,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Robert (1998), Picture, Image, and Experience (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Schier&lt;ref&gt;Schier, Flint (1986), Deeper Into Pictures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall (1990), Mimesis as Make-believe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; They enlist 'experience', 'recognition' and 'imagination' respectively. Each provides additional factors to an understanding or interpretation of pictorial reference, although none can explain how a picture resembles an object (if indeed it does), nor how this resemblance is then also a reference.

For example, Schier returns to the contrast with language to try to identify a crucial difference in depictive competence. Understanding a pictorial style does not depend upon learning a vocabulary and syntax. Once grasped, a style allows the recognition of any object known to the user. Of course recognition allows a great deal more than that – books teaching children to read often introduce them to many exotic creatures such as a kangaroo or armadillo through illustrations. Many fictions and caricatures are promptly recognised without prior acquaintance of either a particular style or the object in question.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Stephanie (1971), 'Caricature', The Monist 58: pp 285-93.&lt;/ref&gt; So competence cannot rely on a simple index or synonymy for objects and styles.

Schier's conclusion that lack of syntax and semantics in reference then qualifies as depiction, leaves dance, architecture, animation, sculpture and music all sharing the same mode of reference. This perhaps points as much to limitations in a linguistic model.

== Notation ==
Reversing orthodoxy, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson (1968), Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis and New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt; starts from reference and attempts to assimilate resemblance. He denies resemblance as either necessary or sufficient condition for depiction but surprisingly, allows that it arises and fluctuates as a matter of usage or familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), pp. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Goodman, a picture denotes. Denotation is divided between description, covering writing and extending to more discursive notation including music and dance scores, to depiction at greatest remove. However, a word does not grow to resemble its object, no matter how familiar or preferred. To explain how a pictorial notation does, Goodman proposes an analogue system, consisting of undifferentiated characters, a density of syntax and semantics and relative repleteness of syntax. These requirements taken in combination mean that a one-way reference running from picture to object encounters a problem. If its semantics is undifferentiated, then the relation flows back from object to picture. Depiction can acquire resemblance but must surrender reference. This is a point tacitly acknowledged by Goodman, conceding firstly that density is the antithesis of notation&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that lack of differentiation may actually permit resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson and Elgin, Catherine Z, (1988) Reconceptions in Philosophy (London and New York: Routledge) p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation without notation lacks sense.

Nevertheless, Goodman's framework is revisited by philosopher John Kulvicki&lt;ref&gt;Kulvicki, John (2006), On Images: Their structure and content (Oxford: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by art historian James Elkins&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James (1999), The Domain of Images (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; to an array of hybrid artefacts, combining picture, pattern and notation.

== Pictorial semiotics ==

Pictorial [[semiotics]] aims for just the kind of integration of depiction with notation undertaken by Goodman, but fails to identify his requirements for syntax and semantics. It seeks to apply the model of structural linguistics, to reveal core meanings and permutations for pictures of all kinds, but stalls in identifying constituent elements of reference, or as semioticians prefer, 'signification'. Similarly, they accept resemblance although call it 'iconicity' (after [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles Sanders - (1931-58), Collected Papers I-VIII. Hartshorne, C, Weiss, P, &amp; Burks, A, (eds.) (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; 1931–58) and are uncomfortable in qualifying its role. Older practitioners, such as [[Roland Barthes]]&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland (1969), Elements of semiology (Paris, 1967) translated by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith, (London: Cape).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto (1980), A Theory of Semiotics (Milan 1976) (Bloomington: Indiana University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; variously shift analysis to underlying 'connotations' for an object depicted or concentrate on description of purported content at the expense of more medium-specific meaning. Essentially they establish a more general [[iconography]].

A later adherent, Göran Sonesson,&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (1989), Pictorial Concepts: Inquiries into the semiotic heritage and its relevance for the analysis of the visual world. (Lund: Aris/Lund University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (2001), 'Iconicity strikes back: the third generation – or why Eco is still wrong'. VISIO 9: 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; rejects Goodman's terms for syntax and semantics as alien to linguistics, no more than an ideal and turns instead to the findings of perceptual psychologists, such as J. M. Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John M. (1974) The Psychology of Picture Perception (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass).&lt;/ref&gt; N. H. Freeman&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H. and Cox, M. V. (eds.) (1985), Visual Order: The Nature and Development of Pictorial Representation (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H., Evans, D., and Willats, J. (1988) Symposium overview: the computational approach to projection drawing-systems. (Budapest, Paper given at Third European Conference on Developmental Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt; and David Marr&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1977), 'Analysis of occluding outline', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B 197 441-475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1978), 'Representing visual information: a computational approach.' in Computer Vision, A. R. Hanson and E. M. Riseman (eds.) Academic Press, New York and London, pp. 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to detect underlying structure. Sonesson accepts 'seeing-in',&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (Revised August 2006), 'Current issues in pictorial semiotics. Lecture three: From the Critique of the Iconicity Critique to Pictorality' . Third conference of a series published online at the Semiotics Institute Online. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although prefers Edmund Husserl's version.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1928), Zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins. Halle. (Republished in Husserliana X, The Hague: Nijhoff, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1980), Phantasie, Bildbewusstsein, Erinnerung, Husserliana XXIII. (The Hague: Nijhoff).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance is again grounded in optics or the visible, although this does not exclude writing nor reconcile resemblance with reference. Discussion tends to be restricted to the function of outlines in schemes for depth.

==Deixis==
The art historian [[Norman Bryson]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Norman (1983) Vision and Painting: The Logic of The Gaz, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; persists with a linguistic model and advances a detail of parsing and tense, '[[deixis]]'. He rejects resemblance and illusion as incompatible with the ambiguities and interpretation available to pictures and is also critical of the inflexible nature of structuralist analysis. Deixis is taken as the rhetoric of the narrator, indicating the presence of the speaker in a discourse, a bodily or physical aspect as well as an explicit temporal dimension. In depiction this translates as a difference between 'The [[Gaze]]' where deixis is absent and 'The Glance' where it is present. Where present, details to materials indicate how long and in what way the depiction was made, where absent, a telling suppression or prolonging of the act. The distinction attempts to account for the 'plastic' or medium-specific qualities absent from earlier semiotic analyses and somewhat approximates the 'indexic' aspect to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#Icon, index, symbol|signs introduced by Peirce]].

Deixis offers a more elaborate account of the picture surface and broad differences to expression and application but cannot qualify resemblance.

==Iconography==
Lastly, iconography is the study of pictorial content, mainly in art, and would seem to ignore the question of how to concentrate upon what. But iconography's findings take a rather recondite view of content, are often based on subtle literary, historical and cultural allusion and highlight a sharp difference in terms of resemblance, optical accuracy or intuitive illusion. Resemblance is hardly direct or spontaneous for the iconographer, reference rarely to the literal or singular. Visual perception here is subject to reflection and research, the object as much reference as referent.

The distinguished art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, Erwin (1955) Meaning in the Visual Arts (New York: Doubleday).&lt;/ref&gt; allowed three levels to iconography. The first is 'natural' content, the object recognised or resembling without context, on a second level, a modifying historical and cultural context and at a third, deeper level, a fundamental structure or ideology (called iconology). He even ascribed the use of perspective a deep social meaning (1927). However more recently, a natural or neutral level tends to be abandoned as mythical. The cultural scholar [[W. J. T.

(1994), Picture Theory (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt; looks to ideology to determine resemblance and depiction as acknowledgement of shifts in relations there, albeit by an unspecified scheme or notation.

Iconography points to differences in scope for a theory of depiction. Where stylistics and a basic object is nominated, resemblance is prominent, but where more elaborate objects are encountered, or terms for nature denied, simple perception or notation flounder. The difference corresponds somewhat to the division in philosophy between the analytic and continental.

==Other issues==
Dozens of factors influence depictions and how they are represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T. J.|last2=Greenwood|first2=Keith|date=2016-03-08|title=Beyond Framing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the equipment used to create the depiction, the creator’s intent, vantage point, mobility, proximity, publication format, among others, and, when dealing with human subjects, their potential desire for impression management.

Other debates about the nature of depiction include the relationship between seeing something in a picture and seeing face to face, whether depictive representation is [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], how understanding novel depictions is possible, the [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] value of depiction and the nature of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in pictorial [[art]].

The '''European Survey Research Association (ESRA)''' was founded in 2005 to provide coordination in the field of [[statistical survey|Survey]] Research in [[Europe]]. According to the website, ESRA's main goal is to encourage communication between [[Methodology|methodologist]]s and researchers in substantive fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], and other disciplines employing survey data. Its main two activities are the biannual [[Academic conference|conference]]s on [[statistical survey|survey]] research, and the [[open access journal]] Survey Research Methods (SRM).

Established in January 2007, '''Survey Research Methods (SRM)''' is the official journal of the European Survey Research Association.  This young [[peer-reviewed journal]] aims to be a high quality scientific publication that will be of interest to researchers in all disciplines involved in the design, implementation and analysis of [[statistical survey]]s. The journal is published electronically with free and open access via the internet. The first issue was published 31 January 2007, and contained articles dealing with topics such as survey [[nonresponse]], the measurement of [[social capital]], the [[questionnaire construction|quality of survey questions]], and cross-cultural research. The current editors of SRM are Jaak Billiet of the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium, and Ulrich Kohler of the [[University of Potsdam]], Germany.

The '''Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging''' (formerly F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging) is one of the four centers which together comprise the Donders [[research institute|Institute]]. It is located at the campus of the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] and maintains strong ties with the [[Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics]]. It is named after the Dutch ophthalmologist [[Franciscus Donders]], who was the first scientist to use differences in reaction times to infer differences in cognitive processing.

Research at the centre is focussed around neuroimaging techniques such as [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]]. The centre also has an arrangement with Universität Duisburg-Essen to operate a 7T fMRI facility in Essen, at the Kokerei [[Zollverein]], the site of the former [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex]]. 

In order to train young talent in the broad field of [[cognitive neuroscience]], the Donders Institute has established the Donders Graduate School for Cognitive Neuroscience, which offers students an educational programme at both the Master's and the PhD level. The school is intended for students in biology, physics, psycholinguistics, behavioral studies and medicine who are strongly motivated to do research in cognitive neuroscience. 

[[FieldTrip]], a [[MATLAB]]-based toolbox for the analysis of [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] and [[EEG]] data originates at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging.

'''Flagellation'''  (Latin ''flagellum'', "whip"), '''flogging''', '''whipping''' or '''lashing''' is the act of beating the human body with special implements such as [[whip]]s, [[wikt:lash|lash]]es, [[Birching|rod]]s, [[Switch (rod)|switches]], the [[cat o' nine tails]], the [[sjambok]], the [[knout]], etc. Typically, flogging is imposed on an unwilling subject as a punishment; however, it can also be submitted to willingly, or performed on oneself, in religious or [[impact play|sadomasochistic contexts]].

The strokes are usually aimed at the unclothed back of a person, in certain settings it can be extended to other corporeal areas. For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).

In some circumstances the word "flogging" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between "flogging" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and "whipping" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.

==Current use as punishment==
{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}
Officially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.

Flogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including fornication, alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, lashes for punishment for women are often performed with the Qu'ran under one arm to minimise the swing and as a reminder of the source of legislation. They are not supposed to leave permanent scars, and when the number of lashes is high, are frequently done in batches to minimise risk of harm.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Judaism===
{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}

According to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.

===Antiquity===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.

In the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Whips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.

The Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&amp;mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as "half death" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}"'' ("taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead").

===From Middle Ages to modern times===
[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]
The Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area "and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody".&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590–591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged "at a cart's tail" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, "until his [or her] back be bloody". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt]], stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the [[Tuileries]].  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, Elisabeth (1992). ''Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt'', Verso. {{ISBN|0-86091-597-2}}. p.198&lt;/ref&gt; She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.

In the [[Russian Empire]], [[knout]]s were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfs]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Tim (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EJCOl7S0UYgC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Imperial Russia, 1801-1905]''. Routledge. p.83. {{ISBN|0-415-23110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use against slaves===
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|200px|An African-American slave named [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], photo taken at Baton Rouge, 1863. The scars are clearly visible because of [[keloid]] formation.]]

Whipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was frequently carried out during the period of [[slavery in the United States]], by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave "patrollers," mostly poor whites, who had among their powers the ability to whip any slave who violated the [[slave codes]].

===Flogging as military punishment===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.

====United States====
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, officers were not flogged. However, in 1745, a [[cashiering|cashiered]] British officer's sword could be broken over his head, among other indignities inflicted on him.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasson, p 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of [[New Hampshire]] Senator [[John P. Hale]], the [[United States]] Congress banned flogging on all U.S. ships on 28 September 1850, as part of a then-controversial amendment to a naval appropriations bill.&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;Hodak, George. [http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/congress_bans_maritime_flogging/ "Congress Bans Maritime Flogging"]. ''ABA Journal''. September 1850, p. 72. Retrieved 18 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legisworks.org/congress/31/session-1/chap-80.pdf 31st Congress, Session 1, Chapter 80 (1850), p515.] Quote: ''"''Provided'', That flogging in the navy, and on board vessels of commerce, be, and the same is hereby, abolished from and after the passage of this act."''&lt;/ref&gt; Hale was inspired by [[Herman Melville]]'s "vivid description of flogging, a brutal staple of 19th century naval discipline" in Melville's "novelized memoir" ''[[White Jacket]]''.&lt;ref name=Congress /&gt; Melville also included a vivid depiction of flogging, and the circumstances surrounding it, in his more famous work, ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.

Military flogging was abolished in the United States Army on 5 August 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the United States Army|last=Weigley|first=Russell|publisher=|year=1984|isbn=978-0253203236|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment was abolished in the [[Royal Navy]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/armyrefs.html Cardwell's Army Reforms 1870--1881]"&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Flogging was a common disciplinary measure in the [[Royal Navy]] that became associated with a seaman's manly disregard for pain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/facts/ships-and-seafarers/life-at-sea-in-the-age-of-sail Life at sea in the age of sail]". National Maritime Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Aboard ships, [[knittles]] or the [[cat o' nine tails]] was used for severe formal punishment, while a "rope's end" or "starter" was used to administer informal, on-the-spot discipline. In severe cases a person could be "flogged around the fleet": a significant number of lashes (up to 600) was divided among the ships on a station and the person was taken to all ships to be flogged on each.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Grint, The Arts of Leadership, 2000, {{ISBN|0191589330}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rJ6yjNy___AC&amp;pg=PA238, pp.237-238]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1879 a motion to abolish flogging in the Royal Navy was debated in the House of Commons. [[John O'Connor Power]], the member for Mayo, asked the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] to bring the navy cat-of-nine-tails to the [[House of Commons Library|Commons Library]] so that the members might see what they were voting about.  It was the Great "Cat" Contention, "Mr Speaker, since the Government has let the cat out of the bag, there is nothing to be done but to take the bull by the horns." [[Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]] celebrates the occasion in his poem, "Wilfred Owen's Photographs": "A witty profound Irishman calls/For a 'cat' into the House, and sits to watch/The gentry fingering its stained tails./Whereupon ...Quietly, unopposed,/The motion was passed."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Ted, "Wilfred Owen's Photographs", ''Lupercal'', 1960. See also Stanford, Jane, ''That Irishman: the Life and Times of John O'Connor Power'', 2011, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the maximum number of lashes that could be inflicted on soldiers in the British Army reached 1,200. This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted "nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.) Oman later wrote: {{quote|If anything was calculated to brutalize an army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code, which [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] to the end of his life supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was often turned thereby from a good soldier into a bad soldier, by losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means{{mdash}}more often than not with success.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 3rd battalion's [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] nickname of "The Steelbacks" is taken from one of its former regiments, the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]] who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat-o'-nine tails ("Not a whimper under the lash"), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

====France====
Meanwhile, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the French Army stopped floggings altogether. The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, p.179.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}
One of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.

=== Australian penal colonies ===
[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]
{{See also|History of Australia}}

Once common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already "imprisoned", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.

Flagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.

With the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or "lashes," to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.

Female convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.

Floggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.

At the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.

Flogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].

==As a religious practice==

[[File:Striding flagellant.jpg|thumb|Self-flagelation is ritually performed in the [[Philippines]] during Holy Week (on [[Good Friday]], before Easter).]]
{{Main|Self-flagellation}}

===Antiquity===
During the [[Ancient Roman religion|Ancient Roman festival]] of [[Lupercalia]] young men ran through the streets with thongs cut from the hide of goats which had just been sacrificed, and women who wished to conceive put themselves in their way to receive blows, apparently mostly on the hands.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The eunuch priests of the goddess [[Cybele]], the ''[[galli]]'', flogged themselves until they bled during the annual festival called [[Dies sanguinis]]. [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery religions]] also sometimes involved ritual flagellation, as famously depicted in the [[Villa of the Mysteries]] at [[Pompeii]], apparently showing initiation into the [[Dionysian Mysteries]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Christianity===
[[Image:Flagellants.png|thumb|[[Flagellants]]. From a fifteenth-century woodcut.]]

[[Flagellation of Christ|''The Flagellation'', in a Christian context]], refers to an episode in the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] prior to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]]. The practice of [[mortification of the flesh]] for religious purposes has been utilised by members of various [[Christian denominations]] since the time of the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054. Nowadays the 
[[Discipline (instrument of penance)|instrument of penance is called a discipline]], a cattail whip usually made of knotted cords, which is flung over the shoulders repeatedly during private prayer.&lt;ref name="Opus Dei Information Office"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&amp;p=9316 |title= Opus Dei and corporal mortification |publisher= Opus Dei Information Office |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, a group of Roman Catholics, known as the [[Flagellant]]s, took self-mortification to extremes. These people would travel to towns and publicly beat and whip each other while preaching repentance. The nature of these demonstrations being quite morbid and disorderly, they were during periods of time suppressed by the authorities. They continued to reemerge at different times up until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Flagellants| website = Encyclopædia Britannica| publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.| date = 6 December 2016| url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/flagellants| accessdate = 9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flagellants|work=The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=6th|date=7 October 2018|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/christianity-general/flagellants|accessdate = 9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flagellation was also practised during the [[Black Plague]] as a means to purify oneself of sin and thus prevent contracting the disease. [[Pope Clement VI]] is known to have permitted it for this purpose in 1348.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Flagellants|author= Leslie Alexander St. Lawrence Toke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]], the founder of the [[Lutheran Church]], regularly practiced self-flagellation as a means of mortification of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wall|first=James T. |title=The Boundless Frontier: America from Christopher Columbus to Abraham Lincoln|publisher=[[University Press of America]]|language=English |page=103|quote=Though he did not go to the ends that had Luther— including even self-flagellation— the methods of ritualistic observance, self-denial, and good works did not satisfy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Congregationalist]] writer [[Sarah Osborn]] (1714-1796) also practiced self-flagellation in order "to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God".&lt;ref name="Rubin1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Julius H.|title=Religious Melancholy and Protestant Experience in America|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780195083019|page=115|quote=In the many letters to her correspondents, Fish, Anthony, Hopkins, and Noyes, Osborn examined the state of her soul, sought spiritual guidance in the midst of her perplexities, and created a written forum for her continued self-examination. She cultivated an intense and abiding spirit of evangelical humiliation--self-flagellation and self-torture to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became "quite common" for members of the [[Tractarian]] movement (see [[Oxford Movement]], 1830s onwards) within the [[Anglican Communion]] to practice self-flagellation using the discipline.&lt;ref name="Yates1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yates|first=Nigel|title=Anglican Ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780198269892|page=60|quote=Self-flagellation with a small scourge, known as a discipline, became quite common in Tractarian circles and was practised by Gladstone among others.}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[Therese of Lisieux|Thérèse of Lisieux]], a late 19th-century French [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] nun considered in Catholicism to be a [[Doctor of the Church]], is an influential example of a saint who questioned prevailing attitudes toward physical penance. Her view was that loving acceptance of the many sufferings of daily life was pleasing to God, and fostered loving relationships with other people, more than taking upon oneself extraneous sufferings through instruments of penance. As a Carmelite nun, Saint Thérèse practiced voluntary corporal mortification.

Some members of strict [[monastic]] orders, and some members of the Catholic lay organization [[Opus Dei]], practice mild self-flagellation using the discipline.&lt;ref name="Opus Dei Information Office"/&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] took the discipline regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barron|first=Fr. Robert|title=Taking the Discipline|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCts0fjsmug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-flagellation remains common in [[Colombia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]] and one convent in [[Peru]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==As a sexual practice==

Flagellation is also used as a sexual practice in the context of [[BDSM]]. The intensity of the beating is usually far less than used for punishment.

There are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped, as a prelude to or substitute for sex, during the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann: ''In Leder gebunden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20435">[[Materials science]] has shaped the development of civilizations since the dawn of mankind. Better materials for tools and weapons has allowed mankind to spread and conquer, and advancements in material processing like steel and aluminum production continue to impact society today. Historians have regarded materials as such an important aspect of civilizations such that entire periods of time have defined by the predominant material used ([[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], etc.). For most of recorded history, control of materials had been through alchemy or empirical means at best. The study and development of chemistry and physics assisted the study of materials, and eventually the interdisciplinary study of materials science emerged from the fusion of these studies.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf E.|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-26691-6|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''history of materials science''' is the study of how different materials were used and developed through the history of Earth and how those materials affected the culture of the peoples of the Earth.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Feuersteinaxt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Flint axe, about 31 cm long.]]

In many cases different cultures leave their materials as the only records which [[anthropologists]] can use to define the existence of such cultures.  The progressive use of more sophisticated materials allows archeologists to characterize and distinguish between peoples.  This is partially due to the major material of use in a culture and to its associated benefits and drawbacks.  [[Stone-Age]] cultures were limited by which rocks they could find locally and by which they could acquire by trading.  The use of [[flint]] around 300,000 BCE is sometimes{{when|date=October 2015}} considered the beginning of the use of [[ceramic]]s. The use of polished [[stone axe]]s marks a significant advance because a much wider variety of rocks could serve as tools.

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]]- or dagger-blade.]]

The innovation of smelting and casting metals in the [[Bronze Age]] started to change the way that cultures developed and interacted with each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Starting around 5500 BCE, early [[metalsmith|smith]]s began to re-shape [[native metal]]s of [[copper]] and [[gold]] - without the use of fire - for tools and weapons.  The heating of copper and its shaping with hammers began around 5000 BCE.  Melting and casting started around 4000 BCE.  [[Metallurgy]] had its dawn with the reduction of copper from its ore around 3500 BCE.  The first [[alloy]], [[bronze]] came into use around 3000 BCE. [[Iron]]-working came into prominence from about 1200 BCE.

In the 10th century BCE [[glass]] production began in [[ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd century BCE people in [[History of India|ancient India]] developed [[wootz steel]], the first [[crucible steel]]. In the 1st century BCE [[glassblowing]] techniques flourished in [[Phoenicia]]. In the 2nd century CE [[steel]]-making became widespread in [[Han Dynasty]] China. The 4th century CE saw the production of the [[Iron pillar of Delhi]], the oldest surviving example of corrosion-resistant steel.

==Antiquity==
[[File:Ac.pantheon1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]].]]

[[Wood]], [[bone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and [[earth]] are some of the materials which formed the structures of the [[Roman Empire]]. Certain structures were made possible by the character of the land upon which these structures are built; a volcanic peninsula with stone aggregates and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] containing [[crystal]]line material will produce material which weathers differently from soft, sedimentary rock and silt. That is one of the reasons that the [[concrete]] [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] of [[Rome]] could last for 1850 years, and  why the [[thatch]]ed [[farmhouse]]s of [[Holland]] sketched by [[Rembrandt]] have long since decayed.

After the [[thigh]][[bone]] [[dagger]]s of the early [[hunter-gatherer]]s were superseded by wood and stone axes, and then by [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] implements of the Roman civilization, more precious materials could then be sought, and gathered together. Thus the [[medieval]] goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] could seek and defend the gold which he had to turn into objects of desire for [[duke]]s and [[pope]]s. ''[[The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini]]'' contains one of the first descriptions of a metallurgical process.

==Stone Age==

The use of materials begins in the stone age. Typically materials such as bone, fibers, feathers, shells, animal skin, and clay were used for weapons, tools, jewelry, and shelter. The earliest tools were in the paleolithic age, called Oldowan. These were tools created from chipped rocks that would be used for scavenging purpose. As history carried on into the Mesolithic age, tools became more complex and symmetrical in design with sharper edges. Moving into the Neolithic age, agriculture began to develop as new was to form tools for farming were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Christian|title=Stone Age|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearing the end of the stone age, humans began using copper, gold, and silver as a material. Due to these metals softness, the general use was for ceremonial purposes and to create ornaments or decorations and did not replace other materials for use in tools. The simplicity of the tools used reflected on the simple understanding of the human species of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
The use of copper had become very apparent to civilizations, such as its properties of elasticity and plasticity that allow it to be hammered into useful shapes, along with its ability to be melted and pored into intricate shapes. Although the advantages of copper were many, the materials was to soft to find large scale usefulness. Through experimentation or by chance, additions to copper lead to increased hardness of a new metal alloy, called bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science: History, Properties, Application|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze was originally composed of copper and arsenic, forming arsenic bronze.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylecote|first1=R.F|title=History of Metallurgy, Second Edition|publisher=London: Manley Publishing, for the institute of metals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==

Proto-porcelain material has been discovered dating back to the Neolthic period, with shards of material found in archaeological sites from the Eastern Han period in China.  These wares are estimated to have been fired from 1260 to 1300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=He|title=Chinese ceramics : the new standard guide|date=1996|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-23727-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, [[porcelain]] was invented in [[Tang Dynasty]] China. Porcelain in china resulted in a methodical development of widely used kilns that increased the quality and quantity that procelain could be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/porcelain-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279-dynasties|title=Porcelain in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing]] of ceramics is invented by [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabic chemists]] and [[Islamic pottery|potters]] in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mason |first=Robert B. |title=New Looks at Old Pots: Results of Recent Multidisciplinary Studies of Glazed Ceramics from the Islamic World |journal=Muqarnas: Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture |year=1995 |volume=XII |isbn=978-9004103146 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]] were invented in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt; and [[lustreware]] appeared in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 86–87, ''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th century, [[Damascus steel]] is developed in the [[Middle East]]. In the 15th century, [[Johann Gutenberg]] develops [[type metal]] alloy and Angelo Barovier invents [[cristallo]], a clear soda-based glass.

==Early modern period==
In the 16th century, [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]] publishes his Pirotechnia, the first systematic book on [[metallurgy]], [[Georg Agricola]] writes De Re Metallica, an influential book on [[metallurgy]] and [[mining]], and glass [[lens (optics)|lens]] are developed in the [[Netherlands]] and used for the first time in [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s.

In the 17th century, [[Galileo]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' ([[strength of materials]] and [[kinematics]]) includes the first quantitative statements in the science of materials. In the 18th century, [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patents a process for the production of metallic [[zinc]] by [[distillation]] from [[calamine]] and charcoal, [[Bryan Higgins]] was issued a [[patent]] for hydraulic cement ([[stucco]]) for use as an exterior [[plaster]], and [[Alessandro Volta]] makes a copper/zinc [[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]].

In the 19th century, [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] invents the [[thermocouple]], Joseph Aspin invents [[Portland cement]], [[Charles Goodyear]] invents [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] invent [[silver]]-based [[photography|photographic]] processes, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] demonstrates color photography, and [[Charles Fritts]] makes the first [[solar cell]]s using [[selenium]] waffles.

Before the early 1800s, [[aluminum]] had not been produced as an isolated metal.  It wasn't until 1825 that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered how to create elemental aluminum via the reduction of aluminum chloride.  Since aluminum is a light element with good mechanical properties, it was widely sought to replace heavier less functional metals like silver and gold.  Napoleon III used aluminum plates and utensils for his honored guests, while the rest were given silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Tom|title=Aluminum: Common Metal, Uncommon Past|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/aluminum-common-metal-uncommon-past|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this process was still expensive and was still not able to produce the metal in large quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production of Aluminum: The Hall-Héroult Process|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/aluminumprocess.html|website=American Chemical Society|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886, American [[Charles Martin Hall]] and Frenchman [[Paul Héroult]] invented a process completely independent of each other to produce aluminum from aluminum oxide via electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Totten|first1=George E.|title=Handbook of aluminum|date=2003|publisher=Dekker|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-8247-0896-2|edition=10. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process would allow aluminum to be manufactured cheaper than ever before, and laid the groundwork for turning the element from a precious metal into an easily obtainable commodity.  Around the same time in 1888, [[Carl Josef Bayer]] was working in St Petersburg, Russia to develop a method to make pure alumina for the textile industry.  This process involved dissolving the aluminum oxide out of the bauxite mineral to produce gibbsite, which can then be purified back into raw alumina.  The [[Bayer process]] and the [[Hall-Héroult process]] are still used today to produce a majority of the world's alumina and aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayer's Process for Alumina Production: A Historical Production|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/num17-18/num17-18%20p15-19.pdf|website=scs.illinois.edu|publisher=Fathi Habashi, Laval University|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material Science as a Field of Study==
Most fields of studies have a founding father, such as Newton in physics and Lavoisier in chemistry. Materials science on the other hand has no central figure that set in motion materials studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=Bernedetta|title=Materials science and engineering: an artificial discipline about to explode|website=History of Recent Materials Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, wartime collaborations of multiple fields of study to produce technological advances became a structure to the future field of study that would become known as material science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Gregory|title=A Materials Science Timeline|website=Materials World Modules}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War in the 1950s, US President Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) made materials a priority when it realized that materials were the limiting factor for advances in space and military technology. The Department of defense signed a contract with 5 universities (Harvard, MIT, Brown, Stanford, and Chicago) providing over $13 million for material research. Several institutions departments changed titles from "metallurgy" to "metallurgy and materials science" in 1960's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Modern materials science==

In the early part of the 20th century, most engineering schools had a department of [[metallurgy]] and perhaps of [[ceramic]]s as well.  Much effort was expended on consideration of the [[austenite]]-[[martensite]]-[[cementite]] phases found in the iron-carbon [[phase diagram]] that underlies [[steel]] production.  The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects.  In the post-WWII era, the systematic study of [[polymer]]s advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view.  [[Northwestern University]] instituted the first materials science department in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matsci.northwestern.edu/about/index.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high temperature materials. He pioneered high temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute. Tressler's contribution to materials science is celebrated with a Penn State lecture named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matse.psu.edu/about-us/lectures-and-awards/tressler Richard E. Tressler lecture in Materials Science] from [[Penn State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Materials Research Society (MRS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org Materials Research Society]&lt;/ref&gt; has been instrumental in creating an identity and cohesion for this young field.  MRS was the brainchild of researchers at [[Penn State University]] and grew out of discussions initiated by Prof. [[Rustum Roy]] in 1970.  The first meeting of MRS was held in 1973.  As of 2006{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}, MRS has grown into an international society that sponsors a large number of annual meetings and has over 13,000 members.  MRS sponsors meetings that are subdivided into symposia on a large variety of topics as opposed to the more focused meetings typically sponsored by organizations like the [[American Physical Society]] or the [[IEEE]].  The fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of MRS meetings has had a strong influence on the direction of science, particularly in the popularity of the study of [[soft materials]], which are in the nexus of biology, chemistry, physics and mechanical and electrical engineering.
Because of the existence of integrative textbooks, [[materials research societies]] and university chairs in all parts of the world, BA, MA and PhD programs and other indicators of discipline formation, it is fair to call materials science (and engineering) a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;See Cahn (2001) and Hentschel (2011) for further references and detailed analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] created the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DoD Directive Establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/dod-establishes-arpa|website=www.darpa.mil|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) since 1996. In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Materials Research|last=Psaras|first=Peter A.|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA offered 4-year IDL contracts to universities, originally to [[Cornell University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Northwestern University]], eventually granting 9 more contracts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/Timeline/index.html|title=A Selected History of DARPA Innovation|last=|first=|date=|website=DARPA|access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the [[National Science Foundation]] took over the program in 1972&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the [[United States]]' research and development of materials science.

The '''history of science and technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it ([[technology]]) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.

[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of [[science studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Modern engineering as it is understood today took form during the [[scientific revolution]], though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese]], [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} See the main articles [[History of science]] and [[History of technology]] for these respective topics.

=== United States ===
Academic study of the History of Science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]] at Harvard with his book ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Reingold, "History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920-1940," ''British Journal for the History of Science'' 1986 19(3): 243-262&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Dauben | first1= JW | last2= Gleason | first2= ML | last3= Smith | first3= GE | title= Seven decades of history of science: I.

'''LGBT sex education''' refers to an educational program, most commonly found in schools, that addresses the [[sex education]] needs of [[LGBT|LGBT individuals]] and covers topics related to [[homosexuality]]. It is usually integrated into the general sex education courses (alongside [[heterosexual]] topics). There is disagreement about whether LGBT sex education should be included in [[sex education]] curricula. Advocates of LGBT sex education say that the inclusion of LGBT issues into sex education programs would reduce [[homophobia|homophobic]] bullying, improve the health of LGBT people, and decrease instances of problems common in LGBT students such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and low [[self-esteem]]. Opponents argue that LGBT sex education programs would force a political point of view on students, misuse tax money, and disrespect religious values. As of 2014, only 5% of middle and high schoolers in the United States reported receiving "positive discussions of LGBT-related topics" within their health classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tolerance.org/magazine/number-53-summer-2016/feature/new-sex-ed|title=The New Sex Ed {{!}} Teaching Tolerance - Diversity, Equity and Justice|website=www.tolerance.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29|date=2016-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
LGBT sex education is currently not covered in many schools.&lt;ref name=Formby&gt;{{cite journal|last=Formby|first=Eleanor|title=Sex and relationships education, sexual health, and lesbian, gay and bisexual sexual cultures: views from young people|journal=Sex Education|date=August 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=255–266|doi=10.1080/14681811.2011.590078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also posited that students often don’t find existing LGBT sex education programs to be effective. Teachers have differing views on the subject of homosexuality, and these personal opinions can impact LGBT sex education when it is implemented.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Viv|author2=High |title=Something More to Tell You: Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Young Peoples|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=April 2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=213–225|doi=10.1080/0141192042000195281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research on LGBT sex education===

Multiple studies have concluded that LGBT sex education is often not encompassed in school sex education courses and that most students do not receive effective instruction in LGBT sex issues.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrow|first=Deana|title=Social Work with Gay and Lesbian Adolescents|journal=Social Work|date=November 1993|volume=38|issue=6|pages=655–660|accessdate=20 October 2013|url=https://academic.oup.com/sw/article-abstract/38/6/655/1880044|doi=10.1093/sw/38.6.655}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Ellis and High in the UK (2004), 384 students were surveyed; they found that 24% had not received instruction in LGBT sex issues.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; The CDC Division of Adolescent and School Health’s study revealed that 48% of schools in the US covered LGBT topics.&lt;ref name=SEICUS&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers: LGBTQ Youth Issues|url=http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=605&amp;grandparentID=477&amp;parentID=591#teach|work=SEICUS|publisher=SEICUS|accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research reported by Burston and Hart in 2001, 45% of surveyed students believed that they did not cover LGBT sex education sufficiently in school. Research has also shown that there can be an implicit assumption that all students are heterosexual in sex education classes.&lt;ref name=Buston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buston|first=Katie|author2=Hart |title=Heterosexism and homophobia in Scottish school sex education: exploring the nature of the problem|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=February 2001|volume=4|issue=1|pages=95–109|doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0366|pmid=11259073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LGBT students in Eleanor Formby’s 2011 study of sex education said that they do not always feel welcomed by sex education classes or at school.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Sex education courses commonly idealize marriage (not acknowledging that many countries outlaw same-sex marriage) thereby presenting a heterosexual view of sex and relationships as normal.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Studies have suggested that sex education programs often do not cover safe sex practices for LGBT individuals.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSW&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez |first=Marisol |title=Providing inclusive sex education in schools will address the health needs of LGBT Youth |url=http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |publisher=Center for the Study of Women UCLA |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102525/https://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are some sex education curricula that do cover LGBT issues.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; For example, the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] provides a sex education program called [[Our Whole Lives]], which includes discussion of sexual orientation and presents homosexuality and heterosexuality as equally valid. Our Whole Lives offers programs designed for a range of developmental stages, from Kindergarten-level through adulthood, and follows the "Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education" that the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]] (SIECUS) endorses.&lt;ref name=UUAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Whole Lives Lifespan Sexuality Education Curricula|url=http://www.uua.org/re/owl/|work=Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Whole Lives|url=http://www.ucc.org/justice/sexuality-education/our-whole-lives.html|work=The United Church of Christ|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Church of Christ]] also supports Our Whole Lives.&lt;ref name=UCC/&gt;

==Issues with Current Sex Education Programs==

Research has  illustrated that some sex education courses present LGBT issues in a negative light—portraying LGBT individuals and LGBT sexuality as something wrong, sick, and abnormal.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; According to the American Civil Liberties Union, “[[Abstinence-only sex education|Abstinence-only]]” approaches to sex education can also be alienating to LGBT students because these programs assume that marriage is a possibility and a desire for all students; however, same-sex marriage is illegal in many countries.&lt;ref name="ACLU"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Civil Liberties Union|title=Helping Teens Make Healthy and Responsible Decisions About Sex|url=https://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/helping-teens-make-healthy-and-responsible-decisions-about-sex|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, promoting marriage as the goal for LGBT students reproduces a [[homonormative]] standard, marginalizing those without access to or interest in marriage.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexuality in School: the Limits of Education|last=Gilbert|first=Jen|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis and High’s survey research in 2004 (including 384 students) revealed that 59% of young people who did receive LGBT sex education found it to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;

===Teachers===

Teachers have been identified as a hindrance to LGBT sex education in some studies. Teachers always have their own opinions about homosexuality, and, according to these studies, if teachers have negative views toward LGBT individuals this can come through in their teaching—causing LGBT students to feel unaccepted and unsafe.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; According to Ellis and High (2004), when LGBT students receive information about LGBT sexuality with negative undertones they are left feeling significantly worse and more unsafe than if homosexuality were left out of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; Researchers have documented multiple self-proclaimed "LGBT-friendly" teachers whose classrooms actually foster prejudiced lessons. Such teachers are also highly likely to ignore instances of homophobic bullying directed at LGBT youth within their classes.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Burston and Hart (2001) reported that teachers sometimes believe that they should not take a side on the issue of homosexuality, and therefore should not interfere when homophobia occurs in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; According to Formby (2011), even phrasing that subtly casts homosexuality in a negative light can have a detrimental effect on LGBT students’ experience of sex education.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;

There have also been issues around teachers feeling free to teach sex education that equally emphasizes both heterosexual and homosexual health information.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; Deana Morrow’s study (1993) reported that some teachers said they were afraid they might be fired if they discussed LGBT issues.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; This fear is linked to the historical misconnection of homosexuality to molestation in the United States; this supposedly natural linkage has been debunked multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=JM|date=|title=The Historical Regulation of Sexuality and Gender of Students and Teachers|url=|journal=Youth and Sexualities|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, straight and LGBT teachers alike still experience allegations of molestation when they engage in discussions surrounding sexuality, particularly those discussions that are LGBT related.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt; Teachers can also feel hindered because the school environment is inhospitable to homosexuality; in Burston and Hart’s 2001 study, some even said that they were under the impression that the school would not allow them to teach LGBT sex education.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

Classmates can also be non-receptive toward LGBT issues in current sex education courses, and students are often hesitant to talk about homosexuality, according to Buston and Hart (2001).&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

=== Home ===
Since sex education has been present in health education in schools, many parents expect their children to learn about sex there.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estes|first=Michelle L.|date=2017-03-09|title=“If There’s One Benefit, You’re not Going to Get Pregnant”: the Sexual Miseducation of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Individuals|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-017-0749-8|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=77|issue=9-10|pages=615–627|doi=10.1007/s11199-017-0749-8|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;Studies show that most families do not engage in conversation about sex in the home, and when they do it is often from a heternormative perspective. The assumptions of being heterosexual can make LGBT people feel ashamed or lacking support from their family. Lack of conversation and knowledge received in the home for LGBT people can often lead them to receive their information for outside sources.[[File:Rainbow Heart 181x182.png|thumbnail|The rainbow heart symbolizes LGB relationships]]

==Proposed LGBT sex education programs==
Advocates for LGBT sex education have suggested adjustments to current sex education practices in schools. One common place for improvement that researchers have identified is the angle from which sex education is approached in general. Buston and Hart (2001), Ellis and High (2004), and others have recommended that teachers frame sex education in terms of relationships rather than merely reproduction, which can lead to the exclusion of LGBT students.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; Ellis and High mention that sexual orientation might be more appropriately taught as “an aspect of culture and identity” (Ellis and High 2004, pg. 11).&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; Other researchers such as Morrow (1993) believe that in order for sex education to be effective, it must present LGB as just as natural and legitimate as heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; Advocates for LGBT sex education ask that LGBT sexual health issues be given equal weight in the curriculum accordingly.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; They also say that more resources concerning LGBT sexual health issues need to be made available to students.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; According to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s Center for the Study of Women’s Policy Brief 11 (2012), LBGT students may not be willing to reach out for guidance themselves.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;

Researchers have recommended that teachers in sex education programs avoid framing homosexuality as something that is fundamentally connected to sexually transmitted diseases and refrain from practices that are potentially detrimental to LGBT students, such as referring to partners as specifically “him” or “her” (better to use the more flexible “they”).&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;  Gowen and Winges-Yanez (2014) suggest through their focus groups on LGBT teens that there are several problems with the way sex education is taught.  The teens cited silencing, heterocentricity, and pathologizing of LGBT individuals as common practices.  When asked how they would improve sex education, the group said inclusive sex education would include discussion of LGBT issues, learning how to access resources, [[Sexually Transmitted Infection|STI]] prevention, relationships, and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gowen | last2 = Winges-Yanez | year = 2014 | title = Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youths' perspectives of inclusive school-based sexuality education | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 51 | issue = 7| pages = 788–800 | pmid = 24003908 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.806648}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates for LGBT rights also say that teachers need to abandon any reluctance to take a side in the debate about homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

There are also alternative sexual education programs for LGBT people, such as that of an online sexual education course. According to a study evaluating the effectiveness of an online, interactive sexual education program for LGBT people, all subsections recorded statistically significant improvement of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustanski|first=Brian|last2=Greene|first2=George J.|last3=Ryan|first3=Daniel|last4=Whitton|first4=Sarah W.|date=2014-03-03|title=Feasibility, Acceptability, and Initial Efficacy of an Online Sexual Health Promotion Program for LGBT Youth: The Queer Sex Ed Intervention|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2013.867924|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=220–230|doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.867924|issn=0022-4499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the topics included safe sex practices, healthy relationships, pleasure and sexually transmitted infections. This type of program also created an online community for people taking the course to ask questions and interact with each other. This social aspect of the program also created a sense of normalcy and acceptance. Online programs could offer a means of education for those who cannot receive it in school.

==Support for LGBT sex education==
Proponents of incorporating LGBT sex education into school curricula commonly present several arguments. According to the [[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]], some supporters claim that failing to include LGBT issues in sex education programs will overlook a significant number of students who identify as LGBT;&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Josh|title=5 Reasons Schools Should Adopt LGBTQ-inclusive Sex Ed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-a-goodman/lgbtq-inclusive-sex-ed_b_3834914.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Center for American Progress]] (CAP) says that this can cause them to feel marginalized and removed from the lesson because it doesn’t pertain to them.&lt;ref name=CAP&gt;{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Hannah|title=LGBT-Inclusive Sex Education Means Healthier Youth and Safer Schools|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2013/06/21/67411/lgbt-inclusive-sex-education-means-healthier-youth-and-safer-schools/|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT sex education advocates also argue that leaving LGBT safe sex instruction out of the curriculum will increase the likelihood of health problems for LGBT students.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; Supporters say that since LGBT people are particularly at risk for [[HIV/AIDS]], it is especially important to provide them with sexual health information.&lt;ref name="Pink News"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Scott|title=National AIDS Trust welcomes Labour's call for LGBT inclusive sex education|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/06/10/national-aids-trust-welcomes-labours-call-for-lgbt-inclusive-sex-education/|work=Pink News|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to researcher Eleanor Formby (2011), lesbian women are a high-risk group for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), because many do not know that they can be susceptible to STDs or how to engage in safe sex. Therefore, it is important that they receive lesbian sex education.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; LGBT sex education advocates suggest that because LGBT students aren’t taught sex education that pertains to them in school, they feel unprepared for sex, unable to talk about it openly, and have to learn about it by themselves—which can result in negative health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; Sanchez (2012) argues that LGBT students are unlikely to reach out to resources that could give them good information on their own, which furthers the need for LGBT sex education in schools.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;

[[File:Showing your pride - DC Gay Pride Parade 2012 (7356403050).jpg|thumbnail|Parade attendees wave rainbow flags at the 2012 Washington, D.C. Capital Pride parade]]

LGBT sex education supporters have also argued that the inclusion of LGBT topics in the curriculum can decrease instances of bullying in schools by familiarizing students with the range of [[sexual orientation]]s and reducing harmful [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; The Center for American Progress argues that LGBT sex education results in a decrease in homophobic comments. According to the Huffington Post, supporters say that educating young people about LGBT individuals could help them have a more positive attitude toward their gay peers.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; The Center for American Progress (2013) says that LGBT sex education would therefore reduce common problems LGBT students face as a result of negative attitudes; these include mental health issues like depression, the risk of suicide, drug abuse, self-esteem issues, and poorer academic performance due to stress caused by discrimination. They argue that covering homosexuality in sex education programs helps students feel more secure at school.&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;

According to Jen Gilbert, associate professor of education at York University, LGBT kids often do not have queer parents who they can ask for sexuality-related advice, nor access to LGBT adults. LGBT sex education could potentially fill this gap and provide LGBT students with elders well-versed in their specific needs and equipped with affirming information, that students are otherwise unable to receive at home or in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexuality in School: the Limits of Education|last=Gilbert|first=Jen|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, proponents of LGBT sex education have said that curricula that explore all facets of sexuality would be beneficial to straight students as well, because they claim that it presents a more accurate picture of the world and human sexuality. A study of Gay/Straight Alliances in Utah found that peer-facilitated discussions concerning the spectrum of sexuality and gender identities benefitted both straight and LGBT students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Camille|date=February–March 2002|title=The Impact of Belonging to a High School Gay/Straight Alliance|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/13897/summary|journal=The High School Journal|volume=85|issue=3|pages=13–26|doi=10.1353/hsj.2002.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exposed them to the reality of relationships outside of the heteronormative images that dominate media (as well as sex education), and even positively impacted all involved students' academic performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Proponents also argue that offering LGBT-inclusive sex education can be of major assistance to any questioning students that might be in the class.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

According to the Center for American Progress (2013), the majority of parents support including homosexuality in the sex education curriculum; they report that 73% of high school parents think LGBT issues should be taught. The CAP claims that this high percentage of support indicates that LGBT topics should be incorporated.&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;

==Opposition to LGBT sex education==
Opponents of LGBT sex education argue that it is wrong to teach students about the issue of homosexuality because it is too contentious. They say that parents should have control over what their children are exposed to and taught, and allowing public schools to cover LGBT sex education would undermine this right, forcing a particular political view on students. According to the [[The Christian Post|Christian Post]], some parents do not want their children to study homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Christian Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/sex-education-in-schools-should-include-a-gay-agenda-report-claims-66976/|title=Sex Education in Schools Should Include a Gay Agenda, Report Claims|last=Villalva|first=Brittney|work=The Christian Post|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics often cite a misuse of citizens' tax dollars; claiming citizens' should not have to pay for children to learn about other lifestyles that their parents do not agree with.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moran|first=Joe|date=1 February 2001|title=Childhood Sexualities and Education: The Case of Section 28|journal=Sexualities|volume=4|issue=1|pages=73–89|doi=10.1177/136346001004001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Formby (2011), opponents have also argued that LGBT sex education is harmful to students because they say it exposes them to damaging information.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; They claim that the students should not learn about LGBT issues until they are older.&lt;ref name="Christian Post" /&gt; Some opponents of LGBT sex education have argued that including LGBT issues in sex education programs will encourage more young people to practice homosexuality as well.&lt;ref name="Morrow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/education/09clash.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Gay Rights Battlefields Spread to Public Schools|last=Janofsky|first=Michael|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2005-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LGBT sex education has also been accused of being disrespectful to certain families’ religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The Christian Post argued that if schools elect to teach about LGBT people while neglecting religious topics, the curriculum would be unfairly balanced.&lt;ref name="Christian Post" /&gt;

There have also been concerns that LGBT sex education wouldn’t be effective because it is difficult for homophobic students to accept homosexuality, which may prevent them from being receptive to the instruction.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

=== Opposition within the United States ===
Four states (Alabama, South Carolina, Texas, Utah) mandate pointedly negative messages regarding all LGBT identities, when sex education is provided.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=Sex and HIV Education|date=2016-03-14|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight states prohibit discussion of any topics deemed LGBT-related.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the Guttmacher Institute's findings in 2017, "If HIV education is taught in Arizona it cannot "promote" a "homosexual lifestyle" or portray homosexuality in a positive manner. Mandated HIV education in Oklahoma teaches that among other behaviors that 'homosexual activity' is considered to be 'responsible for contact with the AIDS virus'."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Laws and legal battles==

===Section 28===
{{Main|Section 28}}
Section 28 was a controversial law in the United Kingdom that barred schools from presenting homosexuality as a viable sexual orientation or basis for relationships (though the law was never used in court).&lt;ref name="Moran" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;{{cite news|last=Browne|first=Daniel|title=The Lasting Legacy of Section 28|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-browne/the-lasting-legacy-of-section-28_b_4259545.html|accessdate=2013-11-24|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enacted in 1988 and repealed throughout the UK by 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Section 28 Timeline|url=http://politics.theguardian.com/homeaffairs/page/0,11026,875944,00.html#top|accessdate=2013-11-24|newspaper=The Guardian|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Section 28 say that the law prevented teachers from intervening in instances of homophobic bullying and greatly hindered the development of gay rights in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt; According to Moran (2001), proponents of the law argued that it protected students from being harmed by gay propaganda.&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt; Recently, LGBT advocates have raised concerns that policies similar to Section 28 are appearing again in British schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Nigel|title=The return of Section 28: Schools and academies practising homophobic policy that was outlawed under Tony Blair|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-return-of-section-28-schools-and-academies-practising-homophobic-policy-that-was-outlawed-under-tony-blair-8775249.html|accessdate=2013-11-24|newspaper=The Independent|date=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatian textbook===
In 2009, the European Committee of Social Rights found several statements in a Croatian mandatory Biology course textbook, including: “Many individuals are prone to sexual relations with persons of the same sex…. It is believed that parents are to blame because they impede their children’s correct sexual development with their irregularities in family relations. Nowadays it has become evident that homosexual relations are the main culprit for increased spreading of sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. AIDS),” and “The disease [AIDS] has spread amongst promiscuous groups of people who often change their sexual partners. Such people are homosexuals because of sexual contacts with numerous partners, drug addicts...and prostitutes.” The European Committee of Social Rights deemed these statements discriminatory and in violation of Croatia's obligations under the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Complaints/CC45Merits_en.pdf|title=The European Social Charter|website=European Social Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''''Whaling Walls''''', which are large outdoor [[mural]]s by the artist [[Robert Wyland]], featuring images of life-size [[gray whale]]s, breaching [[humpback whale]]s, [[blue whale]]s, and other sea life. ''Whaling Walls'' (a pun on the [[Wailing Wall]]) are created by invitation of the communities, institutions, and building owners of the structures on which they are painted. The one hundredth and possibly final ''Whaling Wall'' was painted in [[Beijing]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[Environment News Service|ENS]] (27 June 2008).

'''Mechanism''' is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are like complicated machines or artifacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts or an external influence on the parts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The doctrine of mechanism in [[philosophy]] comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of [[metaphysics]], but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as [[universal mechanism]] and [[anthropic mechanism]].

{{quote|There is no constant meaning in the history of philosophy for the word Mechanism. Originally, the term meant that cosmological theory which ascribes the motion and changes of the world to some external force. In this view material things are purely passive, while according to the opposite theory (i. e., Dynamism), they possess certain internal sources of energy which account for the activity of each and for its influence on the course of events; These meanings, however, soon underwent modification. The question as to whether motion is an inherent property of bodies, or has been communicated to them by some external agency, was very often ignored. With a large number of cosmologists the essential feature of Mechanism is the attempt to reduce all the qualities and activities of bodies to quantitative realities, i. e. to mass and motion. But a further modification soon followed. Living bodies, as is well known, present at first sight certain characteristic properties which have no counterpart in lifeless matter. Mechanism aims to go beyond these appearances. It seeks to explain all "vital" phenomena as physical and chemical facts; whether or not these facts are in turn reducible to mass and motion becomes a secondary question, although Mechanists are generally inclined to favour such reduction. The theory opposed to this biological mechanism is no longer Dynamism, but Vitalism or Neo-vitalism, which maintains that vital activities cannot be explained, and never will be explained, by the laws which govern lifeless matter.&lt;ref name="CE1913"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Mechanism |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1913 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Mechanism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)}}

== Universal mechanism&lt;!--'Universal mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The older doctrine, here called '''universal mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the [[scientific revolution]] had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going [[determinism]]: if ''all'' phenomena could be explained ''entirely'' through the motion of matter under the laws of [[classical physics]], then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, ''all'' phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern [[quantum mechanics]] is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)

The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that [[René Descartes]] was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the [[philosophy of mind]], he is remembered for introducing the [[mind–body problem]] in terms of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[physicalism]].

Descartes was a [[substance dualist]], and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]] (see also: [[French materialism]]).

== Anthropic mechanism&lt;!--'Anthropic mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The thesis in '''anthropic mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may ''also'' believe that), but rather that everything ''about human beings'' can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.

One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human [[mind]]; Descartes, for one, endorsed [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] in his ''Man a Machine'' (1748).

Today, as in the past, the main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind — and consciousness, in particular — and [[free will]]. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in [[philosophy of mind]] they argue that unconscious matter cannot completely explain the phenomenon of consciousness, and in [[metaphysics]] they argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which (they argue) is incompatible with our understanding of ourselves as creatures with [[free will]]. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include [[Norman Malcolm]] and
[[David Chalmers]].

Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies [[eliminative materialism]] in [[philosophy of mind]], and [[hard determinism]] on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher [[Paul Churchland]]. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jonas, ''The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology'' (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the [[argument]]s given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by "consciousness" and "free will," they urge, it is fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist [[Physicalism|physicalist]] theories of mind, and for [[compatibilism]] on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].

===Gödelian arguments&lt;!--'Gödelian argument' and 'Gödelian arguments' redirect here--&gt;===
Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], or by the [[Church-Turing thesis]], any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is [[Consistency|consistent]], then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

'''Gödelian arguments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by Gödel himself in his 1951 [[Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship|Gibbs Lecture]] entitled "Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, [[Hilary Putnam]] published a paper entitled "Minds and Machines," in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1960, ''Minds and Machines'' in [[Sidney Hook]], ed., ''Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium''. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. ''Minds and Machines''. Prentice-Hall: 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between "what can be mechanically proven" and "what can be seen to be true by humans" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let T be a Turing machine which "represents" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using Gödel's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T "represents" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. Gödel's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use Gödel's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;The Gödel Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by [[Hilary Putnam]] in the Gödel centenary 2006  [http://www.logic.at/goedel2006/abstract.php?putnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. Lucas]] in ''[[Minds, Machines and Gödel]]'' (1961), and later in his book ''The Freedom of the Will'' (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas, J. R.]], 1961, "[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/mmg.html Minds, Machines, and Gödel.]" ''Philosophy 36'':112-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucas admits that, by Gödel's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/referenc.html website].

Another work was done by [[Judson Webb]] in his 1968 paper "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Judson Webb|Webb, Judson]], 1968, "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind," ''Philosophy of Science 35'': 156-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the Gödelian statement ''p'' pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of Gödel's theorems, namely, that of [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Emil Post]], Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of ''p''. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of Gödel's theorems are really arguments about whether the [[Church-Turing thesis]] is true.

Later, [[Roger Penrose]] entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''  (1989) [ENM] and ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial.  [[Martin Davis]] responded to ENM in his paper [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/penrose.ps "Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?" (ps)], where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency.  [[Solomon Feferman]] gives a critical examination of SM in his paper [http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/penrose.pdf "Penrose's Gödelian argument" (pdf)].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive Gödelian argument "a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion".&lt;ref name=laforte /&gt;

A Gödel-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looked at this way, Gödel's proof suggests – though by no means does it prove! – that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist – not even in principle – on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on  lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question.
It is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in [[Peano arithmetic]], no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G – despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the [[Gödel sentence]] is true.

What might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emergent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone
  (''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', p. 708).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rationology.net/eGodel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Melville Walker House''' is an inn on Maine Street in the [[Kennebunkport Historic District]] in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]. The inn was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 6, 1976. It is now known as the Maine Stay Inn.

==History==

The Melville Walker House was built as a private residence in 1860 by merchant sea captain Melville Walker on land provided to him by his father, William H. Walker. Captain Walker transferred the title to his wife, Abbie, following their marriage.

The property then passed to brother-in-law, Hiram Fairfield on October 4, 1876, who in turn left it to his wife, Adelaide, (Melville's sister) and their son, Harry. 31 years later in 1891, the property passed from the founding family for the first time when Adelaide sold it to the Heuvelman family. The Heuvelmans held the property until 1899, at which time they sold it to George Little, an executive with the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;Kennebunkport Historical Society, http://www.kporthistory.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's records show that electric lights were installed in 1905 at the Little's on Maine Street, then known as “The Maples.”

Title to the house and property then passed to Senator Wickes of New York in 1924. The next owners, the Eldridge family, gave the property its current name “The Maine Stay” and opened their guest house. The first cottage was added to the property in 1954. The inn remained under the Eldridge ownership until 1970 when it was sold to the Taylor-Milligan family. They sold The Maine Stay to Max and Jane Andrews in 1976. Jacques and Carol Gagnon purchased the house in 1983 and turned it into a [[bed and breakfast]]. In April 1989, title passed to Carol and Lindsay Copeland who sold it to George and Janice Yankowski in 2002. On April 30, 2008 Janice and George sold the inn to Judi and Walter Hauer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainestayinn.com/ Maine Stay Inn &amp; Cottages]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The design of the main house is considered to be square block [[Italianate architecture]], contoured in a low-hip roof design, with additions and renovations added over the years.&lt;ref&gt;iLoveInns, http://www.iloveinns.com/maine-stay-inn-cottages-at-the-melville-walker-house-id8072.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, [[Queen Anne style architecture]] was introduced to the inn with construction of the suspended spiral partially flying staircase, starburst crystal glass windows, ornately carved mantels and moldings, and additions of bay windows and the wrap-around porch.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Methanol toxicity''' is [[poisoning]] from [[methanol]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Symptoms may include a [[decreased level of consciousness]], poor coordination, [[vomiting]], [[abdominal pain]], and a specific smell on the breath.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; [[Decreased vision]] may start as early as twelve hours after exposure.&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; Long term outcomes may include blindness and [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount.&lt;ref name=Kr2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruse|first1=JA|title=Methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication.|journal=Critical care clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=661–711|pmid=22998995|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Methanol poisoning most commonly occurs following the drinking of [[windshield washer fluid]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; This may be accidental or done purposefully in an [[suicide|attempt to die by suicide]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Toxicity may also rarely occur through skin exposure or breathing in the fumes.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; When methanol is broken down by the body it results in [[formaldehyde]], [[formic acid]], and [[formate]] which cause much of the toxicity.&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; The diagnosis may be suspected when there is [[acidosis]] or an increased [[osmol gap]] and confirmed by directly measuring blood levels.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include [[infections]], exposure to other [[toxic alcohol]]s, [[serotonin syndrome]], and [[diabetic ketoacidosis]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Early treatment increases the chance of a good outcome.&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an [[antidote]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; The preferred antidote is [[fomepizole]], with [[ethanol]] used if this is not available.&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; [[Hemodialysis]] may also be used in those where there is [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] damage or a high degree of [[acidosis]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; Other treatments may include [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[folate]], and [[thiamine]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, prognosis, and history --&gt;
[[Outbreak]]s have occurred due to contamination of [[drinking alcohol]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; This is more common in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name=EM2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=GA|last2=Valento|first2=M|title=Toxic Alcohol Ingestion: Prompt Recognition And Management In The Emergency Department.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1–20|pmid=27538060}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 more than 1700 cases occurred in the United States.&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Those affected are often adults and male.&lt;ref name=Fer2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017: 5 Books in 1|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323448383|page=794|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA794|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908221935/https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA794|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outcomes may be good with early treatment.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Toxicity to methanol has been described as early as 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clary|first1=John J.|title=The Toxicology of Methanol|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118353103|page=3.4.1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSs8oDQV4uYC&amp;pg=PT44|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908221935/https://books.google.com/books?id=xSs8oDQV4uYC&amp;pg=PT44|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The initial symptoms of methanol intoxication include [[central nervous system depression]], headache, dizziness, nausea, lack of coordination, and confusion. Sufficiently large doses cause unconsciousness and death. The initial symptoms of methanol exposure are usually less severe than the symptoms from the ingestion of a similar quantity of ethanol.&lt;ref name=ershdb&gt;{{cite web| last = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health| title = The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: Methanol| date = 22 August 2008| url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/EmergencyResponseCard_29750029.html| accessdate = 17 March 2009| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090423005724/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/EmergencyResponseCard_29750029.html| archivedate = 23 April 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the initial symptoms have passed, a second set of symptoms arises, from 10 to as many as 30 hours after the initial exposure, that may include blurring or complete loss of vision, [[acidosis]], and [[putamen|putaminal]] hemorrhages, an uncommon but serious complication.&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Permpalung N, Cheungpasitporn W, Chongnarungsin D, Hodgdon TM |title=Bilateral putaminal hemorrhages: serious complication of methanol intoxication|journal=N Am J Med Sci|volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=623–4 |date=Oct 2013 |pmid=24350079 |doi=10.4103/1947-2714.120804 |pmc=3842708}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms result from the accumulation of toxic levels of [[formate]] in the blood, and may progress to death by [[respiratory failure]]. Physical examination may show [[tachypnea]], and [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] examination may show dilated [[pupil]]s with [[hyperemia]] of the optic disc and [[retina]]l [[edema]].

==Cause==
Methanol has a high toxicity in humans. As little as 10&amp;nbsp;mL of pure methanol when drunk is metabolized into [[formic acid]], which can cause permanent [[blindness]] by destruction of the [[optic nerve]]. 15&amp;nbsp;mL is potentially fatal.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Although the median lethal dose is typically 100&amp;nbsp;mL (3.4&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz) (i.e. 1–2&amp;nbsp;mL/kg body weight of pure methanol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Methanol Poisoning Overview|url=http://www.antizol.com/mpoisono.htm|publisher=Antizol|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005043548/http://www.antizol.com/mpoisono.htm|archivedate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Reference dose]] for methanol is 2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0305.htm Methanol (CASRN 67-56-1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205004930/http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0305.htm |date=2012-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethanol is sometimes [[denatured alcohol|denatured]] (adulterated), and made poisonous, by the addition of methanol. The result is known as methylated spirit, "meths" (British use) or "metho" (Australian slang). This is not to be confused with "meth", a common abbreviation for [[methamphetamine]] and for [[methadone]] in Britain and the United States.

==Mechanism==
Methanol is [[toxic]] by two mechanisms. First, methanol (whether it enters the body by [[ingestion]], [[inhalation]], or [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] through the skin) can be fatal due to its [[CNS depressant]] properties in the same manner as [[Alcohol intoxication#Acute alcohol poisoning|ethanol poisoning]]. Second, in a process of [[toxication]], it is [[metabolism|metabolized]] to [[formic acid]] (which is present as the formate ion) via [[formaldehyde]] in a process initiated by the [[enzyme]] [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] in the [[liver]].&lt;ref name="Schep"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM|title=A seaman with blindness and confusion|journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=339|pages=b3929|date=2009|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3929|pmid=19793790|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008081309/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|archivedate=2009-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid (formate) via [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] (ALDH).  The conversion to formate via ALDH proceeds completely, with no detectable formaldehyde remaining.&lt;ref name=noCHOH&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=McMartin KE, Martin-Amat G, Noker PE, Tephly TR |title=Lack of a role for formaldehyde in methanol poisoning in the monkey |journal=Biochem.

==Treatment==
Methanol poisoning can be treated with [[fomepizole]], or if unavailable, ethanol.&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Casavant MJ |title=Fomepizole in the treatment of poisoning |journal=Pediatrics |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=170–171 |date=Jan 2001 |pmid=11134450 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/107/1/170 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.1.170 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050629084540/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/107/1/170 |archivedate=2005-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brent"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brent J |title=Fomepizole for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=360 |issue=21 |pages=2216–23 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19458366 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct0806112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both drugs act to reduce the action of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] on methanol by means of [[competitive inhibition]].  [[Ethanol]], the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, acts as a competitive inhibitor by more effectively binding and saturating the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme in the liver, thus blocking the binding of methanol.  Methanol is excreted by the [[kidney]]s without being converted into the very toxic metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid.  Alcohol dehydrogenase instead enzymatically converts ethanol to [[acetaldehyde]], a much less toxic organic molecule.&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voet, Donald, Judith G. Voet, and Charlotte W. Pratt. ''Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level''. 5th ed. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2008. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Additional treatment may include [[sodium bicarbonate]] for metabolic acidosis, and [[hemodialysis]] or [[hemodiafiltration]] to remove methanol and formate from the blood.&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt; [[Folinic acid]] or [[folic acid]] is also administered to enhance the metabolism of formate.&lt;ref name="Schep"/&gt;

==History==
There are cases of methanol resistance, such as that of [[Michael Malloy|Mike Malloy]], whom someone tried and failed to poison by methanol in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Deborah (2011). ''The Poisoner's Handbook''. Penguin Books. p. 231. {{ISBN|014311882X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, [[2016 Irkutsk mass methanol poisoning|at least 75 people in Irkutsk, Russia died]] from methanol poisoning after ingesting a counterfeit body lotion that was primarily methanol rather than ethanol as labeled. The body lotion, prior to the event, had been used as a cheap substitute for vodka by the impoverished people in the region despite warnings on the lotion's bottles that it was not safe for drinking and long-standing problems with alcohol poisoning across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/c0c419587e7d44ec8a6c6ac2685b8f2a/Alcohol-poisoning-death-toll-in-Russian-city-rises-to-48|title=Alcohol poisoning death toll in Russian city rises to 49|first=Vladimir|last=Isachenkov|newspaper=Associated Press|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220183656/https://www.apnews.com/c0c419587e7d44ec8a6c6ac2685b8f2a/Alcohol-poisoning-death-toll-in-Russian-city-rises-to-48|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Centre for Radio Astrophysics''' ('''NCRA''') ([[Hindi]]:राष्ट्रीय रेडियो खगोल भौतिकी केन्द्र) of [[India]] is a premier [[research institution]] in India in the field of [[radio astronomy]] is located in the [[Pune University]] Campus&lt;ref name="address"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/contact/ncra-pune NCRA Address]&lt;/ref&gt; (just beside [[IUCAA]]), is part of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]], [[Mumbai]], India. NCRA has an active [[research]] program in many areas of [[Astronomy]] and [[Astrophysics]], which includes studies of the [[Sun]], [[Interplanetary scintillation]]s, [[pulsar]]s, the [[Interstellar medium]], [[Active galaxies]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and particularly in the specialized field of Radio Astronomy and Radio [[instrumentation]]. NCRA also provides exciting opportunities and challenges in [[engineering]] fields such as [[Analogue electronics|Analog]] and [[Digital Electronics]], [[Signal Processing]], [[Antenna (radio)|Antenna]] Design, [[Telecommunication|Communication]] and [[Software Development]]. 
NCRA has set up the [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT), the world's largest [[telescope]] operating at meter [[wavelength]]s located at [[Khodad]], 80&amp;nbsp;km from [[Pune]]. NCRA also operates the [[Ooty Radio Telescope]] (ORT), which is a large Cylindrical Telescope located near [[Udhagamandalam]], India.&lt;ref name="home_page"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra NCRA Website Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{coord|19.10000|74.05000|type:edu_source:USNO/HMNAO|display=title}}

==History==
The Centre has its roots in the [[Radio Astronomy]] Group of [[TIFR]], set up in the early 1960s under the leadership of [[Govind Swarup]]. The group designed and built the Ooty Radio Telescope. In the early 80's an ambitious plan for a new telescope was proposed - the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Since the site chosen for this new telescope was close to Pune, a new home for the group was built in the scenic campus of Pune University. The radio astronomy group morphed into the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics around this time.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/ncra1/history A brief history of NCRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913032757/http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/ncra1/history |date=13 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (NCRA-TIFR) is the premier institute for radio astronomy in India, and one of the best in this field in the world. Research activities at NCRA-TIFR are centered on low frequency radio astronomy, with research in a wide range of areas, including [[solar physics]], [[pulsars]], [[active galactic nuclei]], the interstellar medium, [[supernova remnants]], the [[Galactic Centre]], nearby [[galaxies]], high-[[redshift]] galaxies, Fundamental Constant Evolution, and the [[epoch of reionization]].  NCRA-TIFR has built and operates the largest steerable [[radio telescope]] in the world, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, as well as the Ooty Radio Telescope, and work at the frontiers of astronomy and astrophysics, as well as in instrumentation development.&lt;ref name="ncra_research"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/research/research-at-ncra-tifr-1 NCRA Research Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="details_research"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/research A Details Description of NCRA Research Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Facilities==
Research facilities of NCRA includes a well-furnished Library both at NCRA and GMRT, Computing Facilities, Radio Physics Laboratory(A joint initiative of NCRA-TIFR and IUCAA) and above all two radio telescopes GMRT and ORT.

===[[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT)===
NCRA has set up a unique facility for radio astronomical research using the metrewavelengths range of the [[Radio wave|radio spectrum]], known as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), it is located at a site about 80&amp;nbsp;km north of Pune. GMRT consists of 30 fully steerable gigantic parabolic dishes of 45m diameter each spread over distances of up to 25&amp;nbsp;km. GMRT is one of the most challenging experimental programmes in basic sciences undertaken by Indian scientists and engineers. GMRT is a unique instrument which opens up the [[sky]] at the Metrewave range of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum]] and using the technique of [[Aperture synthesis]] allows to make high sensitive maps of the sky.&lt;ref name="gmrt"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/gmrt/about-gmrt/introducing-gmrt-1 Introducing GMRT]&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is at par with other radio telescopes in the world like the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] in terms of resolution. It complements VLA at the metre-wavelengths.

===[[Ooty Radio Telescope]] (ORT)===
The Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT, as it is known) is a [[cylindrical]] [[paraboloid]] of reflecting surface, 530 m long and 30 m wide, placed on a hill whose slope of about 11 degree in the north-south direction which is the same as the latitude of the location of ORT. This makes it possible to track [[celestial objects]] for about 10 hours continuously from their rising in east to their setting in the west by simply rotating the antenna mechanically along its long axis.The telescope is operated at 326.5&amp;nbsp;MHz (a [[wavelength]] of 0.92 m) with 15&amp;nbsp;MHz usable [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. The large size of the telescope makes it highly sensitive. It has been designed and fabricated fully indigenously.&lt;ref name="ort"&gt;[http://rac.ncra.tifr.res.in/ort.html Radio Astronomy Centre, Ooty]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Engineering Laboratory''' ('''NEL''') was originally one of several large government-funded public research laboratories in the UK, staffed by scientists and engineers of the [[British Civil Service|Scientific Civil Service]].  Other such laboratories include the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL), the [[Laboratory of the Government Chemist]] (LGC), the [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) and the [[Transport Research Laboratory|Transport Research Establishment]] (TRL).

NEL was established in 1948 at [[Thorntonhall]] under the name Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory (MERL), in the village of the same name near [[East Kilbride]], Glasgow, Scotland.   The location was partly dictated by politics, since it was realised that Scotland did not have a UK public research establishment (in contrast to its [[Military of Scotland#Sensitive establishments|defence establishments]]).  There was also debate on whether the new laboratory would be an outpost of the prestigious NPL (which now has its main base in Teddington, just west of London), or have a separate identity.  Eventually the latter course was taken with the new laboratory focussing on mechanical engineering research, complementing the work of the then [[CEGB]] laboratories in [[electrical engineering]] when the name was changed to NEL.

As NEL expanded, it moved to a large, purpose-built site in East Kilbride itself.  Under the control of the Director, it was then part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]]. The 'lab' was organised into a number of subject-based divisions, including Creep Division, an important part of the UK effort to catalogue wear characteristics of materials, a Control Systems Division, Manufacturing Services Division, Fluid Power Division and Design Analysis Division.   The last of these was in the forefront in the use of the emerging technology of [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA).   Indeed, the growing need for quality-assurance in FEA led to the foundation of the ''National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards'', now operating simply as [[NAFEMS]].

Each building at NEL was named after a prominent engineer whose field was related to the focus of that division, so there was Maudsley Building, named after [[Henry Maudslay]], famous for his invention of the [[slide-rest lathe]] amongst many other achievements, Bramah Building so called after [[Joseph Bramah]] owing to his contribution to hydraulic engineering, Rankine Building named after [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] which specialised in [[thermodynamics]], Whitworth Building named after [[Joseph Whitworth]] immortalised after his work to unify standards for screw threads, one of the key stepping stones that paved the way for mass production.

The policy of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] Government was originally for the full [[privatisation]] of all of the government laboratories and the dismantling of NEL was undertaken by [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|Lord Young]]. In practice, re-organisation has in some cases stopped short of a straight sale of these internationally important facilities, but NEL became part of the German-owned [[TÜV SÜD]] group in 1995. Along with the other national laboratories, some of which are still owned or controlled by the UK government, NEL now has a mixed portfolio of work from both government and private sectors. NEL holds the national standard for flow measurement, one of the most important roles it undertakes as part of the overall UK government science strategy.  This is now in the remit of the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]], working in part through the new [[National Measurement Office]], which is itself an Executive Agency created in April 2009.

==Engineering apprenticeships==

NEL operated an [[indentured]] apprentice training scheme and offered a wide range of skills for young engineers before being privatised ranging between light machining, heavy machining, fitting, electro-discharge-machining, jig and horizontal boring and in later years CNC machining, programming and introductions to FMS ([[flexible manufacturing system]]) and [[CAD/CAM]] facilities running KCurve on DEC/VAX mini computers. This work commenced around 1982-6 using raster scan, (green) monitors to visualise the programming, each known as workstations, (since the 'intelligence' was built into the desk, not the monitor) and the CAD CAM programs were still printed out on punched paper to be transferred in some cases into onboard RAM and in others read and implemented sequentially. Machines in use in the CAD / CAM department were Matchmaker 7000M vertical mill, Norton Variant with Fanuc control, Cincinnati horizontal mill that had (then) been recently retrofitted with Gould drives.

This project operates in several European countries (England, Scotland, France, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Ireland and the Netherlands) covering 10 different languages (Portuguese, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Estonian, Greek, Turkish and Arabic).

'''Native Explores''': this project brings pupils to labs or museums. The first events happened at Lancaster University &lt;ref&gt;[https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/native-scientist-lancaster/schedule/ Native Explorers at Lancaster University]&lt;/ref&gt;, King's College London &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/newsevents/newsrecords/2018/june/language-of-science-crosses-borders.aspx King's College London's News]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dynamic Earth, in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nativescientist.com/single-post/2018/06/03/Native-Scientist-explores-the-Origin-of-the-Universe-at-Dynamic-Earth Blog: Native Scientist explores the Origin of the Universe at Dynamic Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native Books''': launched in December 2016, it aims at creating educational resources authored by scientists, which can be used by teachers and parents to promote science and language learning. The first edition is in Portuguese &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nativescientist.com/native-books Uma volta ao mundo com cientistas portugueses]&lt;/ref&gt; and the second one in German. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nativescientist.com/scientistsarehumantoo Wissenschaftler sind auch nur Menschen]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native Aware''': a collection of interviews to raise awareness about the benefits and challenges of being multilingual. &lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/6c3fe4_4a857c3319614facae83aff0ff76625e.pdf Q&amp;A Native Aware]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Natura naturata''''' is a [[Latin]] term coined in the Middle Ages, mainly used later by [[Baruch Spinoza]] meaning "Nature natured", or "Nature already created".  The term adds the suffix for the Latin feminine [[past participle]] (''-ata'') to the verb ''naturo'', to create "natur'''ed'''".  The term describes a passive God, or more specifically, the passivity of God (substance) when it is predicated into modes, and is contrasted with the second part of Spinoza's dichotomy, ''[[natura naturans]]'', meaning "nature naturing", or "nature in the active sense". 

The distinction is expressed in Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[B]y ''Natura naturans'' we must understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''or'' such attributes of substance as express an eternal and infinite essence, that is … God, insofar as he is considered as a free cause. &lt;br&gt; But by ''Natura naturata'' I understand whatever follows from the necessity of God's nature, ''or'' from God's attributes, that is, all the modes of God's attributes insofar as they are considered as things which are in God, and can neither be nor be conceived without God.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Prop. 29, Scholium. Trans: Edwin Curley.  London: Penguin, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24912">'''New literacies''' generally are new forms of [[literacy]] made possible by [[digital technology]] developments, although new literacies do not necessarily have to involve use of digital technologies to be recognized as such. The term "new literacies" itself is relatively new within the field of literacy studies (the first documented mention of it in an academic article title dates to 1993 in a text by David Buckingham).&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, D. (1993) Towards new literacies, information technology, English and media education. ''The English and Media Magazine,'' Summer, pp. 20–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition remains open, with new literacies being conceptualized in different ways by different groups of scholars.

For example, one group of scholars argues that literacy is now [[deictic]], and see it as continually and rapidly changing as new technologies appear and new social practices for literacy emerge. (Leu, 2000). This group aims at developing a single, overarching theory to help explain new literacies (see, for example, Leu, O'Byrne, Zawilinski, McVerry, &amp; Everett-Cacopardo, 2009; see also, below). This orientation towards new literacies is largely psycholinguistic in nature. Other groups of scholars follow a more sociocultural orientation that focuses on literacy as a social practice, which emphasizes the role of literacy with a range of socially patterned and goal-directed ways of getting things done in the world (see, for example, Gee &amp; Hayes, 2012; Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2011; Kalantzis and Cope 2011).

Accompanying the varying conceptualizations of new literacies, there are a range of terms used by different researchers when referring to new literacies, including ''21st century literacies'', ''internet literacies'', ''[[digital literacy|digital literacies]]'', ''new [[Media literacy|media literacies]]'', ''multiliteracies'', ''[[information literacy]]'', ''ICT literacies'', and ''[[computer literacy]]''. In the ''Handbook of New Literacies Research'', Coiro, [[Michele Knobel|Knobel]], [[Colin Lankshear|Lankshear]], and Leu (2008) note that all these terms "are used to refer to phenomena we would see as falling broadly under a new literacies umbrella" (pg. 10).&lt;ref&gt;Coiro, J., Knobel, M., Lankshear, C., &amp; Leu, D. J. (2008). Central issues in new literacies and new literacies research. In J. Coiro, M. Knobel, C. Lankshear, &amp; D. J. Leu (Eds.), ''Handbook of new literacies research'' (pp. 1–22). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly recognized examples of new literacies include such practices as [[instant messaging]], [[blog]]ging, maintaining a [[website]], participating in online [[Social network service|social networking]] spaces, creating and sharing [[music video]]s, [[podcast]]ing and videocasting, photoshopping images and [[photo sharing]], [[E-mail|emailing]], shopping online, [[digital storytelling]], participating in [[online discussion]] lists, emailing and using [[online chat]], conducting and collating online searches, reading, writing and commenting on [[fan fiction]], collaborating on and writing encyclopedic wikis, processing and evaluating online information, creating and sharing [[Mashup (digital)|digital mashups]], etc. (see: Black, 2008; Coiro, 2003; Gee, 2007; Hunter, 2014; Jenkins, 2006; Kist, 2007; Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2006; Lessig, 2005; Leu, et al. 2004; Prensky, 2006).

==Definitions: at least two 'camps'==
The field of new literacies is characterized by two theoretically distinct approaches that overlap to some extent. One is informed by cognitive and language processing theories such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[Schema (psychology)|schema theory]], [[metacognition]], [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], and other similar theories. This orientation includes a particular focus on examining the cognitive and social processes involved in comprehending online or digital texts (see for example: Leu, 2001; [http://www.readingonline.org/newliteracies/leu/ Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, &amp; Cammack, 2004]; Coiro, 2003; Coiro &amp; Dobler, 2007). Donald Leu, a prominent researcher in the field of new literacies, has outlined four defining characteristics of new literacies, according to a largely [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic orientation]] (see: Leu et al., 2007). First, new technologies (such as the internet) and the novel literacy tasks that pertain to these new technologies require new skills and strategies to effectively use them. Second, new literacies are a critical component of full participation—civic, economic, and personal—in our increasingly global society. A third component to this approach is new literacies are ''deictic''—that is, they change regularly as new technology emerges and older technologies fade away. With this in mind, "what may be important in reading instruction and literacy education is not to teach any single set of new literacies, but rather to teach students how to learn continuously new literacies that will appear during their lifetime."&lt;ref name=Leu/&gt;{{rp|43}} Finally, new literacies are "multiple, multimodal, and multifaceted," and as such, multiple points of view will be most beneficial in attempting to comprehensively analyze them.&lt;ref name=Leu/&gt;{{rp|43}} This orientation makes a distinction between "New Literacies" and "new literacies" theories. Lower case theories are better able to keep up with the rapidly changing nature of literacy in a deictic world since they are closer to the specific types of changes that are taking place and interest those who study them within a particular heuristic. Lower case theories also permit the field to maximize the lenses that are used and the technologies and contexts that are studied. This position argues that every scholar who studies new literacy issues is generating important insights for everyone else, even if they do not share a particular lens, technology, or context; and that this requires a second level of theorising. New Literacies (capitalized), it is argued, is a broader, more inclusive concept, and includes common findings emerging across multiple, lower case theories.  New Literacies theory benefits from work taking place in the multiple, lower case dimensions of new literacies by looking for what appear to be the most common and consistent patterns being found in lower case theories and lines of research. This approach permits everyone to fully explore their unique, lowercase perspective of new literacies, allowing scholars to maintain close focus on many different aspects of the rapidly shifting landscape of literacy during a period of rapid change.  At the same time, each also benefits from expanding their understanding of other, lowercase, new literacies perspectives. By assuming change in the model, everyone is open to a continuously changing definition of literacy, based on the most recent data that emerges consistently, across multiple perspectives, disciplines, and research traditions. Moreover, areas in which alternative findings emerge are identified, enabling each to be studied again, from multiple perspectives.  From this process, common patterns emerge and are included in a broader, common, New Literacies theory. From this orientation, proponents argue, this process enables a particular theorization of New Literacies to keep up with consistent elements that will always define literacy on the Internet while it also informs each of the lower case theories of new literacies with patterns that are being regularly found by others.

The second approach to studying new literacies is overtly grounded in a focus on social practices. According to [[Colin Lankshear]] and [[Michele Knobel]] from this "social practice" perspectives, "new literacies" can refer to "new socially recognized ways of generating, communicating and negotiating meaningful content through the medium of encoded texts within contexts of participation in [[Discourse]]s (or, as members of Discourses) ".&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2006). New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning  (2nd ed.). pg. 65. New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective "new" refers to the presence of two dominant features of contemporary [[literacy]] practices. The first is the use of digital technologies as the means of producing, sharing, accessing and interacting with meaningful content. New literacies typically involve screens and pixels rather than paper and type, and digital code (that renders texts as image, sound, conventional text, and any combination of these within a single process) rather than material print. The second defining feature of new literacies is their highly collaborative, distributed, and participatory nature, as expressions of what [[Henry Jenkins]]&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2006). Fans, bloggers and gamers: Exploring participatory culture. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; calls engagement in [[participatory culture]], and Lankshear and Knobel&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2006). New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning  (2nd ed.). New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to as a distinctive ''ethos''.

==Research in new literacies==
Research within the field of new literacies is also diverse. A wide range of topics and issues are focused upon, and a broad range of methodologies are used.

===Online research and comprehension===
One aspect of new literacies that has attracted researchers' attention is school-age children's online research and comprehension. Specifically, researchers are interested in finding the answers to questions such as how reading online differs from traditional print-based reading. Donald Leu, Julie Coiro, Jill Castek, Laurie Henry, and others attempt to understand how students become adept at reading online to learn and how students acquire the necessary skills, strategies, and dispositions required to do so. Initial work in this area referred to online reading comprehension&lt;ref name=Leu&gt;Leu, D. J., &amp; Zawilinski, L., Castek, J., Banerjee, M., Housand, B. C., Liu, Y., &amp; O'Neil, M. (2007). What is new About the new literacies of online reading comprehension?. In Secondary School Literacy: What Research Reveals for Classroom Practice (Chapter 3, pp. 37–68). Retrieved from http://teachers.westport.k12.ct.us/ITL/wkspmaterials/NCTE%20chapter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, the construct "online research and comprehension" is being used since this more precisely describes the type of reading being described in their work.&lt;ref name=Leu2&gt;Leu, D. J., Kinzer, C. K., Coiro, J., Castek, J., Henry, L. A. (2013). New literacies: A dual level theory of the changing nature of literacy, instruction, and assessment. In Alvermann, D.E., Unrau, N.J., &amp; Ruddell, R.B. (Eds.). (2013). Theoretical models and processes of reading (6th ed.). (pp. 1150-1181). Newark, DE: International Reading Association. Available at: http://www.reading.org/Libraries/books/IRA-710-chapter42.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leu and colleagues, the new literacies of online research and comprehension is a process of problem-based inquiry using information on the Internet. It includes the skills, strategies, dispositions, and social practices that take place as we read online information to learn and is based around five practices: "At least five processing practices occur during online research and comprehension: (1) reading to identify important questions, (2) reading to locate information, (3) reading to evaluate information critically, (4) reading to synthesize information, and (5) reading to communicate information. Within these five practices reside the skills, strategies, and dispositions that are distinctive to online reading comprehension as well as to others that are also important for offline reading comprehension (Leu, Reinking, et al., 2007)."&lt;ref name=Leu2/&gt;{{rp|1164}}

===Online fan fiction and adolescents===
Recent research in the field of new literacies has focused on [[fan fiction]] on the internet, especially those stories published online by adolescents (see for example: Black, 2008; Thomas, 2007; Jenkins, 2006). Online fan fiction websites, such as [[FanFiction.Net]], are spaces where fans of all ages, but especially adolescents and younger school-age fans, are able to use these new [[information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) to write and craft fictional stories based on their favorite characters in popular media such as movies, television, and graphic novels. Adolescents are participating more and more on these kinds of sites, not only engaging with "pop culture and media, but also with a broad array of literate activities that are aligned with many school-based literacy practices"&lt;ref&gt;Black, R. W. (2007). Digital design: English language learners and reader reviews in online fiction. In M. Knobel &amp; C. Lankshear (Eds.), ''A New Literacies Sampler,'' pp. 115–136. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, adults are just as able to spend time in such online environments—and they do. However, it is interesting to consider that young people were born into a digitally rich world, and thus could be seen as "digital natives", and therefore interact with the online environment in a fundamentally distinct way than an older generation of people, so-called "digital immigrants".&lt;ref name=Hansford&gt;Adlington, R., &amp; Hansford, D. (2009). Digital spaces and young people's online authoring: Challenges for teachers. ''Australian journal of language and literacy, 32''(1, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; As digital natives, adolescents "use the online world to share, evaluate, create, report and program with each other differently to digital immigrants," and they engage easily and readily with new digital technologies such as instant messaging, file sharing songs and videos, and post all kinds of 'texts', stories, photos, and videos among them.&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt; A central characteristic of digital natives is their "desire to create."&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt; Digital natives are engaged in "programming to some extent, whether it be by including a piece of HTML code that personalizes a MySpace page or creating a Flash animation. They are creating web pages, blogs, avatars and worlds; and, in stark contrast to digital immigrants, digital natives readily report and share their ideas."&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt;

===Video games===
[[James Paul Gee]] described [[Video game|video gaming]] as a new literacy "in virtue of the ways game design involves a multimodal code comprising images, actions, words, sounds, and movements that players interpret according to gaming conventions".&lt;ref&gt;Coiro, J., Knobel, M., Lankshear, C., &amp; Leu, D. J. (Eds.) (2008). ''Handbook of new literacies research'' (pp. 251). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Gee notes that game players participate in their game's world as a form of social practice, especially in real-time [[Strategy video game|strategy games]] in which players can compete with each other to build on land masses, for instance, and in which they can shape and convey their virtual identities as a certain kind of strategist. Video games continue to use new digital technologies to create the symbols players interpret to encode and decode the meanings that constitute the game.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, J. P. (2008). ''What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy, revised and updated''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Many ways in which students learn literacies, increasingly, are happening outside of school rather than inside of school.

Other researchers have expanded the body of knowledge about video games as a new literacy, particularly as they relate to classroom learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerber|first=H. R.|title=From the FPS to the RPG: Using Video Games to encourage reading YAL|journal=The ALAN Review|year=2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Squire&gt;{{cite book|last=Squire|first=Kurt|title=Video Games and Learning: Teaching and Participatory Culture in the Digital Age|year=2011|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see for example: Lacasa, Martinez, &amp; Mendez, 2008; Sanford &amp; Madill, 2007). In one study,&lt;ref name=Lacasa&gt;Lacasa, P., Martinez, R., &amp; Mendez, L. (2008). Developing new literacies using commercial videogames as educational tools. ''Linguistics and Education, 19.''&lt;/ref&gt; researchers examined how video games, supported by discussions and dramatic performances in the classroom, can contribute to the development of narrative thought as demonstrated in written compositions in various contexts. Namely, the researchers engaged primary school children in activities designed to teach them to tell, play out, and write stories based on the most popular video game in their classroom, ''[[Tomb Raider]]''. Although it was a challenging process at times, researchers discovered that the use of new digital media such as video games actually "complements the use of other written or audiovisual methods [in the classroom] and permits the development of multiple literacies in the classroom."&lt;ref name=Lacasa/&gt;{{rp|103}}

==The classroom==
It has become clear to many researchers in the field that new literacies research has important implications for the classroom. Kist (2007), for example, observes how new literacies can be used in classroom settings—from the use of rap music to anime to digital storytelling, there are already instances of teachers attempting to blend new literacies with traditional literacy practices in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Kist&gt;Kist, W. (2007). Basement new literacies: Dialogue with a first-year teacher. ''English Journal, 97''(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Kist asks: "Can new literacies indeed 'fit' into how we currently 'do' school?" Kist notes that "the new literacies instruction that does exist often comes only out of the fortitude of lonely pioneers of new literacies."&lt;ref name=Kist/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Knobel and Lankshear (2011) argue that if educators and prospective teachers engage in blogging, or participate in "[[affinity spaces]]" devoted to practices like fan fiction, video game-playing, music and video remixing, photosharing, and the like, they will better understand how new literacies can better be integrated into worthwhile classroom learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2011). ''New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning'' (3rd ed.). pg. 255. New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leu, Coiro, Castek, Hartman, Henry and Reinking (2008) have begun to explore the use of a modified instructional model of reciprocal teaching that reflects some of the differences between offline and online reading contexts. In an instructional model known as Internet Reciprocal Teaching, each student has his/her own laptop with access to the Internet and students work in small groups to facilitate interactive group work and discussions about strategy use.  In addition, Internet Reciprocal Teaching with online informational resources (as opposed to narrative texts) and strategy instruction on both the common and unique processes by which students navigate through multiple and different texts, rather than the reading of one common text. Teachers and students model their choices about which links are most relevant to a group or individual question through think-alouds. They discuss how to efficiently locate information within different kinds of websites, how to synthesize ideas across multiple texts and media, how to make judgments about the quality of the information and the author's level of expertise, and how to best represent the answers to their questions. Responsibility for monitoring and effectively using these strategies to solve online information problems is gradually released to the students  using an instructional scheme with three phases: Phase 1 includes direct, whole class instruction of basic skills and strategies of Internet use; Phase 2 includes group work and the reciprocal exchange of online reading comprehension strategies by students with their peers; and Phase 3 includes online individual inquiry units, sometimes with collaborative efforts involving other students in other classes, perhaps even in other parts of the world, and periodic strategy sessions with groups.&lt;ref&gt;Leu, D. J. Jr., Coiro, J., Castek, J., Hartman, D. K., Henry, L. A., &amp; Reinking, D. (2008). Research on instruction and assessment of the new literacies of online reading comprehension. In C. C. Block, S. Parris, and P. Afflerbach, (Eds.), Comprehension instruction: Research based best practices. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students "are the first generation to be global publishers to access the raw material of information and to create refined knowledge products for application.  They understand the social skills of working with people who they will never meet face to face.  They also understand that they need to take more responsibility for managing their own learning.  They do not see the boundaries of school as a solid wall.  They see school as a global communications center."

'''New media''' are forms of media that are native to computers, computational and relying on computers for redistribution. Some examples of new media are [[telephone]]s, [[computer]]s, [[virtual world]]s, [[single media]], [[website games]], [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interface]], [[computer animation]] and [[New media art|interactive computer installations]].&lt;ref name="Manovich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/11661|title=Designing Learning Tools. Methodological Insights.|last=Leinonen|first=Teemu|publisher=Aalto University School of Art and Design|year=2010|isbn=978-952-60-0031-2|location=Helsinki|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New media are often contrasted to "[[old media]]", such as television, radio, and print media, although scholars in communication and media studies have criticised rigid distinctions based on oldness and novelty. New media does not include [[television program]]s (only analog broadcast), feature films, [[magazine]]s, [[book]]s, &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; unless they contain technologies that enable digital generative or interactive processes.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;Manovich, Lev. "New Media From Borges to HTML." ''The New Media Reader.'' Ed. Noah Wardrip-Fruin &amp; Nick Montfort. Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2003. 13-25. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia, is a good example of New Media, combining [[Internet]] accessible digital text, images and video with web-links, creative participation of contributors, interactive feedback of users and formation of a participant community of editors and donors for the benefit of non-community readers. [[Facebook]] is another type of New Media, belonging to the category of [[social media]] model, in which most users are also participants. Another type of New Media is [[Twitter]] which also belongs to the social media category, through which users interact with one another and make announcements to which the public receive. Both Facebook and Twitter have risen in usage in recent years and have become an online resource for acquiring information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/the-evolving-role-of-news-on-twitter-and-facebook/|title=The Evolving Role of News on Twitter and Facebook|date=2015-07-14|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1950s, connections between computing and radical art began to grow stronger. It was not until the 1980s that [[Alan Kay]] and his co-workers at [[Xerox PARC]] began to give the [[computability]] of a [[personal computer]] to the individual, rather than have a big organization be in charge of this. "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, we seem to witness a different kind of parallel relationship between social changes and [[computer design]]. Although causally unrelated, conceptually it makes sense that the [[Cold War]] and the design of the Web took place at exactly the same time."&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;

Writers and philosophers such as [[Marshall McLuhan]] were instrumental in the development of [[media theory]] during this period. His now famous declaration in ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) that "[[the medium is the message]]" drew attention to the too often ignored influence media and technology themselves, rather than their "content," have on humans' experience of the world and on society broadly.

Until the 1980s [[media (communication)|media]] relied primarily upon print and [[analog signal|analog]] [[broadcast]] models, such as those of [[television]] and [[radio]]. The last twenty-five years have seen the rapid transformation into media which are predicated upon the use of digital technologies, such as the [[Internet]] and [[video game]]s. However, these examples are only a small representation of new media. The use of [[digital computer]]s has transformed the remaining 'old' media, as suggested by the advent of [[digital television]] and [[online publication]]s. Even traditional media forms such as the printing press have been transformed through the application of technologies such as [[image manipulation]] software like [[Adobe Photoshop]] and desktop publishing tools.

[[Andrew L. Shapiro]] (1999) argues that the "emergence of new, digital technologies signals a potentially radical shift of who is in control of information, experience and resources" (Shapiro cited in Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 322). [[W. Russell Neuman]] (1991) suggests that whilst the "new media" have technical capabilities to pull in one direction, economic and social forces pull back in the opposite direction. According to Neuman, "We are witnessing the evolution of a universal interconnected network of audio, video, and electronic text communications that will blur the distinction between interpersonal and mass communication and between public and private communication" (Neuman cited in Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 322). Neuman argues that new media will:
*Alter the meaning of geographic distance.
*Allow for a huge increase in the volume of [[communication]].
*Provide the possibility of increasing the speed of communication.
*Provide opportunities for interactive communication.
*Allow forms of communication that were previously separate to overlap and interconnect.

Consequently, it has been the contention of scholars such as [[Douglas Kellner]] and [[James Bohman]] that new media, and particularly the Internet, provide the potential for a democratic [[postmodern]] public sphere, in which citizens can participate in well informed, non-hierarchical debate pertaining to their social structures. Contradicting these positive appraisals of the potential social impacts of new media are scholars such as Ed Herman and [[Robert D. McChesney|Robert McChesney]] who have suggested that the transition to new media has seen a handful of powerful [[International|transnational]] [[telecommunication]]s corporations who achieve a level of global influence which was hitherto unimaginable.

Scholars, such as Lister et al. (2003), have highlighted both the positive and negative potential and actual implications of new media technologies, suggesting that some of the early work into new media studies was guilty of technological [[determinism]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; whereby the effects of media were determined by the technology themselves, rather than through tracing the complex social networks which governed the development, funding, implementation and future development of any technology.

Based on the argument that people have a limited amount of time to spend on the consumption of different media, Displacement theory argue that the viewership or readership of one particular outlet leads to the reduction in the amount of time spent by the individual on another. The introduction of New Media, such as the internet, therefore reduces the amount of time individuals would spend on existing "Old" Media, which could ultimately lead to the end of such traditional media.&lt;ref name="Dimmick"&gt;Dimmick, J., Chen, Y., &amp; Li, Z. (2004). Competition between the internet and traditional news media: The gratification-opportunities niche dimension. Journal of Media Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although there are several ways that New Media may be described, Lev Manovich, in an introduction to ''The New Media Reader'', defines New Media by using eight propositions:&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;
#'''New Media versus [[Cyberculture]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Cyberculture is the various social phenomena that are associated with the Internet and network communications (blogs, online multi-player gaming), whereas New Media is concerned more with cultural objects and paradigms (digital to analog television, iPhones).
#'''New Media as Computer Technology Used as a Distribution Platform'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Media are the cultural objects which use digital computer technology for distribution and exhibition. e.g. (at least for now) Internet, Web sites, computer multimedia, Blu-ray disks etc. The problem with this is that the definition must be revised every few years. The term "new media" will not be "new" anymore, as most forms of culture will be distributed through computers.
#'''New Media as Digital Data Controlled by Software'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The language of New Media is based on the assumption that, in fact, all cultural objects that rely on digital representation and computer-based delivery do share a number of common qualities. New media is reduced to digital data that can be manipulated by software as any other data. Now media operations can create several versions of the same object. An example is an image stored as matrix data which can be manipulated and altered according to the additional algorithms implemented, such as color inversion, gray-scaling, sharpening, rasterizing, etc.
#'''New Media as the Mix Between Existing Cultural Conventions and the Conventions of Software'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Media today can be understood as the mix between older cultural conventions for data representation, access, and manipulation and newer conventions of data representation, access, and manipulation. The "old" data are representations of visual reality and human experience, and the "new" data is numerical data. The computer is kept out of the key "creative" decisions, and is delegated to the position of a technician. e.g. In film, software is used in some areas of production, in others are created using computer animation.
#'''New Media as the [[Aesthetics]] that Accompanies the Early Stage of Every New Modern Media and Communication Technology'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; While ideological tropes indeed seem to be reappearing rather regularly, many aesthetic strategies may reappear two or three times ... In order for this approach to be truly useful it would be insufficient to simply name the strategies and tropes and to record the moments of their appearance; instead, we would have to develop a much more comprehensive analysis which would correlate the history of technology with social, political, and economical histories or the modern period.
#'''New Media as Faster Execution of [[Algorithms]] Previously Executed Manually or through Other Technologies'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Computers are a huge speed-up of what were previously manual techniques. e.g. calculators. Dramatically speeding up the execution makes possible previously non-existent representational technique. This also makes possible of many new forms of media art such as interactive multimedia and video games. On one level, a modern digital computer is just a faster calculator, we should not ignore its other identity: that of a cybernetic control device.
#'''New Media as the Encoding of Modernist [[Avant-Garde]]; New Media as Metamedia'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Manovich declares that the 1920s are more relevant to New Media than any other time period. [[Metamedia]] coincides with [[postmodernism]] in that they both rework old work rather than create new work. New media avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information (e.g. hypermedia, databases, search engines, etc.). Meta-media is an example of how quantity can change into quality as in new media technology and manipulation techniques can recode modernist aesthetics into a very different postmodern aesthetics.
#'''New Media as Parallel Articulation of Similar Ideas in Post-WWII Art and Modern Computing'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Post WWII Art or "combinatorics" involves creating images by systematically changing a single parameter. This leads to the creation of remarkably similar images and spatial structures. This illustrates that algorithms, this essential part of new media, do not depend on technology, but can be executed by humans.

==Globalization==
The rise of new media has increased communication between people all over the world and the Internet. It has allowed people to express themselves through blogs, websites, videos, pictures, and other user-generated media.

[[Terry Flew|Flew]] (2002) stated that, "as a result of the evolution of new media technologies, [[globalization]] occurs." Globalization is generally stated as "more than expansion of activities beyond the boundaries of particular nation states".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John B. (1995). ''The Media and Modernity''. Cambridge: Polity Press, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization shortens the distance between people all over the world by the electronic communication (Carely 1992 in Flew 2002) and Cairncross (1998) expresses this great development as the "death of distance". New media "radically break the connection between physical place and social place, making physical location much less significant for our social relationships" (Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 311).

However, the changes in the new media environment create a series of tensions in the concept of "public sphere".&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, "Building Media's industry while promoting community of values in the globalisation", Politické Vedy, Journal of International Affairs, Policy and Security, 2/2011, http://www.fpvmv.umb.sk/politickevedy&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ingrid Volkmer, "public sphere" is defined as a process through which public communication becomes restructured and partly disembedded from national political and cultural institutions. This trend of the globalized public sphere is not only as a geographical expansion form a nation to worldwide, but also changes the relationship between the public, the media and state (Volkmer, 1999:123).&lt;ref&gt;Volkmer, Ingrid (1999) News in the Global Sphere. A Study of [[CNN]] and its impact on [[Global Communication]], Luton: University of Luton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Virtual communities]]" are being established online and transcend geographical boundaries, eliminating social restrictions.&lt;ref name="DeFleur 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeFleur|first=Everette E. Dennis, Melvin L.|title=Understanding media in the digital age : connections for communication, society, and culture|year=2010|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=New York|isbn=0205595820}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Rheingold]] (2000) describes these globalised societies as self-defined networks, which resemble what we do in real life. "People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange pleasantries and argue, engage in intellectual discourse, conduct commerce, make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, create a little high art and a lot of idle talk" (Rheingold cited in Slevin 2000: 91). For [[Sherry Turkle]] "making the computer into a second self, finding a soul in the machine, can substitute for human relationships" (Holmes 2005: 184). New media has the ability to connect like-minded others worldwide.

While this perspective suggests that the technology drives&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and therefore is a determining factor&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in the process of globalization, arguments involving [[technological determinism]] are generally frowned upon by mainstream media studies.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond (1974) 'Television: Technology and Cultural Form, London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durham, M &amp; Kellner, Douglas (2001) Media and Cultural Studies Keyworks, Malden, Ma and Oxford, UK, Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lister, Martin, Dovey, Jon, Giddings, Seth. Grant, Iain. &amp; Kelly, Kieran (2003) "New Media: A Critical Introduction", London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Instead academics focus on the multiplicity of processes by which technology is funded, researched and produced, forming a feedback loop when the technologies are used and often transformed by their users, which then feeds into the process of guiding their future development.

While commentators such as [[Manuel Castells|Castells]]&lt;ref name="Castells, Manuel 1996"&gt;Castells, Manuel, (1996) Rise of the Network Society, The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture volume 1, Massachusetts, Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; espouse a "soft determinism"&lt;ref&gt;Lister, Martin, Dovey, Jon, Giddins, Seth. Grant, Iain. &amp; Kelly, Kieran (2003) New Media: A Critical Introduction, London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; whereby they contend that "Technology does not determine society. Nor does society script the course of technological change, since many factors, including individual inventiveness and entrpreneurialism, intervene in the process of scientific discovery, technical innovation and social applications, so the final outcome depends on a complex pattern of interaction. Indeed the dilemma of technological determinism is probably a false problem, since technology is society and society cannot be understood without its technological tools." (Castells 1996:5) This, however, is still distinct from stating that societal changes are instigated by technological development, which recalls the theses of [[Marshall McLuhan]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1962) The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man, London, Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, Toronto, McGraw Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

Manovich&lt;ref&gt;Manovich, Lev (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' [[MIT Press]], Cambridge and London&lt;/ref&gt; and Castells&lt;ref name="Castells, Manuel 1996"/&gt; have argued that whereas mass media "corresponded to the logic of industrial mass society, which values conformity over individuality," (Manovich 2001:41) new media follows the logic of the postindustrial or globalized society whereby "every citizen can construct her own custom lifestyle and select her ideology from a large number of choices. Rather than pushing the same objects to a mass audience, marketing now tries to target each individual separately." (Manovich 2001:42).

==As tool for social change==
[[Social movement]] media has a rich and storied history ''(see [[Agitprop]])'' that has changed at a rapid rate since New Media became widely used.&lt;ref name="Atton 2003"&gt;[[Chris Atton|Atton, Chris]] "Reshaping Social Movement Media for a New Millennium." Social Movement Studies, 2, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] of [[Chiapas]], Mexico were the first major movement to make widely recognized and effective use of New Media for communiques and organizing in 1994.&lt;ref name="Atton 2003" /&gt; Since then, New Media has been used extensively by social movements to educate, organize, share cultural products of movements, communicate, coalition build, and more. The [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity]] was another landmark in the use of New Media as a tool for social change. The WTO protests used media to organize the original action, communicate with and educate participants, and was used as an alternative media source.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, television, "Will the Revolution be Cybercast?"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indymedia]] movement also developed out of this action, and has been a great tool in the democratization of information, which is another widely discussed aspect of new media movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas, "New Technologies, TechnoCities, and the Prospects for Democratization"&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars even view this democratization as an indication of the creation of a "radical, socio-technical paradigm to challenge the dominant, neoliberal and technologically determinist model of information and communication technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paschal "Reshaping Communications: Technology, Information and Social Change," London:Sage, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical view along these same lines is that people are taking advantage of the Internet to produce a grassroots globalization, one that is anti-neoliberal and centered on people rather than the flow of capital.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas, "Globalization and Technopolitics"&lt;/ref&gt; Chanelle Adams, a feminist blogger for the Bi-Weekly webpaper The Media says that in her "commitment to anti-oppressive feminist work, it seems obligatory for her to stay in the know just to remain relevant to the struggle."  In order for Adams and other feminists who work towards spreading their messages to the public, new media becomes crucial towards completing this task, allowing people to access a movement's information instantaneously. Of course, some are also skeptical of the role of New Media in Social Movements. Many scholars point out unequal access to new media as a hindrance to broad-based movements, sometimes even oppressing some within a movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Herman, "Is a New Worldwide Web Possible? An Explorative Comparison of the Use of ICTs by Two South African Social Movements," African Studies Review, Volume 50, Number 1 (April 2007), pp. 109–131&lt;/ref&gt; Others are skeptical about how democratic or useful it really is for social movements, even for those with access.&lt;ref&gt;Marmura, Stephen, "A net advantage? The Internet, grassroots activism and American Middle-Eastern Policy," New Media Society 2008; 10; 247&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media has also found a use with less radical social movements such as the [[Free Hugs Campaign]]. Using websites, blogs, and online videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the movement itself. Along with this example the use of high volume blogs has allowed numerous views and practices to be more widespread and gain more public attention. Another example is the ongoing [[Free Tibet Campaign]], which has been seen on numerous websites as well as having a slight tie-in with the band [[Gorillaz]] in their Gorillaz Bitez clip featuring the lead singer [[2D (Gorillaz)|2D]] sitting with protesters at a Free Tibet protest. Another social change seen coming from New Media is trends in fashion and the emergence of subcultures such as [[SMS language|Text Speak]], [[Cyberpunk]], and various others.

Following trends in fashion and [[Text Speak]], New Media also makes way for "trendy" social change. The [[Ice Bucket Challenge]] is a recent example of this. All in the name of raising money for [[ALS]] (the lethal neurodegenerative disorder also known as [[Lou Gehrig's disease]]), participants are nominated by friends via [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and ownmirror to dump a bucket of ice water on themselves, or donate to the ALS Foundation. This became a huge trend through Facebook's tagging tool, allowing nominees to be tagged in the post. The videos appeared on more people's feeds, and the trend spread fast. This trend raised over 100 million dollars for the cause and increased donations by 3,500 percent.

== National security ==
{{See also|Terrorism and social media}}
New Media has also recently become of interest to the global [[espionage]] community as it is easily accessible electronically in [[database]] format and can therefore be quickly retrieved and reverse engineered by national [[governments]]. Particularly of interest to the [[espionage]] community are [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], two sites where individuals freely divulge personal information that can then be sifted through and archived for the automatic creation of dossiers on both people of interest and the average citizen.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Mind_Your_Tweets:_The_CIA_Social_Networking_Surveillance_System&lt;/ref&gt;

New media also serves as an important tool for both institutions and nations to promote their interest and values (The contents of such promotion may vary according to different  purposes). Some communities consider it an approach of "peaceful evolution" that may erode their own nation's system of values and eventually compromise national security.

==Interactivity==
[[Interactivity]] has become a term for a number of new media use options evolving from the rapid dissemination of [[Internet]] access points, the [[digitalization]] of media, and [[media convergence]]. In 1984, Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information.&lt;ref&gt;Schorr, A &amp; Schenk, M &amp; Campbell, W (2003),''Communication Research and Media Science in Europe'', Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin, pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Such a definition replaces the "[[Point-to-multipoint communication|one-to-many]]" model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a "[[many-to-many]]" web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound about whatever he or she chooses.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, David &amp; Hoynes, William (2003) Media Society: Industries, Images and Audiences (third edition), Pine Forge Press, Thousand Oaks, pg. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes the ways we interact and communicate with one another. In "What is new media?" Vin Crosbie&lt;ref name="Crosbie, 2002"&gt;[http://www.sociology.org.uk/as4mm3a.doc] Crosbie, V. (2002). What is New Media? Retrieved from http://www.sociology.org.uk/as4mm3a.doc&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) described three different kinds of communication media. He saw Interpersonal media as "one to one", Mass media as "one to many", and finally New Media as [[Individuation]] Media or "many to many".

When we think of interactivity and its meaning, we assume that it is only prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, Sheizaf (1988). "[https://www.academia.edu/533664/Interactivity_From_new_media_to_communication Interactivity: From new media to communication]". Beverly Hills, CA. Pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and there is no longer a limit to what we can do with our creativity.

Interactivity can be considered a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, Sheizaf &amp; Ariel, Yaron (2007), "Assessing Interactivity in Computer-Mediated Research". In: A.N Joinson, K.Y.A McKenna., T. Postmes &amp; U-D. Reips (Eds). The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; different degrees of interactivity,&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry (2002), ''New Media: An Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], UK, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Tony (1997) ''An Introduction to Digital Media'', Routledege, London&lt;/ref&gt; considers digital [[satellite television]] as an example of a new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.

[[Terry Flew]] (2005) argues that "the global interactive games industry is large and growing, and is at the forefront of many of the most significant innovations in new media" (Flew 2005: 101). Interactivity is prominent in these online video games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[The Sims Online]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''. These games, which are developments of "new media," allow for users to establish relationships and experience a sense of belonging that transcends traditional temporal and spatial boundaries (such as when gamers logging in from different parts of the world interact). These games can be used as an escape or to act out a desired life. [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], creator of ''The Sims'', "is fascinated by the way gamers have become so attached to his invention-with some even living their lives through it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article The Sun Newspaper Online]&lt;/ref&gt; New media have created virtual realities that are becoming virtual extensions of the world we live in. With the creation of ''Second Life'' and [[Active Worlds]] before it, people have even more control over this virtual world, a world where anything that a participant can think of can become a reality.&lt;ref&gt;http://secondlife.com/whatis/#Be_Creative&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media changes continuously because it is constantly modified and redefined by the interaction between users, emerging technologies, cultural changes, etc.

New forms of New Media are emerging like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with video games and the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and that people want to watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created that the majority of the gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.

==Industry==
The new media industry shares an open association with many market segments in areas such as [[software]]/[[video game design]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[mobile phone|mobile]] and particularly movies, [[advertising]] and [[marketing]], through which industry seeks to gain from the advantages of two-way dialogue with consumers primarily through the [[Internet]]. As a device to source the ideas, concepts, and intellectual properties of the general public, the [[television]] industry has used new media and the Internet to expand their resources for new programming and content. The advertising industry has also capitalized on the proliferation of new media with large agencies running multimillion-dollar [[interactive advertising]] subsidiaries. Interactive websites and kiosks have become popular. In a number of cases [[Advertising agency|advertising agencies]] have also set up new divisions to study new media. [[Public relations]] firms are also taking advantage of the opportunities in new media through [[interactive PR]] practices. Interactive PR practices include the use of social media&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2010/03/16/public-relations-social-media-results/&lt;/ref&gt; to reach a mass audience of online social network users.

With the rise of the Internet, many new career paths were created. Before the rise, many technical jobs were seen as nerdy. The Internet led to creative work that was seen as laid-back and diverse amongst sex, race, and sexual orientation. Web design, gaming design, webcasting, blogging, and animation are all creative career paths that came with this rise. At first glance, the field of new media may seem hip, cool, creative and relaxed.  What many don't realize is that working in this field is tiresome. Many of the people that work in this field don't have steady jobs. Work in this field has become project-based. Individuals work project to project for different companies. Most people are not working on one project or contract, but multiple ones at the same time. Despite working on numerous projects, people in this industry receive low payments, which is highly contrasted with the techy millionaire stereotype. It may seem as a carefree life from the outside, but it is not.  New media workers work long hours for little pay and spend up to 20 hours a week looking for new projects to work on.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Gill's Cool, Creative and Egalitarian?&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ideology of new media careers as an egalitarian and stress-free environment is a myth. It is a game of networking and thriving at what you are capable of. Many workers face job instability. Inequality within this field exists due to the informality and flexibility of this career path.

Within the Industry, many Companies have emerged or transformed to adapt to the fast moving exciting opportunities that new media offers. The following companies are great examples of the changing landscape of companies/agencies whom have redeveloped, added or changed services to offer new media services.&lt;ref name="Counting the change – The Economist"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.economist.com/news/business/21583687-media-companies-took-battering-internet-cash-digital-sources-lasty|title=Counting the change|accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
Based on nationally representative data, a study conducted by [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in five-year intervals in 1998–99, 2003–04, and 2008–09 found that with technology allowing nearly 24-hour media access, the amount of time young people spend with entertainment media has risen dramatically, especially among Black and Hispanic youth.&lt;ref&gt;Rideout V, Foehr U, Roberts D. Generation M2: Media in the lives o 8- to 18- year olds. January 2010, http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/8010.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, 8- to 18-year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes (7:38) to using entertainment media in a typical day (more than 53 hours a week) – about the same amount most adults spend at work per day.  Since much of that time is spent 'media multitasking' (using more than one medium at a time), they actually manage to spend a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content in those 7½ hours per day. According to the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]], 96% of 18- to 29-year-olds and three-quarters (75%) of teens now own a cell phone, 88% of whom text, with 73% of wired American teens using social networking websites, a significant increase from previous years.&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Social-Media-and-Young-Adults.aspx|title=Social Media and Young Adults|last=Lenhart|first=Amanda|author2=Kristen Purcell |author3=Aaron Smith |author4=Kathryn Zickuhr |date=February 3, 2010|work=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of over 25000 9- to 16-year-olds from 25 European countries found that many underage children use social media sites despite the site's stated age requirements, and many youth lack the digital skills to use social networking sites safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Livingstone|first=Sonia|author2=Ólafsson, Kjartan |author3=Staksrud, Elisabeth |title=Risky Social Networking Practices Among "Underage" Users: Lessons for Evidence-Based Policy|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2013|volume=18|issue=3|pages=303|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the new digital media demands a new educational model by parents and educators. The ''parental mediation'' become a way to manage the children’s experiences with Internet, chat, videogames and social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/media-education/educating-in-the-knowledge-of-new-media/|title=Educating in the knowledge of New Media|date=2017-05-24|work=Family And Media|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent trend in internet is Youtubers Generation. Youtubers are young people who offer free video in their personal channel on YouTube. There are videos on games, fashion, food, cinema and music, where they offers tutorial or comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/internet-and-social-network/who-are-they-and-why-do-kids-like-them-so-much/|title=YouTubers: Who are they, and why do kids like them so much?|date=2017-02-20|work=Family And Media|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of cellular phones, such as the [[iPhone]], has created the inability to be in [[social isolation]], and the potential of ruining relationships. The iPhone activates the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love. People show similar feelings to their phones as they would to their friends, family and loved ones. Countless people spend more time on their phones, while in the presence of other people than spending time with the people in the same room or class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindstrom|first=Martin|title=You Love Your iPhone.

==Political campaigns in the United States==
In trying to determine the impact of new media on [[political campaign]]ing and electioneering, the existing research has tried to examine whether new media supplants conventional media. [[Television]] is still the dominant news source, but new media's reach is growing. What is known is that new media has had a significant impact on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different [[social media]] platforms. Both parties have specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach.

Additionally, their websites are socially connected, engaging voters before, during, and after elections. Email and [[text message]]s are also regularly sent to supporters encouraging them to donate and get involved.&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"&gt;Owen, D. (2011). New Media and Political Campaigns. In K. K. Jamieson (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Political Communication Theory and Research. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some existing research focuses on the ways that political campaigns, parties, and candidates have incorporated new media into their political strategizing. This is often a multi-faceted approach that combines new and old media forms to create highly specialized strategies. This allows them to reach wider audiences, but also to target very specific subsets of the electorate. They are able to tap into polling data and in some cases harness the [[web analytics|analytics]] of the traffic and profiles on various social media outlets to get real-time data about the kinds of engagement that is needed and the kinds of messages that are successful or unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"/&gt;
One body of existing research into the impact of new media on elections investigates the relationship between voters' use of new media and their level of political activity. They focus on areas such as "attentiveness, knowledge, attitudes, orientations, and engagement" (Owen, 2011). In references a vast body of research, Owen (2011) points out that older studies were mixed, while "newer research reveals more consistent evidence of information gain".&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"/&gt;

Some of that research has shown that there is a connection between the amount and degree of voter engagement and turnout (Owen, 2011). However, new media may not have overwhelming effects on either of those. Other research is tending toward the idea that new media has reinforcing effect, that rather than completely altering, by increasing involvement, it "imitates the established pattern of [[political participation]]" (Nam, 2012). After analyzing the Citizenship Involvement Democracy survey, Nam (2012) found that "the internet plays a dual role in mobilizing political participation by people not normally politically involved, as well as reinforcing existing offline participation." These findings chart a middle ground between some research that optimistically holds new media up to be an extremely effective or extremely ineffective at fostering political participation.&lt;ref&gt;Nam, T. (2012). Dual effects on the internet on political activism: Reinforcing and mobilizing.Government Information Quarterly, S90–S97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towner (2013) found, in his survey of college students, that attention to new media increases offline and online political participation particularly for young people. His research shows that the prevalence of online media boosts participation and engagement. His work suggests that "it seems that online sources that facilitate political involvement, communication, and mobilization, particularly campaign websites, social media, and blogs, are the most important for offline political participation among young people".&lt;ref&gt;Towner, T. L. (2013). All Political Participation is Socially Networked? New Media and the 2012 Election. Social Science Computer Review, 00(0), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
Deliberation When gauging effects and implications of new media on the political process, one means of doing so is to look at the deliberations that take place in these digital spaces (Halpern &amp; Gibbs, 2013). In citing the work of several researchers, Halpern and Gibbs (2003) define deliberation to be "the performance of a set of communicative behaviors that promote thorough discussion. and the notion that in this process of communication the individuals involved weigh carefully the reasons for and against some of the propositions presented by others".&lt;ref name="Halpern, D. 2013"&gt;Halpern, D., &amp; Gibbs, J. (2013). Social media as a catalyst for online deliberation? Exploring the affordances of Facebook and YouTube for political expression. Computers in Human Behavior, 1159-1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Halpern and Gibbs (2013) "suggest that although social media may not provide a forum for intensive or in-depth policy debate, it nevertheless provides a deliberative space to discuss and encourage political participation, both directly and indirectly". Their work goes a step beyond that as well though because it shows that some social media sites foster a more robust [[political debate]] than do others such as Facebook which includes highly personal and identifiable access to information about users alongside any comments they may post on political topics. This is in contrast to sites like YouTube whose comments are often posted anonymously.&lt;ref name="Halpern, D. 2013"/&gt;

== Ethical Issues in New Media Research ==
Due to the popularity of new media, social media websites (SMWs) like Facebook and Twitter are becoming increasingly popular among researchers (Moreno, Goniu, Moreno, Diekema, 2013).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=M.A.|last2=Goniu|first2=N.|last3=Moreno|first3=P.S|last4=Diekema|first4=D.|date=2013|title=Ethics of Social Media Research: Common Concerns and Practical Considerations|url=|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=16|pages=708–713|doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0334|via=|pmc=3942703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although SMWs present new opportunities, they also represent challenges for researchers interested in studying social phenomena online, since it can be difficult to determine what are acceptable risks to privacy unique to social media. Some scholars (e.g. Moreno, Frost &amp; Christakis, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=M.A.|last2=Frost|first2=N.C.|last3=Christakis|first3=D.A|date=2008|title=Research ethics in the MySpace era|url=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=121|pages=157–161|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that standard Institutional Review Board (IRB) procedures provide little guidance on research protocols relating to social media in particular.

As a consequence, Moreno et al. (2013) identified three major approaches to research on social media and relevant concerns scholars should consider before engaging in social media research.

=== Observational Research ===
One of the major issues for observational research is whether a particular project is considered to involve human subjects. A human subject is one that “is defined by federal regulations as a living individual about whom an investigator obtains data through interaction with the individual or identifiable private information”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreno et al. (2013) note that if access to a social media site is public, information is considered identifiable but not private, and information gathering procedures do not require researchers to interact with the original poster of the information, then this does not meet the requirements for human subjects research. Research may also be exempt if the disclosure of participant responses outside the realm of the published research does not subject the participant to civic or criminal liability, damage the participant’s reputation, employability or financial standing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given these criteria, however, researchers still have considerable leeway when conducting observational research on social media. Many profiles on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Twitter are public and researchers are free to use that data for observational research.

It should be noted, however, that users have the ability to change their privacy settings on most social media websites. Facebook, for example, provides users with the ability to restrict who sees their posts through specific privacy settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=M.A|date=2011|title=Social privacy in networked publics: teens' attitudes, practices and strategies. A decade in internet time.|url=|journal=Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also debate about whether requiring users to create a username and password is sufficient to establish whether the data is considered public or private. Historically, Institutional Review Boards considered such websites to be private,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although newer websites like YouTube call this practice into question. For example, YouTube only requires the creation of a username and password to post videos and/or view adult content, but anyone is free to view general YouTube videos and these general videos would not be subject to consent requirements for researchers looking to conduct observational studies.

=== Interactive Research ===
According to Romano et al. (2013), interactive research occurs when "a researcher wishes to access the [social media website] content that is not publicly available" (pg. 710). Because researchers have limited ways of accessing this data, this could mean that a researcher sends a Facebook user a friend request, or follows a user on Twitter in order to gain access to potentially protected tweets (pg.711). While it could be argued that such actions would violate a social media user's expectation of privacy, Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe (2007) argued that actions like "friending" or "following" an individual on social media constitutes a "loose tie" relationship and therefore not sufficient to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy since individuals often have friends or followers they have never even met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|date=July 2007|title=The Benefits of Facebook "Friends:" Social Capital and College Students’ Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143–1168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survey/Interview Research ===
Because research on social media occurs online, it is difficult for researchers to observe participant reactions to the informed consent process. For example, when collecting information about activities that are potentially illegal, or recruiting participants from stigmatized populations, this lack of physical proximity could potentially negatively impact the informed consent process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another important consideration regards the confidentiality of information provided by participants. While information provided over the internet might be perceived as lower risk, studies that publish direct quotes from study participants might expose them to the risk of being identified via a Google search&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Optimality Theory''' (frequently abbreviated '''OT'''; the term is normally capitalized by convention) is a linguistic model proposing that the observed forms of [[language]] arise from the optimal satisfaction of conflicting constraints. OT differs from other approaches to phonological analysis, such as [[autosegmental phonology]] and [[linear phonology]] (SPE), which typically use rules rather than constraints. OT models grammars as systems that provide mappings from inputs to outputs; typically, the inputs are conceived of as [[underlying representation]]s, and the outputs as their surface realizations.

In linguistics, Optimality Theory has its origin in a talk given by [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;"Optimality". Proceedings of the talk given at Arizona Phonology
Conference, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later developed in an article by the same authors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan, and Smolensky, Paul (1993) "Optimality Theory: Constraint interaction in generative grammar." Technical Report CU-CS-696-93, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There are three basic components of the theory:

* Generator ({{sc1|Gen}}) takes an input, and generates the list of possible outputs, or candidates,
* Constraint component ({{sc1|Con}}) provides the criteria, in the form of strictly ranked violable constraints, used to decide between candidates, and
* Evaluator ({{sc1|Eval}}) chooses the optimal candidate based on the constraints, and this candidate is the output.

Optimality Theory assumes that these components are universal. Differences in grammars reflect different rankings of the universal constraint set, {{sc1|Con}}. Part of [[language acquisition]] can then be described as the process of adjusting the ranking of these constraints.

Optimality Theory as applied to language was originally proposed by the linguists [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991, and later expanded by Prince and [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]. Although much of the interest in Optimality Theory has been associated with its use in [[phonology]], the area to which Optimality Theory was first applied, the theory is also applicable to other subfields of [[linguistics]] (e.g. [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]).

Optimality Theory is like other theories of [[generative grammar]] in its focus on the investigation of [[linguistic universal|universal principles]], [[linguistic typology]] and [[language acquisition]].

Optimality Theory also has roots in [[neural network]] research. It arose in part as an alternative to the [[connectionist]] theory of [[Harmonic Grammar]], developed in 1990 by [[Géraldine Legendre]], [[Yoshiro Miyata]] and [[Paul Smolensky]]. Variants of Optimality Theory with connectionist-like weighted constraints continue to be pursued in more recent work (Pater 2009).

==Input and {{sc1|Gen}}: the candidate set==
Optimality Theory supposes that there are no language-specific restrictions on the input. This is called ''richness of the base''. Every grammar can handle every possible input. For example, a language without [[Consonant cluster|complex clusters]] must be able to deal with an input such as {{IPA|/flask/}}. Languages without complex clusters differ on how they will resolve this problem; some will [[epenthesis|epenthesize]] (e.g. {{IPA|[falasak]}}, or {{IPA|[falasaka]}} if all codas are banned) and some will [[Elision|delete]] (e.g. {{IPA|[fas], [fak], [las], [lak]}}).

{{sc1|Gen}} is free to generate any number of output candidates, however much they deviate from the input. This is called ''freedom of analysis''. The grammar (ranking of constraints) of the language determines which of the candidates will be assessed as optimal by {{sc1|Eval}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|p=20}}

=={{sc1|Con}}: the constraint set==
In Optimality Theory, every constraint is universal. {{sc1|Con}} is the same in every language. There are two basic types of constraints:

* Faithfulness constraints require that the observed surface form (the output) match the underlying or lexical form (the input) in some particular way; that is, these constraints require identity between input and output forms.
* Markedness constraints impose requirements on the structural [[well-formedness]] of the output.

Each plays a crucial role in the theory. Markedness constraints motivate changes from the underlying form, and faithfulness constraints prevent every input from being realized as some completely unmarked form (such as {{IPA|[ba]}}).

The universal nature of {{sc1|Con}} makes some immediate predictions about language typology. If grammars differ only by having different rankings of {{sc1|Con}}, then the set of possible human languages is determined by the constraints that exist. Optimality Theory predicts that there cannot be more grammars than there are permutations of the ranking of {{sc1|Con}}. The number of possible rankings is equal to the [[factorial]] of the total number of constraints, thus giving rise to the term ''factorial typology''. However, it may not be possible to distinguish all of these potential grammars, since not every constraint is guaranteed to have an observable effect in every language. Two total orders on the constraints of {{sc1|Con}} could generate the same range of input–output mappings, but differ in the relative ranking of two constraints which do not conflict with each other. Since there is no way to distinguish these two rankings they are said to belong to the same grammar. A grammar in OT is equivalent to an [[antimatroid]] (Merchant &amp; Riggle 2016). If rankings with ties are allowed, then the number of possibilities is an [[ordered Bell number]] rather than a factorial, allowing a significantly larger number of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: The Best of All Possible Words (review of ''Optimality Theory: An Overview'', Archangeli, Diana &amp; Langendoen, D. Terence, eds., Blackwell, 1997)|first1=T. Mark|last1=Ellison|first2=Ewan|last2=Klein|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=127–143|jstor=4176645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faithfulness constraints===
McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) propose three basic families of faithfulness constraints:

* {{sc1|Max}} prohibits [[elision|deletion]] (from "maximal").
* {{sc1|Dep}} prohibits [[epenthesis]] (from "dependent").
* {{sc1|Ident}}(F) prohibits alteration to the value of feature F (from "identical").

Each of the constraints' names may be suffixed with "-IO" or "-BR", standing for ''input/output'' and ''base/reduplicant'', respectively—the latter of which is used in analysis of [[reduplication]]—if desired. ''F'' in {{sc1|Ident}}(F) is substituted by the name of a [[distinctive feature]], as in {{sc1|Ident-IO}}(voice).

{{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}} replace {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} proposed by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993), which stated "underlying segments must be parsed into syllable structure" and "syllable positions must be filled with underlying segments", respectively.{{sfnp|Prince|Smolensky|1993|p=94}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}} {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} serve essentially the same functions as {{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}}, but differ in that they evaluate only the output and not the relation between the input and output, which is rather characteristic of markedness constraints.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=209}} This stems from the model adopted by Prince &amp; Smolensky known as ''containment theory'', which assumes the input segments unrealized by the output are not removed but rather "left unparsed" by a syllable.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=99–100}} The model put forth by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995, 1999), known as ''correspondence theory'', has since replaced it as the standard framework.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}}

McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) also propose:

* {{sc1|I-Contig}}, violated when a word- or morpheme-internal segment is deleted (from "input-contiguity");
* {{sc1|O-Contig}}, violated when a segment is inserted word- or morpheme-internally (from "output-contiguity");
* {{sc1|Linearity}}, violated when the order of some segments is changed (i.e. prohibits [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]);
* {{sc1|Uniformity}}, violated when two or more segments are realized as one (i.e. prohibits [[fusion (linguistics)|fusion]]); and
* {{sc1|Integrity}}, violated when a segment is realized as multiple segments (i.e. prohibits [[unpacking]] or [[vowel breaking]]—opposite of {{sc1|Uniformity}}).

===Markedness constraints===
Markedness constraints introduced by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993) include:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name
! Statement
! Other names
|-
| {{sc1|Nuc}}
| Syllables must have nuclei.
|
|-
| {{sc1|&amp;minus;Coda}}
| Syllables must have no codas.
| {{sc1|NoCoda}}
|-
| {{sc1|Ons}}
| Syllables must have onsets.
| {{sc1|Onset}}
|-
| {{sc1|HNuc}}
| A nuclear segment must be more [[Sonority hierarchy|sonorous]] than another (from "harmonic nucleus").
|
|-
| {{sc1|*Complex}}
| A syllable must be V, CV or VC.
|
|-
| {{sc1|CodaCond}}
| Coda consonants cannot have place features that are not shared by an onset consonant.
| {{sc1|CodaCondition}}
|-
| {{sc1|NonFinality}}
| A word-final syllable (or [[foot (prosody)|foot]]) must not bear stress.
| {{sc1|NonFin}}
|-
| {{sc1|FtBin}}
| A foot must be two syllables (or [[Mora  (linguistics)|moras]]).
| {{sc1|FootBinarity}}
|-
| {{sc1|Pk-Prom}}
| Light syllables must not be stressed.
| {{sc1|PeakProminence}}
|-
| WSP
| Heavy syllables must be stressed (from "weight-to-stress principle").
| {{sc1|Weight-to-Stress}}
|}

Precise definitions in literature vary. Some constraints are sometimes used as a "cover constraint", standing in for a set of constraints that are not fully known or important.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=224}}

Some markedness constraints are context-free and others are context-sensitive. For example, *V&lt;sub&gt;nasal&lt;/sub&gt; states that vowels must not be nasal in any position and is thus context-free, whereas *V&lt;sub&gt;oral&lt;/sub&gt;N states that vowels must not be oral when preceding a tautosyllabic nasal and is thus context-sensitive.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=29–30}}

===Alignment constraints===
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

===Local conjunctions===
Two constraints may be conjoined as a single constraint, called a ''local conjunction'', which gives only one violation each time both constraints are violated within a given domain, such as a segment, syllable or word. For example, [{{sc1|NoCoda &amp; VOP}}]&lt;sub&gt;segment&lt;/sub&gt; is violated once per voiced [[obstruent]] in a coda ("VOP" stands for "voiced obstruent prohibition"), and may be equivalently written as {{sc1|*VoicedCoda}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|pp=214–20}} Local conjunctions are used as a way of circumventing the problem of [[phonological opacity]] that arises when analyzing [[chain shift]]s.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}

=={{sc1|Eval}}: definition of optimality==
Given two candidates, A and B, A is better, or more "harmonic", than B on a constraint if A incurs fewer violations than B. Candidate A is more harmonic than B on an entire constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations of the highest-ranked constraint distinguishing A and B. A is "optimal" in its candidate set if it is better on the constraint hierarchy than all other candidates.

For example, given the constraints C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which dominates C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), A is optimal if it does better than B on the highest ranking constraint which assigns them a different number of violations. If A and B tie on C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but A does better than B on C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A is optimal, even if A has however many more violations of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than B does. This comparison is often illustrated with a tableau. The [[index (typography)|pointing finger]] marks the optimal candidate, and each cell displays an asterisk for each violation for a given candidate and constraint. Once a candidate does worse than another candidate on the highest ranking constraint distinguishing them, it incurs a fatal violation (marked in the tableau by an exclamation mark and by shaded cells for the lower-ranked constraints). Once a candidate incurs a fatal violation, it cannot be optimal, even if it outperforms the other candidates on the rest of {{sc1|Con}}.

Other notational conventions include dotted lines separating columns of unranked or equally ranked constraints, a check mark ✔ in place of a finger in tentatively ranked tableaux (denoting harmonic but not conclusively optimal), and a circled asterisk ⊛ denoting a violation by a winner; in output candidates, the angle brackets {{angle bracket|&amp;nbsp;}} denote segments elided in phonetic realization, and □ and □́ denote an epenthetic consonant and vowel, respectively.{{sfnp|Tesar|Smloensky|1998|pp=230–1, 239}} The "much greater than" sign ≫ (sometimes the nested ⪢) denotes the domination of a constraint over another ("C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" = "C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;") while the "succeeds" operator ≻ denotes superior harmony in comparison of output candidates ("A ≻ B" = "A is more harmonic than B").{{sfnp|McCarthy|2001|p=247}}

Constraints are ranked in a hierarchy of strict domination. The ''strictness of strict domination'' means that a candidate which violates only a high-ranked constraint does worse on the hierarchy than one that does not, even if the second candidate fared worse on every other lower-ranked constraint. This also means that constraints are violable; the winning (i.e. the most harmonic) candidate need not satisfy all constraints, as long as for any rival candidate that does better than the winner on some constraint, there is a higher-ranked constraint on which the winner does better than that rival. Within a language, a constraint may be ranked high enough that it is always obeyed; it may be ranked low enough that it has no observable effects; or, it may have some intermediate ranking. The term ''the emergence of the unmarked'' describes situations in which a markedness constraint has an intermediate ranking, so that it is violated in some forms, but nonetheless has observable effects when higher-ranked constraints are irrelevant.

An early example proposed by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1994) is the constraint {{sc1|NoCoda}}, which prohibits syllables from ending in consonants. In [[Balangao]], {{sc1|NoCoda}} is not ranked high enough to be always obeyed, as witnessed in roots like ''taynan'' (faithfulness to the input prevents deletion of the final {{IPA|/n/}}). But, in the [[reduplication|reduplicated]] form ''ma-tayna-taynan'' 'repeatedly be left behind', the final {{IPA|/n/}} is not copied. Under McCarthy &amp; Prince's analysis, this is because faithfulness to the input does not apply to reduplicated material, and {{sc1|NoCoda}} is thus free to prefer ''ma-tayna-taynan'' over hypothetical ''ma-taynan-taynan'' (which has an additional violation of {{sc1|NoCoda}}).

Some optimality theorists prefer the use of comparative tableaux, as described in Prince (2002b). Comparative tableaux display the same information as the classic or "flyspeck" tableaux, but the information is presented in such a way that it highlights the most crucial information. For instance, the tableau above would be rendered in the following way.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Comparative tableau
! !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 1 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 2 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 3
|-
! A ~ B
| e || W || L
|}

Each row in a comparative tableau represents a winner–loser pair, rather than an individual candidate. In the cells where the constraints assess the winner–loser pairs, "W" is placed if the constraint in that column prefers the winner, "L" if the constraint prefers the loser, and "e" if the constraint does not differentiate between the pair. Presenting the data in this way makes it easier to make generalizations. For instance, in order to have a consistent ranking ''some'' W must dominate ''all'' L's. Brasoveanu and Prince (2005) describe a process known as fusion and the various ways of presenting data in a comparative tableau in order to achieve the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given argument.

==Example==
As a simplified example, consider the manifestation of the English plural:

* {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/ → [dɒɡz]}} (''dogs'')
* {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/ → [kæts]}} (''cats'')
* {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/ → [dɪʃɪz]}} (''dishes'')

Also consider the following constraint set, in descending order of domination:

{| class="wikitable"
! Type !! Name !! Description
|-
| rowspan="2" | Markedness || *SS || Two successive sibilants are prohibited. One violation for every pair of adjacent [[sibilants]] in the output.
|-
| {{sc1|Agree}}(Voice) || Output segments agree in specification of [[Distinctive feature|&amp;#91;±voice&amp;#93;]]. One violation for every pair of adjacent [[obstruent]]s in the output which disagree in voicing.
|-
| rowspan="3" | Faithfulness || {{sc1|Max}} || Maximizes all input segments in the output. One violation for each segment in the input that does not appear in the output. This constraint prevents deletion.
|-
| {{sc1|Dep}} || Output segments are dependent on having an input correspondent. One violation for each segment in the output that does not appear in the input. This constraint prevents insertion.
|-
| {{sc1|Ident}}(Voice) || Maintains the identity of the [±voice] specification. One violation for each segment that differs in voicing between the input and output.

No matter how the constraints are re-ordered, the allomorph {{IPA|[ɪs]}} will always lose to {{IPA|[ɪz]}}. This is called ''harmonic bounding''. The violations incurred by the candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡɪz]}} are a subset of the violations incurred by {{IPA|[dɒɡɪs]}}; specifically, if you epenthesize a vowel, changing the voicing of the morpheme is a gratuitous violation of constraints. In the {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}} tableau, there is a candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} which incurs no violations whatsoever. Within the constraint set of the problem, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} harmonically bounds all other possible candidates. This shows that a candidate does not need to be a winner in order to harmonically bound another candidate.

The tableaux from above are repeated below using the comparative tableaux format.

From the comparative tableau for {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}}, it can be observed that any ranking of these constraints will produce the observed output {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}}. Because there are no loser-preferring comparisons, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} wins under any ranking of these constraints; this means that no ranking can be established on the basis of this input.

The tableau for {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} contains rows with a single W and a single L. This shows that {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, and {{sc1|Dep}} must all dominate {{sc1|Ident}}; however, no ranking can be established between those constraints on the basis of this input. Based on this tableau, the following ranking has been established
: {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}.

The tableau for {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/}} shows that several more rankings are necessary in order to predict the desired outcome. The first row says nothing; there is no loser-preferring comparison in the first row. The second row reveals that either *SS or {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, based on the comparison between {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} and {{IPA|[dɪʃz]}}. The third row shows that {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. The final row shows that either *SS or {{sc1|Ident}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. From the {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} tableau, it was established that {{sc1|Dep}} dominates {{sc1|Ident}}; this means that *SS must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}.

So far, the following rankings have been shown to be necessary:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

While it is possible that {{sc1|Agree}} can dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, it is not necessary; the ranking given above is sufficient for the observed for {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} to emerge.

When the rankings from the tableaux are combined, the following ranking summary can be given:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}
::or
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Agree}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

There are two possible places to put {{sc1|Agree}} when writing out rankings linearly; neither is truly accurate. The first implies that *SS and {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Agree}}, and the second implies that {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. Neither of these are truthful, which is a failing of writing out rankings in a linear fashion like this. These sorts of problems are the reason why most linguists utilize a [[Lattice (order)|lattice graph]] to represent necessary and sufficient rankings, as shown below.

[[File:Lattice 2.jpg|Lattice graph of necessary and sufficient rankings]]

A diagram that represents the necessary rankings of constraints in this style is a [[Hasse diagram]].

==Criticism==
Optimality Theory has attracted substantial amounts of criticism, most of which is directed at its application to phonology (rather than syntax or other fields).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dresher (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale &amp; Reiss (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halle (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that Optimality Theory cannot account for [[phonological opacity]] (see Idsardi 2000, for example). In derivational phonology, effects that are inexplicable at the surface level but are explainable through "opaque" rule ordering may be seen; but in Optimality Theory, which has no intermediate levels for rules to operate on, these effects are difficult to explain.

For example, in [[Quebec French]], high front vowels triggered affrication of {{IPA|/t/}}, (e.g. {{IPA|/tipik/ → [tˢpɪk]}}), but the loss of high vowels (visible at the surface level) has left the affrication with no apparent source. Derivational phonology can explain this by stating that vowel [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] (the loss of the vowel) "counterbled" affrication—that is, instead of vowel syncope occurring and "[[bleeding order|bleeding]]" (i.e. preventing) affrication, it says that affrication applies before vowel syncope, so that the high vowel is removed and the environment destroyed which had triggered affrication. Such counterbleeding rule orderings are therefore termed ''opaque'' (as opposed to ''transparent''), because their effects are not visible at the surface level.

The opacity of such phenomena finds no straightforward explanation in Optimality Theory, since intermediate forms are not accessible (constraints refer only to the surface form and/or the underlying form). There have been a number of proposals designed to account for it, but most of the proposals significantly alter Optimality Theory's basic architecture and therefore tend to be highly controversial. Frequently, such alterations add new types of constraints (which are not universal faithfulness or markedness constraints), or change the properties of {{sc1|Gen}} (such as allowing for serial derivations) or {{sc1|Eval}}. Examples of these include [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]'s sympathy theory and candidate chains theory, among many others.

A relevant issue is the existence of circular [[chain shift]]s, i.e. cases where input {{IPA|/X/}} maps to output {{IPA|[Y]}}, but input {{IPA|/Y/}} maps to output {{IPA|[X]}}. Many versions of Optimality Theory predict this to be impossible (see Moreton 2004, Prince 2007).

Optimality Theory is also criticized as being an impossible model of speech production/perception: computing and comparing an infinite number of possible candidates would take an infinitely long time to process. Idsardi (2006) argues this position, though other linguists dispute this claim on the grounds that Idsardi makes unreasonable assumptions about the constraint set and candidates, and that more moderate instantiations of Optimality Theory do not present such significant [[computational problem]]s (see Kornai (2006) and Heinz, Kobele &amp; Riggle (2009)). Another common rebuttal to this criticism of Optimality Theory is that the framework is purely representational. In this view, Optimality Theory is taken to be a model of [[linguistic competence]] and is therefore not intended to explain the specifics of [[linguistic performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kager, René (1999). Optimality Theory. Section 1.4.4: Fear of infinity, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan and Paul Smolensky. (2004): ''Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar''. Section 10.1.1: Fear of Optimization, pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to Optimality Theory is that it is not technically a theory, in that it does not make falsifiable predictions. The source of this issue may be in terminology: the term ''theory'' is used differently here than in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. Specific instantiations of Optimality Theory may make falsifiable predictions, in the same way specific proposals within other linguistic frameworks can. What predictions are made, and whether they are testable, depends on the specifics of individual proposals (most commonly, this is a matter of the definitions of the constraints used in an analysis). Thus, Optimality Theory as a framework is best described{{according to whom|date=June 2018}} as a [[scientific paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;de Lacy (editor). (2007). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Phonology'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories within Optimality Theory==
In practice, implementations of Optimality Theory often assume other related concepts, such as the [[syllable]], the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]], or [[feature geometry]]. Completely distinct from these, there are sub-theories which have been proposed entirely within Optimality Theory, such as [[positional faithfulness theory]], correspondence theory (McCarthy &amp; Prince 1995), sympathy theory, and a number of theories of learnability, most notably by [[Bruce Tesar]].
There are also a range of theories specifically about Optimality Theory. These are concerned with issues like the possible formulations of constraints, and constraint interactions other than strict domination.

==Use outside of phonology==
Optimality Theory is most commonly associated with the field of [[phonology]], but has also been applied to other areas of linguistics. [[Jane Grimshaw]], [[Geraldine Legendre]] and [[Joan Bresnan]] have developed instantiations of the theory within [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, John (2001). A Thematic Guide to Optimality Theory, Chapter 4: Connections of Optimality Theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legendre, Grimshaw &amp; Vikner (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Optimality theoretic approaches are also relatively prominent in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (and the morphology–phonology interface in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Trommer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:london-park-system.jpg|thumb|right|The County of London Park System, planned by [[Patrick Abercrombie]] in 1943-4|300px]]  A '''park system''', also known as an open space system, is a network of green spaces that are connected by public walkways, bridleways or cycleways. The concept first emerged with the need to minimize fragmentation of natural environments and was referred to as "[[Wildlife corridor|patch and corridor]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahern|first1=Jack|title=Greenways as a Planning Strategy|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|date=1995|volume=33|pages=131–155|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/016920469502039V/1-s2.0-016920469502039V-main.pdf?_tid=40541390-2eb5-11e7-81ea-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1493674346_9ae3299e8869afa5e4604041c0ca6552|doi=10.1016/0169-2046(95)02039-v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[landscape architecture]], the park system is collaborating with the idea of planning [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]], which run through urban and rural areas. These systems can serve the landscape through ecological, recreational, social, cultural, and healthful measures, and are designed with intentions of [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the earliest park systems, in London, came into existence by chance. As London expanded around former royal parks in the nineteenth century, [[St. James's Park]], [[Green Park]] and [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] became part of the urban area. This arrangement was admired in France and adopted for the nineteenth century re-planning of Paris by [[Baron Haussmann]]. It was also admired by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and used to create the famous [[Emerald Necklace]] in Boston. Another example is [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s Adirondack Park concept. These green networks were part of the nineteenth century [[Garden city movement|Garden City Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zube|first=Ervin H.|date=1995|title=Greenways and the U.S. National Park System|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0169204694020114/1-s2.0-0169204694020114-main.pdf?_tid=b9cbffaa-2eb8-11e7-9307-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1493675838_474529eabbfc6b0dd0ddea0aa781e5a6|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=33|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/0169-2046(94)02011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1927, the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission]] was formed to plan and acquire parklands along stream valley corridors in the then-rural northern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C.  Over 33,000 acres (130&amp;nbsp;km²) are now protected in the [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] portion and provide welcome green space in this urbanized region.  A major proposal for a park system was included in [[Patrick Abercrombie]]'s 1943-4 [[County of London Plan]].

The largest continuous urban parks system in [[North America]] is the [[North Saskatchewan River valley parks system]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada, which is {{convert|7400|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size and {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, and also includes 22 ravines, which have a combined total length of {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Ribbon&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edmonton.ca/environmental/documents/Ribbon_of_GreenMaster_Plan.pdf#xml=http://search1.edmonton.ca/texis/ThunderstoneSearchService/pdfhi.txt?query=north+saskatchewan+river+valley&amp;pr=www.edmonton.ca&amp;prox=page&amp;rorder=750&amp;rprox=250&amp;rdfreq=0&amp;rwfreq=0&amp;rlead=750&amp;rdepth=0&amp;sufs=1&amp;order=r&amp;cq=&amp;id=4d9aed517 | title=Ribbon of Green: North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravine System Master Plan | publisher=City of Edmonton | accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest urban parks system in [[Australia]] is the [[Western Sydney Parklands]], which is {{convert|5280|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size and {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/planmanagement/draft/WesternSydneyRPPOMFinalDraft.pdf |title=Western Sydney Regional Park Draft Plan of Management |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=16 May 2013 |quote=It is approximately 5,280 hectares in size and is the largest urban park in Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation model (PCBH)''' is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic.  The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population. This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in [[primary care]].&lt;ref name="Pirl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pirl | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Beck | first2 = B.J. | last3 = Safren | first3 = S. A. | last4 = Kim | first4 = H | year = 2001 | title = A descriptive study of psychiatric consultations in a community primary care center | url = | journal = Primary Care Companion Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 190–194 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.v03n0501 | pmc = 181214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice. Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day. Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms. In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems. Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity). As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems. Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians. The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint.  BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients’ changing needs&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, P.J. and Reiter, J.T. (2007). Behavioral Consultation and Primary Care (pp 1-16). N.Y.: Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably.

== Associated Terms ==
Primary Care Psychology: Provision of clinical mental health services through a population-based focus on the common problems confronting a majority of individuals. Such issues treated in primary care may include response to physical illness, stress, affective concerns, substance use and abuse, and developmental and situational issues among others. Primary care psychologists are co-located with primary care providers and usually share the same physical space in practice. [[Primary Care Psychologist|Primary care psychologists]] may retain the traditional session length of specialty care or may adhere to a brief, consultative approach that is solution-focused.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garcia-Shelton | first1 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Meeting U.S. health care needs: A challenge to psychology | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 37 | issue = 6| pages = 676–682 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.37.6.676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary Care Psychologists may often be trained in [[health psychology]] programs, but not exclusively so.

Behavioral Health Consultant: Behavioral Health Consultants and [[Primary care physician|Primary Care Physicians]] collaborate within the same system. The behavioral health provider works as part of the medical team to meet the wide range of needs with which patients present.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;Hunter, C.L., Goodie, J.L., Oordt, M.S., &amp; Dobmeyer A.C., (2009), Integrated behavioral health in primary care: Step-by-step guidance for assessment and intervention. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collaborative Care]]: This model uses databases or what are known as registries to track and monitor patients with certain conditions. Typical examples in primary care include diabetes and depression. Often the person managing the registry is a nurse or mental health professional who performs follow-up phone calls and assists the primary care team in following evidence-based protocols. There is often also a consulting psychiatrist who oversees the provision of care in primary care.&lt;ref name="Hunkeler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunkeler | first1 = E. | last2 = Katon | first2 = W. | last3 = Tang | first3 = L. | last4 = Williams | first4 = J. | last5 = Kroenke | first5 = K. | last6 = Lin | first6 = E. | last7 = Harpole | first7 = L.| year = 2006 | title = Long term outcomes from the IMPACT randomised trial for depressed elderly patients in primary care | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | issue = 7536| pages = 259–63 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38683.710255.BE | pmid=16428253 | pmc=1360390|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
Primary care has often been termed the "De Facto" mental health system in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;Cummings, N.A., O’Donohue, W., Hays, S.C., &amp; Follette, V. (2001). Integrated behavioral healthcare: Positioning mental health practice with medical/surgical practice. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows that approximately half of all mental health care services are provided solely by primary care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Narrow | first1 = W. | last2 = Reiger | first2 = D. | last3 = Rae | first3 = D. | last4 = Manderscheid | first4 = R. | last5 = Locke | first5 = B. | year = 1993 | title = Use of services by persons with mental and addictive disorders: Findings from the Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 95–107 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820140017002 | pmid = 8381266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, primary care practitioners prescribe about 70% of all [[psychotropic medications]] and 80% of [[antidepressants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beardsley | first1 = R. | last2 = Gardocki | first2 = G. | last3 = Larson | first3 = D. | last4 = Hidaldo | first4 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Prescribing of psychotropic medication by primary care physicians and psychiatrists | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 12| pages = 1117–1119 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800360065009 | pmid = 2904248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while it seems there are various "specialty" mental health clinics and psychiatrists alike, the primary care environment continues to lend itself to an array of psychiatric issues. One reason is that physical health problems can contribute to psychological dysfunction and vice versa.  Examples of the frequent comorbity between medical and psychological problems include: chronic pain can cause depression; panic symptoms can lead to complaints of heart palpitations; and stress can contribute to irritable bowl syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;O’Donohue, W.T., Cummings, N.A., Cucciare, M.A., Runyan, C.N., &amp; Cummings, J.L. (2006). Integrated behavioral health care: A guide to effective intervention. Amherst, NY: Humanities Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  While these mind-body relationships may seem obvious, often the presenting problem is far less clear, with the physical health problem being masked by psychosocial concerns.  In fact, of the 10 most common complaints in primary care, less than 16% had a diagnosable physical etiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroenke | first1 = K. | last2 = Mangelsdorff | first2 = A. | year = 1989 | title = Common symptoms in ambulatory care: Incidence, evaluation, therapy, and outcome | url = | journal = American Journal of Medicine | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 262–266 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(89)90293-3 | pmid = 2919607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychosocial impact on primary care is tremendous (approximately 70% of all visits); however, it is curious that few mental health providers have traditionally placed themselves where the demand for their services is arguably the greatest. 
 
Despite the availability of outpatient mental health resources, research indicates that patients are still driven to the primary care setting. In fact, studies show that as little as 10% of patients actually follow through when being referred by a physician to receive outpatient mental health treatment.&lt;ref name="Slay"&gt;Slay, J.D., &amp; McCleod, C. (1997) Evolving an integration model: The Healthcare Partners experience.  In N.A. Cummings, J.L. Cummings, and J. Johnson (Eds.) Behavioral health in primary care: A guide for clinical integration (pp 121-144).  New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Many experts believe this low completion rate is tied to the stigma that often surrounds mental health care, causing patients to deny or refuse to seek help for psychiatric needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mak | first1 = W.W.S. | last2 = Poon | first2 = C.Y.M. | last3 = Pun | first3 = L.Y.K. | last4 = Cheung | first4 = S.F. | year = 2007 | title = Meta-analysis of stigma and mental health | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 245–261 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.03.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a general rule, patients who do choose to address their mental health concerns express a preference for services in primary care likely due to its familiarity and less stigmatizing environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = A.J. | year = 2005 | title = Mental health treatment preferences of primary care patients | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 581–586 | doi = 10.1007/s10865-005-9019-2 | pmid = 16228695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, as many medical providers will admit, their training has left them ill-prepared to appropriately treat the psychiatric sequalae that presents in their clinic.  The PCBH model has sought to address this dilemma by providing access to mental health services on site to more effectively target the biological, psychological, and social aspects of patient care.  Resulting from close collaboration between physicians and mental health providers, the patients’ needs are more adequately met by care that is more comprehensive and collaborative between physicians and mental health providers.  Furthermore, the patients are more likely to follow through with primary care services, with referral rates around 80-90%.&lt;ref name="Slay"/&gt;

==The Behavioral Health Consultant Model==
Behavioral Health Consultants are culturally competent generalists who provide treatment for a wide variety of mental health, psychosocial, motivational, and medical concerns, including management of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, smoking cessation, sleep hygiene, and diabetes among others.  BHCs also provide support and management for patients with severe and persistent mental illness and tend to be familiar with psychopharmacological interventions.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; Paralleling general medicine, patients who require more extensive mental health treatment are typically referred to specialty care. BHC appointments are typically 15–30 minutes long with the goal of utilizing brief interventions to reduce functional impairment for the population as a whole.  BHCs tend to provide focused feedback to PCPs with succinct, action oriented recommendations to help effectively manage patients’ needs.  BHC interventions tend to be more cost effective&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, L.C. (2009)  What administrators should know about the primary care setting. In L.C. James &amp; W.T. O’Donohue (Eds.). The primary care toolkit (pp 13-19).  N.Y.: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt; and offer increased access to care, with improved patient and provider satisfaction.

===Evidence Base For The BHC Model===
A comparison of an enhanced-referral system to a BHC model found that more than 80% of medical providers rated communication between themselves and the BHC as occurring "frequently," relative to less than 50% in an enhanced-referral model of care. Providers strongly preferred an integrated care model to the enhanced-referral model.&lt;ref name="Gallo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallo | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Zubritsky | first2 = C. | last3 = Maxwell | first3 = J. | last4 = Nazar | first4 = M. | last5 = Bogner | first5 = H.R. | last6 = Quijano | first6 = L.M | year = 2004 | title = Primary care clinicians evaluate integrated and referral models of behavioral health care for older adults: Results from a multisite effectiveness trial (PRISM-E) | url = | journal = Annals of Family Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 305–309 | display-authors = 6 | doi = 10.1370/afm.116 | pmid = 15335128 | last7 = Syropoulos | first7 = HJ | last8 = Cheal | first8 = KL | last9 = Chen | first9 = H | pmc = 1466686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another single-site study at an urban community health center found that embedding BHCs resulted in reduced referrals to specialty mental health (8% of depressed patients were referred) along with improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the care of depression and reduced prescriptions for antidepressants.&lt;ref name="Serrano"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serrano | first1 = N | last2 = Monden | first2 = K. | year = 2011 | title = The effect of behavioral health consultation on the care of depression by primary care clinicians | url = | journal = Wisconsin Medical Journal | volume = 110 | issue = 3| pages = 113–118 | pmid = 21748995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, a recent literature review revealed that improved outcomes in mental health care were associated with several fundamental characteristics, including collaboration and co-location with PCP and mental health providers, as well as systematic follow-up, medication compliance, patient psycho-education, and patient input into treatment modality.&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Craven |first1=MA|last2= Bland |first2=R |title=Better practices in collaborative mental health care: an analysis of the evidence base |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=6 Suppl 1 |pages=7S–72S |date=May 2006 |pmid=16786824 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general the number of empirical investigations that have examined the clinical impact and cost-offset of the BHC model is still limited, although a growing body of evidence supports the utility of other integrated behavior health programs (with varying degrees of integration) in academic settings, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and community health care settings.

====Depression Care====
Specifically targeting depression, Schulberg, Raue, &amp; Rollman (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schulberg | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Raue | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Rollman | first3 = B.

The authors concluded that evidence-based psychotherapies adapted for the primary care setting are comparable to pharmacotherapy alone and superior to PCP's usual care. The use of brief evidence-based psychotherapies, such as those reviewed by Schulberg et al., 2002, are fundamental within the PCBH model.  The PCBH model emphasizes a problem-focused and functional-contextual approach to assessment and treatment of behavioral health and mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; Wolf and Hopko's (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = N.

Research also shows that providing basic training in CBT to PCPs is not enough to produce robust clinical outcomes (King et al., 2002);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michael King | first1 = O.

====Anxiety Care====
Although less empirical attention has been directed toward improving treatment of anxiety disorders in primary care, Stanley et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanley | first1 = M. | last2 = Beck | first2 = J. | last3 = Novy | first3 = D. | year = 2003| title = (2003).

Additionally, a collaborative care approach that packaged brief CBT with pharmacotherapy reduced disability, increased remitted symptoms, and decreased anxiety sensitivity for individuals diagnosed with panic disorder relative to usual care and demonstrated greater improvement in depression, anxiety, and disability measures at 6 month follow-up,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roy-Byrne | first1 = P. | last2 = Craske | first2 = M. | last3 = Stein | first3 = M.| year = 2005 | title = A randomized effectiveness trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication for primary care panic disorder | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 290–8 |pmid=15753242 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.3.290 | pmc=1237029|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roy-Byrne | first1 = P. | last2 = Katon | first2 = W. | last3 = Cowley | first3 = D. | last4 = Russo | first4 = J. | year = 2001 | title = A randomized effectiveness trial of collaborative care for patients with panic disorder in primary care | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 58 | issue = 9| pages = 869–76 |pmid=11545671 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.58.9.869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, clinical guidelines for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in primary care recommend behavior therapy and/or SSRI.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

====Health Behavior Change====
In regard to other health behaviors, strict utilization of the BHC model has shown significant improvements in sleep difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodie | first1 = J.

However, they also suggested that within a population-based model of care modest changes in behavioral health "translate to significant effects."

====Alternative Models Of Care====
Traditional Outpatient Psychotherapy: Commonly called "Specialty" care, traditional outpatient psychotherapy usually involves treatment of mental health concerns in an outpatient clinic or another setting independent of medical care.  Sessions are usually 50 minutes in length and the duration of treatment may vary from weeks to years depending on the mental health concern. Typically, little contact occurs between therapists and patients’ physicians or psychiatrists, and coordination of care may be difficult, time consuming, and expensive. The payment and access systems for specialty mental health are also usually distinct from and more cumbersome than that for primary care treatment.

Co-located Care Model: Behavioral health providers and PCPs practice within the same office or building but maintain separate care delivery systems, including records and treatment plans. However, behavioral health providers and PCPs may consult one another for enhanced treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

==Policy==
Funding has been a barrier to the implementation of the Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultant model.  The cost of treatment and lack of affordable health care has been a barrier for many people with mental illness to receive treatment.  In the private sector insurance market mental health treatment is often segregated from other medical care, isolated in separate systems of care and payment.  Typically this makes it more difficult for patients to access services readily, if at all.  For uninsured patients the United States federal government can provide (depending on eligibility criteria) Medicaid which provides insurance coverage for a large number of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.  The federal government provides money to each state to fund Medicaid programs and provides general mandates on how the money must be spent.  Because the federal government has special relationships with [[Veteran's Administration]] hospitals and clinics and [[Federally Qualified Health Center|federally qualified health centers]] and because [[Bureau of Primary Health Care|several federal agencies]] have identified integrated care as key targets for improved primary care, the PCBH model has been able to take root in these systems whereas only a few PCBH programs exist in private insurance environments. One major barrier in some states (states can set some of their own rules with regard to Medicaid) is the prohibition of same-day billing.  This makes it impossible for a PCBH program since the fundamental concept behind PCBH is the provision of services (medical and mental health visit) on the same day.  Typically eligible professionals for Medicaid reimbursement in federally qualified health centers include psychiatrists, psychologists and licensed clinical social workers.  Access to care and payment tends to be less restrictive with Medicare, another federal program for persons without private insurance.

The other major issue impacting the development of the PCBH model is the dearth of well-trained mental health workers. At present professional training programs with an emphasis in primary care are limited in number which has led to the growth of internships of varying kinds to train students and retrain professionals (see training programs below).

===PCBH and Health Disparities In The United States===
As the population of the United States becomes more diverse, the approach to population-based care must also adjust accordingly.  Projections published by the U.S. Census Bureau estimate that by the year 2042 White, non-Hispanic people will no longer be the majority of the population in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Retrieved from:  https://www.census.gov/ prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The changing population of the United States is generating a need to incorporate cultural competence into the way primary care services are delivered. These changes in the population are concurrent with increasing evidence of disparities in the quality of care that is provided to historically underserved populations within the United States.  Underserved populations have low levels of access and utilization based on economic, cultural, and systemic barriers to care.

Behavioral Health providers in Primary Care settings have an opportunity to directly impact health care disparities by designing "…strategies to enhance cooperative or healthy behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haley | first1 = W.E. | last2 = McDaniel | first2 = S.H. | last3 = Bray | first3 = J.H. | last4 = Frank | first4 = R.G. | last5 = Heldring | first5 = M. | last6 = Johnson | first6 = S.B. | last7 = Lu | first7 = E.G. | year = 1998 | title = Psychological practice in primary care settings: Practical tips for clinicians | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 237–244 | display-authors = 7 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.29.3.237 | last8 = Reed | first8 = Geoffrey M. | last9 = Wiggins | first9 = Jack G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The premise is that mismatches in models (i.e., expectations about illness and health interactions) between the patient and the health provider may render medical care ‘psychologically’ inaccessible to ethnic minorities, resulting in poorer health outcomes for these populations (possibly via noncompliance)."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, T., &amp; Swartzman, L. (2001), Cross-cultural differences in illness models and expectations for the health care provider-client/patient interaction. In S. Kazarian and D. Evans (Eds.), Cultural health psychology, (pp. 45-61). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategies that help bridge mismatches improve treatment outcomes and make care more accessible for underserved populations.

By establishing a role in primary care, the front-line of health-care delivery, Behavioral Health providers gain direct access to patients and providers.  Healthy People 2010, published in 2007, recommended "that early intervention efforts to protect and promote mental health, including screening and the promotion of mental health awareness, become an essential component of primary care visits and school health assessments.".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, D., (2007).

(2004). Primary care, psychology, and primary care psychology. In Haas, L.J. (Ed.), Handbook of Primary Care Psychology, (pp. 5-19). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the difference in how patients, particularly those from underserved groups, may express their distress and respond to the stigma of mental illness providing Behavioral Health services through primary care will likely make services more psychologically and physically accessible.

Providing culturally-competent, population based care can difficult to conceptualize, particularly in the context of the fast-paced environment of primary care.  Hunter ''et al.'' propose "a patient-centered, culturally competent approach for effective communication and care…that includes the Explanatory model of health and illness, Social and environmental factors affecting adherence, Fears and concerns about medication and side effects, Treatment understanding model of culturally competent practice".&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;  By adopting this kind of approach, Behavioral Health providers can help primary care providers meet the medical, psychological, and cultural needs of the patient.

==History==
In the early 1960s, Kaiser Permanente, an early Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), uncovered that 60% of physician visits were either individuals who were somatizing stress or whose physical condition was exacerbated by emotional factors.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt; These findings prompted Kaiser to explore various strategies to better manage psychosocial complaints, with ultimate goal of cost reduction.  Psychotherapy, which was offered as a prepaid benefit, was studied as a method to reduce primary care visits while also more properly (and less expensively) addressing the problem at hand. Studies revealed that by participating in brief psychotherapy, medical utilization reduced by 65%.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;  The initiatives at Kaiser Permanent set in motion a large body of research on medical cost-offset, a term for the reduction in medical costs that occurs as a result of a patient receiving appropriately designed behavior health services in lieu of more expensive medical services.  The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded several replications examining medical cost offset in the years to follow, with reductions of cost around 30 to 65%.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K.R., &amp; Vischi, T.R. (1980). The Bethesda Consensus Conference on Medical Offset. Alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health administration report. Rockville, MD: Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;   One important trend that emerged in this literature was the greater the collaboration between primary care, the better the cost offset.  Likewise, the more "traditional" the behavioral interventions, the less the medical cost offset.
 
In 1981, The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) sponsored the Hawaii Medicaid Project, a seven-year prospective study examining the impact of a new, collaborative behavioral health system among 36,000 Medicaid beneficiaries and 91,000 federal employees in Honolulu. This landmark trial compared the medical cost-offset among patients who received brief and targeted interventions, those who received a 52-session annual psychotherapy benefit, and those who received no treatment. The results showed that the brief, targeted interventions reduced saved $350 per patient per year while psychotherapy actually increased costs by $750 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pallack | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Cummings | first2 = N.A. | last3 = Dorken | first3 = H. | last4 = Henke | first4 = C.J. | year = 1994 | title = Medical costs, Medicaid, and managed mental health treatment: The Hawaii study | url = | journal = Managed Care Quarterly | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 64–70 |pmid=10134004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hawaii Medicaid Project became the prototype for cost offset research and spawned future projects among managed care organizations, with goal of reducing costs.  In 1987, Humana followed suit by studying brief behavioral intervention among Medicare recipients in Florida, with the intention of reducing medical utilization among recent widows and widowers.  Known as the Bereavement Program, Humana learned after 2 years $1400 could be saved per patient via brief group intervention for bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, N.A. (1997). Approaches in prevention in the behavioral health of older adults. In P. Hartman-Stein (Eds.) Innovative behavioral healthcare for older adults: A guide-for changing times (pp. 1-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, other HMOs and regional group practices began to integrate behavioral health services into primary care, including Kaiser Permanente, Healthcare partners, Group Health Cooperative of the Puget Sound,  Kaiser Group Health of Minnesota, and Duke University Medical Center.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;

In the years to follow, behavioral health integration started to gain support from a federal level, as VA systems began to conduct research around the impact of primary care psychologists, beginning with the Healthcare Network of Upstate New York (VISN2).  In the last decade, additional VA systems have followed suit with primary care behavioral health programs of their own to meet the increasing mental health demands of soldiers returning from war.  More recently, federal support has begun to take hold by increasing funding for integrated behavioral health services for various federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the United States. Primary care behavioral health was seen as a solution in FQHCs to address the mental health needs of the Medicaid and uninsured populations, with the goal of better treatment and reduced overall costs.

==Introduction==

===Relative species abundance===
[[File:Hollow curve beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''. Relative species abundance of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing the universal "hollow curve". (derived from data presented in Magurran (2004)&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt; and collected by [[C.B. Williams]] (1964)&lt;ref name=Williams64&gt;Williams, C.B. 1964. ''Patterns in the balance of nature and related problems in quantitative ecology''. Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;)]]
Relative species abundance and species richness describe key elements of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; Relative species abundance refers to how common or rare a species is relative to other species in a given location or community.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGill&gt;McGill, B. J., Etienne R. S., Gray J. S., Alonso D., Anderson M. J., Benecha H. K., Dornelas M., Enquist B. J., Green J. L., He F., Hurlbert A. H., Magurran A. E., Marquet P. A., Maurer B. A., Ostling A., Soykan C. U., Ugland K. I., White E. P. 2007. "Species abundance distributions: moving beyond single prediction theories to integration within an ecological framework". ''Ecology Letters'' 10: 995–1015&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually relative species abundances are described for a single [[trophic level]]. Because such species occupy the same [[trophic level]] they will potentially or actually compete for similar resources.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; For example, relative species abundances might describe all terrestrial birds in a forest community or all [[planktonic]] [[copepods]] in a particular marine environment.

Relative species abundances follow very similar patterns over a wide range of ecological communities. When plotted as a histogram of the number of species represented by 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' individuals usually fit a hollow curve, such that most species are rare, (represented by a single individual in a community sample) and relatively few species are abundant (represented by a large number of individuals in a community sample)(Figure 1).&lt;ref name=McGill/&gt; This pattern has been long-recognized and can be broadly summarized with the statement that "most species are rare".&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H. G.; Birch L. C. 1954. ''The Distribution and Abundance of Animals''. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Charles Darwin]] noted in 1859 in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' that "... rarity is the attribute of vast numbers of species in all classes...."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 2004 (1859). ''The Origin of Species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life''. Castle Books, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Species abundance patterns can be best visualized in the form of relative abundance distribution plots. The consistency of relative species abundance patterns suggests that some common macroecological "rule" or process determines the distribution of individuals among species within a trophic level.

===Distribution plots===
[[File:PrestonPlot beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. ''Preston plot'' of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing a strong right-skew.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;]]
[[File:Rank abundance beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 3'''. ''Whittaker plot'' of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing a slight "s"-shape.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;]]
Relative species abundance distributions are usually graphed as frequency histograms ("Preston plots"; Figure 2)&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite journal | author = Preston, F. W. | year = 1948 | title = The Commonness, and Rarity, of Species | journal = Ecology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–283 | url = http://www.bgu.ac.il/desert_agriculture/Vegecology/Papers/Preston48.pdf | doi = 10.2307/1930989}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[rank abundance curve|rank-abundance diagrams]] ("Whittaker Plots"; Figure 3).&lt;ref name=Whittaker65&gt;Whittaker, R. H. 1965. "Dominance and diversity in land plant communities", ''Science'' 147: 250–260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frequency histogram (Preston plot)''':

::'''''x''-axis''': logarithm of abundance bins (historically log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a rough approximation to the natural logarithm)

::'''''y''-axis''': number of species at given abundance

'''Rank-abundance diagram (Whittaker plot)''':

::'''''x''-axis''': species list, ranked in order of descending abundance (i.e. from common to rare)

::'''''y''-axis''': logarithm of % relative abundance

When plotted in these ways, relative species abundances from wildly different data sets show similar patterns: frequency histograms tend to be right-skewed (e.g. Figure 2) and rank-abundance diagrams tend to conform to the curves illustrated in Figure 4.

==Understanding relative species abundance patterns==
Researchers attempting to understand relative species abundance patterns usually approach them in a descriptive or mechanistic way. Using a descriptive approach biologists attempt to fit a mathematical model to real data sets and infer the underlying biological principles at work from the model parameters. By contrast, mechanistic approaches create a mathematical model based on biological principles and then test how well these models fit real data sets.&lt;ref name=Tokeshi99&gt;Tokeshi, M. 1999. ''Species coexistence: ecological and evolutionary perspectives''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive approaches===

====Geometric series (Motomura 1932)====
[[File:Common descriptiveWhittaker.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 4'''. Generic Rank-abundance diagram of three common mathematical models used to fit species abundance distributions: Motomura's geometric series, Fisher's logseries, and Preston's log-normal series (modified from Magurran 1988)&lt;ref name=Magurran88&gt;Magurran, A. E. 1988. ''Ecological Diversity and Its Measurement''. Princeton Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Succession.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Plant succession in abandoned fields within Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY. Species abundances conform to the geometric series during early succession but approach lognormal as the community ages. (modified from Whittaker 1972&lt;ref name=Whittaker72&gt;Whittaker, R. H. 1972. "Evolution and measurement of species diversity". ''Taxon'' 21:213&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt;)]]
I. Motomura developed the geometric series model based on benthic community data in a lake.&lt;ref name=Motomura&gt;Motomura, I. 1932. "A statistical treatment of associations", ''Japanese Journal of Zoology''. 44: 379–383 (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the geometric series each species' level of abundance is a sequential, constant proportion (''k'') of the total number of individuals in the community. Thus if ''k'' is 0.5, the most common species would represent half of individuals in the community (50%), the second most common species would represent half of the remaining half (25%), the third, half of the remaining quarter (12.5%) and so forth.

Although Motomura originally developed the model as a statistical (descriptive) means to plot observed abundances, the "discovery" of his paper by Western researchers in 1965 led to the model being used as a [[niche apportionment models|niche apportionment model]] &amp;ndash; the "niche-preemption model".&lt;ref name=Whittaker65/&gt; In a mechanistic model ''k'' represents the proportion of the resource base acquired by a given species.

The geometric series rank-abundance diagram is linear with a slope of –''k'', and reflects a rapid decrease in species abundances by rank (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Motomura/&gt; The geometric series does not explicitly assume that species colonize an area sequentially, however, the model fits the concept of niche preemption, where species sequentially colonize a region and the first species to arrive receives the majority of resources.&lt;ref name=He_Tang&gt;He , F., Tang D. 2008. "Estimating the niche preemption parameter of the geometric series" ''Acta Oecologica'' 33 (1):105&amp;ndash;107&lt;/ref&gt; The geometric series model fits observed species abundances in highly uneven communities with low diversity.&lt;ref name=He_Tang/&gt; This is expected to occur in terrestrial plant communities (as these assemblages often show strong dominance) as well as communities at early successional stages and those in harsh or isolated environments (Figure 5).&lt;ref name=Whittaker65/&gt;

====Logseries (Fisher ''et al'' 1943)====

: &lt;math&gt;S=\alpha\ln{\left(1+{N\over{\alpha\,\!}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

''where'':

:''S'' = the number of species in the sampled community

:''N'' = the number of individuals sampled

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = a constant derived from the sample data set

The logseries was developed by [[Ronald Fisher]] to fit two different abundance data sets: British moth species (collected by [[Carrington Bonsor Williams|Carrington Williams]]) and Malaya butterflies (collected by [[Alexander Steven Corbet]]).&lt;ref name=Fisher_etal&gt;Fisher, R. A; Corbet, A. S.; Williams, C. B. 1943. "The relation between the number of species and the number of individuals in a random sample of an animal population". ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 12: 42&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The logic behind the derivation of the logseries is varied&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. L.; Adrienne, W. K.; Kotz, S. (2005). ''Univariate and Discrete Distributions'', 3rd edn. John Wiley and Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; however Fisher proposed that sampled species abundances would follow a negative binomial from which the zero abundance class (species too rare to be sampled) was eliminated.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; He also assumed that the total number of species in a community was infinite. Together, this produced the [[logarithmic series distribution|logseries distribution]] (Figure 4). The logseries predicts the number of species at different levels of abundance (''n'' individuals) with the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;S_n= {\alpha\,\!x^n \over n}&lt;/math&gt;

''where:''

:S = the number of species with an abundance of ''n''

:''x''&amp;nbsp;= a positive constant (0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1) which is derived from the sample data set and generally approaches 1 in value

The number of species with 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' individuals are therefore:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha, {\alpha\,\!x^2\over{2}}, {\alpha\,\!x^3\over{3}}, \dots, {\alpha\,\!x^n\over{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

=====Fisher’s constants=====
[[File:R. A. Fischer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ronald Fisher]]
The constants ''α'' and ''x'' can be estimated through iteration from a given species data set using the values ''S'' and ''N''.&lt;ref name=Magurran04&gt;Magurran, A. E. 2004. ''Measuring biological diversity''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher's [[dimensionless]] ''α'' is often used as a measure of biodiversity, and indeed has recently been found to represent the fundamental biodiversity parameter ''θ'' from neutral theory ([[Relative species abundance#Fisher.E2.80.99s alpha and Hubbell.E2.80.99s theta .E2.80.93 an interesting convergence|see below]]).

====Log normal (Preston 1948)====
[[File:Prestonsveil copy.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. An example of Preston's veil. Fish species abundances sampled using repeated trawling over a one-month (blue bars), two month (gold bars) and one-year period (yellow). One year of sampling indicates that the fish community is log-normally distributed. (derived from Magurran 2004&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;)]]
Using several data sets (including breeding bird surveys from New York and Pennsylvania and moth collections from Maine, Alberta and Saskatchewan) [[Frank W. Preston]] (1948) argued that species abundances (when binned logarithmically in a Preston plot) follow a [[Gaussian function|Normal (Gaussian) distribution]], partly as a result of the [[Central Limit Theorem]] (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt; This means that the abundance distribution is [[Lognormal]]. According to his argument, the right-skew observed in species abundance frequency histograms (including those described by Fisher ''et al.'' (1943)&lt;ref name=Fisher_etal/&gt;) was, in fact, a sampling artifact. Given that species toward the left side of the ''x''-axis are increasingly rare, they may be missed in a random species sample. As the sample size increases however, the likelihood of collecting rare species in a way that accurately represents their abundance also increases, and more of the normal distribution becomes visible.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt; The point at which rare species cease to be sampled has been termed ''Preston's veil line''. As the sample size increases Preston's veil is pushed farther to the left and more of the normal curve becomes visible&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magurran88/&gt;(Figure 6).  Williams' moth data, originally used by Fisher to develop the logseries distribution, became increasingly lognormal as more years of sampling were completed.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;

=====Calculating theoretical species richness=====
Preston's theory has an application: if a community is truly lognormal yet under-sampled, the lognormal distribution can be used to estimate the true species richness of a community. Assuming the shape of the total distribution can be confidently predicted from the collected data, the normal curve can be fit via statistical software or by completing the [[Gaussian function|Gaussian formula]]:&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n = n_0 e^{-(aR)^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

''where:''

:''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of species in the modal bin (the peak of the curve)
 
:''n'' is the number of species in bins ''R'' distant from the modal bin

:''a'' is a constant derived from the data

It is then possible to predict how many species are in the community by calculating the total area under the curve&amp;nbsp;(''N''):

: &lt;math&gt;N= {n_0\sqrt{\pi}\over a}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of species missing from the data set (the missing area to the left of the veil line) is simply ''N'' minus the number of species sampled.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt; Preston did this for two lepidopteran data sets, predicting that, even after 22 years of collection, only 72% and 88% of the species present had been sampled.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

====Yule model (Nee 2003) ====
The Yule model is based on a much earlier, [[Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process|Galton&amp;ndash;Watson model]] which was used to describe the distribution of species among [[genera]].&lt;ref&gt;Yule, G. U. 1924. "A mathematical theory of evolution based on the conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, FRS". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B'' 213: 21–87&lt;/ref&gt; The Yule model assumes random branching of species trees, with each species (branch tip) having the equivalent probability of giving rise to new species or becoming extinct. As the number of species within a genus, within a clade, has a similar distribution to the number of individuals within a species, within a community (i.e. the "hollow curve"), Sean Nee (2003) used the model to describe relative species abundances.&lt;ref name=McGill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nee&gt;Nee, S. 2003. "The unified phenomenological theory of biodiversity". In T. Blackburn and K. Gaston, editors, ''Macroecology: concepts and consequences''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways this model is similar to [[niche apportionment models]], however, Nee intentionally did not propose a biological mechanism for the model behavior, arguing that any distribution can be produced by a variety of mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Nee/&gt;

===Mechanistic approaches: niche apportionment===
''Note'': This section provides a general summary of niche apportionment theory, more information can be found under [[niche apportionment models]].

Most mechanistic approaches to species abundance distributions use niche-space, i.e. available resources, as the mechanism driving abundances. If species in the same [[trophic level]] consume the same resources (such as nutrients or sunlight in plant communities, prey in carnivore communities, nesting locations or food in bird communities) and these resources are limited, how the resource "pie" is divided among species determines how many individuals of each species can exist in the community. Species with access to lots of resources will have higher carrying capacities than those with little access. Mutsunori Tokeshi&lt;ref&gt;Tokeshi, M. 1990. "Niche apportionment or random assortment: species abundance patterns revisited". ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 59: 1129&amp;ndash;1146&lt;/ref&gt; later elaborated niche apportionment theory to include niche filling in unexploited resource space.&lt;ref name=Tokeshi99/&gt; Thus, a species may survive in the community by carving out a portion of another species' niche (slicing up the pie into smaller pieces) or by moving into a vacant niche (essentially making the pie larger, for example, by being the first to arrive in a newly available location or through the development of a novel trait that allows access previously unavailable resources). Numerous [[niche apportionment models]] have been developed. Each make different assumptions about how species carve up niche-space.

====Unified neutral theory (Hubbell 1979/2001)====
{{main|Unified neutral theory of biodiversity}}

The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (UNTB) is a special form of mechanistic model that takes an entirely different approach to community composition than the niche apportionment models.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; Instead of species populations reaching equilibrium within a community, the UNTB model is dynamic, allowing for continuing changes in relative species abundances through drift.

A community in the UNTB model can be best visualized as a grid with a certain number of spaces, each occupied with individuals of different species.  The model is [[zero-sum]] as there are a limited number of spaces that can be occupied: an increase in the number of individuals of one species in the grid must result in corresponding decrease in the number of individuals of other species in the grid. The model then uses birth, death, immigration, extinction and speciation to modify community composition over time.

;Hubbell's theta

The UNTB model produces a dimensionless "fundamental biodiversity" number,&amp;nbsp;''θ'', which is derived using the formula:

: ''θ'' = 2''J''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;''v''

''where'':

: ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the size of the metacommunity (the outside source of immigrants to the local community)

:''v'' is the speciation rate in the model

Relative species abundances in the UNTB model follow a zero-sum multinomial distribution.&lt;ref name=Hubbell_Lake&gt;Hubbell, S. P.; Lake J. 2003. "The neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity: and beyond". In T. Blackburn and K. Gaston, editors, ''Macroecology: concepts and consequences''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of this distribution is a function of the immigration rate, the size of the sampled community (grid), and&amp;nbsp;''θ''.&lt;ref name=Hubbell_Lake/&gt; When the value of ''θ'' is small, the relative species abundance distribution is similar to the geometric series (high dominance). As ''θ'' gets larger, the distribution becomes increasingly s-shaped (log-normal) and, as it approaches infinity, the curve becomes flat (the community has infinite diversity and species abundances of one). Finally, when ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 the community described consists of only one species (extreme dominance).&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;

===== Fisher's alpha and Hubbell's theta – an interesting convergence=====

An unexpected result of the UNTB is that at very large sample sizes, predicted relative species abundance curves describe the [[metacommunity]] and become identical to Fisher's logseries. At this point ''θ'' also becomes identical to Fisher's &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for the equivalent distribution and Fisher's constant ''x'' is equal to the ratio of birthrate : deathrate. Thus, the UNTB unintentionally offers a mechanistic explanation of the logseries 50 years after Fisher first developed his descriptive model.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;

'''Singing''' is the act of producing [[music]]al sounds with the [[human voice|voice]] and augments regular [[speech]] by the use of sustained [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a '''singer''' or '''vocalist''' (in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vocalist ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/vocalist | title=Vocalist &amp;#124; Definition of vocalist in US English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers perform music ([[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, [[song]]s, etc.) that can be sung [[accompaniment|with]] or [[a cappella|without accompaniment]] by [[musical instrument]]s. Singing is often done in an [[ensemble (music)|ensemble]] of musicians, such as a [[choir]] of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[gazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (film songs).

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular [[practice (learning method)|practice]]. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.&lt;ref name="Musicguides"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional singers usually build their [[career]]s around one specific [[musical genre]], such as [[Classical music|classical]] or [[Rock music|rock]], although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] provided by voice teachers or [[vocal coach]]es throughout their careers.

[[File:Gray1204.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords]]

In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or [[bellows]]; on the [[larynx]], which acts as a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]]; on the [[chest]], head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an [[amplifier]], as the tube in a [[wind instrument]]; and on the [[tongue]], which together with the [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[lip]]s articulate and impose [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].

The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]] but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].&lt;ref name="Vennard"&gt;polka dots

===Vocal registration===
{{Main|Vocal registration}}
{{Vocal registration}}

''Vocal registration'' refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chest‐ and falsetto‐like oscillations in a two‐mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355–3359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;

The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"&gt;

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
* A certain vocal [[timbre]] or vocal "color"
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system. Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

=== Vocal resonation ===
{{Main|Vocal resonation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]

'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].&lt;ref name="Greene2001"&gt;

===Chest voice and head voice===
{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}

''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.

====History and development====
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the "throat voice" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;

Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into "chest register", "head register", and "falsetto register" and woman's voices into "chest register", "middle register", and "head register". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.&lt;ref name="Headv"&gt;

However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;

===Classifying singing voices===
{{Main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}
{{Vocal range}}

In [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

Within [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[contemporary commercial music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Vocal pedagogy''' is the study of the teaching of singing. The art and science of vocal pedagogy has a long history that began in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Music/|title=Ancient Greek Music|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to develop and change today.

Vocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper [[vocal technique]]. Typical areas of study include the following:&lt;ref name="Titze2008"&gt;

===Vocal technique===
[[File:Morphometric-Differences-of-Vocal-Tract-Articulators-in-Different-Loudness-Conditions-in-Singing-pone.0153792.s004.ogv|thumb|[[Real-time MRI]] of a [[vocal tract]] while singing.]]

Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:
# Breath is taken
# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]
# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Although these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

Since singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;
:
# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]

====Developing the singing voice====
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.

Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.&lt;ref name="Appelman" /&gt;

Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Extending vocal range===
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much can a singer sing before they reach their limits? May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.&lt;ref name=Vennard/&gt;

There are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:

# The ''energy'' factor – "energy" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
# The ''space'' factor – "space" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
# The ''depth'' factor – "depth" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.

McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

===Posture===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

There are eight components of the ideal singing posture:

# Feet slightly apart
# Legs straight but knees slightly bent
# Hips facing straight forward
# Spine aligned
# Abdomen flat
# Chest comfortably forward
# Shoulders down and back
# Head facing straight forward

===Breathing and breath support===
Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.

These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;

===Vibrato===
[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Singing|page=64|author=Phyllis Fulford|author2=Michael Miller |year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=max+schoen+vibrato+neuro+muscular+tremor#v=onepage&amp;q=max%20schoen%20vibrato%20neuro%20muscular%20tremor&amp;f=false|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|last=Stark|first=James|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0802086143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.

==Vocal music==
{{Main|Vocal music}}
'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.

Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.

====Popular and traditional music====
In many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.

Popular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s–notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the "[[death growl]]".

One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as "[[crooning]]" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive "p" and "b" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.

While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows

Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and  vocal exercises.

In order to become independent and survive  the competitive atmosphere and stay for a longer time and have a long career, singers must learn the skill of [[Composing (music)|Music composing]], [[Music Producer|Music producing]] and [[Lyrics]] writing, they should take advantage of social media platforms like [[YouTube]] and upload their musical contents. Many musicians gained popularity because of social media and got recognition, example [[Justin Bieber]]. After getting recognition and popularity for their "original" or "cover" songs, they can get offers for doing [[Concerts|Live shows]] from the event organisers, which is a large source of income for musicians across the world, [[YouTube]] also pays if the channel of the singer in YouTube is popular and have significant amount of subscribers and viewership. This they can also monetise (earn revenues) from [[Streaming media|Streaming]] apps.
They must also take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of an  [[Music Director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the "talent buyers" that they seek out may be [[Record company]], [[A&amp;R]] representatives, [[Music Director]], choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.

==Singing competitions==
In recent years, the talent of singing has become competitive. Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents. ''[[American Idol]]'' was one of the prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[American Idol]] Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.

==Health benefits==
Scientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.  A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name="Clift2001"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, one much older study of lung capacity compared those with professional vocal training to those without, and failed to back up the claims of increased lung capacity.&lt;ref name="Heller1960"&gt;

One study found that both singing and listening to choral music reduces the level of stress hormones and increases immune function.&lt;ref name="Kreutz2004"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called ''Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing'' (AIRS).&lt;ref name="AIRS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Doctor's prescription: 2 arias + a chorus |last=Mick |first=Hayley |date=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150118161443/http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774037978|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=June 20, 2014|work=|access-date=November 11, 2016|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on the brain ===
John Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that "people who sing are more likely to be happy." This is because "singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being." Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that "music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication" and that "singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech" (260).&lt;ref name="brain on music"&gt;{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0452288522|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who "argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language" (248).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt;

Studies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.

Singing is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title="To be heard": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405–421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on body===
A recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. "Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=April 4, 2016|work=|access-date=November 10, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent newspaper article by the ''Toronto Star'' states that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=The Star|last=Rozien Oz|first=Mike Mehmet|date=April 25, 2011|work=|access-date=November 25, 2011|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing and language ==
Every natural or non natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.

=== Neurological aspects ===
Much research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter "speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits" (130).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann Area 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, "listening to music and attending its syntactic features," similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, "musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca's area" and "the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near Wernicke's area." Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.

Singing has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |publisher = BBC News|date = 2010-02-21|access-date = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually known as the "singing center." By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that "regional specificity," such as that for speech, "may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage."&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the "singing center" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y. Wan, Gottfried Schlaug |title=Neurological Bases of Musical Disorders and Their Implications for Stroke Recovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accents and singing ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

The speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing animals ==
Scholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669–73 | pmid = 5480089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown. (Editors) (2000). The origins of music. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wide dispersal of singing behavior among very different animal species, like [[bird]]s, [[gibbon]]s, [[whale]]s, and many others strongly suggests that singing appeared independently in different species. Currently, there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing. At least some singing species demonstrate the ability to [[learn]] their songs, to [[improvise]] and even to [[Composer|compose]] new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Katherine (2000). "The progressively changing songs of humpback whales: a window on the creative process in a wild animal." In The Origins of Music. Edited by N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 135–150. Cambridge, Massachusetts:MIT&lt;/ref&gt;  In some animal species singing is a group activity (see, for example, singing in [[gibbon]] families&lt;ref&gt;Geissmann, Thomas. 2000. "Gibbon songs and human music from an evolutionary perspective." In ''The origins of Music''. Edited by N. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 103–124. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''The British Society for the Philosophy of Religion''' (registered charity 1027548) was founded in 1993 and is the [[United Kingdom]]'s main forum for the interchange of ideas in the [[philosophy of religion]]. The current president is [[Yujin Nagasawa]] of the [[University of Birmingham]].

The Society holds a major conference in Britain every two years, devoted to a particular area of the subject. The programme of events for the Society is decided at the General Meeting held at the Biennial Conference. The planning of the programme is in the hands of the Committee.

The BSPR is also affiliated to the [[European Society for Philosophy of Religion]] which holds a biennial conference in years alternating with the BSPR’s conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6199">'''Theophilus Presbyter''' ([[Floruit|fl.]] c. 1070–1125) is the pseudonymous author or compiler of
a [[Latin]] text containing detailed descriptions of various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] arts, a text commonly known as the ''Schedula diversarum artium'' ("List of various arts") or ''De diversis artibus'' ("On various arts"), probably first compiled between 1100 and 1120. The oldest manuscript copies of the work are found in Vienna ([[Austrian National Library]], Codex 2527) and in [[Wolfenbüttel]] (Herzog-August-Bibliothek, Cod. Guelf. Gud. Lat. 69 2°). [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] rediscovered the document when he worked as librarian in Wolfenbüttel, and published excerpts in 1774.  These aroused great interest as they disproved [[Vasari]]'s myth of [[Jan van Eyck]] developing the technique of [[oil painting]] in the early 15th century, about which [[antiquaries]] had already become suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, Marc, "The Painter's Secret: Invention and Rivalry from Vasari to Balzac", p. 473, ''The Art Bulletin'' , Vol. 84, No. 3 (Sep., 2002), pp. 469–490, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177309 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophilus' ''Schedula'' allows detailed insights into the techniques used in the applied arts in the [[high Middle Ages]]. The work is divided into three books. The first covers the production and use of painting and drawing materials ([[painting#Painting techniques|painting techniques]], [[paint]]s, and [[ink]]), especially for [[illumination (manuscript)|illumination]] of texts and painting of walls. The second deals with the production of [[stained glass]] and techniques of glass painting, while the last deals with various techniques of [[jewellery|goldsmithing]] and other metalwork. It also includes an introduction into the building of [[organ (music)|organ]]s. Theophilus contains perhaps the earliest reference to [[oil paint]]. The work has been translated into English, French, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Hungarian, German, Italian, Japanese, Bulgarian, and Russian, mostly in the 19th and 20th centuries.

'Theophilus' was quite possibly a [[Benedictine]] monk. It has been suggested (particularly by [[Eckhard Freise]]) that Theophilus is the same person as the artisan monk [[Roger of Helmarshausen]]. Roger appears to have come from [[Stavelot Abbey]] in the [[Meuse River]] region, was active as an artist and author between 1100 and 1107 in [[St. Pantaleon]]'s church in [[Cologne]], and moved to [[Helmarshausen Abbey]] in 1107. The identity of the two men has been argued among researchers for some time, but Freise's conclusions have not yet been accepted by all researchers. Other suggestions have also been made, and at present there can not be said to be a consensus.&lt;ref name="HAB"&gt;[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-soz-u-kult&amp;month=1004&amp;week=c&amp;msg=LUbuR%2BKQguXvmNhWv6Hq3w&amp;user=&amp;pw=], "Around Theophilus": expert meeting, Wolfenbüttel 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophilus, as the author of a "handbook", has been described as a mere theorist, but this view is currently in the minority. The First Book, on painting, is not particularly well-informed, but adequately reliable, the Second, on glass, is better, while most of the Third Book is clearly the work of a practising metalworker. It has recently been suggested that the apparent contradictory evidence as to dating, practical experience, and location of 'Theophilus' is best explained if the ''Schedula'' is understood to be a compilation.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, M. (2011) ''Mediaeval Painters’ Materials and Techniques: The Montpellier ‘Liber diversarum arcium’''. London: Archetype Publications: 56–7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermal physics''' is the combined study of [[thermodynamics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].  This umbrella-subject is typically designed for physics students and functions to provide a general introduction to each of three core heat-related subjects.  Other authors, however, define thermal physics loosely as a summation of only thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chang Lee | first = Joon | title = Thermal Physics – Entropy and Free Energies | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2001 | isbn = 981-02-4874-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Thermal physics, generally speaking, is the study of the statistical nature of physical systems from an energetic perspective.  Starting with the basics of heat and [[temperature]], thermal physics analyzes the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and [[second law of thermodynamics]] from the statistical perspective, in terms of the number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]s corresponding to a given [[macrostate]].  In addition, the concept of [[entropy]] is studied via [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

A central topic in thermal physics is the [[canonical probability distribution]].  The electromagnetic nature of [[photons]] and [[phonons]] are studied which show that the oscillations of electromagnetic fields and of crystal lattices have much in common.  Waves form a basis for both, provided one incorporates quantum theory.

Other topics studied in thermal physics include: [[chemical potential]], the [[quantum]] nature of an [[ideal gas]], i.e. in terms of [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s, [[Bose–Einstein condensation]], [[Gibbs free energy]], [[Helmholtz free energy]], [[chemical equilibrium]], [[phase equilibrium]], the [[equipartition theorem]], [[entropy]] at [[absolute zero]], and transport processes as [[mean free path]], [[viscosity]], and [[Heat conduction|conduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">In [[linguistics]], '''transformational syntax''' is a derivational approach to [[syntax]] that developed from the extended standard theory of [[generative grammar]] originally proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in his books ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' and ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]''.&lt;ref name="Akmajian"&gt;Akmajian, Adrian; Heny, Frank ''An Introduction To The Principles Of Transformational Syntax'' MIT Press, {{ISBN|9780262510226}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged from a need to improve on approaches to [[grammar]] in [[structural linguistics]]. 

Particularly in early incarnations, transformational syntax adopted the view that [[phrase structure grammar]] must be enriched by a transformational grammar, with [[syntactic rules]] or [[syntactic operations]] that alter the base structures created by phrase structure rules. In more recent theories, including [[Government and Binding Theory]] but especially in [[Minimalist program|Minimalism]], the strong distinction between phrase structure and transformational components has largely been abandoned, with operations that build structure ([[phrase structure rules]]) and those that change structure ([[transformational rules]]) either interleaved, or unified under a single operation (as in the Minimalist operation [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]]). 

==Overview==
{{Main|Transformational grammar}}
According to the Chomskyan tradition, [[language acquisition]] is easy for children because they are born with a [[universal grammar]] in their minds. The tradition also distinguishes between [[linguistic competence]], what a person knows of a language, and [[linguistic performance]], how a person uses it. Finally, grammars and metagrammars are ranked by three [[levels of adequacy]]: observational, descriptive, and explanatory. A core aspect of the original Standard Theory is a distinction between two different representations of a sentence, called [[deep structure]] and [[surface structure]]. The two representations are linked to each other by a set of transformation rules, the totality of these rules is what constitute grammar, and what a grammatical description of a language should present. Under this theory, a speaker must have access to both structures to interpret an expression.

Under this model, syntax was placed in the center of linguistic research and sought to go beyond description. Scholars explored the formalism of syntax and psychology of grammar under this model. This led to more systematic research on linguistic data such as [[native speaker]] judgments and distinctions in [[grammaticality]].

Many notable linguists have written on the topic, including [[Andrew Radford (linguist)|Andrew Radford]],&lt;ref name="radford"&gt;Radford, Andrew (1982). ''Transformational Syntax: A Student's Guide to Chomsky's Extended Standard Theory'' Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521285742}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodney Huddleston]],&lt;ref name="huddleston"&gt;Huddleston, Rodney D. (1976). ''An Introduction to English Transformational Syntax.'' Longman, {{ISBN|9780582550629}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Fowler]].&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;Fowler, Roger (1971). ''An Introduction to Transformational Syntax.''  Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, {{ISBN|9780389041528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of transformational syntax were revised or replaced under the [[Minimalist program]].&lt;ref name="Stabler"&gt;Stabler, Edward P. (2000). Minimalist grammars and recognition. Manuscript for the SFB340 workshop at Bad Teinach&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-transformational syntax===

Non-transformational syntax describes competing models. The main non-transformational syntactic frameworks include [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], [[lexical-functional grammar]], [[categorial grammar]], and [[simpler syntax]].&lt;ref name="borsley"&gt;Borsley, Robert; Börjars, Kersti, eds. (2011). ''Non-Transformational Syntax: Formal and Explicit Models of Grammar .'' Wiley-Blackwell {{ISBN|978-0631209652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Travel behavior''' is the study of what people do over [[geography|space]], and how people use [[transport]].

==Questions studied==
The questions studied in travel behavior are broad, and are probed through activity and [[time-use research]] studies, and surveys of travelers designed to reveal attitudes, behaviors and the gaps between them in relation to the sociological and environmental impacts of travel.

* How many [[trip generation|trips]] do people make?
* Where do they go? (What is the [[trip distribution|destination]]?)
* What [[mode choice|mode]] do they take?
* Who accompanies whom?
* When is the trip made? What is the schedule?
* What is the sequence or pattern of trips?
* What [[route assignment|route choices]] do people make?
* Why do people travel? (Why can't people stay at home and [[Telecommuting|telecommute]] or teleshop?)
* To what degree are people aware of the environmental and climate impacts of their travel choices?&lt;ref&gt;Hanna P., Scarles C., Cohen S.A., Adams M. (2016). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Adams7/publication/289247229_Everyday_climate_discourses_and_sustainable_tourism/links/568a8a8308ae1e63f1fbd36d.pdf Everyday climate discourses and sustainable tourism]. Jrnl.  Sust. Tourism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hares A. (2009). [http://www.cstt.nl/userdata/file/PROCEEDINGS%20TTRA2009.pdf The role of climate change in the travel decisions of UK tourists]. CSTT 2009 conf: Transport and Tourism: Challenges, Issues and Conflicts.  pp.141-154. [http://www.cstt.nl/conferences].&lt;/ref&gt;
* To what degree and how do people rationalize the environmental and climate impacts causes by their travel?&lt;ref&gt;Higham J.E.S., Cohen S.A., Cavaliere C.T. (2014). [http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/782524/10/Higham,%20Cohen%20%26%20Cavaliere%202014.pdf Climate Change, Discretionary Air Travel, and the "Flyers' Dilemma"]. Jrnl Trav.

[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699713001518]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where changes in travel behavior would be beneficial to society, how might those changes be promoted?&lt;ref&gt;Truong D., Hall C.M. (2015). [https://web.archive.org/web/20160921060118/http://202.191.120.147:8020/greenstone/collect/ebooks/index/assoc/HASH01e2.dir/doc.pdf Promoting voluntary behaviour change for sustainable tourism]. The Routledge handbook of tourism and sustainability. pp.266-280.

Other behavioral aspects of traveling, such as letting people get off before entering a vehicle, [[queue area|queueing]] behavior, etc. (See for example [[Shanghai Metro#Passenger behavior|Passenger behavior in Shanghai]])

==Data==
These questions can be answered descriptively using a [[travel journal|travel diary]], often part of a [[travel survey]] or travel behavior inventory.  Large metropolitan areas typically only do such surveys once every decade, though some cities are conducting panel surveys, which track the same people year after year.

That data is generally used to estimate [[transportation planning]] [[Scientific modelling|models]], so that transport analysts can make predictions about people who haven't been surveyed. This is important in [[forecasting]] [[traffic]], which depends on future changes to road networks, land use patterns, and policies.

Some years ago it was recognized that behavioral research was limited by data, and a special [[data set]] was developed to aid research:  The Baltimore Disaggregate Data Set which is the result an in depth survey,  ca. 1977.  Its title indicates today’s emphasis on disaggregated rather than aggregated data. This particular data set is believed lost.  A small program to preserve and make available on the web these travel behavior surveys, the [[Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive]], is now under way at the University of Minnesota. There is also the National Personal Transportation Survey (later National Household Travel Survey), conducted every five years or so, but with much less spatial detail.

==Travel behavior and activity analysis==
Analysis of travel behavior from the home can answer the question: How does the family participate in modern society. Consider two non-observable extremes.  At one extreme we have the non-specialized household.  It does everything for itself, and no travel is required.  Ultimate specialization is the other extreme; travel is required for all things.  Observed households are somewhere in between.  The “in between” position of households might be thought of as the consequence of two matters.

#	There is social and economic structure – the organization of society.  To participate in this society, the household specializes its occupations, education, social activities, etc.
#	The extent to which members of the household specialize turns on their attributes and resources.

Moore (1964) has observed that increasing specialization in all things is the chief feature of social change. Considering social changes, one might observe that 100 years ago things were less specialized compared to today.  So we would expect lots of change in household travel over the time period.  Data are not very good, but the travel time aspect of what’s available seems contrary to the expectation, travel hasn’t changed much.  For instance, the time spent on the [[journey to work]] may have been stable for centuries (the travel budget hypothesis).  Here are some travel time comparisons from John Robinson (1986).

Most travel behavior analysis concerns [[demand curve|demand]] issues and do not touch very much on [[supply and demand|supply]] issues.  Yet when we observe travel from a home, we are certainly observing some sort of [[market clearing]] process – demand and supply are matched.

==History of travel behavior analysis==
Analytic work on travel behavior can be dated from Liepmann (1945). Liepmann obtained and analyzed 1930s data on worker travel in [[England]].  Many of the insights current today were found by Liepmann:  time spent, ride sharing, etc. Most academics date modern work from advances in mode choice analysis made in the 1970s.  This created much excitement, and after some years an International Association for Travel Behaviour Research emerged.  There are about 150 members of the Association; it holds a conference every three years.  The proceedings of those conferences yield a nice record of advances in the field. The proceedings also provide a record of topics of lasting interest and of changing priorities.  Mode choice received priority early on, but in the main today’s work is not so much on theory as it is on practice.  [[Torsten Hägerstrand|Hagerstrand]] (1970) developed a time and space path analysis, often called the time-space prism.

==Gender Difference In Travel Patterns==
On November 18–20, 2004, Transportation Research Board (TRB) held its third conference in Chicago, Illinois, with an interest in advancing the understanding of women’s issues in transportation. One of the presented studies, conducted by Nobis et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trid.trb.org/view/773080 |title=Gender Differences in Travel Patterns: Role of Employment Status and Household Structure |author=Nobis, C.|author2= B. Lenz. |year=2004 |work=Research on Women's Issues in Transportation, Report of a Conference, Vol. 2: Technical Papers |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that the gender difference in travel patterns is linked to employment status, household structure, child care, and maintenance tasks. They found that travel patterns of men and women are much similar when considering single families; the differences are greater once males and females are compared in multi-person households without children; and are the highest once they live in households with children. Over the past two decades numerous studies have been conducted on travel behavior showing gender as an influential factor in travel decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5#page-1 |title=Investigating Women’s and Men’s Propensity to Use Traffic Information in a Developing Country |author=Fatemeh Baratian-Ghorghi|author2= Huaguo Zhou |year=2015 |work=Transportation in Developing Economies |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Useful art''', or '''useful arts''' or '''technics''', is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship. The phrase has now gone out of fashion, but it was used during the [[Victorian era]] and earlier as an antonym to the [[performing art]] and the [[fine art]].&lt;ref&gt; George Washington used the term in a letter to Lafayette (Jan. 29, 1798). Washington distinguished commerce from useful arts by stating, “While our commerce has been considerably curtailed for want of that extensive credit formerly given in Europe, and for default of remittance; the useful arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection.”  THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT SOURCES, 1732-1799 (Fitzpatrick ed.).  Other literary sources are collected in the PTO Supp. Br., ''In re Bilski'', p. 11 n.4 (useful arts are manufacturing processes).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "useful Arts" is used in the [[United States Constitution]], [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress|Article One, Section 8, Clause 8]] which is the basis of United States [[patents in the United States|patent]] and [[Copyright in the United States|copyright]] law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;…"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the clause, the phrase "useful Arts" is meant to reference inventions, while "Science" is meant to reference human knowledge, including{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that which is encompassed in literature and the "fine arts".

In his dissenting opinion in ''[[In re Bilski]]'',&lt;ref&gt;In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haldane Robert Mayer|Judge Mayer]] criticized the majority for not addressing the preliminary issue of whether the claimed invention was within the useful arts. In Mayer's view this should have been dispositive, because he considered the claimed [[business method]] not to be within the useful arts. In the same case, [[Timothy Dyk|Judge Dyk]] filed a concurring opinion to similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://works.bepress.com/malla_pollack/12  Malla Pollack], "The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents: Common Sense, Congressional Choice, and Constitutional History" 61 Rutgers Computer &amp; Tech.

'''''Worlds Beginning''''' is a 1944 speculative fiction novel by [[Robert Ardrey]]. It proposed a new economic model and system of corporate ownership.&lt;ref name=Worlds&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''Worlds Beginning.'' New York: Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce. 244 p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Worlds Beginning'' was published one year after ''[[God and Texas]]'', Ardrey's one-act play about the [[Battle of the Alamo]], and two years before the production of ''[[Jeb (play)|Jeb]]'', Ardrey's [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] play.

==Synopsis &amp; Themes==
The ''[[New York Times]]'' gave the following synopsis of the novel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Twenty years from now a retired reporter takes time off from cultivating his petunias and his perennial border to write of his own experiences during the dark days after peace, when American civilization seemed about to crack up for good. The "myth of internationalism" had infected big business with a bad case of economic imperialism. But synthetic revolutions in industrial chemistry soon fixed things so foreign nations didn't need a thing we could sell them. Depression, unemployment, bankruptcies, hatred and fear plagued the country. The business-controlled Government was swept out of office by a labor popular front. But things got worse instead of better. ... [W]hile Americans everywhere sank into fatalistic apathy, a new hope was born in the desert town of Indian Pass in Texas, where the Trans-Pecos Chemical Commonwealth was making a plastic substitute for copper wire that was much cheaper and much better than copper. The significance lay in a new concept of ownership. ... The commonwealth idea got rid of all owners of property and also paid no wages, only shares in the earnings. The employees had no participation in the concern. The harder they worked and the more money the commonwealth made, the larger was their share of the earnings. Every foreman was subject to dismissal by a majority vote of the workers under him. Any lazy or inefficient worker was thrown out on his ear by his comrades. Efficiency was wonderful, morale perfect.&lt;ref name=Prescott /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Worlds Beginning'' also includes a one-page forward by the author in which he discusses his reasons for writing the novel. Included is his sense that during dark times there is hope for the future, but only if those concerned are willing to fight for it. This is a theme consistently developed throughout his work, including most notably in [[Thunder Rock (play)|Thunder Rock]], Ardrey's most famous play.&lt;ref&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "Forward." In Ardrey, Robert. ''Worlds Beginning.'' New York: Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce. p. i. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Worlds Beginning'' was the subject of two dedicated reviews in [[The New York Times]]. The first, by [[Carlos Baker]], appeared on September 24, 1944.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;Baker, Carlos. "America Remade—On a New Yankee Pattern." ''The New York Times,'' 24 September 1944. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The second, by [[Orville Prescott]], appeared on September 27.&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Orville. "Books of the Times." ''The New York Times,'' 27 September 1944. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both offered praise.

Prescott asserted "Mr. Ardrey has written a novel with as thumping a thesis as Bellamy's 'Looking Backward,' or any other celebrated outlines of Utopia."&lt;ref name=Prescott /&gt; Baker wrote of the book that it was: "fresh, tough, cocky, exciting, shot through with the exuberance of discovery. However he does it, with stiletto or meat cleaver, ad copywriter's slogans or heroic analogies, reiteration either plain or fancy, Mr. Ardrey clears a path for the reader through the jungle of economics and brings him out, flushed and panting, to a new world in the making."&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;

In 1948 ''Worlds Beginning'' was included in [[Everett F. Bleiler|Everett F. Bleiler's]] ''The Checklist of Fantastic Literature.''
