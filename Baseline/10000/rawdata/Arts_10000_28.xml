The '''Alliance of Figurative Artists''' was an artist-run discussion group frequented by a majority of the figurative and realist painters and sculptors in New York City in the 1970s, including artists such as [[Alice Neel]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Rackstraw Downes]], [[Paul Georges]], [[Lois Dodd]], [[Gaberial Laderman]], Richard Miller, [[Larry Faden]], [[Sam Thurston]], and [[Howard Kalish]]. It was held in New York City from February 14, 1969 until the 1980s. The first three meetings were held in artists' lofts and studios and thereafter at the Educational Alliance, 197 East Broadway, NYC. Although open to all without membership, it was intended as a forum for figurative and realistic painters and sculptors who felt isolated in an art world dominated by abstract and pop styles. The panels and individual speakers were usually artists. Bring work nights were also held. The organization was close to “anarchistic” (Tillim) and the discussions were often contentious to the point of driving people away. 
Philip Pearlstein noted “Between two and three hundred people showed up at these meetings. I started going there regularly. It  was very exciting. All they wanted to do was to have panels and guest speakers, and just talk about the problems of figurative art representation, and the battles became terrific. It was mostly a split between the intellectuals and the expressionists; the ‘heads and the guts’”. 
The [[Artist’s Choice Museum]] grew out of the Alliance.

'''Ariadne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|i|ˈ|æ|d|n|i}}; {{lang-el|Ἀριάδνη}}; {{lang-la|Ariadne}}), in [[Greek mythology]], was a [[Cretan]] princess. She is mostly associated with mazes and labyrinths because of her involvement in the myths of the [[Minotaur]] and [[Theseus]].

==Family==
Ariadne was the daughter of [[Minos]]—the King of [[Crete]]&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' 11.320, Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 947, and later authors.&lt;/ref&gt; and a son of [[Zeus]]—and [[Pasiphaë]]—Minos' queen and a daughter of [[Helios]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasiphaë is mentioned as Ariadne's mother in ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.1.2 (Pasiphaë, daughter of the Sun), in Apollonius' ''[[Argonautica]]'' iii.997, and in Hyginus ''[[Fabulae]]'', 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Others called her mother [[Crete (mythology)|Crete]], daughter of [[Asterion (king of Crete)|Asterius]], husband-king of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. Ariadne was the sister of [[Acacallis (mythology)|Acacallis]], [[Androgeus (son of Minos)|Androgeus]], [[Deucalion (Cretan)|Deucalion]], [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Glaucus (son of Minos)|Glaucus]], [[Xenodice (mythology)|Xenodice]] and [[Catreus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.1.2&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 3.1.2.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Minos put Ariadne in charge of the labyrinth where sacrifices were made as part of reparations (either to Poseidon or to Athena, depending on the version of the myth); later, she helped Theseus overcome the Minotaur and save the potential sacrificial victims. In other stories, she became the bride of the god [[Dionysus]], with the question of her being mortal or a goddess varying in those accounts.&lt;ref&gt; In creating a "biography" for a historicized Ariadne, her presence on Naxos is accounted for by Theseus' having abandoned her there; in assembling a set of biographical narrative episodes, this would have had to be placed "after" her abduction from Knossos. In keeping with the role of Minos as Crete's king, Ariadne has come to bear the late designation of "princess". The endpoint of this rationalizing process is the realistic historicizing fiction of [[Mary Renault]], ''The Bull from the Sea'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidhe, Fiana.

Since [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] myths are passed down through oral tradition, many variations of this and other myths exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia: Greek Mythology |url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570116/Greek_Mythology.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKdfeoI?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570116/Greek_Mythology.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an Athenian version of the legend, Minos attacked [[Athens]] after his son was killed there. The Athenians asked for terms, and were required to sacrifice [[sacrificial victims of Minotaur|seven young men and seven maidens]]  to the [[Minotaur]] every seven or nine years. One year, the sacrificial party included [[Theseus]], the son of King [[Aegeus]], who volunteered to come and kill the Minotaur. Ariadne fell in love at first sight, and helped him by giving him a sword and a ball of thread (μίτο της Αριάδνης 'Ariadne's thread'), so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur's labyrinth.

She eloped with Theseus after he achieved his goal, but according to [[Homer]] "he had no joy of her, for ere that, [[Artemis]] slew her in seagirt Dia because of the witness of [[Dionysus]]" (''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D321 XI, 321-5]). Most accounts claim that Ariadne was abandoned by Theseus, but in some versions she is mortally wounded by Perseus &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Ariadne.html|title=ARIADNE - Greek Goddess Wife of Dionysus (Roman Libera)|website=www.theoi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Homer does not expand on the nature of Dionysus's accusation, but the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' speculates that she was already married to Dionysus when she ran away with Theseus.

===Naxos===

[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]]: Dionysus discovers Ariadne on the shore of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. The painting also depicts the [[Corona Borealis|constellation named after Ariadne]].]]

In [[Hesiod]] and most other accounts, Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]], and [[Dionysus]] rediscovered and wedded her. In a few versions of the myth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] iv. 61, v. 51; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 20. § 2, ix. 40. § 2, x. 29. § 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysus appeared to Theseus as they sailed away from Crete, saying that he had chosen Ariadne as his wife and demanding that Theseus leave her on Naxos for him; this has the effect of absolving the Athenian culture-hero of desertion. The vase-painters of Athens often showed Athena leading Theseus from the sleeping Ariadne to his ship.

With Dionysus, she was the mother of [[Oenopion]], the personification of wine, [[Staphylus]] (related to grapes), [[Thoas (Tauri king)|Thoas]], Peparethus, Phanus, Eurymedon, [[Enyeus]], Ceramus, Maron, Euanthes, Latramys and Tauropolis.&lt;ref&gt;The classical references for these offspring are at [http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Ariadne.html TheoiProject:Ariadne] and [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DionysosFamily.html Theoi Project: Dionysus family]. Euanthes, Latramys and Tauropolis are only mentioned in [[scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 3. 997&lt;/ref&gt; Her wedding [[diadem]] was set in the heavens as the constellation [[Corona Borealis]].

Ariadne remained faithful to Dionysus but was later killed by [[Perseus]] at [[Argos]]. In other myths she hanged herself from a tree, like [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] and the hanging [[Artemis]], a Mesopotamian theme. Some scholars have posited, due to her thread-spinning and winding associations, that she was a [[Weaving (mythology)|weaving goddess]], like [[Arachne]], supporting this theory with the [[mytheme]] of the Hanged Nymph (see [[weaving (mythology)|weaving in mythology]]). Dionysus descended into Hades and brought her and his mother [[Semele]] back. They then joined the gods in [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].

==As a goddess==

[[File:Dionysos Ariadne BM 311.jpg|thumb|left|Ariadne as the consort of Dionysos: bronze appliqué from [[Chalki]], [[Rhodes]], late fourth century BCE ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]])]]

[[Karl Kerenyi]] and [[Robert Graves]] theorize that Ariadne (whose name they derive from [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]'s listing of Άδνον, a Cretan-Greek form for ''arihagne'', "utterly pure") was a [[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]] of [[Crete]], "the first divine personage of Greek mythology to be immediately recognized in Crete",&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, ''Dionysos: archetypal image of indestructible life'', 1976, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; once archaeology had begun. Kerenyi observes that her name is merely an [[epithet]] and claims that she was originally the "Mistress of the [[Labyrinth]]", both a winding dance-ground and in the Greek view a prison with the dreaded [[Minotaur]] at its centre. Kerenyi notes a [[Linear B]] inscription from Knossos, "to all the gods, honey... to the mistress of the labyrinth honey" in equal amounts, suggesting to him that the Mistress of the Labyrinth was a Great Goddess in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi 1976, p 90f.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Barry Powell has suggested she was Minoan Crete's [[Snake Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Barry B. ''Classical Myth.'' Second ed. with new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]], in his ''vita'' of Theseus, which treats him as a historical individual, reports that in the Naxos of his day, an earthly Ariadne was separate from a celestial one:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of the Naxians also have a story of their own, that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, one of whom, they say, was married to Dionysos in Naxos and bore him Staphylos and his brother, and the other, of a later time, having been carried off by Theseus and then abandoned by him, came to Naxos, accompanied by a nurse named Korkyne, whose tomb they show; and that this Ariadne also died there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by the painter Aison (c. 425&amp;nbsp;– c. 410 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;The kylix is conserved at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]], [[Madrid]]; see [[:File:Kylix Theseus Aison MNA Inv11365 n1.jpg|image]].&lt;/ref&gt; Theseus drags the Minotaur from a temple-like labyrinth, but the goddess who attends him, in this Attic representation, is [[Athena]].

[[File:Sleeping Ariadne 2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]] ''[[Sleeping Ariadne]]'', long called ''Cleopatra'', a Roman marble in late Hellenistic taste]]

An ancient cult of [[Aphrodite]]-Ariadne was observed at [[Amathus]], Cyprus, according to the obscure [[Hellenistic]] mythographer [[Paeon of Amathus]]; Paeon's works are lost, but his narrative is among the sources cited by [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Theseus (20.3-.5). According to the myth that was current at Amathus, the second most important Cypriote cult centre of Aphrodite, Theseus's ship was swept off course and the pregnant and suffering Ariadne put ashore in the storm. Theseus, attempting to secure the ship, was inadvertently swept out to sea, thus being absolved of abandonment. The Cypriote women cared for Ariadne, who died in childbirth and was memorialized in a shrine. Theseus, overcome with grief upon his return, left money for sacrifices to Ariadne and ordered two [[cult image]]s, one of silver and one of bronze, set up. At the observation in her honour on the second day of the month Gorpiaeus, one of the young men lay on the ground vicariously experiencing the throes of labour. The [[sacred grove]] in which the shrine was located was called the grove of Aphrodite Ariadne.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund P. Cueva, "Plutarch's Ariadne in Chariton's Chaereas and Callirhoe" ''American Journal of Philology'' '''117'''.3 (Fall 1996) pp. 473-484.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primitive aspect of the cult at Amathus in this account would appear to be much older than the Athenian-sanctioned shrine of Aphrodite, who has assumed ''Ariadne'' (''hagne'', "sacred") as an [[epithet]] at Amathus.

==In Etruscan culture==&lt;!--Areatha redirects here--&gt;
Ariadne (Etruscan: '''Areatha''') is paired with Dionysus (Etruscan: [[Fufluns]]) on engraved bronze Etruscan [[bronze mirror]]backs, where the Athenian culture-hero Theseus is absent, and [[Semele]] (Etruscan: [[Semla (mythology)|Semla]]), as mother of Dionysus, may accompany the pair,&lt;ref&gt;For example on the mirror engraving reproduced in Larissa Bonfante and Judith Swaddling, ''Etruscan Myths'' (Series The Legendary Past) University of Texas/British Museum, 2006, fig. 25 p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; lending a particularly Etruscan air&lt;ref&gt;"The married couple is ubiquitous in Etruscan art.  It is appropriate to the social situation of the Etruscan aristocracy, in which the wife's family played as important a role in the family's genealogy as that of the husband." (Bonfante and Swaddling 2006:51f.).&lt;/ref&gt; of family authority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13344">The role of an '''assistant director''' on a [[filmmaking|film]] includes tracking daily progress against the filming [[production schedule]], arranging logistics, preparing [[daily call sheet]]s, checking cast and crew, and maintaining order on the [[Set construction|set]]. They also have to take care of the health and safety of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;IMDB Glossary, &lt;https://www.imdb.com/glossary/A&gt; retrieved 2015-02-10&lt;/ref&gt; The role of an assistant to the [[Film director|director]] is often confused with assistant director but the responsibilities are entirely different. The assistant director manages all of the directors in development, pre-production, while on set, through post-production and is often involved in both personal management as well as creative aspects of the production process. Historically, assistant directing was a stepping stone to directing work; [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was an AD, as well as [[James McTeigue]] and [[Akira Kurosawa]]. This transition into film directing is no longer common in feature films. It is more common now for an assistant director to transition to a [[production management|theatre production management]] or [[film producer|producer]] role than to directing. 

== Sub-roles ==
Often, the role of assistant director is broken down into the following sub-roles:
* The '''first assistant director''' (first or 1AD) has overall AD responsibilities and supervises the second AD. The "first" is directly responsible to the director and "runs" the floor or set. The first AD and the [[unit production manager]] are two of the highest "[[below the line (film production)|below the line]]" technical roles in filmmaking (as opposed to creative or "[[Above the line (filmmaking)|above the line]]" roles) and so, in this strict sense, the role of first AD is non-creative.&lt;ref&gt;DGA Rates, &lt;http://www.dga.org/Contracts/Rates-2014-to-2017/ADs-UPMs-and-AssociateDir-2014-to-2017.aspx.{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Their responsibility is to keep the production on schedule throughout the day, communicate to the entire crew, and to maintain the safety and security of the staff and shot itself. An assistant director must be very good at estimating how long a scene will take. (Sometimes a scene running a few pages long on the screenplay can be shot relatively quickly, while a half page emotional key moment may take all day).&lt;ref&gt;CreativeSkillset.Org, "First Assistant Director," &lt;http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/2937_first_assistant_director_first_ad&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IMDB Glossary, &lt;https://www.imdb.com/glossary/A&gt; retrieved 2015-02-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''second assistant director''' (second or 2AD) creates the [[daily call sheet]]s from the [[production schedule]],&lt;ref&gt;IMDB Glossary, &lt;https://www.imdb.com/glossary/A&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the production coordinator. The "second" also serves as the "backstage manager", liaising with actors, putting cast through make-up and wardrobe, which relieves the "first" of these duties. Supervision of the second second assistant director, third assistant director, assistant director trainees, and the setting of background (extras) are parts of the "second's" duties.&lt;ref&gt;CreativeSkillset.Org, "Second Assistant Director,"&lt;http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/2938_second_assistant_director_second_ad&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
** The '''second second assistant director''' (second second or 22AD) deals with the increased workload of a large or complicated production. For example, a production with a large number of cast may require the division of the aspects of backstage manager and the call sheet production work to two separate people.
* The '''third assistant director''' (third or 3AD) works on set with the "First" and may liaise with the "Second" to move actors from base camp (the area containing the production, cast, and hair and makeup trailers), organize crowd scenes, and supervise one or more production assistants (PA). There is sometimes no clear distinction between a 2AD and a 3AD. Although some industry bodies such as the [[Directors Guild of America]] have defined the roles in an objective way, others believe it to be a subjective distinction.&lt;ref&gt;CreativeSkillset.org, "Third Assistant Director," &lt;http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/2939_third_assistant_director_third_ad.&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''additional assistant director''' (AAD or Additional) or '''fourth assistant director''' (4AD or "fourth") or "key production assistant" (key PA) may have a number of duties. Most commonly, the AAD has two broad job functions. One is the contraction of the duties of an AD where the AD acts as both second AD and third AD simultaneously. For example, a production with a large number of cast may pass the 2AD call sheet production work to that of the AAD, especially when the 2AD is already performing the additional work of a third AD. The other main use of an AAD is as an adjunct to the 3AD and 1AD for logistically large scenes where more ADs are needed to control large numbers of extras. The "Additional" may also serve where the complexity of the scene or specialized elements within it (stunts, period work) require or are best served by a dedicated AD in most respects equal to a first AD - directing and controlling a number of other ADs to direct action to the satisfaction of the 1AD and the director.
* A [[production assistant]] is one of the lowest crew in a film's hierarchy in terms of salary&lt;ref&gt;BECTU.org, UK,&lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bectu.org.uk/filegrab/pactrates2006.pdf?ref%3D44 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530081616/http://www.bectu.org.uk/filegrab/pactrates2006.pdf?ref=44 |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }} PACT Pay-scale&gt; Retrieved 2013-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and authority. They perform various duties required of them by ADs.

The sub-roles of assistant directors differ among nations. For example, the distinction between second second AD and third AD is more common in North America. British and Australian productions, rather than having a second second AD, will hire a "second" 2AD experienced in the same duties, and trained to the same level, to allow a division of the duties. 3ADs in Britain and Australia have different duties from a second second AD, and the terms are not synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;UK National Career Service, &lt;https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/tvorfilmassistantdirector.aspx&gt; Retrieved 2015-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calling the roll ==
One of the first AD's most important responsibilities is to "call the roll" — that is, call out a series of specific [[Cue (theatrical)|cues]] for each take to ensure that all cast and crew on set are aware of exactly what is going on so they can perform their particular role at the appropriate moment.  Over the years, special procedures have been developed for this task to achieve maximum efficiency during shooting, which are usually some variant of the following:

# "Waiting on..." Though not technically part of calling the roll, first ADs may keep the set focused by frequently calling out which department is responsible for a delay in rolling a take. If the lights need to be adjusted, the first AD calls out, "waiting on lighting". If the actors are still in their trailer, the first AD calls out "Waiting on talent," etc. However, such calls can be regarded as applying excessive pressure to the department in question.
# "Final checks, please" (or "last looks"). Once everyone is in place, and rehearsals and [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] have finished, the first AD calls out, "final checks" or "checks." This is the signal for any last minute adjustments, especially to hair, makeup, wardrobe and props.
# Traditionally, the first AD calls "quiet on the set." However, it is more common in current productions to hear first "Picture is up!" (or "Rehearsal's up" accordingly) followed by "Quiet please!" to alert everyone that the take is ready and imminent. "Lock it down" or more commonly "Lock it Up" is also a signal (particularly on location) to ensure nothing interrupts the take. This call is crucial for third assistant directors, as this is their primary responsibility during a take.
# "Turnover." While most AD's say both "roll sound" and "roll camera", "turnover" signals both the camera and sound departments to start rolling. The sound department will roll first. After a second or two, the sound recordist will confirm that the recording equipment is running at the correct speed by calling "Speed" or "Sound Speed." Hearing this, the [[clapper loader]] immediately calls out the "Scene" and "Take" numbers so that these details are on the recording. Simultaneously (or within a very few seconds) the Camera Operator or focus puller will roll the camera, and immediately the camera is confirmed as running at the correct speed, will call for the clapper-loader to "mark it" (or "smack it," "bang it," "tag it," etc.). This is done by showing the slate ("[[clapperboard]]") on camera, and bringing the clapper down to make a synchronisation point for audio (the sound of the clapper) and picture (the two parts of the clapper being seen to come together). With the slate quickly taken out of shot, and the camera refocused or repointed as necessary for the opening framing, the camera operator calls "set" or "frame" to indicate that all is ready to capture the action.
# The responsibility to call "action" is shared by either the first assistant director or the director, depending on the director's preference. "Action" may be preceded by "background action" if extras must be in motion in the shot, which is called by one of the lower AD's or sometimes the first. According to [[SAG-AFTRA]] regulations, the director must never address background actors directly on set{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}, so the AD's carry information from the director to background actors.
# Usually the director says "cut," but camera operators may also "cut" to save film if they know the take is unusable. The operator may also call "cut" if the camera has "rolled out," i.e. run out of film.  The Operator will not cut if there are other cameras still rolling or an interruption would ruin the actor's focus. 
# After the director has called "cut," the first AD will check whether the director is happy with the take, and conclude the roll with a direction such as "going again" or "that's a take two" if another take is required. If the director does not want another take, the AD will call "check the gate" (a signal for the [[Focus puller]] or camera assistant to confirm that the camera has not malfunctioned during a take, and that there is no hair or fluff in the aperture ("gate") where the film is exposed). When the camera has been checked, the call from the focus puller or camera assistant will be "clear gate!". Then, if that set up is complete, the AD may call "moving on" or "next set up." These announcements cue all departments and the ADs on set as to the next steps they must take. For example, "reset," "going again" and/or "back to one" may require a reset of elements in the frame extras, cars - anything that moved back to where they started, which the third AD will oversee.

The above roll sequence can be varied by, for example, eliminating the sound calls and the clapping of the slate if the shot is mute or "MOS" ("MOS" is a universal abbreviation for "Motor Only Shot").&lt;ref&gt;"MOS", FilmSound.org, &lt;http://filmsound.org/terminology/mos.htm&gt;. Retrieved 2011-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, for expediency (e.g. if the shot begins with a closeup of a closed door which then opens), the slate may be shown at the end of the take rather than the beginning. In this case, once the sound is rolling, there is an audible announcement of "End board" (also "end slate," "tails," "tail slate," or "tail sticks") so that the editing department knows to look for the sync marks at the end of the action. At the conclusion of the action, the director will still call "cut", but the first AD (and possibly others) will immediately call "end board!" or so that the camera and sound recorder are not turned off before the clapper is clapped. Also, as a visual cue to the editors, the clapper-board will be shown inverted on camera.

The '''[[autobiography]] of [[Manuel Belgrano]]''' (full name in Spanish: "''Autobiografía del General Don Juan Manuel Belgrano, que comprende desde sus primeros años (1770) hasta la Revolución del 25 de mayo''") was written in 1814. It is part of his ''Memories'' and it was first published by [[Bartolomé Mitre]] in 1877 as part of the book [[Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina]]. The second part of the ''Memories'' deals with the [[Paraguay campaign]] and the third and last with the [[Battle of Tucumán]], being included at the ''Memorias Póstumas'' of [[José María Paz]] in 1855.

In this writing Belgrano described the frustration he experimented before the constant resistance from the Spanish monarchy to the liberal changes he promoted from the [[Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="mercaderes"&gt;{{cite book

'''Blind contour drawing''' is a [[drawing]] exercise, where an [[artist]] draws the [[Contour drawing|contour]] of a subject without looking at the paper. The artistic technique was introduced by [[Kimon Nicolaïdes]] in ''The Natural Way to Draw'', and it is further popularized by [[Betty Edwards]] as "pure contour drawing" in ''The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain''.&lt;ref name="Nicolaïdes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolaïdes |first=Kimon |authorlink=Kimon Nicolaïdes |title=The Natural Way to Draw: A Working Plan for Art Study |location=Boston |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] |year=1941 |isbn=0-395-53007-5 |oclc=700158 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjWRImvzWYgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards |first=Betty |authorlink=Betty Edwards |title=The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain |location=New York |publisher=[[Jeremy P.

==Technique==
The student fixes their eyes on the outline of the model or object, then tracks the edge of the object with his or her eyes, while simultaneously drawing the contour very slowly, in a steady, continuous line without lifting the pencil or looking at the paper.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=New at the Godfrey Dean – a document of life on the rails |work=Yorkton News Review |first=Devin |last=Wilger |date=2014-08-14 |accessdate=2014-09-10 |url=http://www.yorktonnews.com/article/20140814/YORKTONNEWS0101/308149993/-1/yorktonnews/new-at-the-godfrey-dean-8211-a-document-of-life-on-the-rails }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ching"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ching |first1=Francis D.

==Importance==
Nicolaïdes and Edwards propose different ideas of why blind contour drawing is an important method of drawing for art students. Nicolaïdes instructs students to keep the belief that the pencil point is actually touching the contour.&lt;ref name="Nicolaïdes" /&gt; He suggested that the technique improves students' drawings because it causes students to use both senses of sight and touch.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt; Edwards suggests that pure contour drawing creates a shift from left mode to right mode thinking. The left mode of the brain rejects meticulous, complex perception of spatial and relational information, consequently permitting the right brain to take over. Blind contour drawing may not produce a good drawing; however, it helps students to draw more realistically, rather than relying on their memorized drawing symbols.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ching"/&gt; Blind contour drawing trains the eye and hand to work as a team, and it helps students to see all of the details of the object.&lt;ref name="Ching"/&gt;

Some artists use contour drawing to warm up for a drawing session.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, P. 92 (sidebar)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Catherine Teresa Murray, appears to have been from [[County Wicklow]], was the daughter of a P. Murray. Little is known of her life, but it has been assumed that she is the wife of George James Cookson (1805-1838), a member of the [[Bengal Army|Bengal Artillery]], whom she married on 8 June 1832.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Desmond&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desmond|first1=Ray|title=Dictionary Of British And Irish Botantists And Horticulturalists Including plant collectors, flower painters and garden designers|date=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=9780850668438|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband died of smallpox on 20 January 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=East India Company|title=The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Miscellany, Volume 26|date=1838|publisher=Wm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3434">'''Chagrin Valley Little Theatre''' is a [[community theater]] located in [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]] in the [[United States]].  The theater has been in existence since 1930, and is one of the oldest community theaters in the country (the oldest being the [[Little Theatre of Wilkes-Barre]], founded 8 years earlier).

The main CVLT facility includes a main auditorium seating 262 patrons, two group dressing rooms, a small scene shop, and lobby.  The second story of the building is known as ''The River Room'', and hosts events before and after performances.

Adjacent to CVLT's main building is ''The Riverstreet Playhouse'', which is a smaller [[Black box theater]]-like space affiliated with, but not owned by, Chagrin Valley Little Theatre.

CVLT's annual season begins in September, and includes approximately eight major productions, including up to three [[musical theater]] productions.  The season also includes performances by the active [[Youth Theatre]], and special events such as the annual ''Murder By The Falls'' fundraiser.

== History ==

CVLT has come a long way from its humble beginnings in 1930. In that year, Chagrin Falls was a sleepy little town with little in the way of culture. Alfred Hill, owner of a short-lived newspaper in the Valley, ran an article in his paper suggesting that interested residents meet and form a local group of players.

The idea caught on, and in November 1930 the Valley Players celebrated their inaugural season with a series of three one-act plays staged in the Federated Church gym. So successful was the first production that 50 more people joined the Players, and plans were laid for a second season.

The Players opened their second season on the upper floor of the Old Town Hall, which was to be their home until a fire destroyed the second story in 1943. For the next several years the Players used makeshift accommodations in schools and other buildings.

In the fall of 1948, following two fundraising drives, construction was begun on the present Little Theatre building on River Street. Architect Frank Draz, who also designed the Cleveland Play House and Karamu Theater, drew the final plans for the theater.

The new facility opened in November 1949 with the world premiere of ''How’s Your Hooper'', by Everett Rhodes Castle of Cleveland heights. Going to the theater became the social thing to do in the Valley.

The theater thrived and rapidly expanded its offerings to include a youth theater group and a ballet school. For many years the theater actors and audiences were limited to Valley residents only. By the late 1960s, as television and movies drew people away from live theater, the Chagrin Valley Little Theatre decided to open its doors to the wider community.

Now a true community theater, Chagrin Valley Little Theatre is recognized throughout the region as a venue for high quality productions that showcase the talents of area actors and delight thousands of theater lovers each season.

==Notable Actors==
Notable actors who have appeared on the CVLT stage include:
*[[Tim Conway]] (Comedic Actor)
*[[Howard Da Silva]] (Stage and Screen Actor)

A '''collection manager''' ensures the proper care and preservation of objects within [[cultural institutions]] such as [[museums]], [[libraries]], and [[archives]]. Collection managers, along with [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[curators]], and [[conservator-restorer|conservators]], play an important role in [[collections care]].  Collection Managers and Registrars are two distinct collection roles that are often combined into one within small to mid-size cultural institutions. Collection Managers can be found in large museums and those with a [[history]] and [[natural history]]
focus whose diverse collections require experienced assessment to properly sort, catalog, and store artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jane|title=Museums: A Place to Work|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|author2=Zenetou, Artemis|isbn=0-415-12724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection manager may oversee the registrar, archivist, curator, photographer, or other collection professionals, and may assume the responsibilities of these roles in their absence within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R., Gilmore, J., ed. (2010). Museum Registration Methods (5 ed.). Washington, D.C.: The AAM Press. {{ISBN|978-1-933253-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between collection managers and registrars==
Collection managers are responsible for the long-term preservation of collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fifield|first=Becky|title=Museum Mondays-What is a Collections Manager?|url=http://thestillroomblog.com/2012/04/23/museum-monday-what-is-a-collections-manager/|work=The Still Room|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They oversee the physical care of objects and form the hands-on problem-solving component of a collections team. Collection managers work collaboratively with registrars, who are document-oriented and responsible for risk management of the collection. 
Registrars maintain facility reports, contracts, and legal records associated with acquisitions, inventory, incoming and outgoing loans, shipping, and insurance. They must keep current with national and international regulations and procedures as they work with custom agents and brokers to acquire security, custom permits, insurance coverage, government indemnity, and requests for immunity from judicial seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Management|url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation-and-collections-care/collections-management|work=Museum of Fine Arts Boston|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities and duties==
[[File:Storage Gallery.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Storage of Peruvian ceramics at the [[Larco Museum]]]]
Collection managers work in cooperation with curators, registrars, conservators, art handlers, exhibit fabricators, mount makers, facilities managers, security, and housekeeping. They are responsible for establishing and maintaining high standards of collections care, from acquisition to conservation to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Manager|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/careers/9914|work=Museums Association|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the institution, collection managers may by tasked with drawing up a departmental budget, providing expenditure projections, and if necessary, raising funds in the form of grant writing.

* '''Acquisition''': During acquisition consideration, the collection manager must research the object, determine its fit within the collection, ensure there are available resources for its care, and in the absence of a registrar, establish the object's [[provenance]]. Once acquired, the collection manager begins the accession process by carefully examining the object and classifying it based on the institution's specific guidelines. [[Categorization|Classification]] terms are drawn from an ordered system of categories and can vary from one institution to another. The purpose of classification is to provide order within a collection by grouping objects with similar characteristics such as form, shape, material, function, use, or social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Class|url=http://www.vraweb.org/ccoweb/cco/parttwo_chapter7.html|work=Cataloging Cultural Objects Part 2: Chapter 7|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object is then given a unique [[Accession number (library science)|identifying number]], tying it to all related records. Next, the object is carefully measured, photographed, and described in a detailed condition report.  
* '''Object Care''': Proper [[collections care]], or preventative conservation, is imperative to the welfare of objects by avoiding and minimizing deterioration and loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventative Conservation|url=http://www.icom-cc.org/36/working-groups/preventive-conservation/|work=International Council of Museums-Committee for Conservation|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection managers are responsible for proper object handling and for instructing/supervising other staff members, researchers, interns, and volunteers on proper procedures. They monitor the condition and environment of objects in storage and on exhibit,  rotating sensitive objects off exhibit as needed. Collection managers clean and stabilize objects, select appropriate archival supplies, prepare objects for storage and exhibition, and pack and label objects for loan. Collection managers also design and prepare exhibit mounts for delicate objects on display and in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fruth|first=Marth|title=A Primer on Museum Collection Management|url=http://www.ohiolha.org/how-tos/a-primer-on-museum-collection-management/|work=Ohio Local History Alliance|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to best utilize storage space, collection managers may need to rehouse and relocate objects within and between museum facilities while closely tracking and documenting all object movement.
* '''Inventory''': A key responsibility of collection managers is performing a detailed inventory of all items in their collection.&lt;ref name="Brunot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunot|first=Trudy|title=Job Description of a Museum Collections Manager|url=http://work.chron.com/job-description-museum-collections-manager-18372.html|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the institution's collection management policy, a complete inventory can be taken every 5–10 years, with spot inventories performed annually. 
* '''Exhibition''': At the request of curators or borrowing institutions, the collection manager retrieves objects from storage and examines them for potential exhibition or loan consideration. After close examination and comparison with prior condition reports, a determination is made regarding the object's current condition, fragility level, special exhibition or shipping requirements, and/or need for conservation. Once objects have been cleared for exhibition or loan, the collection manager cleans and stabilizes them and ensures their safety by monitoring and/or assisting with the exhibit installation and deinstallation. Collection managers may also be tasked with interpretation and case selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Manager/Registrar|url=http://berkshiremuseum.org/collections-managerregistrar/|work=Berkshire Museum|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
* '''Database Management''': Collection managers are responsible for documenting object information into their institution's database management system. The proper input and maintenance of this information is imperative. According to the National Park Service, "the information on the catalog records may be as important as the items themselves." &lt;ref name="NPS, 3:1"&gt;{{cite book|last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part II: Museum Collections|year =2000|chapter =Chapter 3: Cataloging"|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mh2ch3.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum amount of information entered into the database should be catalog number, accession number, nature of accession (e.g. gift, purchase), provenance, object name, classification, materials, dimensions, condition, and current location.  Institutions utilize the catalog information to manage their collections, facilitate interdepartmental communications, and make collections available to researchers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Management Systems: Museums and the Web 2011|url=http://www.idea.org/blog/2011/04/07/collection-management-systems-museums-and-the-web-2011/|work=Institute for Dynaic Educational Advancement|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum Collection Management Software is determined by the size, collection type, and budget of the institution.
*  '''Environmental Control''': Dust, pests, light exposure, extremes and/or fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity can adversely affect objects. The collection manager, in conjunction with the facilities manager, is responsible for monitoring environmental controls, establishing and maintaining an [[integrated pest management]] system, coordinating a housekeeping routine, and ensuring the security of all objects within the building.
* '''Collection Management Policy''': Collection managers assist with  writing and updating [[collections policy|collection care policies]]. An institution's collection is its greatest asset. As such, they have a legal, ethical, and fiduciary obligation to provide for its safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Management Policies (CMP)|url=http://www.spencerart.ku.edu/collection/collection_management_policies.pdf|work=Spencer Art Museum|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Collection management policy is a detailed, written statement that explains why a museum is in operation and how it goes about its business." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malaro|first=Marie|title=A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection management policy guides an institution's decision making and covers a range of topics including collection goals, methods of acquisition and disposal of objects, incoming/outgoing loan policies, care, control, and access to objects, insurance procedures, and record keeping. Some institutions also assign [[emergency management]] (disaster planning) responsibility to collection managers.&lt;ref name="Brunot"/&gt;

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
There are specific skills, abilities, and areas of knowledge necessary for collection managers. All collection managers must be skilled in object handling, able to accurately identify objects, artifacts, and specimens within their institution's collection, and have knowledge of preventative conservation methods and procedures. It is essential that collection managers are educated about the organization, arrangement, and nomenclature of objects, artifacts, and specimens in their field of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jane|title=Museums: A Place to Work|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|pages=75–76|author2=Zenetou, Artemis|isbn=0-415-12724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection managers also need to be knowledgeable about collection management software for cataloging and record keeping.

==Education and training (experience)==
Most institutions require collection managers to have an undergraduate degree in their specialty area such as art, history, or archeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seversen|first=Dana|title=The Salary of a Museum Collections Manager|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/salary-museum-collections-manager-15479.html|work=Global Post|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, from 2012 - 2022 archivists, curators, and museum workers "should expect very strong competition for jobs" with a projected growth rate of only 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archivists, Curators, and Museum Workers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/curators-museum-technicians-and-conservators.htm|work=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this competitive field, a master's degree in the institution's area of focus, museum studies, or library/information science is preferred.

Internships and volunteer work in libraries, museums, and archives is the best way to acquire hands-on collection management experience. Whether paid or unpaid, experience with object/artifact handling, processing, cataloging, preservation, packing, storage, inventory, fabrication, and collection management software is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlatter|first=N. Elizabeth|title=Museum Careers|date=2008|publisher=Left Coast Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=978-1-59874-044-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience or training in conservation would be an added bonus, especially to small museums with limited resources.

==Professional organizations==
There are numerous professional organizations of interest to collection managers and other museum professionals. These organizations provide opportunities to network, share information, and participate in continuing education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7093">'''COMMUNIA''' is a thematic project funded by the [[European Commission]] within the [[eContentplus]] framework addressing theoretical analysis and strategic policy discussion of existing and emerging issues concerning the [[public domain]] in the digital environment - as well as related topics, including, but not limited to, alternative forms of licensing for creative material; [[open access]] to scientific publications and research results; management of works whose authors are unknown (i.e. [[orphan works]]).

COMMUNIA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communia-project.eu/ |title=communia-project.eu |publisher=communia-project.eu |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; effort is aimed at helping to frame the general discourse on and around the public domain in the digital environment by highlighting the challenges arising from the increasingly complex interface between scientific progress, technological innovation, cultural development, socio-economic change on the one hand and the rise and mass deployment/usage of digital technologies in the European information society.

Coordinated by Prof. [[Juan Carlos De Martin]] of the Politecnico of Torino's [[NEXA Research Center for Internet and Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mauro Vecchio, [http://punto-informatico.it/2794108/PI/News/nexa-un-manifesto-pubblico-dominio.aspx ''Nexa, un manifesto per il pubblico dominio''], "Punto Informatico", 25 gennaio 2010&lt;/ref&gt; COMMUNIA started its activities on 1 September 2007 and ended on 28 February 2011. The network includes 51 members (initially were 36) - universities, consumer organisations, libraries, archives, non-profit entities, etc. - mostly from the EU, but also from a few overseas countries, such as United States and Brazil, where similar policy discussions are underway.

Among its activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communia-project.eu/activities |title=The activities of COMMUNIA &amp;#124; COMMUNIA - The European Thematic Network on the Digital Public Domain |publisher=Communia-project.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; COMMUNIA is organizing several workshops and three International conferences in EU countries, and will produce and disseminate a final strategic report. Under the title "Global Science and the Economics of Knowledge-Sharing Institutions", the Second COMMUNIA International Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communia-project.eu/node/283 |title=Full report on the COMMUNIA Conference 2009 &amp;#124; COMMUNIA - The European Thematic Network on the Digital Public Domain |publisher=Communia-project.eu |date=2009-06-28 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in June 2009 in Torino, Italy. The event addressed the conceptual foundations and practical feasibilities of contractually constructed “commons” and related bottom-up public domain initiatives (joint policy guidelines, common standards, institutional policies, etc.) capable of offering shared access to a variety of research resources, identifying models, needs and opportunities for effective initiatives across a diverse range of research areas. The third and final conference&lt;ref name="communia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communia2010.org/ |title=communia2010.org |publisher=communia2010.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held on 28–30 June 2010 in Torino, Italy, under the title of Universities &amp; Cyberspace: Reshaping Knowledge Institutions for the Networked Age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/2010/06/communia ''University and Cyberspace: Reshaping Knowledge Institutions for the Networked Age''], Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, Harvard University, June 30, 2010, 25 gennaio 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In several sessions, workshops and keynote speeches, more than 200 attendees from all over the world discussed such issues as: What can universities contribute to the future of the internet? How can our educational institutions promote ideals of free exchange of information yet cope with the complex intellectual property challenges presented by the Net? Video-recordings, papers and other material related to the conference are fully available on the COMMUNIA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communia-project.eu/ |title=communia-project.eu/ |publisher=communia-project.eu/ |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[YouTube]] hosts several videos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=communia+2010&amp;aq=f |title=communia 2010 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many video-interviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/PolimediaTv |title=Polimedia webTV |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Conference speakers.

Along with on-going activities of its five working groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communia-project.eu/activities |title=The activities of COMMUNIA &amp;#124; COMMUNIA - The European Thematic Network on the Digital Public Domain |publisher=Communia-project.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (particularly finalized to the Project's Final Strategic Report), the COMMUNIA network co-hosted the Free Culture Research Conference&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikis.fu-berlin.de/display/fcrc/Home ''The 3rd Free Culture Research Conference: October 8-9, Berlin'']&lt;/ref&gt; (October 8–9, 2010) in Berlin.

The COMMUNIA network also drafted the Public Domain Manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Public Domain Manifesto |url=http://publicdomainmanifesto.org/ |title=publicdomainmanifesto.org |publisher=publicdomainmanifesto.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a document aimed at "reminding citizens and policy-makers of a common wealth that, since it belongs to all, it is often defended by no-one". The Manifesto has been signed by hundreds of individuals and organizations worldwide, and anybody can sign it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Public Domain Manifesto |url=http://publicdomainmanifesto.org/node/8#sign |title=The Public Domain Manifesto |publisher=The Public Domain Manifesto |date=2009-12-23 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another initiative launched within the context of COMMUNIA is [[Public Domain Day]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicdomainday.org/ |title=publicdomainday.org |publisher=publicdomainday.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year on [[New Year's Day]], due to the expiration of [[copyright]] protection terms on works produced by authors who died several decades earlier, thousands of works enter the public domain (differing in the various countries according to their copyright laws). Several events were also planned for January 1, 2011, to celebrate the role of the public domain in our societies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2940">'''Domestic realism''' normally refers to the genre of 19th-century novels popular with women readers. This body of writing is also known as "[[Sentimental novel|sentimental fiction]]" or "woman's fiction". The genre is mainly reflected in the novel though short-stories and non-fiction works such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s "Our Country Neighbors" and ''The New Housekeeper's Manual'' written by Stowe and her sister-in-law [[Catharine Beecher]] are works of domestic realism.  The style's particular characteristics are:

"1. Plot focuses on a heroine who embodies one of two types of exemplar: the angel and the practical woman (Reynolds) who sometimes exist in the same work. Baym says that this heroine is contrasted with the passive woman (incompetent, cowardly, ignorant; often the heroine's mother is this type) and the "belle," who is deprived of a proper education.

2. The heroine struggles for self-mastery, learning the pain of conquering her own passions (Tompkins, Sensational Designs, 172).

3. The heroine learns to balance society's demands for self-denial with her own desire for autonomy, a struggle often addressed in terms of religion.

4. She suffers at the hands of [[abuse of power|abusers of power]] before establishing a network of surrogate kin.

5. The plots "repeatedly identify immersion in feeling as one of the great temptations and dangers for a developing woman. They show that feeling must be controlled. . . " (Baym 25). Frances Cogan notes that the heroines thus undergo a full education within which to realize feminine obligations (The All-American Girl).

6. The tales generally end with marriage, usually one of two possible kinds:

A. Reforming the bad or "wild" male, as in [[Augusta Jane Evans|Augusta Evans]]'s ''St. Elmo'' (1867)

B. Marrying the solid male who already meets her qualifications.
Examples: [[Maria Susanna Cummins|Maria Cummins]], ''[[The Lamplighter]]'' (1854) and [[Susan Warner]], ''[[The Wide, Wide World]]'' (1850) 

7. The novels may use a "language of tears" that evokes sympathy from the readers.

8. [[Richard H. Brodhead|Richard Brodhead]] (Cultures of Letters) sees class as an important issue, as the ideal family or heroine is poised between a lower-class family exemplifying poverty and domestic disorganization and upper-class characters exemplifying an idle, frivolous existence (94)."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Donna M. ''Domestic or Sentimental Fiction, 1820-1865'' 21 May 2007. [http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/domestic.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this style of novel is [[Jane Smiley]]'s ''[[A Thousand Acres]]'' in which the main character's confinement is emphasized in such a way.

Some early exponents of the genre of domestic realism were [[Jane Austen]] and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]].

{{Missing information|the history of the subject. In particular, nothing is said about dream sequences in literature, and only one sentence addresses anything other than film|date=September 2016}}
A '''dream sequence''' is a technique used in [[storytelling]], particularly in television and film, to set apart a brief interlude from the main story. The interlude may consist of a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], a [[flashforward]], a [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]], a [[dream]], or some other element.

==Purposes==
Commonly, dream sequences appear in many films to shed light on the psychical process of the dreaming character or give the audience a glimpse into the character's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Montgomery |first= Mark |date=December 2010 |title= Dreaming Up Dream Sequences |journal= Videomaker |pages= 57–59 |url = http://www.videomaker.com/article/14611/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance in ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', the purpose of Pee-wee's dreams is to inform the audience of his anxieties and fears after losing his bike.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Other times major action takes place in dreams, allowing the filmmaker to explore infinite possibilities, as [[Michel Gondry]] demonstrates in ''[[The Science of Sleep]]''. Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] points out in the book ''The Committee of Sleep'' that, while the main content of dream sequences is determined by the film's overall plot, visual details often reflect the individual dream experience of the screenwriter or director. For Hitchcock's ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', [[Salvador Dalí]] designed sharply angled sets inspired by his own dream space. [[Ingmar Bergman]] lit dream sequences in several films with a harsh glare of light which he says reflects his own nightmares (though most people's have dim light), and [[Orson Welles]] designed a scene of [[The Trial (1962 film)|''The Trial'']] to reflect the manner in which architecture constantly changed in his dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Barrett |first1= Deidre | authorlink1 = Deirdre Barrett |title= The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use Dreams for Creative Problem-Solving—and How You Can Too |chapter= Chapter 2: Dreams that Money Can Buy |year= 2010 |origyear= 2001 |publisher= Oneiroi Press| isbn=0982869509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films normally present dreams as a visually accessible or objectively observed space, a discrete environment in which characters exist and interact as they do in the world rather than restricting themselves to the subjective point of view a dream is normally experienced from in real life.&lt;ref name="altworlds"&gt;{{cite book |title= Alternative Worlds in Hollywood Cinema |last= Walters |first= James |chapter= Chapter 2 |year= 2008 |publisher= Intellect Books |location= Chicago |isbn= 1841502022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way films succeed in presenting a coherent dreamed world alongside the [[Diegesis#In film|diegetic reality]] of the film. Via transition from one to the next, a film establishes not only the boundaries but resonances between the two worlds. These resonances can reveal a character's subjective observations or desires without breaking away from the objective viewpoint of the narrator, camera, or director with which some theorist, such as [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]], believe the viewer identifies.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Metz |first1= Christian |authorlink1= Christian Metz (critic) |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= Leo |editor1-last= Braudy | editor2-first = Marshall | editor2-last = Cohen  |title= Film Theory and Criticism: Introductory Readings |edition= 6th |year= 1999  |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |isbn= 0195105982  |pages= 800–808 |chapter= Identification, Mirror (from ''The Imaginary Signifier'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] explain past plot elements as a dream sequence in order to maintain a plausible [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in continuing fiction, such as a television series. Such was the case with ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', which had killed off [[Bobby Ewing]], one of the more popular characters on the show; when the show's writers decided to bring Bobby back to the show, the [[Dallas (season 10)|tenth-season]] premiere "Return to Camelot" revealed that the events between Bobby's death and the end of season nine were all part of a nightmare his wife was having.

==Techniques==
Audio or visual elements, such as distinctive music or coloration, are frequently used to signify the beginning and end of a dream sequence in film. It has also become commonplace to distinguish a dream sequence from the rest of the film by showing a shot of a person in bed sleeping or about to go to sleep. Other films show a dream sequence followed by a character waking up in their own bed, such as the dream sequence [[George Gershwin]] composed for his film score to ''[[Delicious (film)|Delicious]]''. In classic Hollywood, the wavy [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] was the standard way to transition between reality and a dream; there would be a close-up of the character having the dream, which would begin shimmering as we crossed over from reality to fantasy.&lt;ref name="transitions"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Morton |first= Ray |date=September–October 2011 |title= Transitions |journal= Script |volume= 17 |issue= 5 |pages=68–70 |issn= 1092-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common contemporary transitions into a fantasy is to zoom in on a character's face and then spin around to the back of that character to reveal that he/she is now standing in an alternate reality.&lt;ref name="transitions"/&gt; Perhaps the most common technique today is the post-reveal in which a character is shown in an awkward or unusual situation, the scene builds to an even more absurd or unusual situation, and then suddenly there is a cut to the character waking up,&lt;ref name="transitions"/&gt;  as exemplified by the opening sequence of ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'' where a [[pep rally]] with irreverent routines builds into an abnormal moment where a character is revealed topless; she then wakes up to the viewers' realization that she had been dreaming.

This is akin to the technique wherein a dream sequence is a [[plot device]] in which an entire story has been revealed to be a dream. As opposed to a segment of an otherwise real scenario, in these cases it is revealed that everything depicted was unreal. Often this is used to explain away otherwise inexplicable events. Because it has been done in many occasions to resolve a storyline that seemed out of place or unexpected, it is often considered weak storytelling; a particularly referenced example of this is the TV show ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' in which the entirety of season 9 was revealed after the fact to have been a dream. Furthermore, in-jokes are often made in writing (particularly television scripts) that refer to the disappointment a viewer might feel in finding out everything they have watched was a dream. For example, entire sequences of the ''[[Family Guy]]'' two-part episode [[Stewie Kills Lois and Lois Kills Stewie|"Stewie Kills Lois" and "Lois Kills Stewie"]] are revealed to have taken place within a virtual reality simulation, upon which a character asks whether a potential viewer could be angry that they have effectively watched a dream sequence, but this technique can also be effective and its use lauded when the status of dream or reality is left more ambiguous as it was in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="dreamvision"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rabin |first= Staton |date=July–August 2011 |title= Dream, Vision or Fantasy? |journal= Script |volume= 17 |issue= 4 |pages=66–68 |issn= 1092-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[camera angle]]s and movements used to depict dream sequences enable this kind of play and confusion between the diegetic reality and the dreamed world by presenting the dream world as a visually accessible space in which the character moves around the same as he does in the diegetic reality, as opposed to restricting themselves cinematographically to a [[subjective viewpoint]] even though dreams are generally understood to be experienced by the dreamer from their own subjective point of view.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; This point is made salient by the films which choose to employ first-person camera angles such as ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' (1995) when it depicts recorded memories experienced via the "SQUID" recorder, the first-person sequence of ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (2005), the beginning of ''[[Enter the Void]]'' (2010), and others, and how radically these moments stand out against normal cinematography even when the subject matter is something as subjective as a dream. Many have cited the general impracticality and unattractiveness of sustained first-person perspective in film as a reason for its absence from filmed dream sequences.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:LifeOfAnAmericanFiremanqq01 12 56qq00013.jpg|thumb|A dream sequence in ''Life of an American Fireman'' (1903)]]
The dream sequence that Atossa narrates near the beginning of [[Aeschylus]]' Athenian tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' (472 BCE) may be the first in the history of European theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Taxidou |first1= Olga |title= Tragedy, Modernity and Mourning |year= 2004 |month= |origyear= |publisher= [[Edinburgh University Press]] |location= [[Edinburgh]] |isbn= 0748619879 |page= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first dream sequence in a film is more contested.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Film critic [[Bob Mondello]] claims that the first famous movie with a dream sequence was [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'' (1924).&lt;ref name="dreamvision"/&gt; Predating this, Leslie Halpern claims that the earliest dream sequence was in [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]]'s ''[[Life of an American Fireman]]'' (1903).&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Earlier than either of these, James Walters points out [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|G.A. Smith]]'s use of a dream sequence in ''[[Let Me Dream Again]]'' (1900), but is careful to note the precariousness of claiming any film the first to feature dream sequence given the rapid transnational development of cinema in its early years and that so many films from the period have been lost.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

Walters traces the dream sequence technique of revealing one thing to be another (revealing what the audience thought was a dream to actually be reality), back to [[magic lantern (projector)|magic lantern]] shows features "slipping" or "slipper" slides in which; some lantern slides for examples would feature two sheets of glass with different images painted on each, say a cocoon and a butterfly. The first sheet would be projected and then the second sheet slid on top of it to reveal a change, such as a butterfly emerging from a cocoon.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Dream sequences became very popular in the early period of film following this change of phase format.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Alongside this technique, a dream sequence which is introduced by a character falling asleep and then entering the dream sequence also became popular via such films as [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]]'s ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'' (1906).&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; What is important to note is these films created a model for dream sequences in which a character's inner thoughts are not represented subjectively (from the character's point of view), but from an objective camera angle that gives the audience the impression less of a character having a dream than of being transported alongside the character into a dreamed world in which the character's actions are captured by the camera in the same way they are the films' real fictional worlds.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

The '''Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI)''' is an Indian organisation consisting of technicians from the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film industry]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. A total of 22 unions belonging to different trades in the film and television industry are affiliated to the FEFSI that has around 25,000 members.

==Strikes==
===June 1997===
In June 1997, some members of the FEFSI resorted to a flash strike during the shooting of the film ''[[Raman Abdullah]]'', directed by [[Balu Mahendra]], protesting against the director engaging "outsiders". This led into a major crisis when FEFSI launched an indefinite strike, affecting other film units as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/news/jul/07madras.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The state government's intervened and FEFSI called off the strike after a week. However, the producers hardened their stand and insisted that they would not engage any technician or worker associated with FEFSI. They complained that the rising wages of technical staff and artistes were contributing towards the box office run of Tamil films in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/entertai/jun/17mad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They demanded that workers and technicians form new organisations exclusively for the production of Tamil films, on the lines of organisations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The issue escalated when the organisation's leader [[Vijayan (stunt coordinator)|Vijayan]] declined to budge from his demands and was able failed to gather support from a series of prominent actors and film director [[Bharathiraja]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/News/97/Oct/strike.htm&lt;/ref&gt; vijayan also became the key person for the strike which led to suicide of some members and some lost their asserts due to this strike.

Films delayed included ''[[Marudhanayagam]]'', ''[[Jeans (film)|Jeans]]'', ''[[Sethu (film)|Sethu]]'' and ''[[Kadhal Rojave]]''. Producer [[K. T. Kunjumon]] said his losses amounted to {{INR}} 3 [[lakh]]s after a large set he had erected for his film ''[[Ratchagan]]'' (a replica of the massive Rajaji Hall) was destroyed in the rain. Several new Cielo cars parked near the set were also damaged, resulting in a loss of another {{INR}} 7 lakhs, he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/entertai/jun/30mad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The strike lasted for over six months, delaying the production of several films before easing. In June 1998, FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Association (TFPA) merged and formed a new organisation called the Tamil Nadu Film Producers and Employees Federation. An agreement to this effect was signed by the representatives of the two organisations in the presence of then Chief Minister [[Muthuvel Karunanidhi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98jul06/nation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2011===
Talks between FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) over wages and working hours became a heated matter in early 2011 and FEFSI members wanted the issue regarding increase in salary to be sorted out immediately, calling for a strike in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/movies/fefsi-to-strike-from-monday-news-tamil-lgflWVajbbi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 2012===
An unofficial two-week strike was held in early February 2012, with nearly 5000 members of FEFSI engaging on a day-long hunger strike at Isai Kalaignargal Sangam in Vadapalani, demanding that the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) implement the revised wages for its members. The strike was made official briefly in April 2012 but did not disrupt any big-budget film productions, and soon the problems were eased out after the intervention of the State's Labour Minister [[S. T. Chellapandian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-10/clash-brings-kollywood-to-a-standstill-fefsi-strike-29-05-13.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moviecrow.com/News/824/fefsi-strike-fails-as-tamil-movies-carry-on&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/movies/fefsi-calls-off-strike-rumblings-in-tfpc-news-tamil-melj3Bebfgd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2013===
A clash broke out when the drivers' union learnt that one of the camera crews supposedly hired a private agency for their logistics, instead of approaching the assigned drivers and this was contrary to union expectations.&lt;ref&gt;http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-10/clash-brings-kollywood-to-a-standstill-fefsi-strike-29-05-13.html&lt;/ref&gt; After brief disturbances in May 2013, FEFSI announced a decision to boycott all vehicles of the drivers’ union. In June 2013, FEFSI announced that they would go an indefinite strike after it was alleged that members of the drivers union had assaulted members of the technicians union at Nerkundram Paadhai on Monday, when they were loading food into an autorickshaw for a film shoot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unions-clash-puts-film-shoots-on-hold/article4760404.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later the strike was cancelled and film shootings resumed.

As a fallout of the strike, the Tamil Nadu Chinna Thirai Producers Council president [[Raadhika]] announced that the council had decided to break away from FEFSI.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/film-technicians-union-calls-off-strike-shoots-to-resume/article4763699.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formalism''' is a school of [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] having mainly to do with structural purposes of a particular text. It is the study of a text without taking into account any outside influence. Formalism rejects or sometimes simply "brackets" (''i.e.'', ignores for the purpose of analysis) notions of culture or societal influence, authorship, and content, and instead focuses on modes, genres, discourse, and forms.

==In literary theory==
In [[literary theory]], formalism refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret, or evaluate the inherent features of a text. These features include not only [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] but also literary devices such as meter and [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]. The formalistic approach reduces the importance of a text’s historical, biographical, and cultural context.

Formalism rose to prominence in the early twentieth century as a reaction against [[Romanticist]] theories of literature, which centered on the artist and individual creative genius, and instead placed the text itself back into the spotlight to show how the text was indebted to forms and other works that had preceded it. Two schools of formalist literary criticism developed, [[Russian formalism]], and soon after Anglo-American [[New Criticism]]. Formalism was the dominant mode of academic literary study in the US at least from the end of the Second World War through the 1970s, especially as embodied in [[René Wellek]] and [[Austin Warren]]'s ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1948, 1955, 1962).

Beginning in the late 1970s, formalism was substantially displaced by various approaches (often with political aims or assumptions) that were suspicious of the idea that a literary work could be separated from its origins or uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The term has often had a pejorative cast and has been used by opponents to indicate either aridity or ideological deviance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some recent trends in academic literary criticism suggest that formalism may be making a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;“Formalism and its Malcontents: Benjamin and de Man on the Function of Allegory”, Jim Hansen, New Literary History, 2004, Vol. 35, No. 4, 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
William H Thelin criticizes Maxine Hairston’s approach to teaching composition from a current-traditional standpoint, which she then mixes with the political. He claims that “No matter how sound the politics … the student would have no choice but to regurgitate that dogma in the clearest terms possible and to shift concentration onto matters of structure and correctness”.&lt;ref&gt;Thelin, WIlliam H. "Advocating Language: An Ethical Approach to Politics in the Classroom". ''The Ethics of Writing Instruction''. Michael Pemberton, ed. Stamford: Ablex Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Ann Cain writes that “formalism asserts that the text stands on its own as a complete entity, apart from the writer who produced it”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"&gt;Cain, Mary Ann. "Problematizing Formalism: A Double-Cross of Genre Boundaries." ''College Composition and Communication''. 51:1 Sept 1999. 89-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Cain says that “one can regard textual products as teachable and still maintain that being a writer is a "natural" act, one not subject to instruction.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Composition, like creative writing, has flourished under the assumption that students are already writers, or have the capacity to learn-and that everyone should be writers. Yet the questions composition tends to pose within this assumption are not so much about which aspects of writing can or cannot be taught, but how writing can be taught and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;
In regards to formalist composition, one must ask, “to what extent is this ‘need’ for ‘academic discourse’ real – any more than the need for more ‘imaginative writing’ is real-except to perform some function, to get something done?”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;

==Research==
Formalism research involves studying the ways in which students present their writing.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Some ways formalism research is conducted involves allowing the text to speak to the readers versus cutting out unintended meaning in a written piece. Respectively, these two methods deal with language as the “master” writer versus a teacher as the “master” writer.

===Russian formalism===
{{Main|Russian formalism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Russian Formalism refers to the work of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language (OPOYAZ) founded in 1916 in St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) by [[Boris Eichenbaum]], [[Viktor Shklovsky]] and [[Yury Tynyanov]], and secondarily to the Moscow Linguistic Circle founded in 1914 by [[Roman Jakobson]]. (The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] is also often associated with the movement.) Eichenbaum's 1926 essay "The Theory of the 'Formal Method'" (translated in Lemon and Reis) provides an economical overview of the approach the Formalists advocated, which included the following basic ideas:
*The aim is to produce "a science of literature that would be both independent and factual," which is sometimes designated by the term ''[[poetics]].''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
*Since literature is made of language, linguistics will be a foundational element of the science of literature.
*Literature is autonomous from external conditions in the sense that literary language is distinct from ordinary uses of language, not least because it is not (entirely) communicative.
*Literature has its own history, a history of innovation in formal structures, and is not determined (as some crude versions of Marxism have it) by external, material history.
*What a work of literature says cannot be separated from ''how'' the literary work says it, and therefore the form and  of a work, far from being merely the decorative wrapping of an isolable content, is in fact part of the content of the work.

According to Eichenbaum, Shklovsky was the lead critic of the group, and Shklovsky contributed two of their most well-known concepts: defamiliarization (''ostraneniye,'' more literally, 'estrangement') and the plot/story distinction (''[[syuzhet]]/fabula''). "Defamiliarization" is one of the crucial ways in which literary language distinguishes itself from ordinary, communicative language, and is a feature of how art in general works, namely by presenting the world in a strange and new way that allows us to see things differently. Innovation in literary history is, according to Shklovsky, partly a matter of finding new techniques of defamiliarization. The plot/story distinction separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the story) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the plot). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the significance of the form of a literary work in order to define its "literariness." For the Russian Formalists as a whole, form is what makes something art to begin with, so in order to understand a work of art as a work of art (rather than as an ornamented communicative act) one must focus on its form.

This emphasis on form, seemingly at the expense of thematic content, was not well-received after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. One of the most sophisticated critiques of the Formalist project was [[Leon Trotsky]]'s ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'' (1924).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Trotsky does not wholly dismiss the Formalist approach, but insists that "the methods of formal analysis are necessary, but insufficient" because they neglect the social world with which the human beings who write and read literature are bound up: "The form of art is, to a certain and very large degree, independent, but the artist who creates this form, and the spectator who is enjoying it, are not empty machines, one for creating form and the other for appreciating it. They are living people, with a crystallized psychology representing a certain unity, even if not entirely harmonious. This psychology is the result of social conditions" (180, 171). The Formalists were thus accused of being politically reactionary because of such unpatriotic remarks as Shklovsky's (quoted by Trotsky) that "Art was always free of life, and its color never reflected the color of the flag which waved over the fortress of the City"(source?)(164). The leaders of the movement suffered political persecution beginning in the 1920s, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power, which largely put an end to their inquiries. But their ideas continued to influence subsequent thinkers, partly due to Tzvetan Todorov's translations of their works in the 1960s and 1970s, including Todorov himself, Barthes, Genette and Jauss.

==The Prague Circle and structuralism==
{{Main|Prague linguistic circle}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The Moscow Linguistic Circle founded by Jakobson was more directly concerned with recent developments in linguistics than Eichenbaum's group. Jakobson left Moscow for Prague in 1920 and in 1926 co-founded the Prague Linguistic Circle, which embodied similar interests, especially in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

'''Foundland''' is an art collective founded in 2009 in [[Amsterdam]] by [[Syrian people|Syrian]] artist Ghalia Elsrakbi and [[South Africa|South African]] artist, Lauren Alexander. The name Foundland was chosen by the two artists because it suggests using [[Found object|found objects and art]], but also that it's about "reclaiming."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://impakt.nl/archive/2012/blog-2012/interview-with-lauren-alexander-of-foundland/|title=Interview With Lauren Alexander of Foundland|last=|first=|date=27 October 2012|work=Impakt|access-date=2 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective is based in [[Cairo]] and Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dutchartinstitute.eu/page/6315/foundland|title=Foundland|last=|first=|date=|website=Dutch Art Institute|publisher=|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== About ==
Elsrakbi was born in [[Damascus]] in 1978 and lived in Syria until 2000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artnews.com/2014/11/04/women-of-the-arab-art-world/|title=The Women of the Arab Art World|last=Wei|first=Lilly|date=4 November 2014|work=Art News|access-date=2 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied in the [[Netherlands]] where she attended the [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie|Sandberg Institute]] in [[Amsterdam]], graduating in 2009.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/144113/locating-loss-from-damascus-to-manhattans-little-syria/|title=Locating Loss, from Damascus to Manhattan’s Little Syria|last=McDermott|first=Emily|date=19 August 2014|website=Hyperallergenic|publisher=|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she met [[South Africa|South African]] artist, Lauren Alexander, and together they created the art group, Foundland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2007 she returned to Damascus and visited regularly until "it became too dangerous."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She eventually moved to [[Cairo]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Alexander was born [[Cape Town]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edgeofarabia.com/artists/foundland|title=Foundland|last=|first=|date=|website=Edge of Arabia|publisher=|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a bachelor's degree in graphic design from the [[Stellenbosch University|University of Stellenbosch]] and a Masters in Design from the Sandberg Institute.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2015, Foundland was included on the shortlist for the [[Prix de Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://artforum.com/news/id=56877|title=Magali Reus Receives 2015 Prix de Rome|last=|first=|date=18 December 2015|work=Art Forum|access-date=2 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Elsrakbi feels that it is important to live in the [[Middle East]] so that she and her art collective can "be a bridge between two cultures."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Elsrakbi and Foundland began to focus on themes relating to Arab politics after the [[Syrian Civil War|2011 Syrian uprising]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alexander feels that she and Elsrakbi have a similar approach to art and subject matter, which is what drew them together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Foundland's work uses graphic design elements mixed with drawings, video and photography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Elsrakbi and Alexander find media and social media observations and reports about the Middle East, using these to create a [[database]] of both visual art and information.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acaw.info/?p=8948|title=Edge of Arabia ISCP Residency|last=|first=|date=8 August 2014|website=Asia Contemporary Art Week|publisher=|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then make connections based on the information they have found and "create alternate narratives to media reporting through innovative image making and personal interpretation."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Fourteen Words''', '''14''', or '''14/88''', is a reference to the fourteen-word slogan “'''We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children''',”&lt;ref name="ADL14"/&gt; or less commonly "Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Mattias| last = Gardell| title = Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism| page = 69}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The slogans were originally coined by [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]],&lt;ref name="Michael2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michael|first=George|year=2009|title=David Lane and the Fourteen Words|journal=Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions|volume=10|issue=1|pages=43–61|doi=10.1080/14690760903067986|issn=1469-0764}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founding member of the [[Terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]].&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern American Extremism and Domestic Terrorism: An Encyclopedia of Extremists and Extremist Groups|last=Balleck|first=Barry|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2018|isbn=978-1440852749|location=[[United States]]|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms were coined while he was serving a 190-year sentence in [[federal prison]] for his role in violating the civil rights of [[Jews|Jewish]] talk show host [[Alan Berg]], who was murdered by another member of the group in June 1984.&lt;ref name="Thompson-20-10-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/white-hate-group-campaign-of-menace-rise-above-movement|title=Racist, Violent, Unpunished: A White Hate Group's Campaign of Menace|last1=Thompson|first1=A.C.|date=19 October 2017|publisher=propublica.org|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogans were publicized through now-defunct [[Wotansvolk|14 Word Press]], founded in 1995 by Lane's wife to disseminate her husband's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-lane|title=David Lane|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="splc profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=David Lane |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-lane |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane also used the phrasing in other pamphlets including the "14 points" of his [[White genocide conspiracy theory|White Genocide Manifesto]] and further in his [[88 Precepts]] essay, stressing his support for racial and [[ethnic religion]]s, opposition to [[Cornelis Tiele#Universal religions|universal religions]] (such as [[Christianity]]), his opposition to [[miscegenation]], his [[anti-Americanism]],&lt;ref name="splc profile"/&gt; and support for [[racial segregation|racial separatism]].&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Werwolf!: The History of the National Socialist Guerrilla Movement, 1944–1946|last=Biddiscombe|first=Perry|publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1998|isbn=978-0-8020-0862-6 |at=note 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-truth-about-88-new-book-reveals-secret-meaning-of-neo-nazi-codes-a-770820.html|title=The Truth about 88: New Book Reveals Secret Meaning of Neo-Nazi Codes|date=June 27, 2011|work=[[Spiegel Online]]|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his concepts, ideology and values, particularly the Fourteen Words slogan, are either inspired by or derived from [[Adolf Hitler]]'s autobiographical book ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-freedom-party |title=The American Freedom Party (formerly American Third Position) is a political party initially established by racist Southern California skinheads that aims to deport immigrants and return the United States to white rule. |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phrasing ==
The terms were later adopted by [[white supremacist]]s&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt; and [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazis]],&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt; [[white nationalist]]s and [[identitarians]], members of the [[far-right]] and [[alt-right]], the most widely used variation being:

Another less commonly used variation is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Mattias| last = Gardell| title = Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism| page = 69}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It is sometimes combined with [[88 (number)#In white nationalism|88]], as in "14/88" or "1488" with the 8s representing the eighth letter of the alphabet (H), with "HH" standing for "[[Heil Hitler]]",&lt;ref name="Dictionary of White Supremacist Slang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/life/2017/01/dictionary-of-white-supermacist-slang-symbols/|title=A Complete Dictionary of White Supremacist Slang and Symbols|last=Ruiz|first=Stephen|date=January 11, 2017|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply as a reference to Lane's [[88 Precepts]],&lt;ref name="88 meaning"&gt;{{cite news |author=James Ridgeway |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/28/uselections-obama-racism |title=Fourteen Words that spell racism |date=28 October 2008 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which when combined with "14" refer to Lane's white supremacist [[neo-pagan]] religion, [[Wotansvolk|Wotanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Ruiz |url=https://www.complex.com/life/2017/01/dictionary-of-white-supermacist-slang-symbols/numbers-abbreves-acronyms-one |title=A Complete Dictionary of White Supremacist Slang and Symbols |publisher=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:Mein Kampf dust jacket.jpeg|thumb|Scholars say the slogan was influenced by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which was also written from prison]]
A strong resemblance of the first definition to a statement in Adolf Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' has been pointed out, albeit not by Lane or by Fourteen Word Press. Scholars such as Barry Balleck have stated that Lane was almost certainly influenced by Hitler, specifically the following statement in ''Mein Kampf''.&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and reproduction of our race and our people, the sustenance of our children and the purity of our blood, the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that our people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted it by the creator of the universe. Every thought and every idea, every doctrine and all knowledge, must serve this purpose. And everything must be examined from this point of view and used or rejected according to its utility. ''(Vol. I, Chapter 8)''&lt;ref name="Balleck 2018 p.4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Audrey Hepburn screentest in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Audrey Hepburn]] has been cited as the epitome of a gamine.]]
A '''gamine''' is  a slim, elegant young woman who is, or is perceived to be, mischievous, teasing or sexually appealing.

The word ''gamine'' is a French word, the feminine form of ''gamin'', originally meaning [[Street Urchin|urchin]], [[waif]] or playful, naughty child. It was used in English from about the mid-19th century (for example, by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] in 1840 in one of his Parisian sketches), but in the 20th century, came to be applied in its more modern sense.

== Lexicography ==
In 1997 the publisher [[HarperCollins]] drew up a list of 101 words – one a year – that defined the years 1896 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Times'', 3 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt; "Gamine" was chosen for 1899, being described by Philip Howard in ''[[The Times]]'' as follows:

{{quote|An [[elf]]ish young woman. [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'' was the archetypal, unforgettable, adorable gamine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Gamine'' has been used particularly of such women in the performing arts or world of fashion. In that context, the closest English word – of [[Anglo-Norman langauge|Anglo-Norman]] origin – is probably "waif" (although "gamine" is often seen as conveying an additional sense of style and [[chic (style)|chic]]). For example, in a press release of 1964, impresario [[Andrew Oldham]] described the 17-year-old singer [[Marianne Faithfull]] as "shy, wistful, waif-like";&lt;ref&gt;''Faithfull – An Autobiography'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and writer and musician John Amis referred to German-born actress [[Luise Rainer]] (b. 1910) as [[Paul Muni]]'s "waif-wife" in the 1937 film, ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oldie'', August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaminerie'' has sometimes been used in English with reference to the behaviour or characteristics of gamin(e)s.

== In silent films ==
In the early 20th century, [[silent films]] brought to public attention a number of actresses who sported a gamine look. These included the Canadian-born [[Mary Pickford]] (1892–1979), who became known as "America’s Sweetheart" and, with her husband [[Douglas Fairbanks]], was one of the founders of the film production company [[United Artists]]; [[Lillian Gish]] (1893–1993), notably in ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920); and [[Louise Brooks]] (1906–86), whose short [[bob cut|bobbed]] [[hairstyles, eponymous|hairstyle]], widely copied in the 1920s, came to be regarded as both a gamine and a "[[boho-chic|Bohemian]]" trait (this style having first appeared among the Paris ''demi-monde'' before World War I and among London art students during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among the Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1936, [[Charlie Chaplin]] cast his then-girlfriend [[Paulette Goddard]] (1910–1990) as an orphaned gamine (credited as "A Gamin") in one of his last silent films, ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]''.

== Audrey Hepburn and gamines of the 1950s ==
In the 1950s "gamine" was applied notably to the style and appearance of the [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born actress [[Audrey Hepburn]] (1929–1993): for example, in the films, ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954) and ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957). Hepburn also played the role of the gamine Gigi in New York (1951) in the play of that name, based on the novel (1945) by [[Colette]], who had personally "talent-spotted" her when she was filming in [[Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;Judith Thurman (1999) ''Secrets of the Flesh – A Life of Colette''&lt;/ref&gt; On film and in photographs, Hepburn’s short hair and petite figure created a distinct and enduring "look", well defined by Don Macpherson,&lt;ref&gt;''Stars of the Screen'' (Marks &amp; Spencer, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; who cited her "naïveté which did not rule out sophistication", and described her as "the first gamine to be accepted as overpoweringly chic".

Other film actresses of the period regarded as gamines included [[Leslie Caron]] (b. 1931), who played the leading role in the 1958 musical film of ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''; [[Jean Seberg]] (1938–79), best known in ''[[Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1957) and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]’s ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|À bout de souffle]]'' (1960); [[Jean Simmons]] (1929-2010), for example, in ''Angel Face'' (1952); and [[Rita Tushingham]] (b. 1940), whose first starring role was in ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' (1961). The French singer [[Juliette Greco]] (b. 1926), who emerged from [[Bohemian style#Post-Liberation Paris|Bohemian]] Paris in the late 1940s to become an international star in the 1950s, also had gamine qualities.

== 1960s and beyond ==
In many ways, the "gamine look" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: [[Jean Shrimpton]] (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the [[mini-skirt]] in 1965; [[Twiggy]] (b. Lesley Hornby, 1949), who became "The Face of '66";&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/breakfast/4725427.stm "The face of '66"] ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kate Moss]] (b. 1974), associated in the 1990s with the "[[waif]]" look and what, notably through an advertising campaign for [[Calvin Klein]] in 1997, became known as "[[heroin chic]]." Moss was part of a trend of "wafer" thin models which was satirized in [[Neil Kerber]]’s strip cartoon "Supermodels" in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''.

Gamines share similarities with the modern, cinematic "[[Manic Pixie Dream Girl]]" stock character.

== Other gamines ==
Others who have been described as gamines include Danish-French actress [[Anna Karina]] (b. 1940); American actresses [[Julia Roberts]] (b. 1967) (she was often compared to Audrey Hepburn at the start of her career), [[Edie Sedgwick]] (1943–1971), [[Elizabeth Hartman]] (1943–1987), [[Mia Farrow]] (b. 1945), [[Sissy Spacek]] (b. 1949), [[Winona Ryder]] (b. 1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traill-Nash|first1=Glynis|title=Cream of the gamine crop|journal=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 April 2007|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/cream-of-the-gamine-crop/2007/03/31/1174761805542.html|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] (b. 1980), [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] (b. 1972),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A747453 The Austin Chronicle 2009-02-27].

[[Penelope Chetwode]] (1910–86), later Lady Betjeman, wife of the Poet Laureate, [[John Betjeman]], was described by Betjeman's biographer [[A. N. Wilson]] as "gamine of feature, but large-breasted".&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson (2006) ''Betjeman''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corinne Bailey Rae]] alleged that she was called a gamine in her song, "Choux Pastry Heart" (2005).

Japanese 1990s J-Pop rock band vocalist Maki Watase was called a "spry gamine firecracker" in a review in the New Music Express.

=== In film ===
Among the notable gamine characters of film are Gelsomina, the street performer from ''[[La Strada]]'', played by [[Giulietta Masina]]; Bree Daniels, the prostitute played by [[Jane Fonda]] (b. 1937) in ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) (whose hairstyle was sometimes referred to as the "Klute shag"); Nikita ([[Anne Parillaud]], b. 1960), the titular [[Punk subculture|punkish]] [[Substance dependence|junkie]] in [[Luc Besson]]'s [[Nikita (film)|1990 film]]; and, most recently, Amélie (Audrey Tautou) in the [[Amélie|2001 romantic comedy of that name]].

'''''Head III''''' is an oil painting by [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], one of series of works made in 1949 for his first one-man exhibition at the [[Hanover Gallery]], in London. As with the other six paintings in the series, it focuses on the disembodied head of male figure, who looks out with a penetrating gaze, but is fixed against an isolating, flat, nondescript background, while also enfolded by hazy horizontal foreground curtain-like folds which seems to function like a surrounding cage.&lt;ref name="y19"&gt;Davies; Yard, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

''Head III'' was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover in a showing commissioned by one of the artist's early champions, [[Erica Brausen]].&lt;ref name="z74"&gt;Zweite, 74&lt;/ref&gt; They six head paintings were painted during a short period of time, when Bacon was under pressure to provide works for the Hanover exhibition. Of the series, ''[[Head I]]'', ''[[Head II]]'', and ''[[Head VI]]'' are today seen as artistically successful, with ''Head VI'' as ground breaking, and a direct precursor to Bacon's seminal 1950's many representations of Popes. ''Head III'' is important in the development in that it is the first of the series in which Bacon masters the effect of the horizontal folds, and the ambiguous facial expression of the subject nears that of his [[Diego Velázquez]]'s ''[[Portrait of Innocent X]]''; his primary source for these paintings.&lt;ref name="y19"&gt;Davies; Yard, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is in a private collection, having been sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] in 2013 for £10,442,500.&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/contemporary-art-evening-auction-l13022/lot.11.html Francis Bacon, ''Head III''], Sotheby's, 26 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dex"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dex|first1=Robert|title=Francis Bacon paint brushes expected to fetch £25,000 at auction|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/francis-bacon-paint-brushes-expected-to-fetch-25000-at-auction-8732148.html|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Independent|date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Eisenstein Potemkin 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Image from ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925)]]

The painting measures {{convert|81|x|66|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artimage.org.uk/6346/francis-bacon/head-iii--1949 Head III, 1949], artimage.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps a portrait of Bacon's lover Eric Hall, the [[grisaille]] work depicts a bald man's head with pock-marked discolored off-white face, partially concealed by diaphanous curtains.&lt;ref name="y19" /&gt;

The face has an enigmatic expression, with his cold eyes - emphasised by bright marks of [[zinc white]] - looking out through broken [[pince-nez]] spectacles.  This is the first occasion when the motif of broken glasses appears in Bacon's work, inspired by the image of an injured nurse in the 1925 film ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''.  The open-mouthed scream of the nurse in the film would also become a theme of Bacon's work, including ''[[Head VI]]'',&lt;ref name="p30"&gt;Peppiatt, 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zweite, 75&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Fragment of a Crucifixion]]''.&lt;ref name="d18"&gt;Davies; Yard, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission and provenance==

The 1949 Hanover gallery exhibition included the six ''Head'' paintings, and four other important early works by Bacon: ''[[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]]'', ''[[Figure in a landscape]]'', ''Study from the Human Body'' (also known as '' Study for Figure'') and ''[[Study for Portrait]]'' (also known as '' Man in a Blue Box'').&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mbartfoundation.com/biography/catalogues Exhibition catalogues: A chronological selection of solo and group exhibition catalogues from the MB Art Collection.]". MB Art Foundation. Retrieved 20 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

They are usually interpreted as intermediate steps from the preliminary images in ''Head I'' and ''Head II'' towards the final image of ''Head VI'',&lt;ref name="sb" /&gt; the first of Bacon's paintings to reference [[Velázquez]] and his ''[[Portrait of Innocent X]]'' of 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Barbara; Sylvester, David. ''Francis Bacon in Dublin''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000. 52. {{ISBN|0-500-28254-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Head III'' was the first of the six paintings to be sold at the Hanover Gallery exhibition.  It was acquired by US art collector [[Wright Saltus Ludington]] (brother of [[Charles Townsend Ludington]]) in October 1949, shortly before the exhibition opened in November 1949.  It was later sold to Sir and Lady [[Edward Hulton]], and passed through the hands of several private collectors.  It was included in Bacon retrospective at the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1985, and sold again at [[Sotheby's]] in London in 2013.

==Reception==
''Head III'' was described by [[Wyndham Lewis]] in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' on 12 May 1949, page 811: "Bacon's picture, as usual, is in lamp-black monochrome, the zinc white of the monster’s eyes glittering in the cold crumbling grey of the face. Bacon is a Grand Guignol artist: the mouths in his heads are unpleasant places, evil passions make a glittering white mess of the lips."  and then in ''The Listener'' on 17 November 1949, page 860. He later wrote that "part of the head is rotting away into space".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unirioja.es/listenerartcriticism/essays/essay-Wyndham-Lewis-and-Francis-Bacon.htm Wyndham Lewis and Francis Bacon], Jan Cox, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Wölfli General view of the island Neveranger, 1911.jpg|thumb|Many paintings by [[outsider art]]ist [[Adolf Wölfli]] contain space filled with writing or musical notation]]
[[File:M73 13.jpg|thumb|''The Fall of Babylon'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]] from the ''Apocalypse'' series, circa 1555, plate size: 11 ⅞ x 8 ⅜ in.]]

In [[visual art]], '''horror vacui''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|r|ər|_|ˈ|v|ɑː|k|juː|aɪ}}; from [[Latin]] "fear of empty space"), also '''kenophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] "fear of the empty"),&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Brown: ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1:&amp;nbsp;A−M. [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]], Oxford 1993, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an [[Work of art|artwork]] with [[Complexity|detail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/horror%20vacui]] horror vacui as defined in the Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term is associated with the Italian art critic and scholar [[Mario Praz]], who used it to describe the suffocating atmosphere and clutter of interior design in the [[Victorian age]].&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=Beverly, Massachusetts|isbn=1592535879|pages=128–9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older, and more artistically esteemed examples can be seen on [[Migration period art]] objects like the [[carpet page]]s of [[Insular art|Insular]] illuminated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]]. This feeling of meticulously filling empty spaces also permeates [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] Islamic art from ancient times to the present. Another example comes from ancient Greece during the [[Geometric Art|Geometric Age]] (1100 - 900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver [[Jean Duvet]] consistently exhibits horror vacui.

==Examples==
Some examples of horror vacui in art come from, or are influenced by, the [[mentally ill|mentally unstable]] and inmates of [[psychiatric hospitals]], such as [[Richard Dadd]] in the 19th century, and many modern examples fall under the category of [[Outsider Art]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horror vacui may have also had an impact, consciously or unconsciously, on [[graphic design]] by artists like [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] or [[Vaughan Oliver]], and in the [[underground comix]] movement in the work of [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and on later comic artists such as [[Mark Beyer (comics)|Mark Beyer]]. The paintings of Williams, [[Faris Badwan]], Emerson Barrett, [[Joe Coleman (painter)|Joe Coleman]] and [[Todd Schorr]] are further examples of horror vacui in the modern [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]] art movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The [[entheogen]]-inspired [[visionary art]] of certain [[indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] yarn paintings and the [[ayahuasca]]-inspired art of [[Pablo Amaringo]], often exhibits this style, as does the [[psychedelic art]] movement of the [[1960s counterculture]]. Sometimes the patterned art in clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric [[Mola (art form)|molas]] of [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] people and the traditional clothing on [[Shipibo-Conibo]] people.

The artwork in the [[Where's Wally?]] series of children's books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique ([[Malangatana Ngwenya]]) also fill the canvas in this way.

The arrangement of [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[hieroglyphs]] suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs are repeated or [[phonetic complement]]s added to prevent gaps.

Horror vacui also strikes mapmakers. In the times of the [[Age of Discovery|Discoveries]], for instance, it was common for cartographers to fill in the ''[[Terra incognita]]'' or the poorly known oceans with [[Sea monster|monsters]] or simply with the [[Scale (map)|scale]] of the map, rather than to leave them blank.

==Current usage and meaning==
{{double image|right|Only Two Colours.jpg|150|Mango store in Barcelona.jpg|150|''Horror vacui'' and value perception}}
There is an inverse relationship between ''horror vacui'' and value perception, and commercial designers favour [[minimalism]] in shop window displays and advertising to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals more to affluent and well-educated audiences.&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden" /&gt;


==Analogy==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The term is also used as an analogy to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Horror vacui (physics)|idea]] that a physical vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected.  This was widely believed up to the time of [[Rene Descartes]].

Before 1959, as portraitist, he painted the entire [[Barakzai dynasty|Afghan Royal Family]]. From about 1960 on, he was noted as an abstract painter influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic calligraphy]] and by the American "[[action painting]]" idiom.

==Biography==

Gulgee was born on 26 October 1926 at Karimpura locality in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan. Initially, he went to [[Lawrence College Murree]] and then to [[Aligarh University]] to study civil engineering before heading off to the US for continuing his higher education. Gulgee started to paint while acquiring his training as an engineer in the United States at [[Columbia University]] and then [[Harvard]]. His first exhibition was in 1950.

Gulgee was a gifted and consummately skilled naturalistic [[portrait]] painter who had enjoyed (according to Partha Mitter) "lavish state support" and plenty of elite commissions in this capacity. Nevertheless, he was perhaps best known worldwide for his [[abstract art|abstract]] work, which was inspired by [[Islamic calligraphy]] and was also influenced by the "[[action painting]]" movement of the 1950s and 1960s (Mitter notes that [[Elaine Hamilton-O'Neal|Elaine Hamilton]] was a strong influence in this direction). This is perhaps a natural enough stylistic combination since in both Islamic calligraphy and action painting a high value is placed on the unity and energy of gestural flow. As with the works of other action painters or [[abstract expressionist]]s, Gulgee's canvases were often quite large. He was also known for using materials such as mirror glass and gold or silver leaf in his oil paintings, so that they were in fact [[mixed media]] pieces.

According to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (see external links): "Gulgee's calligraphy paintings are abstract and gestural interpretations of [[Arabic]] and [[Urdu]] letters. His sweeping layers of paint explore the formal qualities of oil paint while they make references to [[Islamic]] design elements." [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wepk/hd_wepk.htm]

Beginning in the 1960s (if not earlier), Gulgee also created sculptures, including bronze pieces that were (like so many of his paintings) calligraphic in form and inspiration, and sometimes specifically based on verses from the [[Quran]] [source:artnet.com].

His paintings were bright and full of color, but the paint was put on with great sensitivity, and paintings vibrate with intense feeling. Areas sing with luminous, thin color; thick blobs of paint pulsate with fiberglass tears, the brush swirls strong and free. The total effect used to be very free, yet considered and well thought out. They work enormously well, because it was all orchestrated with great care and concentration.

His son [[Amin Gulgee]] is also a famous artist.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

[Note: the name is also spelled "Guljee", "Gulji", or "Gulgi" in some sources.]

==International and special assignments==

Guljee, as he was famously known, received many requests for his paintings internationally, from the [[Saudi royal family]] to the [[Islamabad presidency]]. Many of his works are placed in the [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Guljee received many awards, including from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Japan and France.

==Exhibition and personal life==

Gulgee's exhibitions have mostly been available to few people. Keeping that in mind and high demand from public and lovers of his works, an art gallery for Gulgee has been built in [[Clifton, Karachi]] near [[South City Hospital]] and [[Sea View Karachi]]. Gulgee mostly painted for his own inspirations and vision. Although selected paintings are available for sale in Gulgee art gallery. Gulgee was last based in Boat Basin in Karachi. He has a son [[Amin Gulgee]].

==Murder==

Gulgee, his wife Zarrin Gulgee and a maid were found dead by strangulation&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; in their house on the evening of 19 December 2007 by his servants. Police suspect that all three had been murdered.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7151914.stm] While the bodies were found on the 19th, officials report that they had apparently been deceased for three days, leading to a speculative death date of 16 December 2007. Their bodies were found bound and gagged in separate rooms of the house. The initial cause of death for all three has been attributed to suffocation. According to press reports, his son reported that Gulgee's car and driver are missing. Gulgee was buried on the evening of 20 December 2007 in Karachi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8474">'''Karl Barth's views on Mary''' agreed with much [[Roman Catholic]] dogma but disagreed with the Catholic veneration of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. [[Karl Barth|Barth]], a leading 20th-century theologian, was a [[Reformed Protestant]]. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the [[Mother of God]]. Through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race. Through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God.

==Background==

===Theology of Karl Barth===
Karl Barth (May 10, 1886 &amp;ndash; December 10, 1968) a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Reformed]] theologian, was one of the most important Christian thinkers of the 20th century. Beginning with his experience as a pastor, he rejected the predominant [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] theology typical of 19th-century [[Protestantism]], especially [[Germany|German]], and instead embarked on a unique theological path, often labelled [[neo-orthodoxy]] by critics (a label emphatically rejected by Barth himself), that emphasized the sovereignty of God particularly through his innovative doctrine of [[predestination|election]]. Barth's theology swept through Europe and Britain.

Barth was originally trained in German [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Liberal Christianity|Liberalism]] under such teachers as [[Wilhelm Herrmann]], but reacted against this theology at the time of the [[World War I|First World War]].  His reaction was fed by several factors, including his commitment to the German and Swiss [[International League of Religious Socialists|Religious Socialist]] movement surrounding men like [[Hermann Kutter]], the influence of the [[Biblical Realism]] movement surrounding men like [[Christoph Blumhardt]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and the impact of the [[skepticism|skeptical philosophy]] of [[Franz Overbeck]].

===Epistle to the Romans===
In his commentary ''[[The Epistle to the Romans]]'' (Ger. ''Der Römerbrief''; particularly in the thoroughly re-written second edition of 1922) Barth argued that the God who is revealed in the cross of [[Jesus]] challenges and overthrows any attempt to ally God with human cultures, achievements, or possessions.  Many theologians believe this work to be the most important theological treatise since [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]'s ''[[On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers]].''

In the decade following the First World War, Barth was linked with a number of other theologians, actually very diverse in outlook, who had reacted against their teachers' liberalism, in a movement known as "[[Dialectical Theology]]" &lt;ref&gt;(Ger. ''Dialektische Theologie'').&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the movement included [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[Eduard Thurneysen]], [[Emil Brunner]], and [[Friedrich Gogarten]].

==Marian views==

===The nativity mystery===

* ''The nativity mystery  “conceived from the [[Holy Spirit]] and born from the [[Virgin Mary]]”,  means,  that God became human, truly human out of his own grace. The miracle of the existence of Jesus , his “climbing down of God” is: Holy Spirit and Virgin Mary! Here is a human being, the Virgin Mary,  and as he comes from God, Jesus comes also from this human being. Born of the Virgin Mary means a human origin for God.  Jesus Christ is not only truly God, he is human like every one of us. He is human without limitation. He is not only similar to us, he is like us''.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Dogmatik im Grundriss,  1947, 125,127&lt;/ref&gt;

This means to Barth, God's presence in our world, His presence as man among men and therefore God's revelation to humanity. It also means humanity's reconciliation with God. To Barth,  this happened and still happens,  it is the substance of the Christmas message.

This God is conceived where we all are conceived. He is born of Mary. She who conceived and bore Him, plays our part in the wonder of Christmas, for it concerns us. God has come to us. "Disguised in our flesh and blood, is the Eternal God."

=== Virgin Birth ===
The [[Nicene Creed]] says: ''Et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto ex Maria virgine et homo factus est'' ("and he [God the Son] became body from the Virgin Mary and was made man").  In Barth's theology – in contrast to much of the contemporary liberal theology – this statement is interpreted to mean the [[dogma]] of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]]. It means that Jesus as a human does not have a father, in the same way that as the Son of God he has no mother. The Holy Spirit, through whom Mary conceived, is not just any spirit, it is God himself whose act must be understood spiritually and not physically.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic I, 2,  219&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary is "full of grace" according to Barth, but this grace is not earned but totally given to her. This is quite similar to Catholic teaching, in which Mary, "by sheer grace," received the fullness of grace from God at the moment of her conception, that she might give her consent at the annunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 722&lt;/ref&gt;  Barth argues that the Church adopted its doctrine of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] not because of Mary, but in defence of its [[Christology]].

=== Mother of God ===

Karl Barth states that as a Christian and theologian, he  does not reject the description of Mary as the "Mother of God." To him, this is a legitimate expression of Christological truth. The description of Mary as the "Mother of God" was and is sensible, permissible and necessary as an auxiliary Christological proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, I, 2, Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1963, 138)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2004-1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics: The doctrine of the word of God (2 pts.)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Po0rhLSFx0wC&amp;pg=PA138|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-05069-4|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of the Catholic view ===
Barth on the other hand sees the term "Mother of God," as "being overloaded by the so-called Mariology of the Roman Catholic Church".&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, 138&lt;/ref&gt; 
He considered the Roman Catholic veneration of Mary a terrible mistake and heresy.

* ''Where ever Mary is venerated, and devotion to her takes place, there the Church of Christ does not exist''.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, I, 2, 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics Study Edition 3: The Doctrine of the Word of God I.2 § 13-15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=APXR1E0m_AkC&amp;pg=PA145|date=2 September 2010|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-02766-5|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* ''Mariology is an excrescence, i.e., a diseased construct of theological thought. Excrescences must be excised.'' &lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, I, 2, 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics: The doctrine of the word of God (2 pts.)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Po0rhLSFx0wC&amp;pg=PA139|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-05069-4|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He warns however, of extending this critique too far:
{{quote|It is not recommended that we should base our repudiation [of Marian doctrine] on the assertion that there has taken place here an irruption from the heathen sphere, an adoption of the idea, current in many non-Christian religions, of a more or less central and original female or mother deity. In dogmatics you can establish everything and nothing from parallels from the history of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, Vol. 1, p. 143).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And, Barth equally attacks Protestant theology on this issue: "For justice sake, one has to say, that the Protestant rejection of Roman Catholic mariology and Marian cult is dishonest, as long as Protestantism is caught in the same unreal problem".&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic, I,2,160&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], who published about him. Barth’s dogmatic theology was partly based on [[Thomas Aquinas]], although he departed from Aquinas on many characteristically Catholic points.

'''Kiwix''' is a [[free and open-source]] offline web browser created by Emmanuel Engelhart and Renaud Gaudin in 2007.&lt;ref name="sutherland2014" /&gt; It was first launched to allow offline access to [[Wikipedia]], but has since expanded to include other projects from the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] as well as [[public domain]] texts from the [[Project Gutenberg]]. Available in more than 100 languages, Kiwix has been included in several high-profile projects, from smuggling operations in [[North Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/north-korea/|title=The plot to free North Korea with smuggled episodes of "Friends"|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encyclopedic access in [[Cuba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ecured.cubava.cu/2017/06/12/como-utilizar-kiwix-como-servidor-local/|title=¿Cómo utilizar Kiwix como servidor local?|access-date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Google Impact Challenge's recipient [[Bibliothèques Sans Frontières]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les Lauréats du Google Impact Challenge|access-date=27 April 2016|url=http://www.tntv.pf/Les-laureats-du-Google-Impact-Challenge_a8169.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founder Emmanuel Engelhart sees Wikipedia as a [[common good]], saying “The contents of Wikipedia should be available for everyone! Even without Internet access. This is why I have launched the Kiwix project.”&lt;ref name="sutherland2014" /&gt;

After becoming a Wikipedia editor in 2004, Emmanuel Engelhart became interested in developing offline versions of Wikipedia. A [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team|project to make a Wikipedia CD]], initiated in 2003, was a trigger for the project.&lt;ref name="sutherland2014"&gt;Joe Sutherland: ''[//blog.wikimedia.org/2014/09/12/emmanuel-engelhart-inventor-of-kiwix/ Emmanuel Engelhart, Inventor of Kiwix: the Offline Wikipedia Browser]''. In: Wikimedia Blog. 12. September 2014. Accessed on 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Kiwix won a grant from Wikimedia France to build kiwix-plug, which was deployed in universities in eleven countries in the [[Afripedia Project]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citazine.fr/article/afripedia-wikipedia-pour-afrique-francophone Citazine article on Afripedia (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afrik.com/article25968.html|title=Afripédia : un projet de promotion de Wikipédia en Afrique|last=Traoré|first=Kardiatou|website=www.afrik.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2013 Kiwix won [[SourceForge]]'s Project of the Month award,&lt;ref name="Slashdot.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/topic/cloud/kiwix-aims-to-spread-wikipedias-reach/ |title=Kiwix Aims to spread Wikipedia's Reach |publisher=Slashdot.org |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302024146/http://slashdot.org/topic/cloud/kiwix-aims-to-spread-wikipedias-reach/ |archivedate=2013-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; - and an Open Source Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netzwoche.ch/News/2015/10/29/OSS-Awards-kueren-die-innovativsten-Schweizer-Open-Source-Projekte.aspx||title=OSS Awards küren Schweizer Open-Source-Projekte|publisher=Netzwoche|accessdate =2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''incompatibility''' list includes [[iPhone OS 1]], [[iPhone OS 2]], [[iPhone OS 3]], [[iOS 4]], [[iOS 5]], [[iOS 6]], [[iOS 7]], [[iOS 8]] and is expected to continue throughout the product line on a [[chronological]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;https://ibb.co/ib5hOc&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The software is designed as an offline reader for web content. It is used on computers without an internet connection, computers with a slow or expensive connection, and to avoid censorship. It can also be used while travelling (e.g. on a plane or train).

[[File:Kiwix 0.9 rc1 library fr screenshot.png|thumb|left|Downloading new content files on an early version of Kiwix]]

Users first download Kiwix, then download content for offline viewing with Kiwix (see picture). Compression saves disk space and bandwidth. All of English-language Wikipedia, with pictures, fits on a USB stick (54 GB as of May 2016, or 16 GB with no pictures).&lt;ref name="Slashdot.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Content in all languages - Kiwix"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Content_in_all_languages|title=Content in all languages - Kiwix|website=www.kiwix.org|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All content files are [[Data compression|compressed]] in [[ZIM (file format)|ZIM format]], which makes them smaller, but leaves them easy to index, search, and selectively decompress.

The ZIM files are then opened with Kiwix, which looks and behaves like a web browser. Kiwix offers full text search, tabbed navigation and the option to export articles to PDF and HTML.&lt;ref name=sourceforge&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/kiwix/ |title=Kiwix |publisher=[[SourceForge]] |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an HTTP server version called '''kiwix-serve'''; this allows a computer to host Kiwix content, and make it available to other computers on a network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Kiwix-serve Kiwix-serve]&lt;/ref&gt; The other computers see an ordinary website. '''kiwix-plug''' is a version for plug computers&lt;ref name="Slashdot.org"/&gt; which is often used to provide a [[Server (computing)|wifi server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Kiwix-plug|title=Kiwix-plug - Kiwix|website=www.kiwix.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiwix uses the deprecated [[XULRunner|Mozilla framework]] localised on [[Translatewiki.net]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Kiwix|title=Translating:Kiwix - translatewiki.net|website=translatewiki.net|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but plans to replace it.&lt;ref name="Linux Packaging project - Kiwix"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Linux_Packaging_project|title=Linux Packaging project - Kiwix|website=www.kiwix.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Available content ==
[[File:The Goodall girls using Kiwix aboard the Kyrimba.JPG|thumb|left|Reading Wikipedia through Kiwix on a boat in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/11/14/sailing-south-pacific-with-wikipedia-on-board-goodall-family/ Sailing the South Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A list of content available on Kiwix is available for download, including language-specific sublists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Content_in_all_languages|title=Content in all languages - Kiwix|website=www.kiwix.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content can be loaded through Kiwix itself.
Since 2014, most Wikipedia versions are available for download in various different languages.&lt;ref name="Content in all languages - Kiwix"/&gt; For English Wikipedia, a full version containing pictures as well as alternative version containing text only can be downloaded from the archive. This allows users to save disk space and bandwidth while downloading. The servers are updated every two to ten months, depending on the size of the file. For English Wikipedia, the update frequency is thus substantially lower than the [[bzip2]] database downloads by the Wikimedia Foundation, which are updated twice a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#English-language_Wikipedia|title=English-language Wikipedia|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}

Besides Wikipedia, content from the [[Wikimedia foundation]] such as [[Wikisource]], [[Wikiquote]], [[Wikivoyage]], [[Wikibooks]] and [[Wikiversity]] are available for offline viewing in various different languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.kiwix.org/zim/ Zim archive for Kiwix]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 a ZIM version of all [[public domain|open texts]] forming part of [[Project Gutenberg]] was made available.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Engelhart: [https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikisource-l/2014-November/002139.html ''50.000 public domain books available to everybody, everywhere, offline''.] In: [[Wikisource]]-l-Mailinglist. 19. November 2014. Accessed on 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimategerardm.blogspot.ch/2014/11/wikimedia-project-gutenberg-sum-of-all.html|title=Words and what not: #Wikimedia &amp; Project #Gutenberg - the sum of all knowledge|website=ultimategerardm.blogspot.ch|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides [[public domain]] content, works licensed under a [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons license|license]] are available for download. For example, offline versions of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[wiki]] containing user documentation for the Ubuntu operating system,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Wiki/Hilfsmittel#Kiwix Ubuntuusers Hilfsmittel]''&lt;/ref&gt; ZIM editions of [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] talks&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.kiwix.org/zim/ted/ Kiwix archive for TED]&lt;/ref&gt; and videos from [[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]] are available in the Kiwix archive as ZIM file formats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.kiwix.org/zim/other/ Kiwix archive for additional content]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deployments ==
Kiwix can be installed on a desktop computer as a stand-alone program, installed on a tablet or smartphone, or can create its own [[WLAN]] environment from a Raspberry plug.
[[File:Carte localisation Afripédia hors-ligne.png|thumb|Locations of 13 universities where Kiwix was deployed as part of the [[Afripedia Project]]]]

As a software development project, Kiwix itself is not directly involved in deployment projects. However, third party organisations do use the software as a component of their own projects. Examples include:

* Universities and libraries that can't afford broadband Internet access.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Main_Page|title=Main Page - Kiwix|website=www.kiwix.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[Afripedia Project]] set up kiwix servers in French-speaking universities (some of them with no Internet access) in 11 African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/01/24/afripedia-project-increasing-off-line-access-to-wikipedia-in-africa/|title=Afripedia project increasing off-line access to Wikipedia in Africa|website=Wikimedia blog|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In European and US prison education programs.&lt;ref name="Slashdot.org" /&gt;

===Package managers and app stores===
[[File:Kiwix page view.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia medical app on smartphone]]
Kiwix was formerly available in the native [[package manager]]s of some Linux distributions. However, Kiwix is currently not available in most package databases, due to [[XULRunner]], a program on which Kiwix depends, being [[deprecated]] by [[Mozilla]] and removed from the package databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Debian|title=Debian - Kiwix|website=www.kiwix.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiwix is available in the [[Sugar (software)|Sugar]] and [[ArchLinux]] [[Linux distributions]]. It is also available on Android.

Kiwix is available in the Microsoft Store&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P8SLZ4J979J|title=Get Kiwix JS - Microsoft Store|website=Microsoft Store Online|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, on GooglePlay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kiwix.kiwixmobile|title=Kiwix, Wikipedia offline - Android Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kiwix/id997079563?mt=8|title=Kiwix on the App Store|website=App Store|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, a series of "customized apps" have also been released, of which medical Wikipedia and [[PhET]] simulations are the two largest.

[[File:Groud Magie Noire.jpg|thumb|''Gilbert G. Groud'' signs "Magie Noire", 20 March 2006, [[Switzerland]]]]

'''"Magie Noire"''' ("[[Black Magic]]") is a [[comics]] series by the [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian]] painter and author [[Gilbert G. Groud]]. It deals with the dangers of black magic in [[Africa]].

The story is about a father who is married to several women. His favourite wife Zoé has only one child. In order to proceed in sorcery and earn a position of higher power he is required to sacrifice this last son. The child is sacrificed in the world of ghosts. In the real world he falls very sick and throws up daily. The mother, who is not into Black Magic, takes the child to a hospital. The doctors can not find out what is wrong. Still the situation of the child worsens.

The illustrations were drawn by hand with ink. The mood is sad and dark which can also be seen in the pictures that are painted in green and brown. Pictures showing the real world are suddenly painted in bright colors. This contrast shows the difference between the real world and the frightening, dangerous world of ghosts.

Groud converted to [[Christianity]] in 1985 but comes from a family that practised sorcery. His point of view is a very critical one.

The '''Memorial for the Victims of Nazi Military Justice''' was inaugurated on 24 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vienna to honor deserters from Hitler's army|publisher=[[Associated Press]]; [[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9606158|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vienna to honour Austria's Nazi army deserters|publisher=[[BBC]]News Europe|date=23 April 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13179406|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the [[Ballhausplatz]] in the centre of [[Vienna]], opposite the President's office and the Austrian [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellory]]. The monument was created by German [[Conceptual art|conceptual artist]] [[Olaf Nicolai]]. The inscription atop the three-step sculpture features the poem by Scottish poet [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]] consisting of just two words: ''all alone''.

==Desertion, Wehrkraftzersetzung, Conscientious Objection==
Of the Germans and Austrians who deserted the [[Wehrmacht]], 15,000 men were executed. In contrast only 18 Germans who deserted in [[World War I|the first world war]] were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shot at Dawn|url=http://www.greatwar.nl/frames/default-shotatdawn.html|website=The Heritage of the Great War|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 10 percent of all victims of Nazi Military Justice were Austrians.

In June 1988 the Initiative for the Creation of a Memorial to Deserters came to life in [[Ulm]] and Neu Ulm. A central idea was, "Desertion is not reprehensible, war is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites-of-memory.de/main/ulmdeserters.html|title=Memorial to Deserters in Ulm|author=Hatlie, Mark R.|date=19 November 2005|publisher=Sites of Memory|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monheim Town Hall''' ([[German language|German]] ''Monheimer Rathaus'') is a historical  building   in [[Monheim, Bavaria|Monheim]], [[Bavaria]], southern [[Germany]], now owned by the city's council.

The building, constructed from 1714 to 1720 for a rich Jewish merchant, the [[Court Jew]] Abraham Elias Model, is most notable for its [[ceiling]]s, displaying motifs from the [[Old Testament]], or [[Tanakh]], which were restored in 1978 and 1994 respectively.&lt;ref name="Kostbar"&gt;{{de icon}} ''Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit'', Chapter: Jews as citizens in Monheim, by: Emeran Meyer (Mayor of Monheim 1978-84), page: 117-123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.junge-pfalz.de/broschuere/die_junge_pfalz.pdf ''Die Junge Pfalz''] {{de icon}} ''The young Palatinate'', page: 11, accessed: 6 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The Jewish community===
The Jewish community in Monheim was established in 1697, when Duke [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine|Johann Wilhelm]] allowed six Jewish families which had been banned from [[Eichstätt]], to settle in Monheim. The new community was allowed to acquire property in Monheim, to construct a [[Synagogue]] and to work as merchants in town. In the following years, the community grew considerably, numbering 19 families and 150 people by 1737.&lt;ref name="Community" &gt;[http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/monheim_synagoge.htm History of the Jewish community in Monheim] {{de icon}}, accessed: 6 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospering community however raised concerns with the local population, which was worried about eventually becoming outnumbered in town. In 1736, restrictions were passed, allowing only a limited number of weddings to be conducted by the local Jews at considerable cost. In 1741, Duke [[Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine|Charles III Philip]] passed an act banning all Jews from [[Palatinate-Neuburg]]. By the 31 July 1741, all Jews had to leave his lands and were only permitted to take with them what they could carry. No financial compensation was made for their loss of property. The Jews from Monheim left for the towns in the region not part of Palatinate-Neuburg and their origin from Monheim remains obvious through the surname ''Monheim'' or ''Monheimer''.&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

===The town hall===
The location of the current town hall was acquired by Abraham Elias Model in 1712 from Ferdinand Kugler for 1,025 [[Baden gulden|Gulden]].&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt; The later owned a brewery and guest house at the spot, called ''Gasthaus zur Rose''. Model had the old building demolished and commissioned a new building to be constructed, which was erected between 1714 and 1720.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;

The new building, which was referred to in the local town chronicles as "very precious", was built in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. It was a square three-story building which was richly decorated, especially the ceilings. The main room on the second floor, now the council chambers, depict [[Abraham]] being prevented by the angel from sacrificing [[Isaac]], with a text in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

The ceiling, long hidden, was only restored in 1978.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt; Two more ceilings, also on the second floor, were restored in 1994. One depicts [[Moses]] receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] while the other shows King [[David]] playing the [[harp]].&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

For a time it was assumed that the house also functioned as a synagogue, Monheim having had a [[Rabbi]] since 1715, but this has since been disproven. Nothing is left of the former synagogue, which was located in the nearby building that later became the guest house ''Zum Ochsen''.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

With the forced departure of the Jews in 1741, the building came into non-Jewish, private possession. In 1853, it was acquired by the town from the brewer Anton Wunderlich, to be used as a school house. For this purpose, the chamber that is now the main council chamber was subdivided into two rooms. The rooms were nevertheless insufficient to house all pupils and a separate building was constructed from 1892 to 1895 to house the school boys, while the girls stayed at the town hall. Eventually, two more, larger schools were completed, one in 1957 and 1976. With the completion of the later, the town hall ceased to be required for schooling purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} ''Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit'', Chapter: "To read and to write...", by: Dr. Paul Olbrich, page: 137-144&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceilings on the second floor can be visited free of charge during the opening hours of the town hall, provided no marriages or council meetings take place in the rooms at the time.

'''''Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas completed by the French artist [[Paul Cézanne]] between 1882 and 1885. It depicts [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire]] and the valley of the [[Arc (Provence)|Arc River]], with Cézanne's hometown of [[Aix-en-Provence]] in the background. Once owned by the art collectors and patrons [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer|Henry]] and [[Louisine Havemeyer]], the painting was bequeathed to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] after the latter's death in 1929.

== Description ==
The ''Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley'' was painted from 1882 to 1885, and was completed 21 years before Cézanne's artistic career finished.&lt;ref name="offline3"/&gt; Cézanne began working on [[Impressionism]] in his artworks in the late 19th century, nearing the end of his career, away from his post-impressionist former paintings. A later example of this can be seen in ''[[The Card Players]]''.&lt;ref name="offline1"/&gt; These mainly included still lifes and landscapes such as ''Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley''. His aim was "to make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of museums."&lt;ref name="museums 1"&gt;"Paul Cézanne: Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley (29.100.64)". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000. Uploaded December 2008. Retrieved 30 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted in the 'mature' period of Cézanne's work.&lt;ref name="web1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impressionistsgallery.co.uk/artists/Cezanne/1878-1890%20(1).html|title=Cezanne, 1878-1890 (20/1)|publisher=Impressionists Gallery|date=|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley'' was a bequest to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer]] and his wife [[Louisine Havemeyer|Louisine Waldron Elder Havemeyer]]. After Henry died in 1907, the work passed to Louisine; it was donated to the museum following her death in 1929 as part of the Havemeyer collection of 142 artworks.&lt;ref name="The Havemeyers Book 1"&gt;Weitzenhoffer, Frances. ''The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America'' (Harry N. Abrams Publishers, New York). 1986. pp. 251—252.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts the [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire]], which dominates the landscape of his native city of [[Aix-en-Provence]] (southern France). The city is visible in the distance, far back from the valley of the [[Arc (Provence)|Arc River]].&lt;ref name="doc1"&gt;Mont Sainte-Victoire. s885-i887. 2534  x  32'  s  inches. The H.  0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14531">In the [[United States]], the [[National Register of Historic Places]] classifies its listings by various '''types of architecture'''.  Listed properties often are given one or more of 40 standard architectural style classifications that appear in the [[National Register Information System]] (NRIS) database.   Other properties are given a custom architectural description with "vernacular" or other qualifiers, and others have no style classification.  Many National Register-listed properties do not fit into the several categories listed here, or they fit into more specialized subcategories.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Grounds Print Workshop, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;New Grounds Print Workshop&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''New Grounds Print Workshop''', founded in 1996 by Regina Held, is a [[nontoxic]] printmaking facility specializing in [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] and relief [[printmaking]]. It is located in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], United States. According to the mission statement on their website, New Grounds is "dedicated to providing artists with a professional, informative, safer and well-equipped environment for the creation of fine prints while promoting the artists and exhibiting their work."{{cite quote|date=October 2018}}

== Origins and goals ==
New Grounds was founded in response to three particular needs: 
#The need for a printmaking center in Albuquerque offering classes, press and studio access to all artists working in intaglio and relief printmaking. 
#The need to educate the general public about printmaking by offering studio tours, lectures and exhibitions. 
#The need for this facility to be nontoxic.  At that time all printmaking constituted a high health risk to artists in addition to having a negative impact on the environment. 

A good definition of nontoxic, or green printmaking, can be found on Friedhard Kiekeben's website, NontoxicPrint.com: "the term nontoxic/non-toxic has become synonymous with safety-conscious practice. Nontoxic processes still use a variety of chemicals, and the ultimate safety of any material and process is dependent on their informed use."{{cite quote|date=October 2018}}

New Grounds utilized the research of the innovators Keith Howard&lt;ref name=praga&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Keith|title="Intaglio and the Tradition of Toxicity." Keith Howard’s Non-Toxic Printmaking Page.|url=http://www.praga.com/Imagon/imhoward.htm|accessdate=October 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917021811/http://www.praga.com/Imagon/imhoward.htm|archivedate=2004-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Zaffron to build a completely green studio, and, according to a research paper&lt;ref name=nontoxicprint&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiekeben|first=F.|title=The Green Print Studio|url=http://www.nontoxicprint.com/thegreenprintstudio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Liz Chalfin from Zea Mays Printmaking studio, New Grounds was one of the first nontoxic printmaking studios in the United States.

{{quote|It all began with a non-toxic studio in her remodeled [[South Valley, New Mexico|South Valley]] garage, where artists would rent press access on an hourly basis and Held taught classes. At that time, New Grounds also offered [[papermaking]] classes and access to the papermaking studio. In 2000, Regina expanded to the current 3500 square foot commercial space in [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque, New Mexico|Nob Hill]]. Now, more than five years later, New Grounds includes a thriving gallery that represents member and international artists whose works Regina consigns. It is also a shared workspace where resident artists have the use of two large print rooms, five presses, comfortable work and storage areas, a break room, and areas in which to shoot photographic plates for gravures and to etch plates for intaglio prints. Another entire room, with its own press, is devoted to classes, where everything from monotype to the alternative process, gumoil printing, is taught.&lt;ref name=marylandprintmakers&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher|first=Janet|title=A Summer at New Grounds Print Workshop, Albuquerque, NM|url=http://marylandprintmakers.org/newsletter.asp?id=214|publisher=Maryland  Printmakers|accessdate=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Impact ==
New Grounds Print Workshop has had a significant influence on the promotion of nontoxic printmaking. Other workshops have modeled their facilities after New Grounds and printmakers from school teachers to university professors from around the world have studied nontoxic printmaking there.&lt;ref name=Artnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Kamerick|first=Megan|title=Albuquerque Art emerges from the shadows|newspaper=Art Business News|date=December 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Njuup''' tradition is a conservative [[Serer people|Serer]] style of [[Music genre|music]] rooted in the [[Ndut initiation rite]] (a [[rite of passage]] that young Serers must go through once in their lifetime as commanded by the [[Serer religion]]).&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{en icon}} The Culture trip : [http://explore.theculturetrip.com/africa/africa-discussions/youssou-n-dour-an-unlikely-politician/  "Youssou N'Dour: An Unlikely Politician"] (Retrieved : 28 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|Ndut initiation rite}}
The history of Njuup derives from the [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut classical teachings]].&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt; Young Serer boys in the ''Ndut'' ([[nest]]) were required to compose religious songs during their [[circumcision]] rite of passage in order to take their minds off the pending circumcision operation, develop their artistic skills and spirituality. These songs are [[Serer religion|Serer religious]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Gav"/&gt; The Njuup tradition is the [[progenitor]] of [[Mbalax]] and for a long part of its history has remained within the confines of the ''Ndut''.  Unlike the ''Mbalax'' which is a [[Dance music|party music]], the Njuup tradition is religious, and it was not until some prominent [[Senegal]]ese artists such [[Youssou N'Dour]] (himself of [[Serer people|Serer heritage]]) began to incorporate it in their early works thereby giving birth to the ''Mbalax'' music.&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt; All Mbalax artists are strongly influenced by the Njuup tradition. There are also other [[Senegambia]]n artists who sing the purest form of Njuup in the [[Serer language]], some of these include [[Rémi Jegaan Dioh]],&lt;ref name="Ferloo"&gt;{{fr icon}} Ferloo [http://www.ferloo.com/Remi-Jegaan-Dioh-Sur-un-air.html "Rémi Jegaan Dioh : Sur un air culturel et cultuel "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513074200/http://www.ferloo.com/Remi-Jegaan-Dioh-Sur-un-air.html |date=2012-05-13 }} (Retrieved : 28 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} All Africa [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201002251041.html "Sénégal: Rémi Diégane Dioh présente samedi son CD dédié à Senghor"]&lt;/ref&gt; the late Serer diva - [[Yandé Codou Sène]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} All Africa [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201112220375.html "Sénégal: Commémoration du dixième anniversaire du décès de Senghor - Les héritiers de Yandé Codou Sène et de Julien Jouga assurent les partitions"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
{{main article|Serer religion|Pangool|Mbalax}}
The [[Serer religion]] especially the veneration of certain Serer [[Pangool]] influenced the religious songs sang in the [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut]]&lt;ref name="Gav"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]]  [http://www.refer.sn/ethiopiques/article.php3?id_article=895&amp;artsuite=6 Le Ndut dans « L'héritage spirituel sereer : valuer traditionnelle d'hier, d'aujourd'hui et de demain »] [in] ''Éthiopiques'' n° 31&lt;/ref&gt;  such as the Njuup, which in turn influenced the [[Mbalax]] and [[:Category:Senegalese singers|Senegalese artists]] who specializes in Mbalax i.e. [[Mbaye Dieye Faye]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Thione Seck]], etc.&lt;ref name="Ferloo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt;

'''''On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων μυστηρίων}}), also known as the '''''Theurgia''''' and under its abbreviated [[Latin]] title '''''De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum''''' (''The Egyptian Mysteries''), is a work of [[Neoplatonic]] philosophy primarily concerned with [[ritual]] and [[theurgy]] and attributed to [[Iamblichus]].

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] is known to have had a disagreement with Iamblichus over the practice of [[theurgy]], and the ''Mysteries'' consists mainly of Iamblichus' responses to the criticisms of his teacher.

[[Proclus]], writing 100 years after Iamblichus, seems to have ascribed to him the authorship of the ''Mysteries''. However, the differences between this book and Iamblichus' other works in style and in some points of doctrine have led some to question whether Iamblichus was the actual author. Still, the treatise certainly originated from his school, and in its systematic attempt to give a speculative justification of the polytheistic cult practices of the day, it marks a turning-point in the history of thought where Iamblichus stood.

The '''''Opening of the Fifth Seal''''' (or '''''The Fifth Seal of the Apocalypse''''' or '''''The Vision of Saint John''''') was painted in the last years of [[El Greco|El Greco's]] life  for a side-[[altar]] of the church of [[Saint John the Baptist]] outside the walls of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Before 1908 El Greco's painting was referred to as '''''Profane Love'''''. [[Manuel B. Cossio|Cossio]] had doubts about the title and suggested the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal''.&lt;ref&gt;In his catalogue the painting Number 327 is called ''De l'Apocalypsis?'' (fragmento)&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Museum, where the painting is kept, comments: "the picture is unfinished and much damaged and abraded."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=11&amp;viewmode=1&amp;item=56.48 Official website of the Metropolitan Museum of Art].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject of the painting==
The very subject is taken from the [[Book of Revelation]] (6:9–11), where the souls of persecuted martyrs cry out to God for justice upon their persecutors on Earth. The ecstatic figure of St. John dominates the [[canvas]], while behind him naked souls writhe in a chaotic storm of emotion as they receive white robes of [[salvation]]. 

The upper portion of the canvas appears to have been considerably cut down (it was destroyed in 1880). This lost upper portion may have resembled that of another altarpiece, the ''Concert of Angels'', painted by El Greco for the same church, and also cut off. Many believed that the bottom section, which has been preserved, depicted profane love, while the missing upper part depicted divine love.&lt;ref name="Foundoulaki116"&gt;E. Foundoulaki, ''From El Greco to Cézanne'', 116&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ownership(s) ==

In the 19th century, the painting was owned by [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]], Prime Minister of Spain. Dissatisfied with the poor condition of the work, he had it "restored" around 1880. The restorers actually trimmed it by at least 175 centimetres (68.9&amp;nbsp;in), leaving John the Evangelist emphatically pointing nowhere. It was this strange [[Non sequitur (literary device)|quirk in composition]] that perhaps intrigued modern viewers the most and contributed to the painting's fame in [[modernism|modernist]] circles.

After Cánovas' death in 1897, the painting was sold for 1,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] to [[Ignacio Zuloaga]], a painter who was instrumental in reviving European interest in El Greco. The painting may be seen in the background of his work ''[[Mis amigos]]'', representing several notable members of the [[Generation of '98]]. Zuloaga is known to have demonstrated the painting to [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. He declared it as possessing a "visionary power" that made it a "precursor of modernism".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Scholz-Hänsel. ''El Greco: Domenikos Theotokopoulos, 1541–1614''. Taschen, 2004. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-3171-7}}. Page 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, the Zuloaga Museum sold this artwork to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]], where it is on exhibit today.

==Comparison with ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|Picasso's ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (1907, oil on canvas, 243.9 × 233.7 cm. (96.02 × 92.01 in), [[New York City]], [[Museum of Modern Art]])]]
It has been suggested that the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' served as an inspiration for the early [[Cubism|Cubist]] works of [[Pablo Picasso]], especially ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', which mirrors the expressionistic angularity of the painting. When Picasso was working on ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', he visited his friend Zuloaga in his studio in [[Paris]] and studied El Greco's ''Opening of the Fifth Seal''.&lt;ref&gt;C. B. Horsley, [http://www.thecityreview.com/elgreco.html The Shock of the Old]&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' and the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;R. Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon'', 102–113&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Ron Johnson was the first to focus on the relationship between the two paintings. According to [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]], a [[Great Britain|British]] art historian, ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' "turns out to have a few more answers to give once we realize that the painting owes at least as much to El Greco as [[Cézanne]]".&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;J. Richardson, ''Picasso's Apocalyptic Whorehouse'', 40–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Efi Foundoulaki insists on the "activity of the triangle Picasso-Cézanne-El Greco, which is established in ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''". Foundoulaki analyzes the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' and states that the clothed figure in the left part of the painting and the naked figures to the right showed the contradiction between profane and divine love. According to Rolf Laesse, this may have been the original inspiration of Picasso who in a preliminary drawing of the ''Demoiselles'' depicted a medical student holding a skull or a book and entering a room where there is a sailor among nude women.&lt;ref name="Laesse"&gt;R. Laesse, ''A Source in El Greco for Picasso's "Demoiselles d'Avignon"'', 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson, however, conjectures that Picasso knew the interpretation by Cossio concerning the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' and based his theory extensively on this conjecture.&lt;ref name="Richardson45"&gt;J. Richardson, ''Picasso's Apocalyptic Whorehouse'', 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson and Foundoulaki emphasize on the morphological parallels between the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' and ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', and explore the Picasso–Cézanne–El Greco relationship.&lt;ref name="Richardson46"&gt;J. Richardson, ''Picasso's Apocalyptic Whorehouse'', 46&lt;/ref&gt; Foundoulaki asserts that there is a similarity of shape and that Picasso ingeniously repeated the game with the |V and the inverted [[triangle]]s of El Greco, something he had already begun in ''The Villagers''.&lt;ref name="Foundoulaki102"&gt;E. Foundoulaki, ''From El Greco to Cézanne'', 102&lt;/ref&gt; According to Foundoulaki, "the dialogue Picasso inaugurated with El Greco in ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', by means of Cézanne, is carried on in [[Cubism]]".&lt;ref name="Foundoulaki102" /&gt; Richardson sees the Apocalypse in El Greco's ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' as the catalyst which showed Picasso how to harness the spiritual energy of a great religious artist to his own demonic ends. According to Richardson, Picasso followed this apocalyptic vision his whole life.&lt;ref name="Richardson46" /&gt;

'''Samuel Daniell''' (born 1775 in [[Chertsey]]; died in [[Sri Lanka]] on 16 December 1811) was an English painter of natural history and other scenes in Africa and [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofnati14stepuoft#page/33/mode/1up|title=Daniell, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Daniell is perhaps best known as the appointed artist for an expedition to Africa and the renderings he did there of African animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Daniell – African scenery and animals, 1804–1805|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/imagegalaxy/imagegalaxy_imageDetail.cfm?id_image=10848|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Libraries|work=Galaxy of Images}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 1799, he went to [[South Africa]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4323/ |title = Sketches Representing the Native Tribes, Animals, and Scenery of Southern Africa: From Drawings Made by the Late Mr. Samuel Daniell |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1820 |accessdate = 2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings he made in southern Africa including a journey to [[Bechuanaland]] were published by his brother [[William Daniell]] in London.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; During the trip to Bechuanaland he was named the official secretary and artist for the trip. The trip went from [[Cape of Good Hope]] to Bechuanaland.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; He returned to England from the trip and co-published with [[William Daniell]] and [[Thomas Daniell]], ''African Scenery and Animals,'' in 1804.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

He later on lived in [[Sri Lanka]], then called [[Ceylon]], from 1806 to his death from [[tropical fever]].&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5y42AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Samuel+Daniell&amp;as_brr=3 Catalogue of drawings by British artists and artists of foreign origin, pg 17]&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve of his drawings also were published by his brother in 1806 with the title: ''A Picturesque Illustration of the Scenery, Animals and Native Inhabitants of Ceylon''.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

After Samuel Daniell's death, further engravings based on his drawings were published: In 1820, forty-eight [[lithograph]]s titled ''Sketches Representing the Native Tribes and Scenery of Southern Africa'', and in 1832, ''Twenty Varied Subjects of the Tribe of Antelopes''.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

'''''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[feminist]] [[academic journal]]. It was established in 1975 by [[Catharine R. Stimpson]], and is published quarterly by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. ''Signs'' publishes essays examining the lives of women, men, and [[Non-Binary|non-binary]] people around the globe from both historical and contemporary perspectives, as well as theoretical and critical articles addressing processes of [[gender]]ing, [[sexualization]], and [[racialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=M|year=2011|title=Signs 2005–2015: Reflections on the Nature and Global Reach of Interdisciplinary Feminist Knowledge Production|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657513|journal=Signs|volume=36|issue=3|pages=511–519|doi=10.1086/657513|jstor=10.1086/657513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and significance ==
The founding of ''Signs'' in 1975 was part of the early development of the field of [[women's studies]], born of the [[women's liberation movement]] of the late 1960s and 1970s. The journal had two founding purposes, as stated in the inaugural editorial: (1) "to publish the new scholarship about women" in the U.S. and around the globe, and (2) "to be [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stimpson|first=Catharine R.|last2=Burstyn|first2=Joan N.|last3=Stanton|first3=Domna C.|last4=Whisler|first4=Sandra M.|date=1975-10-01|title=Editorial|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493202|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=1|issue=1|pages=v–viii|doi=10.1086/493202|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was for readers of the journal to "grasp a sense of the totality of women's lives and the realities of which they have been a part."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The meaning behind the name ''Signs'' is that signs "represent" and "point": the original editors wanted the journal to "represent the originality and rigor" of women's studies and to "point" to new directions for feminist scholarship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Former editor-in-chief Ruth-Ellen Boetcher Joeres said in an article in the [[Yale Journal of Criticism]] that ''Signs'', from its inception, was meant to be "something different, even insurgent...an agent for change", because it emerged from the "[[grassroots]]" feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joeres|first=Ruth-Ellen B.|date=1997-10-01|title=The Paradox of a Feminist Academic Journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/36767|journal=The Yale Journal of Criticism|volume=10|issue=2|pages=439–443|doi=10.1353/yale.1997.0021|issn=1080-6636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joeres explored the "paradox" of how a journal can be both an "agent for change" and regarded as "respectable in the academy," and concluded with the hope that ''Signs'' could retain its activist roots and transform the academy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the effort to avoid the tendency of the academy to "codify" and limit scholarship, ''Signs'' rotates institutional homes roughly every 5 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is currently based at [[Northeastern University]], with [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], Director of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Professor of Sociology, serving as editor-in-chief. In her inaugural editorial, Walters laid out five "core concerns" for ''Signs'': (1) for the field of women's studies to "substantively reckon" with [[Gender studies|gender and sexuality studies]] and [[queer studies]]; (2) to focus on "racial and ethnic difference"; (3) to re-emphasize "inter- or transdisciplinarity"; (4) to not lose sight of "the big questions about gender and sexuality" by getting too narrow in scope; and (5) to expand the journal's "digital presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/inaugural-editorial-thinking-and-doing-feminism/|title=Inaugural Editorial: Thinking and Doing Feminism|date=2014-12-08|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of ''Signs'' is explored extensively in Kelly Coogan-Gehr's 2011 book ''The Geopolitics of the Cold War and Narratives of Inclusion: Excavating a Feminist Archive''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcJgAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Geopolitics+of+the+Cold+War+and+Narratives+of+Inclusion:+Excavating+a+Feminist+Archive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4prGtkuvVAhVJ2oMKHRciAeAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Geopolitics%20of%20the%20Cold%20War%20and%20Narratives%20of%20Inclusion:%20Excavating%20a%20Feminist%20Archive&amp;f=false|title=The Geopolitics of the Cold War and Narratives of Inclusion: Excavating a Feminist Archive|last=Coogan-Gehr|first=K.|date=2011-11-03|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230370555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coogan-Gehr uses ''Signs'' as a case study to complicate what she calls the "stock narrative of feminist field formation." She argues that dominant histories of the development of academic feminism, in focusing solely on the women's movement and other radical movements of the 1960s, fail to take into account the role of "changes the Cold War produced in higher education."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the book, she calls ''Signs'' a "premier academic feminist journal."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Feminist Public Intellectuals Project (FPIP) ==
In 2015, ''Signs'' launched the [http://signsjournal.org/feminist-public-intellectuals-project/ Feminist Public Intellectuals Project], which seeks to engage feminist theorizing with pressing political and social problems via three open-access, online-first initiatives: [http://signsjournal.org/short-takes/ Short Takes: Provocations on Public Feminism,] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/ Currents: Feminist Key Concepts and Controversies], and [http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist/ Ask a Feminist.] Given the fragmentation of feminist activism and the persistent negative freighting of the term “feminist,” the Feminist Public Intellectuals Project seeks to reimagine what role a journal can play in provoking activism.

''Short Takes'' features commentaries by feminist activists and public intellectuals on recent books that "have shaped popular conversations about feminist issues," alongside a response by the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/short-takes/|title=Short Takes|date=2015-06-12|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured books include [[Roxane Gay|Roxane Gay's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/bad-feminist Bad Feminist]'', [[Rebecca Traister|Rebecca Traister's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/all-the-single-ladies/ All the Single Ladies]'', and [[Andi Zeisler|Andi Zeisler's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/zeisler/ We Were Feminists Once.]''

''Currents'' publishes essays that put forth "a nuanced and edgy take on a key issue circulating in the feminist definitional landscape."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Issues addressed include [http://signsjournal.org/currents-identity-politics/ "identity politics,"] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-trigger-warnings/ "trigger warnings,"] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-celebrity-feminism/ "celebrity feminism,"] and [http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/ "affirmative consent."]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/|title=Currents: Affirmative Consent|date=2015-11-02|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ask a Feminist'' is an interview series that seeks to create "conversation between and among feminist scholars, media activists, and community leaders," to bridge the divide between scholarship and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist/|title=Ask a Feminist|date=2016-05-17|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent features include "[[Angela P. Harris]] on Gender and Gun Violence"[http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist-harris-farrell/] and "[[Cathy J. Cohen]] on [[Black Lives Matter]], Feminism, and Contemporary Activism."[http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist-cohen-jackson/]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist/|title=Ask a Feminist|date=2016-05-17|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catharine R. Stimpson Prize ==
''Signs'' awards the Catharine R. Stimpson Prize for Outstanding Feminist Scholarship, named for the founding editor-in-chief of ''Signs,'' biennially to the best paper from an international competition of "emerging" feminist scholars (meaning "fewer than seven years since receipt of the terminal degree"). The submissions are judged by an international jury of prominent feminist academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/anna-hajkova-wins-2013-catharine-stimpson-prize-for-feminist-scholarship/|title=Anna Hájková Wins 2013 Catharine Stimpson Prize for Feminist Scholarship|date=2012-08-24|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners receive a $1,000 honorarium and have their papers published in ''Signs'''.'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/for-authors/calls-for-papers/#stimpson|title=Calls for Papers|date=2012-08-21|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Southpaw''''' is a 2015 American [[Sports film|sports drama]] film directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]], written by [[Kurt Sutter]] and starring [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Forest Whitaker]] and [[Rachel McAdams]]. The film follows a boxer who sets out to get his life back on track after losing his wife in an accident and his young daughter to protective services. The film was released on July 24, 2015, by [[The Weinstein Company]].

The film marked one of the last films to be scored by [[James Horner]], and one of three posthumous releases to feature his music. The film and the [[Southpaw (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack album]] are dedicated to his memory.

==Plot==
Billy "The Great" Hope is an undefeated [[Professional boxing|professional boxer]] living in the suburbs of [[New York City]] with his wife Maureen and their daughter Leila. Billy's particular style of fighting often leaves him beaten and bruised. During a match in which he defends his [[light heavyweight]] world title, Billy sustains an eye injury as well as heavy blows to the face and body, leaving him coughing up blood for days. He is finally convinced by Maureen to retire before he becomes forever "punch-drunk". During the press conference at the post-match, an up-and-coming boxer Miguel "Magic" Escobar taunts Billy and tries to get Billy to fight him. At a charity event for the orphanage where he and his wife both grew up, Escobar is in attendance, and as Billy is leaving, Escobar threatens he'll take Maureen and his title away from him, and while Maureen tells Billy to let it go and go home with her, Billy's anger gets the best of him, leading to a brawl in which Maureen is accidentally shot and killed by Miguel's brother Hector, who flees.

Billy begins abusing alcohol and drugs while obsessively searching for Hector. He eventually gets a tip about Hector's whereabouts but only finds Hector's drug-addicted wife Maria, and leaves after learning Hector is a father. Billy attacks a referee out of frustration after throwing a fight and is suspended for a year, leaving him with no income and a six figure fine for ref assault. Furthermore, the networks are suing him for breach of contract, leaving him indebted and his house and belongings being repossessed. He continues to spiral out of control and nearly dies after crashing his car in a suicide attempt; he loses custody of Leila as a result, and she is put under care of [[Child Protective Services]] officer Angela Rivera. The incident drives Billy to sober up, but Leila cuts ties with him, blaming him for their predicament.

At the behest of his friends, Billy gets a job as a cleaner at a gym owned by seasoned boxer Titus "Tick" Wills, and tries to convince Tick to become his trainer. Billy's former manager, Jordan Mains, who is currently managing Miguel, arranges a fight between the two that could put Billy back in the spotlight. Tick is reluctant to train Billy, fearful he might be blinded by his vendetta against Miguel, but is motivated to do so when another of his students, Hoppy, is killed by his abusive father while attempting to defend his mother.

Seeing Billy's hard work after securing a job and keeping it, and his ability to show responsibilities of a father, a judge removes his visitation restrictions and congratulates him for his good work. Billy then takes Leila to his apartment where they have breakfast together and Leila asks if she can attend the fight. Billy, reluctant to let his daughter go to the fight because Maureen never wanted to expose their daughter to the violence in boxing, says he is unsure because Maureen used to make all the decisions for him. Leila asks if they can go visit Maureen's grave, where Leila convinces Billy to let her go to the fight to have someone by his side. Billy tells Leila that there will be people at the fight saying some harsh things, so Leila makes an agreement to go to the fight but stay only in the locker room with Angela, watching the fight via closed circuit television in the locker room.

As the match begins, Miguel has the upper hand against Billy, but, with Tick's advice, Billy has the chance to turn the tables in the final round by using the [[Boxing styles and technique#Defense|Philly shell defense]] and countering more aggressively with his left. As the round reaches its final minute, Billy pivots hard and, although fighting from a traditional stance, delivers a powerful left uppercut which knocks the champion down to the ground. Miguel manages to get up before the count is over and is saved by the bell. Billy is declared the winner by a split-decision and reunites with Leila in the locker room, where she forgives his past mistakes and they embrace.

==Production==
[[Eminem]] was originally supposed to play the role of Billy Hope. The film's screenwriter [[Kurt Sutter]] said the project was inspired by the rapper's personal struggles. He stated that he had taken meetings with Eminem's producing partners over the past seven years, looking for something to do together. "I know he's very selective and doesn't do a lot. But he shared so much of his personal struggle in this raw and very honest album, one that I connected with on a lot of levels. He is very interested in the boxing genre, and it seemed like an apt metaphor, because his own life has been a brawl. In a way, this is a continuation of the ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' story, but we are doing a metaphorical narrative of the second chapter of his life. He'll play a world champion boxer who really hits a hard bottom, and has to fight to win back his life for his young daughter. At its core, this is a retelling of his struggles over the last five years of his life, using the boxing analogy. I love that the title refers to Marshall being a lefty, which is to boxing what a white rapper is to hip hop; dangerous, unwanted, and completely unorthodox. It's a much harder road for a [[southpaw]] than a right-handed boxer."&lt;ref name="deadline5"/&gt; Producers Alan and Peter Riche have given a slightly different story about Eminem's involvement however stating that they set out to make a boxing movie similar to ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'' but wanted to make the story about a father-daughter relationship as opposed to ''The Champ''{{'}}s father-son story.&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt; Recalling Eminem's strong relationship with his daughter, they asked him and he was immediately receptive.&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt;

On December 13, 2010, [[DreamWorks]] acquired the script, with Eminem eyed to play the lead role,&lt;ref name="deadline5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/12/dreamworks-teams-with-eminem-and-kurt-sutter-for-southpaw/ |title=DreamWorks Teams With Eminem And Kurt Sutter For 'Southpaw' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the following August the studio dropped the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/eminem-antoine-fuqua-boxing-drama-southpaw-dropped-by-dreamworks-but-still-seeking-to-answer-bell/ |title=Eminem-Antoine Fuqua Boxing Drama 'Southpaw' Dropped By DreamWorks But Still Seeking To Answer Bell |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] picked up the film that October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeff Sneider |url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/mgm-closes-eminem-pic-southpaw-1118044796/ |title=MGM closes Eminem pic ‘Southpaw’ |publisher=Variety |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2012, Eminem dropped out of the film to focus instead on his music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminems-second-movie-put-on-hold-20120510 |title=Eminem delays second movie, 'Southpaw' to focus on music. |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Fuqua]] signed on to the project in March 2014 with [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] replacing Eminem.&lt;ref name="deadline1"/&gt; Other casting news was announced in May 2014 with [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], and [[Rachel McAdams]] officially joining the cast.&lt;ref name="deadline2"/&gt; In August of that year, it was announced that [[Naomie Harris]] would be replacing Nyong'o.&lt;ref name="deadline6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamato |first=Jen |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/08/naomie-harris-jake-gyllenhaal-southpaw/ |title=Naomie Harris Joins Jake Gyllenhaal In 'Southpaw' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyllenhaal did research for his role by doing "tons of reading on boxers, orphan boxers, the spirit of gyms all over America, children who start early, [and] the history of [[foster care]] in America"&lt;ref name="huffington research"/&gt; while also spending five months training as a boxer.&lt;ref name="huffington research"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Matthew|title=With ‘Southpaw,’ Jake Gyllenhaal’s Physical Transformations Become A One-Two Punch|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jake-gyllenhaal-southpaw_us_55ae83dde4b07af29d567e26|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminem would later praise Gyllenhaal's performance, noting that "Jake smashed it" in an interview with [[Zane Lowe]].&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guerrasio|first1=Jason|title=New movie 'Southpaw' was created for Eminem — but here's why the role ended up going to Jake Gyllenhaal|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/southpaw-eminem-jake-gyllenhaal-casting-2015-7|website=Business Insider|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soren Anderson of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "''Southpaw'', a boxing movie with a theme of redemption, is redeemed by the performances of its two main actors, Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andersen |first=Soren |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/southpaw-hokey-boxing-film-has-fine-acting-in-its-corner/ |title=‘Southpaw’: Hokey boxing film has fine acting in its corner |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Smith of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying "It brings back every stale genre convention you can think of, then hopes you won't recognize predictability pumped up with swearing and steroids and an Eminem song during the training montage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Kyle |url=https://nypost.com/2015/07/23/jake-gyllenhaals-southpaw-is-a-stale-cliche-filled-fight/ |title=Jake Gyllenhaal’s ‘Southpaw’ is a stale, cliche-filled fight &amp;#124; New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "This is a genre with especially sturdy bones, and when ''Southpaw'' connects, which is more often than you might expect, you feel it down to your toes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2015/07/23/southpaw-old-two-punch/5bdZfJeFAj1kzPAgtdiVeO/story.html |title=In ‘Southpaw,’ it’s the old 0ne-two punch - Movies |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying "''Southpaw'' may be rote, predictable and mawkish, but none of those faults lie in its star.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3959">The '''Symphony in E minor''' is the first [[symphony]] written by the American composer [[Florence Price]].  The work was completed in 1932 and was first performed by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] under the conductor [[Frederick Stock]] in June 1933.  The piece was Price's first full-scale [[orchestra]]l composition and was the first symphony by a black woman to be performed by a major American orchestra.&lt;ref name="Symphony nos. 1 and 3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Florence |author-link=Florence Price |date=January 1, 2008 |orig-year=1932 |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Rae Linda |editor2-last=Shirley |editor2-first=Wayne D. |title=Symphonies nos. 1 and 3 |publisher=A-R Editions |pages=xxxviii-xlv |isbn=0895796384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewMusicBox"&gt;{{cite web |last=Oteri |first=Frank J. |title=Sounds Heard: Florence B.

==Composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 40 minutes and is composed in four numbered [[Movement (music)|movements]].

===Background===
The symphony was composed between January 1931 and early 1932 while Price recovered from a broken foot.  In February 1932, Price entered the symphony in the Rodman Wanamaker Competition, in addition to three other concert works that she composed.  While all of Price's entries received recognition, her Symphony in E minor won the first place $500 prize for an orchestral work.  The award brought Price national recognition and caught the attention of the conductor [[Frederick Stock]] of the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]].  Stock later premiered the symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in June 1933.&lt;ref name="Symphony nos. 1 and 3" /&gt;

Price drew inspiration for the piece from [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9 in E minor, ''From the New World'']].&lt;ref name="Symphony nos. 1 and 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewMusicBox" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for an orchestra comprising two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], two [[piccolo]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion, and [[String section|strings]].

==Reception==
The initial critical response to the symphony was positive, though the work has since fallen into relative obscurity.&lt;ref name="Symphony nos. 1 and 3" /&gt;  In 2012, Bob McQuiston of [[NPR]] called it "an early American symphony worthy of being rediscovered."  He further remarked:{{quote|The opening movement has melodies and rhythms typically found in Afro-American folk music, and recalls Dvorák's ''New World Symphony'', while the following slow movement features a moving hymn tune of Price's design.  Both concluding movements are fast and return to the juba dance concept. They contain hints of fiddles and banjos, antic slide whistle effects, and a recurring three-against-two melody which end this loveable work on a whimsical note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McQuiston |first=Bob |title=Classical Lost And Found: Florence Price Rediscovered |work=Deceptive Cadence |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=February 28, 2012 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2012/02/27/147522468/classical-lost-and-found-florence-b-price-rediscovered |accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5010">The '''Symphony No. 8 ''Autumnal Fragments''''', Op. 81, is the eighth [[symphony]] by the Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] and was completed in October 2001.  Its world premiere was given by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by [[Paavo Järvi]] at the [[Concertgebouw]] on April 16, 2004.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sallinen |first=Aulis |authorlink=Aulis Sallinen |year=2001 |title=Symphony No. 8 (''Autumnal Fragments'') |publisher=[[G. Schirmer Inc.]] |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/1356/13495 |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Background===
The symphony is cast in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]] and has a duration of approximately 20 minutes.  Sallinen described its composition in the score program notes, remarking, "I have sought to combine two contrasting elements in this work: one that is fragmentary and sketchy, and one that maintains a symphonic discipline and coherence."  He continued:{{quote|Whenever I have had the chance, I have always enjoyed being in an artist's studio, looking at sketches. The fascination of a sketch lies in the fact that it conveys a strong, quickly realised inspiration and vision, at the same time leaving scope for many possible alterations and developments. All paths to completion are open, no possibilities have been excluded, and so the sketch is the foundation of a multi-faceted whole.}}

The music quotes the "Theme of the Dead" from Sallinen's 1992 opera ''[[Kullervo (Sallinen)|Kullervo]]''.  Additionally, the "Bell Theme" of the symphony's finale is a homage to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; this theme consists of the possible musical notes contained in the words "Concertgebouw Amsterdam," or CCEGEBAEDA.

The composition of the symphony was influenced by the [[September 11 attacks]], which occurred late in the writing process.  Sallinen wrote, "The title ''Autumnal Fragments'' refers not only to the age of the composer, but also the tragic events of September 11. That is why the finale turned out to be different from my original design."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of four [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (3rd and 4th doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s, three [[clarinet]]s (4th doubling [[bass clarinet]]), three [[bassoon]]s (3rd doubling [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], four percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
The symphony has been praised by music critics.  Reviewing a 2005 performance by the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Anthony Tommasini]]  of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the piece as "like a string of boldly disconnected rhythmic riffs, melodic motives and aborted attempts at development."  Tommasini further remarked:{{quote|It begins with a nonchalant rhythmic pattern for wood blocks, as if the percussionist is trying to get the piece going. Soon, strangely haunting things happen: whistling figurations from the violins, [[Minimal music|minimalistic]] repetitions in the lower strings, pungent brass chorales that suddenly stop. A middle section, like a nervous [[scherzo]], gains in impetus and density. But the work subsides into a slow, funereal ending, the composer's response, as he has written, to the horrors of 9/11. If the fragments never quite coalesce into a whole, Mr. Sallinen takes you on a journey so wondrous you are sorry when it ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |title=Familial, Geographical and Musical Connections |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 26, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/26/arts/music/familial-geographical-and-musical-connections.html |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Guy Rickards of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' said the title "seems at odds with the music's unbroken flow and much of the work's dynamic arises from this tension between static and moving elements, encapsulated right at the start, dominated by the percussion."  He added, "The process of integrating these irreconcilable elements has a kinship with that in Sallinen's Fifth, ''Washington Mosaics'', but the Eighth's structure is more obviously integrated and quietly compelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rickards |first=Guy |title=Sallinen Symphony No 8; Violin Concerto |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=December 2005 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/sallinen-symphony-no-8-violin-concerto |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Center for Art in Wood''' is an American educational [[wood art]] institution located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It was officially established as a nonprofit in 1986 by brothers Albert and Alan LeCoff, following a series of international symposium from 1976-1986 presented by the LeCoff's with woodturner Palmer Sharpless.  The organization operated as the Wood Turning Center until 2011, when the nonprofit moved to its current location in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City District of Philadelphia]] and changed its name to The Center for Art in Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/10/garden/philadelphia-design.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Four Square Blocks: Philadelphia|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Center presents changing exhibitions of contemporary art work in the medium of wood, a permanent collection of over 1,000 pieces and a host of educational programs and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmagazine.com/big-philadelphia/38|work=Big Magazine|title=The Center for Art in Wood|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center also houses a research library, artists files, and a museum store.  A series of publications documents the Center's work and highlights premier artists working in the field of [[wood turning]] and art in wood.

The film's initial German title is '''''Der ewige Jude''''', the German term for the character of the "[[Wandering Jew]]" in medieval folklore. At the insistence of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Minister of Propaganda]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], the film was directed by [[Fritz Hippler]].

With a screenplay credited to [[Eberhard Taubert]], the film consists of feature and documentary footage combined with materials filmed shortly after the [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|Nazi occupation of Poland]]. At this time, Poland's Jewish population was about three million, roughly ten percent of the total population. Actor [[Harry Giese]] narrated.

==Background==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-04-29-36, München, Ausstellung "Der ewige Jude".jpg|thumb|left|The interior of the exhibition ''The Eternal Jew'' (1937/1938)]]
[[File:Plakat der ewige Jude, 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for ''The Eternal Jew'' exhibition, 1937]]
Hitler and Goebbels believed that film was a vital tool for molding public opinion.  The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] first established a film department in 1930 and Goebbels had taken a personal interest in the use of film to promote the Nazi philosophy and agenda.  Soon after the Nazi takeover, Goebbels insisted in speeches that the role of the German cinema was to serve as the "vanguard of the Nazi military".&lt;ref name="Eisner2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Lotte H. |title=The Haunted Screen: Expressionism in the German Cinema and the Influence of Max Reinhardt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwZ_S6ap1LcC&amp;pg=PA329|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=29 September 2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25790-0|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goebbels film appears to have been intended as a violently anti-Semitic version of the British film ''[[The Wandering Jew (1933 film)|The Wandering Jew]]'', which argued that Jews were victims of relentless persecution throughout history. Saul Friedländer suggests that Goebbels' intent was to counter three films: [[Jew Süss (1934 film)|''Jew Süss'']], ''[[The House of Rothschild]]'', and ''The Wandering Jew''. These three films, all released in 1933-34, showed that Jews were persecuted throughout history; the Goebbels films presented the opposite message.&lt;ref name="Friedländer2008_20"&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedländer|first=Saul|title=The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KaCGDUys50C&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=21 November 2018|date=6 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-093048-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, a special wing of the [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]] put on an art exhibition in [[Munich]] titled ''[[The Eternal Jew (art exhibition)|Der ewige Jude]]''.  It followed this up with the publication of [[The Eternal Jew (book)|a book of the same title]], consisting of 265 photographs, each with a derogatory caption asserting the degeneracy of the Jewish race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Virtual Library: The Eternal Jew |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/eternal.html |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maxwell|first=Anne |title=Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870-1940|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=X99qg-eQDKcC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=1 April 2010|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-415-4|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1938, Goebbels made a series of attacks against the Jews in the German media that were a factor which resulted in the pogrom known as [[Kristallnacht]].  Despite the emotional satisfaction afforded the Nazis by carrying out their antisemitism with direct violence, Kristallnacht was considered by Hitler to have been a political disaster both within Germany and internationally.  Not only did the brutality indirectly caused by Goebbels evoke harsh criticism internationally, the mixed reaction in the German media showed a lack of broad-based support among Germans for antisemitism and violence.&lt;ref name="Fritz2011 p. 15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritz|first=Stephen G. |title=Ostkrieg: Hitler's War of Extermination in the East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNsg8VBGs8AC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=21 November 2018|date=8 September 2011|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-3416-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler expressed his frustration and anger at the mixed response from the German media and insisted that, instead of openly calling for violence against the Jews as Goebbels had in instigating the pogrom, Nazi propaganda should "elucidate events of foreign policy" in such a way that the German people themselves would call for violence against the Jews.&lt;ref name="Fritz2011 p. 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazkani_2008&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Moreshet |date=Summer 2008 |first=Shay|last=Hazkani|title=Forbidden Films – An Analysis of the Nazi Propaganda Films The Eternal Jew and Jew Suess and Their Influence on the German Public|page=181|url=http://issuu.com/shay_hazkani/docs/hazkani_y5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Hitler's harsh reprimand, Goebbels launched a campaign to promote the anti-Semitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an anti-Semitic film.  In the case of ''The Eternal Jew'', Goebbels conceived of a film that would communicate to the German people the same antisemitic message that had been the theme of the 1937 Munich exhibition. Hitler preferred films such as ''The Eternal Jew'' which presented the Nazi anti-Semitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straightforward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching anti-Semitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal.  The film ''[[Jud Süß (1940 film)|Jud Süß]]'' is an example of Goebbels' preferred approach.&lt;ref name="Rees2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Laurence |title=Auschwitz: A New History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wh9QVS3A5QIC&amp;pg=PR16|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=9 January 2006|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-357-9|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Although Goebbels did not generally take an active role in the production of particular films, he elected to do so in the case of major propaganda films such as ''The Eternal Jew''.&lt;ref name="Friedländer2008_20" /&gt; The film was in production for over a year.&lt;ref name="HaggithNewman2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haggith|first1=Toby |last2=Newman|first2=Joanna |title=Holocaust and the moving image: representations in film and television since 1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hetrpvcBuuEC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=16 November 2011|date=1 August 2005|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-904764-51-9|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940, Goebbels devoted "constant attention" to the production of what he referred to as "the Jew film".&lt;ref name="FriedländerKenan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedländer|first1=Saul |last2=Kenan|first2=Orna|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1933-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EY2npqn0J8UC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=10 March 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-135027-6|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As early as 1938, Goebbels had wanted to have a film crew travel to Poland to shoot the ghetto scenes; however, he was unable to gain permission from the Polish government.  In October and November 1939, almost immediately after the German/Soviet [[invasion of Poland]], he instructed Hippler to send camera crews to [[Łódź]], [[Warsaw]], [[Cracow]] and [[Lublin]] to shoot footage of Polish Jews.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002_148"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etlin|first=Richard A. |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQXoZ3oZ3-cC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=15 October 2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22087-1|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PagesRhiel2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pages|first1=Neil Christian |last2=Rhiel|first2=Mary |last3=O'Sickey|first3=Ingeborg Majer |title=Riefenstahl screened: an anthology of new criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vf4k0Y3mMcC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 May 2008|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-2801-1|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The footage that Hippler shot in the Jewish ghettos of those cities in German occupied Poland was the only footage shot specifically for the purpose of the film.  At the beginning of the film, animated text informs the audience that this "documentary footage" shows Jews in their original state "before they put on the mask of civilized Europeans."&lt;ref name="Reimer2002_135"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reimer|first=Robert C. |title=Cultural History Through a National Socialist Lens: Essays on the Cinema of the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zf0FW0fjLNQC&amp;pg=PA135|accessdate=16 November 2011|year=2002|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-134-8|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Nazi press, Hippler expanded on this claim, asserting that his filming techniques captured Jews "in an unprejudiced manner, real to life as they live and as they react in their own surroundings."&lt;ref name="Reimer2002_136"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reimer|first=Robert C. |title=Cultural History Through a National Socialist Lens: Essays on the Cinema of the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zf0FW0fjLNQC&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=16 November 2011|year=2002|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-134-8|page=136 |quote=In the Nazi press, Hippler explained, "No Jew was forced into any kind of action or position during the shooting. Moreover, we let the filmed Jews be on their own and tried to shoot in moments when they were unaware of the camera's presence.  Consequently, we have rendered the Ghetto Jews in an unprejudiced manner, real to life as they live and as they react in their own surroundings.  All who see this film will be convinced that there is never a forced or scared expression in the faces of the Jews who are filmed passing by, trading or attending ritual services."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hippler advertised the film as being a factual documentary consisting of pictures of real Jews with nothing faked or simulated, his claims were complete falsehoods.  In reality, the film was an exercise in manipulation for the purposes of propaganda.  In shooting his footage, Hippler did in fact simulate scenes and use actors who were performing under duress and without knowledge of how the footage would be employed.  For example, in order to get shots of Jewish worship services, Hippler and Goebbels assembled the congregation of the Vilker synagogue, ordered them to wear the ''tallithim'' and ''tefillin'' and hold a full-scale service.  When the Germans ordered the Torah reader to read from the Torah, he started by saying on camera "Today is Tuesday" signalling that his reading of the Torah was coerced since it was not customary to read the Torah on Tuesdays.&lt;ref name="FriedländerKenan2009" /&gt;

Aside from the footage shot in Poland, the rest of the film consisted of stills and archival footage from feature films (often without permission) that the film presented as if they were documentary footage.&lt;ref name="HuenerNicosia2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huener|first1=Jonathan |last2=Nicosia|first2=Francis R. |title=The arts in Nazi Germany: continuity, conformity, change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynlpiQ7LUjsC&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=12 November 2011|year=2006|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-209-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and structure==
The movie was produced in a documentary format and, like other Hippler films, relied heavily on narration.&lt;ref name="Barnouw1993 pp. 141–142"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik|title=Documentary: a history of the non-fiction film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtZ91DNvgBMC&amp;pg=PA141|accessdate=17 November 2011|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507898-5|pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film can be roughly divided into four thematic areas:
* Recordings from Polish ghettos
* Enumeration and evaluation of numerous political, cultural and social values in the international arena of Jewish origin
* Religious ceremonies, religious instruction, worship, ritual slaughter
* Adolf Hitler's Reichstag speech, parading SA troops

==Themes==
Richard Barsam writes the film's "essential contrast is between myths and stereotypes of Jews and the Nazi ideal of a 'master race,' between the alleged inferiority of the Jews and the superiority of the Germans."&lt;ref name="Barsam1992_204"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barsam|first=Richard Meran |title=Nonfiction film: a critical history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7p36FdLYdIC&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=1992|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20706-7|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen Fritz, Goebbels' intent was to create a film that would serve as "both a demonstration of the parasitical nature of the Jews and a justification for drastic measures against them."&lt;ref name="Fritz2011 p. 22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritz|first=Stephen G. |title=Ostkrieg: Hitler's War of Extermination in the East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNsg8VBGs8AC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=21 November 2018|date=8 September 2011|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-3416-1|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Tatar writes that the Nazis were able to use Hippler's film to "position the victims of their genocidal project as dangerous aggressors who had to be exterminated."&lt;ref name="Hantke2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hantke|first=Steffen|title=Horror Film: Creating and Marketing Fear|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAX81WbAcfcC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=9 September 2009|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-376-1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Barsam describes the film as arguing that "Jews are criminals;... they have no soul;... they are different in every way;... killing them is not a crime, but a necessity—just as killing rats is a necessity to preserve health and cleanliness."&lt;ref name="Barsam1992_205"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barsam|first=Richard Meran|title=Nonfiction film: a critical history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7p36FdLYdIC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=1992|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20706-7|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unser Wille und Weg'', a Nazi Party monthly publication aimed at propagandists, provides a rationale for why ''The Eternal Jew'' was made.  The author of the essay "The Film of a 2000-Year Rat Migration,"&lt;ref name=UnserWille&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/ewig.htm|title=A Nazi review of 'The Eternal Jew'}}&lt;/ref&gt; who remains anonymous, believes the film shows "a full picture of Jewry" and provides "the best treatment of this parasitic race."  The author connects the Jews' migration from the Middle East to Egypt and their following of German colonists to rats traveling as a group, who "even then displayed the same criminal traits that they still displayed".  The film is complimented for "its portrayal of the Jews' vulgar methods and the brutality and all-devouring hatred they exhibit when they reach their goal and control finance."&lt;ref name=UnserWille /&gt; The slaughtering method causes the author to question the "so-called Jewish religion", as butchers do their work with grins on their face.&lt;ref name=UnserWille /&gt; In closing, the author states the film will be a valuable tool in the struggle to break the Jews' "power over us.  We are the initiators of the fight against world Jewry, which now directs its hate, its brutal greed and destructive will toward us.  We must win this battle for ourselves, for Europe, for the world."&lt;ref name=UnserWille /&gt;

Richard Taylor describes the basic tenet of the film as arguing that "the Jew is an oriental barbarian who has insinuated himself cleverly into European society, and now exploits it parasitically."&lt;ref name="Taylor1998_175"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Richard |title=Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ2ihtMCI5QC&amp;pg=PA175 |accessdate=12 November 2011 |year=1998 |publisher=I. B. Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-167-1 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point is emphasized throughout the film, starting from the very opening lines of the film's commentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The "civilized" Jews that we know in Germany give us only an incomplete picture of their racial character.  This film shows genuine shots of the Polish ghettos.  It shows the Jews as they really are, before they conceal themselves behind the mask of the civilized European.&lt;ref name="Taylor1998_175" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following this commentary, the film provides a succession of scenes in which Jews are portrayed as an uncivilized, parasitic people with low social standing. The images were mostly shot on site in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and other Polish ghettos, showing subjects who were deliberately chosen to be poorly dressed, dirty and who had partially toothless grins. The locations shown are dirty and infested by vermin. Robert Reimer asserts that a central theme of the film is the assertion that "Jews have always lived in the ghettos and in fact they ''choose'' to live this way."  According to Reimer, the film asserts that ghettos are "ordinary [and] normal" aspects of Jewish life.  Reimer charges that what the film is actually showing is not the normal life of Polish Jewry but rather the "effect of the Nazi administration and the disruption of the lives of millions of Polish Jews."&lt;ref name="Reimer2002_135"/&gt; Erik Barnouw describes the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] after the Nazi conquest as a place where "hundreds of thousands of Jews were herded by the [[Nazi]] conquerors into pockets of indescribable misery."  He describes footage shot there as showing "half-starved, unshaven creatures caught in pathetic acts of barter - a pair of socks for a scrap of food." It is scenes such as these that the film presents as showing Jews "in their natural state."&lt;ref name="Barnouw1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik|title=Documentary: a history of the non-fiction film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtZ91DNvgBMC&amp;pg=PA141|accessdate=17 November 2011|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507898-5|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film utilizes a [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] that juxtaposes these images of ghetto Jews with images of rats to draw an analogy between the migration of Jews from Eastern Europe with the migration of rats.  For example, one of the shots shows a pack of [[rat]]s emerging from a sewer, followed by a shot of a crowd of Jews in a bustling street of the [[Łódź Ghetto]]. Close-ups of those in the crowd reveal sickly, malformed facial features. The narrator states that, as rats are the vermin of the animal kingdom, Jews are the vermin of the human race and similarly spread disease and corruption. Unlike rats, however, the narrator continues, Jews have the uncanny ability to change their appearance and blend into their "human hosts." A scene depicts four bearded men in traditional religious Jewish clothing, then shows them shaved and in modern business suits, while the narrator explains that only a "trained eye" can distinguish their Jewish features.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Where rats appear, they bring ruin by destroying mankind's goods and foodstuffs.  In this way, they spread disease, plague, leprosy, typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and so on.  They are cunning, cowardly and cruel and are found mostly in large packs. Among the animals, they represent the rudiment of an insidious, underground destruction – just like the Jews among human beings."&lt;ref name="Smith2011_137"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=David Livingstone |title=Less than human: why we demean, enslave, and exterminate others |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWAiRrm3LkcC&amp;pg=PA137 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-53272-7 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film also claims that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jewish people] need other people because they need the goods with which to carry on business. The things that are valued by the creative ''Aryan'' peoples have been reduced by the Jew to the level of a mere piece of merchandise, which he buys and sells but cannot produce himself. He leaves production to the labourers and peasants of the people upon whom he has imposed his presence. The Jews are a race without farmers and without manual labourers, a race of parasites.&lt;ref name="I. B. Trauris"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to ''Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;By showing the way in which Jews allegedly insinuate themselves from small-scale to large-scale operations by preying on others, the film returns to its original image of the Jew concealing himself 'behind the mask of the civilised European'. [...] According to the film, the Jew presents an insidious, because concealed, threat, and one that is growing and must be brought under control. The message of this part of the commentary is that Jews will always be Jews, and that the 'civilised European' Jew is only a guise for a new and more dangerous forms of parasitic exploitation.&lt;ref name="I. B. Trauris"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jews as manipulative===

====Changing outward appearances====
The film also claims that the Jewish people ... 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...change their outward appearances when they leave their Polish nests and go out into the rich world. [...] When he appears without them, then it is only the keen-eyed amongst us who recognise his racial origins. [...] It is true that their fathers and grandfathers still lived in ghettoes, but there is no trace left now in their external appearance. Here in the second and third generation, the Aryanisation has reached its [[zenith]]. [...] And people lacking in [[Intuition (mind)|intuition]] allow themselves to be deceived by this mimicry and regard them as being in truth their equals. Therein lies the dreadful danger, for even these 'civilised' Jews remain foreign bodies in the organism of their hosts, no matter how much their outward appearance may correspond to that of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Richard|title=Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany|date=15 October 1998|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=9781860641671|pages=179-179|edition=rev. illus. repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Economic impact====
{{see also|Economic antisemitism}}

The film claims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jews sit at the junction of the world financial markets.  They are an international power.  Only one percent of the world's population, with the help of their capital they terrorize the world stock exchanges, world opinion, and world politics."&lt;ref name="Gilreath2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilreath|first=Shannon |title=The End of Straight Supremacy: Realizing Gay Liberation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0LaGybtIzwC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=31 October 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18104-4|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movie blamed Jews for inflation and unemployment in Germany. It charged that they had crept into all professions through [[usury]], racketeering and crimes against German assets.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Out of a thousand workers in Berlin, only two were Jews. For the start of 1933, out of one hundred prosecutors in Berlin 15 were Jews.  Out of a hundred judges were 23 Jews. Out of a hundred lawyers 49 Jews. 52 Jews out of a hundred doctors. And out of every hundred of businessmen 60 Jews. The average wealth of Germans was 810 marks each. The average wealth of each Jew amounted to 10,000 marks."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The evidence for these assertions is unstated in the film. The occupational information is found in Germany's June 1933 census, which proves the claims made in the movie to be greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Michael|title=JEWISH CULTURE IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICA AND WEIMAR GERMANY: PARALLELS AND DIFFERENCES|url=http://web.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/pdf/02_brenner.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANTI-JEWISH LEGISLATION IN PREWAR GERMANY|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005681|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hubert Rübsaat 1938"&gt;Margarete Limberg and Hubert Rübsaat, eds., Germans No More: Accounts of Jewish Everyday Life, 1933-1938, trans.

In 1933, 5,600 Jewish doctors and 3,030 Jewish lawyers were practicing in Germany, corresponding to 11 percent of doctors and 16 percent of lawyers.&lt;ref name=academia.edu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt|first1=Sarah|title=Changing Relations between Jews and non-Jews in Interwar Germany|url=https://www.academia.edu/2083415/Changing_Relations_between_Jews_and_non-Jews_in_Interwar_Germany|website=academia.edu|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, an exceptionally large number of successful lawsuits over equal citizenship and rights had been filed in the [[Weimar Republic]], most of them by Jewish lawyers.&lt;ref name="Hubert Rübsaat 1938"/&gt; The Nuremberg Laws specifically forbade German judges from citing any precedents by Jewish jurists and cut off Jewish doctors from reimbursement under public health care insurance.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

In contrast, during the economic crisis between the end of World War I and the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were disproportionately likely to be laid off from the labor market, to the point that 1 out of every 4 Jews had been laid off by 1935.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; The original set of layoffs also had the effect of concentrating Jewish employment during this period into the professional and self-employed sectors, while post-1933 delicensing and other Nuremberg legislation gradually pushed Jews completely out of professional occupations and into positions such as street peddlers.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

The reference to average wealth probably used the wealth of the Jewish [[Rothschild family]] as the basis for its calculation. The Rothschild banking family is still believed to have had the largest private fortune in the world during the 19th century, as well as the largest fortune in [[modern world]] history.&lt;ref name="Rothschild 1999, page 481-85"&gt;''The House of Rothschild: Money's prophets, 1798–1848'', Volume 1, Niall Ferguson, 1999, page 481-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article56239.ece |title=The Independent, UK: The Rothschild story: A golden era ends for a secretive dynasty |accessdate=2017-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115031554/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article56239.ece |archivedate=15 January 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jazz Baroness 2009"&gt;''The Secret Life of the Jazz Baroness'', from The Times 11 April 2009, Rosie Boycott&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Creditanstalt]] debts were assumed in part by the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family, its bankruptcy was later used by Hitler as an example of how the Jews were responsible for all the economic and social troubles of Germany and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trumbore|first1=Brian|title=The Collapse of Creditanstalt Bank in 1931|url=http://www.buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2012/collapse.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318080458/http://www.buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2012/collapse.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 March 2014|publisher=Freedom Investments, Inc|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie goes on to assert that: "The most common expressions in the jargon of international gangsters and criminals stem from [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]] words." According to the movie, Jews are likewise disproportionately plentiful in organized crime, where they represent 82% of international crime organizations, and 98% of international prostitution. This Jewish influence is seen as well in the international language used by criminals (see also ''[[Rotwelsch]]''). The evidence for these blatant assertions is nowhere produced. Insofar as "organized crime" represents lawbreaking other than that forced by the Nuremberg Laws, it has not been corroborated by subsequent research.

The film also claims that the Jewish people have some kind of "genetic predisposition towards [[barter]] and [[haggling]]", saying that "[Jewish people] rush into trade" because it is fitting "with their character and inclination", and that "For the Jew, there is but one object of value – money. How he earns it is a matter of complete indifference to him." It also accuses Jews of passing corruption on to their children by religious means, saying that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These children see no ideals before them like our own. The egoism of the individual is not used in the service of higher common goals. On the contrary, Jewish racial morality claims, in contrast to ''Aryan'' morality, that the unrestrained egoism of each Jew is a divine law. His religion makes a duty out of treachery and usury.&lt;ref name="I. B. Trauris"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richard |first1=Taylor |title=Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany |date=15 October 1998 |publisher=I. B.

===Jews as abnormal and depraved===

In a long sequence of images, the film provides examples to illustrate its claims that Aryan/European culture had been corrupted by Jews.&lt;ref name="HaggithNewman2005_90"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haggith|first1=Toby|last2=Newman|first2=Joanna |title=Holocaust and the moving image: representations in film and television since 1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hetrpvcBuuEC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=16 November 2011|date=1 August 2005|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-904764-51-9|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This sequence includes footage of notable figures who had earned [[Adolf Hitler]]'s wrath, such as physicist and Nobel laureate [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Spartacist uprising]] leader [[Rosa Luxemburg]] (erroneously named as one and the same person as anarchist [[Emma Goldman]]) as representatives of so-called "[[international Jewry]]". Einstein's image was juxtaposed with a series of images about the supposed Jewish control of the pornography industry. Einstein was characterized as "the relativity Jew, who masks his hatred of Germany behind his obscure pseudo-sciences".
Other film clips presented Jewish (or supposedly Jewish) actors from the Weimar era such as [[Curt Bois]], [[Fritz Kortner]], [[Peter Lorre]], and [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. [[Charles Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin]] was also included in this sequence and inaccurately identified as Jewish, possibly as a consequence of his role as the Jewish barber in ''[[The Great Dictator]]''.&lt;ref name="DesserFriedman2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desser|first1=David|last2=Friedman|first2=Lester D. |title=American Jewish Filmmakers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4Aqh7u9qCQC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=5 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07153-9|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacoby2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Russell |title=Bloodlust: On the Roots of Violence from Cain and Abel to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EA7Va7XHiSEC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=5 April 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0024-0|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film includes two scenes from the Hollywood film ''[[The House of Rothschild]]'' (1934). The first clip shows Mayer Rothschild, a rich man, hiding money and putting on old, shabby clothes in order to fool a corrupt tax collector.&lt;ref name="Barnouw1993" /&gt; And the second shows him speaking to his sons, encouraging them to start an international banking business to take advantage of nations' misfortunes in times of war. The clips were used without permission.

The film's narrator asserts that: "the Jew is instinctively interested in everything abnormal and depraved." To illustrate this point, Hippler included a scene from [[Fritz Lang]]'s film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' in which the child murderer Beckert (played by Peter Lorre) makes an impassioned plea to the "jury" of criminals, begging for his life and disclaiming responsibility for his crimes on account of insanity.  Beckert shrieks, "... it burns within me. I must go the way I am driven. Who knows what is going on inside me? How I must - not want, must!"&lt;ref name="Barnouw1993_142"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik |title=Documentary: a history of the non-fiction film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtZ91DNvgBMC&amp;pg=PA142|accessdate=15 November 2011|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507898-5|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sharon Packer, Hitler used this scene to assert that "Jews transmit inheritable criminality and therefore deserve to die."&lt;ref name="Packer2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Packer|first=Sharon |title=Movies and the modern psyche|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX4goUP_yh0C&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=September 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99359-7|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerate art===
The film proceeds to suggest that pictorial art and music have degenerated under Jewish influence, with many spurious examples given. [[Degenerate art]] included works of [[abstract art]] as well as those from specific individuals such as [[George Grosz]] and [[Emil Nolde]], while [[degenerate music]] included [[jazz]] and so-called ''[[Negermusik]]'', although here the connection to Jewry is absent.

===Jewish religious practice===
After showing how Jews have supposedly been responsible for the decline of Western music, science, art, and commerce, the film presents a scene of a cow being slaughtered for meat by a ''[[Shechita|shochet]]'' (Jewish ritual slaughterer). The scene is prefaced by a warning similar to the one in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', warning the squeamish about what is coming next. This long sequence, lasting several minutes, shows cows and sheep in their death throes as they bleed to death. The producers apparently filmed this scene because of Hitler's opposition to [[cruelty to animals]]. He had banned [[Kosher foods|kosher]] slaughter of animals in Germany and felt that such footage would shock the German public.

This scene was cut from the version intended for young audiences.
&lt;blockquote&gt; "These images are a clear proof of the cruelty of ''Schächtmethode''. They also reveal the character of a race, their blunt brutality hidden under the guise of religious worship. "&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hitler's Reichstag speech===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E11354, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hitler giving a speech to the Reichstag at the [[Kroll Opera House|''Krolloper'']]]]
The film concludes with footage of Hitler's speech in the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] in which he proclaims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war,  the result will not be Bolshevization of the earth and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/ |title=Papers on 'The Eternal Jew' by Stig Hornshoj-Moller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702072155/http://www.holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/ |archivedate=2 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film ends with images of SA troops on parade.

==Release and reception==
In and of itself, the movie did not have much impact on the German public.  The film suffered from being released after [[Jud Süß (1940 film)|''Jud Süß'']], which had been wildly popular, perhaps because the antisemitic message was secondary to an engaging period drama.  The actors in ''Jud Süß'' were leading German actors of the time.  In contrast, ''Der ewige Jude''{{'s}} only original footage was of Jews in the Polish ghetto and animated maps.  All the other footage consisted of stills and archive film clips.

Thus, unlike ''[[Jud Süß (1940 film)|Jud Süß]]'', which was a box-office smash success, ''Der ewige Jude'' was a commercial flop.  David Culbert asserts that it is unlikely that there were more than one million paid admissions compared to over 20 million paid admissions to ''Jud Süß''.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002_151"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etlin|first=Richard A. |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQXoZ3oZ3-cC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=15 October 2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22087-1|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was more known by word-of-mouth descriptions than from people actually viewing it.  Some Germans were quoted as saying "We've already seen enough Jewish filth.  We don't need to see any more."&lt;ref name="JowettJowettODonnell2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowett|first1=Garth S. |last2=Jowett|first2=Garth |last3=O'Donnell|first3=Victoria |title=Propaganda and persuasion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIC92PdJ0l0C&amp;pg=PA234|accessdate=1 December 2011|year=2006|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-0898-6|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was chiefly screened by party supporters and Nazi organizations like the [[Hitler Youth]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Its themes and content made it a topic of discussion by a wider audience that never saw it. Himmler invited to screen it SS troops headed for the Eastern Front to carry out the "[[Final Solution]]".

==Postwar legacy==
In 1946, Fritz Hippler was tried for directing ''Der ewige Jude'' but was not found guilty.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002_152"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etlin|first=Richard A. |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQXoZ3oZ3-cC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=15 October 2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22087-1|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippler contended Joseph Goebbels was the true creator of ''The Eternal Jew'' with Hitler's close supervision. He claimed that Goebbels gave Hippler credit as a reward "for his excellent work in the newsreel department".&lt;ref&gt;Winkel, Roel. Nazi German's Fritz Hippler, 1909- 2002. Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television. Carfax Publishing. Vol 23, No 2, 2003. 91–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Hippler was interviewed in the [[Emmy Award]]-winning program "The Propaganda Battle" in the [[PBS]] series ''Walk Through the Twentieth Century'' (1983–1984). In this interview he stated that he regretted being listed as the director of ''The Eternal Jew'' because it resulted in being interrogated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after the war. He thought this was unfair because, in his opinion, he had nothing to do with the killing of Jews. In an interview shown in the German documentary series ''Holocaust'' (2000), the 90-year-old Hippler described the film as "the most disgraceful example of antisemitism." The film's narrator, [[Harry Giese]], went on to narrate other films, but he was associated with this film and other films by the Third Reich and he found less work in the Postwar German cinema of the 1950s and 60s.

==Availability==
The public distribution and exhibition of the film is prohibited in Germany. The only exception is for use in college classrooms and other academic purposes; however, exhibitors must have formal education in "media science and the history of the [[Holocaust]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/millersville-19980427.shtml |title=The Eternal Jew - a Blueprint for Genocide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708111625/http://www.holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/millersville-19980427.shtml |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it can only be screened in a censored version with annotations.

The '''Vari Cave''', also known as the '''Nympholyptos Cave''' ({{lang-el|Σπήλαιο Νυμφολήπτου Βάρης}}), is a small cave northeast of [[Vari]] in [[Attica]], [[Greece]]. In [[classical antiquity]] the cave was used as a shrine dedicated to [[Apollo]], [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the [[Nymph]]s. The cave was occupied from the sixth to second century BC. The cave then fell into disuse until it was occupied again in the fourth century AD. It was finally abandoned in approximately the sixth century. The cave was excavated in 1901.

It lies near the top of one of the southern spurs of Mount [[Hymettus]] at an altitude of almost 300&amp;nbsp;meters. From Vari, it can be reached on foot in one hour.&lt;ref name=well /&gt; The cave is unique in Greece because of its [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] sculptures. The marble [[votive tablet]]s from the cave are now exhibited at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]].

Because of its use for the veneration of Pan the cave is also called the '''Cave of Pan'''. It was one of the five caves of Pan in the vicinity of ancient [[Athens]].

==History==
According to inscriptions found in the cave, the sanctuary was built by Archedemus of [[Santorini|Thera]]. He identified himself as a [[nympholepsy|nympholept]] and states that he built the sanctuary "at the Nymph's counsel". Archedemus has a [[cross]] on his right shoulder that has as yet found no explanation. &lt;ref name=well /&gt;

Unlike many other caves, prehistoric remains were not found. The earliest inscription found in the cave was dated to approximately the beginning of the sixth century BC. A [[relief]] depicting Archedemus is dated to approximately 400&amp;nbsp;BC, most likely during the apex of the sanctuary's popularity. A second-century coin from Athens found in the cave provides evidence that it was continuously occupied from about 600&amp;nbsp;BC to 150&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

For the next four or five centuries the cave apparently fell into disuse because material dated to this period was not found. Coins found in the cave suggest that a new period of occupation began in the time of the [[Roman Empire]], approximately during the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] (307–337&amp;nbsp;AD). Based on the number of coins found, the sanctuary became even more popular during the reign of his successor, [[Constantius II]] (337–361&amp;nbsp;AD). Coins indicate the sanctuary was still visited during the time of [[Arcadius]] (395–408&amp;nbsp;AD). Because no remains of later dates were found the cave was abandoned after this time. The absence of remains of offerings with significant value means the cave had probably always been a sanctuary for poor people.&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

A large number of [[Ancient Roman pottery#Lamps|Roman oil lamps]] with Christian designs were found in the cave. The excavators dated these to the same period as the coins, the fourth and early fifth century. Many remains of the first period of occupation, especially the reliefs, were found destroyed. The oil lamps and deliberate destruction of pagan sculptures led the excavators to the conclusion that the cave became a Christian shrine in the second period of occupation.&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

The site is not mentioned by any ancient writer. However, there is inconclusive evidence that [[Claudius Aelianus]] and [[Olympiodorus the Younger]] describe the cave. They write that the infant Plato was taken to a spot on Mount Hymettus by his parents [[Ariston of Athens|Ariston]] and [[Perictione]]. His parents performed sacrifices on his behalf to Pan, Apollo, the [[Muse]]s and the Nymphs. Even though the reliability of both late authors is questionable, the list of deities is nearly identical with those known to be honored in the cave.&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

More recent research disputes the interpretation of the cave as a Christian site. According to the latest evidence there were no Attic oil lamps with Christian designs until the fifth century. The small number of more sophisticated Christian oil lamps probably date to the sixth century. More importantly, the presence of Christian oil lamps does not imply the site was Christian. Elsewhere in the Roman Empire [[Paganism|pagans]] used Christian oil lamps when non-Christian ones were not available. A remote cave like the one near Vari would have made a suitable location for continuing pagan religious practice in secret after the Empire started [[Persecution of pagans by the Christian Roman Empire|persecuting pagans]]. If Christians smashed the sculptures, it most likely happened at the end of the reoccupation rather than its beginning. Instead, it was possible that the pagan [[Platonism|Platonists]] of late Roman Athens would have frequented the site due to its association with Plato.&lt;ref name=fowd /&gt;

==Layout==
The opening of the cave descends vertically. From the opening approximately a dozen steps are cut in the ridge at the western end, which are now broken. After these steps comes a landing from which the two rooms of the cave are visible, separated by a large rock partition.&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

From the landing another set of ancient stairs take the visitor to a position at the upper side of the larger room. The largest shrine of the cave is found here. The shrine is dedicated to Pan and looks a like a rough imitation of the facade of a temple. A headless seated figure and an object with a shape resembling an [[omphalos]] are hewn from the rock in this room, but they are too damaged to be identified.&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

After descending more steps a rock-cut shrine to Apollo Hersus is found towards the bottom of the cave. Next to this shrine is the rock-cut image of Archemus who is crudely depicted as a stonecutter with his tools.&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

==Excavations==
[[Richard Chandler]] was the first scientist to visit and report on the cave in 1765.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt; Through the 19th century the cave was visited by more scholars, but it was not until 1901 that it was excavated. The excavation was led by Charles Heald Weller of the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]].&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

'''World Book Day'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.worldbookday.com/about/| title = What is World Book Day?|publisher =Worldbookday.com| accessdate = 16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''World Book and Copyright Day''' (also known as '''International Day of the Book''' or '''World Book Days''') is a yearly event on April 23rd, organized by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), to promote [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[publishing]] and [[copyright]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], the day is recognized on the first Thursday in March. World Book Day was celebrated for the first time on 23 April 1995.

==Date selection==
The original idea was of the Valencian writer Vicente Clavel Andrés as a way to honour the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], first on 7 October, his birth date, then on 23 April, his death date. In 1995 UNESCO decided that the World Book and Copyright Day would be celebrated on 23 April, as the date is also the anniversary of the death of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], as well as that of the birth or death of several other prominent authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/bookday/ |title=World Book and Copyright Day, 23 April |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In a historical coincidence, Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same ''date'' — 23 April 1616 — but not on the same ''day'', as at the time, Spain used the [[Gregorian calendar]] and England used the [[Julian calendar]]; Shakespeare actually died 10 days after Cervantes died, on 3 May of the Gregorian calendar.)

==World Book Day by country==

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Book Day is 23 April, the anniversary of Cervantes death, ''[[Don Quixote]]'' is read during a two-day "readathon" and the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] is presented by the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish king]] in [[Alcalá de Henares]]. 

In Catalonia, Spain, [[St. George's Day]] has been 'The Day of the Rose' since 1436, and involves the exchange of gifts between loved ones and respected people—it is analogous to [[Valentine's Day]].  Although World Book and Copyright Day has been celebrated since 1995 internationally, books were exchanged on 'The Day of the Rose' in Catalonia since 1929, in memory of Cervantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Sant Jordi et le jour du livre |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall2&amp;contentid=a503ef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |work=Generalitat de Catalunya |date=20 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220195057/http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall2&amp;contentid=a503ef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |archive-date=20 December 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
