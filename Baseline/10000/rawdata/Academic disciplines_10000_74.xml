'''Advanced Placement [[Chemistry]]''' ('''AP Chemistry''' or '''AP Chem''') is a course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] as a part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]] to give [[United States|American]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] high school students the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities and earn [[college]]-level credit. AP Chemistry has the distinction of having the lowest known test participation rate, with 49.5% of AP Chemistry students taking the exam in one study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=Research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement program: Taking stock and looking forward |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F2158244016682996 |journal=SAGE Open|date=2017|volume=7|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.1177/2158244016682996|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, smaller study found that 52.7% of students enrolled in AP Chemistry took their course's AP test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadler|first1=Philip M.|last2=Sonnert|first2=Gerhard|last3=Hazari|first3=Zahra|last4=Tai|first4=Robert|title=The role of Advanced high school coursework in increasing STEM career interest|journal=Science Educator|volume=23|issue=1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The course==
AP Chemistry is a course geared toward students with interests in chemical and [[physical science]]s, as well as any of the biological sciences. The course aims to prepare students to take the AP Chemistry exam toward the end of the academic year. AP Chemistry topics include [[atomic theory]], [[chemical bonding]], [[phases of matter]], [[solution (chemistry)|solutions]], [[chemical reactions|types of reactions]], [[chemical equilibrium]], [[reaction kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], and [[thermodynamics]].

==Prerequisites==
The College Board recommends successful completion of High School Chemistry and [[Algebra II]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_chem.html AP Chemistry at collegeboard.com]&lt;/ref&gt; however, requirement of this may differ from school to school. AP Chemistry usually requires knowledge of [[Algebra II]]; however, some schools allow students to take Algebra II concurrently with this class. The requirement of regular or honors level High School Chemistry may also be waived, but usually requires completion of a special assignment or exam.

==The exam==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}

The annual AP Chemistry examination, which is typically administered in May, is divided into two major sections (multiple-choice questions and free response essays).

=== Old test (2013 and earlier) ===

The old test was composed of two sections: a multiple-choice section consisting of 75 questions with five answer choices each, and a free-response section consisting of six essay prompts that required the authoring of chemical equations, solution of problems, and development of thoughtful essays in response to [[hypothetical]] scenarios.

* '''Section I''', the multiple-choice portion, did ''not'' allow the use of a [[calculator]], nor did it provide any additional reference material, other than a periodic table. Each question contained five answer choices. 90 minutes were allotted for the completion of Section I. Section I covered the breadth of the curriculum.
* '''Section II''', the free response section, was divided into two sections: Part A, requiring the completion of three problems, and Part B, also containing three problems.  Part A, lasting 55 minutes, allowed the use of calculators, while Part B, lasting 40 minutes, did not. The first problem in Part A concerned equilibrium related to solubility, [[acids]] and [[base (chemistry)|bases]], or pressure/concentration.  The first question of Part B was a chemical equation question in which 3 scenarios were presented and the student was required to work all 3 scenarios, authoring a balanced net ionic chemical equation for each scenario and answering questions about the equations and scenarios. If time permitted, students may have edited their responses from Part A during the time allotted for responding to Part B, though without the use of a calculator. The student needed to have completed all six questions.

While the use of calculators was prohibited during Section I and Section II Part B, a periodic table, a list of selected standard reduction potentials, and two pages of equations and conventions are available for use during the entirety of Section II.

=== New test (2014 and later) ===
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}

The 2014 AP Chemistry exam was the first administration of a redesigned test as a result of a redesigning of the AP Chemistry course.  The exam format is now different from the previous years, with 60 multiple choice questions (now with only four answer choices per question), 3 long free response questions, and 4 short free response questions. The new exam has a focus on longer, more in depth, lab-based questions. The penalty for incorrect answers on the multiple choice section was also removed.  More detailed information can be found at the related link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exam Content|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/exam/exam_information/1998.html|work=The AP Chemistry Exam|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Guideline|guidelines]] are ascertained for one, short exposure (with a maximum of eight hours) by the air. The AEGL consist of different levels of [[toxicology|toxicological]] effects. It subjects the 4 Ds: [[detection]], [[discomfort]], [[disability]] and [[death]]. The AEGL values gives the expected effects of exposure to certain [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. So the compound can provide from detection to discomfort, from discomfort to disability and from disability to death. There are three levels of AEGL-values: AEGL-1, AEGL-2 and AEGL-3. The values of AEGL are determined for varying times of exposure, such as ten minutes, thirty minutes, one hour, four hours and eight hours.
AEGLs are mainly used in case of [[calamities]] to estimate the exposure to certain compounds.

The '''Al-Yahudu tablets''' are a collection of about 200 clay tablets from the sixth and fifth centuries BCE on the exiled [[Judaism|Judean]] community in [[Babylonia]] following the destruction of the [[First Temple]].&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasson|first1=Nir|title=Ancient Tablets Disclose Jewish Exiles’ Life in Babylonia|url=https://archive.is/4ptde|website=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ben-Zion|first1=Ilan|title=‘By the rivers of Babylon’ exhibit breathes life into Judean exile|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/by-the-rivers-of-babylon-exhibit-breathes-life-into-judean-exile/|website=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Luke|title=Ancient tablets reveal life of Jews in Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-archaeology-babylon/ancient-tablets-reveal-life-of-jews-in-nebuchadnezzars-babylon-idUSKBN0L71EK20150203|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain information on the physical condition of the exiles from Israel and their financial condition in [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name="PLC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearce|first1=Laurie|last2=Wunsch|first2=Cornelia|title=Documents of Judean Exiles and West Semites in Babylonia in the Collection of David Sofer|date=2014|publisher=Cornell University Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULl9oAEACAAJ|isbn=9781934309575}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets are named after the central settlement mentioned in the documents, '''al-Yahudu''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: The city of Judah).

The earliest document in the collection dates back to 572 BCE, about 15 years after the destruction of the Temple, during the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vukosavović|first1=Filip|title=By the Rivers of Babylon: The Story of the Babylonian Exile|date=2015|publisher=Bible Lands Museum|isbn=978-9657027271|ref=FV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent tablet dates back to 477 BCE, during the reign of [[Xerxes I]], about 60 years after the [[Return to Zion]] began and about 20 years before the rise of [[Ezra the Scribe]].

==Discovery and research==
The public records do not contain information on the location and date of the discovery of the documents in [[Iraq]], and it seems that they were not found in an archaeological excavation. The first time the public was exposed to the documents and the settlement of al-Yahudu was in an article by two French researchers in 1999, which dealt with three legal documents of Jews in Babylon, including the city of al-Yahudu itself. These three certificates were part of a small collection of six documents in the possession of [[Israelis|Israeli]] antiquities collector [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]].

At the beginning of the 21st century, it turned out that this was not a small collection, but a collection of more than 200 documents, most of which were in two other private collections. Some of the documents were presented in 2004 at [[Beth Hatefutsoth]] in [[Tel Aviv]] and were investigated in part by Kathleen Abraham of [[Bar-Ilan University]]. Since then, the entire collection has been investigated mainly by two researchers - Cornelia Wunsch of Germany and Laurie Pearce of the United States. After a series of papers on documentary issues, Wensh and Pierce published in early 2015 the first full translations and analysis of the collection in the author's book.&lt;ref name="PLC" /&gt;

==Geography==
Although no information was given on the circumstances of the discovery of the documents, the plan provides clues as to the location of the communities mentioned in the Jewish exiles. The assessment is based on two main components:

* The mention of familiar sites, such as cities that have been excavated and researched, or concepts that have been evaluated for their location.
* Cross-referencing the names of the few writers mentioned in the documents vis-à-vis the communities mentioned in them and the date of writing the documents. In some cases, this cross-cross has made it possible to estimate the distance between a recognized locality and an unrecognized locality.

Based off this, researchers estimate that al-Yahudu and the other communities mentioned in the documents are located in the area southeast of the city of [[Nippur]].&lt;ref name="PLC" /&gt;

===The localities mentioned in the documents===
Beyond the settlement of al-Yahudu, other settlements were mentioned where Jews were living or working. Some of them are well-known cities and some were apparently satellite settlements of al-Yahudu. The main localities mentioned in the documents are:

* '''Al-Yahudu''': The dominant settlement in the documents. The most ancient document in the collection, dated 572 BCE, is called Al-Yahudiyya ("City of the Jews").
* '''Beit Nashar''': Apparently not far from al-Yahudu. A mixed community, where Jews also lived. The ruler of the settlement, which appears in many of the documents, was Ahikar ben Riemot, who was probably Jewish in origin.
* '''House of Aviram''': Possibly named after [[Abraham]]. Although this locality is located in connection with al-Yahudu, there were no Jews with Jewish names and it is unclear whether Jews lived there. The most famous figure in this locality is Zbava Sher-Ozer, an heir to the Babylonian throne.
* The village of '''Ubu Sha Tubiyama''': Possibly named after the village's founder, Tuviyahu ben Mukhaiahu.
* '''Al-Hazatu''': A community of [[Gaza City|Gazan]] exiles.

The collection also contains documents from the cities of [[Babylon]], [[Nippur]], [[Borsippa]], and even a document signed on the banks of the [[Kebar River]], known in the bible as the site of the Exile and known from the Babylonian records as an irrigation canal which was also used as a transportation channel for commerce and movement of people. The collection contained no references to other biblical-known cities in which the Babylonian exiles resided.&lt;ref name="PLC" /&gt;

==Life of Jews in Babylon as reflected in the documents==
The al-Yahudu tablets cover a period of 100 years under Babylonian rule, especially Persian. In general, the documents show a similarity between the life of the Jews and other exiles in the kingdom at the time. In principle, it can be said that the documents attest to the tension between the preservation of Jewish identity, language, culture and religion and the need, and sometimes the will, to integrate into life in Babylon. In this respect, life in Babylon corresponds to the instruction of the prophet Jeremiah in a letter he sent from Judah to the Babylonian exiles following the exile of [[Jeconiah]] in 577 BCE.

===Status of Exiles===
According to the documents, the Jews were defined as "Shushanu." This status is also known from other documents from the period and relates to foreign exiles who were exiled to Babylon, mainly in order to rehabilitate cities and areas devastated by past wars. These exiles received land lease for their livelihood in the form of service in exchange for land. Although they can be compared to the status of land-bound tenants, they seem to have enjoyed freedom of movement, they were defined as independent entities before the Babylonian and Persian law and enjoyed the possibilities of social and economic integration.

===Service for the Kingdom===
The type of service required of the exiles is mentioned in the documents, both in the context of the designation of the leasehold lands and directly in the jobs that the exiles were required to perform as part of the payment of taxes. Based on other documents dealing with payment of tax and service to the kingdom after their settlement, it seems that other exiles were employed in physical labor. These included construction work, excavation and maintenance of irrigation channels. It is possible that among these were many of the "plow and locksmith," mentioned in connection with the exile of [[Jeconiah]] in 597 BCE. The nature of the service described also appears to indicate a restriction imposed on them in their movement, and to a certain extent may have been in this period a status similar to that of a slave. This period maybe reflected in the famous lines from [[Psalms]] 137 on the exile.

Most of the Jews on the certificates made their living from agriculture. Most of the land they leased grew [[Date palm|dates]] and [[barley]], but [[wheat]], [[spices]] and [[linen]] were also mentioned in the documents. Analysis of the money amounts in the transactions appearing in the certificates shows that they had a low economic status relative to the kingdom. A comparison of the economic agreements from other collections in Babylon indicates the integration of the Jews into the economic life of Babylon, and it seems that they operated on the daily economic level, like other Babylonians, and not necessarily according to the [[Halakha|laws of the Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lubetski|first1=Meir|title=New Seals and Inscriptions, Hebrew, Idumean, and Cuneiform|date=2007|publisher=Sheffield Phoenix Press|isbn=978-1905048359|pages=206–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and Economic Integration===
Among the exiles, there are documents of a number of Jews of strong economic standing. Some (such as Raphaiah Ben Smachiho and his son) acted as intermediaries and credit providers to the Jewish population and managed to accumulate substantial capital. These intermediaries provided pure silver coins to concentrate tax payments of various Jews and provided farmers with means of production, such as plowing animals and grain.

===Jewish lifestyle and attitude toward Zion===
Due to the nature of the documents, this subject appears only implicitly. The preservation of Jewish identity can be seen in the sequence of names given to family members for at least four generations, the fact that no documents were found on Jewish holidays, and that dates were not signed on Shabbat.

The documents do not show signs of people leaving for Judea, but at least two Jews have been found who had a desire to return to Zion:
* A man named '''Siddur''', apparently given his name in the hope of returning to the Holy Land.
* A man named '''Yaeli''', who points to his parents' desire that he immigrate to Israel. This refers to the concept of "Yael," which is contained in the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] of 538 BCE, and refers to the immigration of exiles to Israel.

'''Analytical feminism''' is  a line of philosophy that applies analytic concepts and methods to feminist issues and applies feminist concepts and insights to issues that have traditionally been of interest to analytic philosophers. Like all [[Feminism|feminists]], analytical feminists insist on recognizing and contesting [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |title=One Woman's Attempt at a Definition |author=Ann E. Cudd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324073853/http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |archivedate=2012-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term “analytical feminism” dates back to the early 1990s when the Society for Analytical Feminism was opened in at the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/analyticalfeminism/|title= Society for Analytical Feminism |author= Norco College - Riverside Community College District}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as an opportunity to discuss and examine issues concerning analytical feminism, in part to contrast the more prevalent influences of [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]], and also to demonstrate that analytic philosophy is neither inherently or  irredeemably male-biased. Analytic feminists have attempted to rehabilitate certain key concepts, such as truth, reason, objectivity, agency and autonomy, both because they are normatively compelling as well as in some ways liberating and empowering for women. Not limited to these concepts, analytical feminism has contributed to the historical arena of analytic philosophy such as the philosophy of language, [[epistemology]], [[metaphysic]]s and the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/56/xhtml/chapter01.html#chapter01sec04|title=History of Analytical Feminism|author=Monash University Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the American philosophical magazine ''[[Hypatia]]'' published a special issue&lt;ref name="Hy 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hypatia-Special Issue: Analytic Feminism-August 1995|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|issue=3|doi=10.1111/hypa.1995.10.issue-3|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifying the meaning of analytic feminism in the mainstream Anglo-American analytical context and in the range of [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophical positions]]. In this issue, the authors such as [[Ann Cudd]] of the [[University of Kansas]], [[Ann Garry]] of [[California State University Los Angeles]], and Lynn Hankinson Nelson of the [[University of Washington]] proposed that analytic feminism typically was unrecognized and  somewhat depreciated by not only analytical philosophers but academic  feminist agenda as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm|title=THE NATURALISM QUESTION. HOW TO RE-THINK THE ANALYTIC – CONTINENTAL DICOTHOMY FROM A FEMINIST EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE|author=Alessandra Allegrini|access-date=2011-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928142832/http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm#|archive-date=2011-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered a sub-category of both analytic philosophy, and feminism, analytic feminism acknowledge the philosophical traditions of both fields while simultaneously addressing prominent issues within said fields.

==Philosophical approach==
Analytical feminism, as defined by Ann E. Cudd: "Analytic feminism holds that the best way to counter  [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]] is through forming a clear conception of and pursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality, justice, and the good while recognising that these notions have often been perverted by androcentrism throughout the history of philosophy." (1996: 20) Analytic feminists engage the literature traditionally thought of as analytic philosophy, but also draw on other traditions in philosophy as well as work by feminists working in other disciplines, especially [[sociology]] and [[biology]]. They, like most [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]], value clarity and precision in argument and tend to use more rigorously structured logical and linguistic analysis in reaching their conclusions and positions as compared to other philosophical approaches.

The majority of philosophers, including feminist philosophers, have at least some formal training in analytic philosophy, with some possessing extensive education and experience regarding analyticity. There has been a conscious effort to use the word ‘analytical’, the reason being that within the field of philosophy there is sometimes an inclination to assume all feminist work as tied to other methods to philosophy, whereas upon review much of the work in feminism is closer in method to analytic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to most analytic feminists, the  best method for scholars to counter sexism and androcentrism in their respective areas of inquiry is by forming a clear conception of and practicing logical consistency and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bookrags.com/research/analytic-feminism-eoph/ |title= Analytic Feminism |author= bookrags }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrines===
Even though analytical feminists retain only some traditional concepts{{Clarify|date=February 2013}}, it is not doctrinaire—indeed, there is even a spirit of contrarianism within it. Nevertheless, analytic feminists share a thing that we may call a "core desire" rather than a core principle, that is to say, the need to hold on to enough of the essential normative notions of the modern European tradition to aid the kind of [[norm (social)|norm]]ativity which is necessary for both [[feminist political theory]] and philosophy. This "core desire"  finds its appearance by means of the core concepts of analytical feminism.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge building===
Analytic feminists' use of core ideas and their excerpt to the work of traditional analytic philosophers permit them to communicate with and build bridges amongst different types of scholars, for example, traditional analytic philosophers, other feminist philosophers, and, in some cases, scientists or scholars in social studies.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstructing philosophy===
One tenet of analytic feminism holds that if philosophers positions are applicable universally, they must be usable by men and women alike, and from a range of social situations. This is a basis for what can be considered the reconstruction of philosophy via analytic feminism. This approach, which somewhat mirrors the construction of feminist philosophy tradition, attempts to limit the creation of areas or categories of philosophy that apply to only some women and feminists. It's an attempt to apply to 'all' (men and women) instead of 'some' (women and/or feminists) with specific examples of topics being feminine ethics, gynocentric ethics, or lesbian ethics. The basis for this universal approach would be an analytic feminist ethics and metaphysics which would create and establish a new criterion of adequacy for the fields of ethics and metaphysics. The goal of Miranda Fricker and Jennifer Hornsby, editors of ''The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy'', is to have this position included in the mainstream of the discipline  (Fricker and Hornsby 2000).

Not basing the approach on any 'essential' characteristics, be they experiences or otherwise, it can maintain the importance of a variety of perspectives, while crafting a 'working' theory. 'Working' is defined as being particularly inclusive, of both men and women, but also simultaneously eliminating oppressive consequences. A wide range of experiences, interests, and background must be reflected with the theory 'working' only if it is applicable to all these issues and concerns.

There are a variety of approaches regarding the reconstruction of philosophy within analytic feminism. Some philosophers, such as Bailey (Bailey 2010) and Gary (Garry 2012), include the use of [[intersectionality]] in their approach. Miranda Fricker (2007) and Kristie Dotson (2011) make use of concept of [[Privilege (social inequality)]] in theirs, particularly with regard to epistemic ignorance and [[epistemic injustice]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}

'''Anthropology''' is the study of [[human]]s and [[human behavior]] and [[society|societies]] in the past and present.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web | title=anthropology | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology |work=Oxford Dictionaries | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology | title=anthropology | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Anthropology? | url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm | publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]] | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life. [[Biological anthropology|Biological or physical anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; studies the biological development of humans.

[[Archaeology]], which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.

==Origin and development of the term==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|History of anthropology}}
The abstract noun ''[[wikt:anthropology|anthropology]]'' is first attested in reference to [[history]].&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey]]'s 1593 ''Philadelphus'', a defense of the legend of [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] in [[History of Britain|British history]], includes the passage "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."}} Its present use first appeared in [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] in the works of [[Magnus Hundt]] and [[Otto Casmann]].&lt;ref name="Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|author=Israel Institute of the History of Medicine|title=Koroth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lev_H1Ie0zcC&amp;pg=PA19|publisher=BRILL|page=19|id=GGKEY:34XGYHLZ7XY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|anthropologia}}'' derived from the [[combining form]]s of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''ánthrōpos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἄνθρωπος}}}}, "[[human]]") and ''lógos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|λόγος}}}}, "[[science|study]]").&lt;ref name=oed2&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "anthropology, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of [[Aristotle]].)&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt; It began to be used in English, possibly via [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|Anthropologie}}'', by the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[John Kersey]]'s 1706 edition of ''[[The New World of English Words]]'' includes the definition "''Anthropology'', a Discourse or Description of Man, or of a Man's Body."}}

===Through the 19th century===
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the [[University of Copenhagen]], defined ''{{lang|fr|l'anthropologie}}'' as follows:&lt;ref name=frenchy&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartholin | first1=Caspar | last2=Bartholin | first2=Thomas | author-link1=Caspar Bartholin the Younger | author-link2=Thomas Bartholin | others=Translated from the Latin by Abr. Du Prat | year=1647 | title=Institutions anatomiques de Gaspar Bartholin, augmentées et enrichies pour la seconde fois tant des opinions et observations nouvelles des modernes | location=Paris | publisher=M. Hénault et J. Hénault | chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.{{refn|group=n|In French: ''L'Anthropologie, c'est à dire la science qui traite de l'homme, est divisée ordinairment &amp; avec raison en l'Anatomie, qui considere le corps &amp; les parties, et en la Psychologie, qui parle de l'Ame''.&lt;ref name=frenchy/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)]] by [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau]]. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Société Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use [[Ethnology]], was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Société was abandoned.

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=Schiller131&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections.

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[Ethnology]], making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[Société de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Société d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U. S. National Museum under the Auspices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington in March and April 1882 | year=1882 | location=Boston; Washington, D.C. | publisher=D. Lothrop &amp; Co.; Judd &amp; Detweiler | url={{Google books|9dEJAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As [[Robert Fletcher (anthropologist)|Fletcher]] points out, the French society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic. Previous organizations used other names. The German Anthropological Association of St. Petersburg, however, in fact met first in 1861, but due to the death of its founder never met again.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;}} When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to ''Transformisme'', as the French called [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broca, being what today would be called a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker'', 1859–1864. The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples". The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man". By nature he meant matter animated by "the Divine breath";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., he was an [[Animism|animist]]. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''Société'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | year=1899 | pages=382–390 | url={{Google books|PA385&amp;dq|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical Anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | accessdate=29 March 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) "What is Anthropology" Pluto. London. p. 79. {{ISBN|0745323200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from [[Boasian anthropology|Boas' arguments]] against 19th-century racial [[ideology]], through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for [[gender equality]] and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary [[research design]]s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E.

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[social anthropology]] tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|''biological'' or ''physical'' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|''social'']], [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|''sociocultural'' anthropology]]; and [[archaeology]]; plus [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]]. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''.

{{further|American anthropology}}

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural science]]s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social science]]s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology – American Anthropological Association].

According to [[Clifford Geertz]],
{{quotation|"anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor1=Daniel A. Segal |editor2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako |isbn=0822386844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sociocultural anthropology]] has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology|Sociocultural anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among individuals and groups.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=GENERAL INTRODUCTION | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold| year=1994 | pages=xv |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more related to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]] (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"/&gt; In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 |isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p18"&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates In Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]] | year=1996|  page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic [[monograph]]. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=H. Russell |year=2002 |url=http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |title=Research Methods in Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002847/http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |publisher=[[Altamira Press]] |page=322 |isbn=0759108684 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]], or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

===Biological===
{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|left|Forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900–1910.]]

Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[University of Toronto]] |title=Research Subfields: Physical or Biological |access-date=14 March 2012 |url=http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422203737/http://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}

[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine this material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remain of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R. H. &amp; Larkin, S. N. (2007). Cultural Anthropology: A problem based approach. Toronto, ON: Nelson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rosetta Stone.svg|thumb|The Rosetta Stone was an example of ancient communication.]]

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (not to be confused with [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|title=What is Anthropology? - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: sociocultural ==

===Art, media, music, dance and film===
{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]]
Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Lughod, Lila |year=1997|title=The Interpretation of Cultures after Television|journal=Representations|volume= 59|pages= 109–133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[Bronisław Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55–71|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=9780745644820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=0275978419|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "[[kinship|descent]]", "[[descent group]]s", "[[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]]", "[[affinity (law)|affines]]", "[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]", and even "[[fictive kinship]]". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialization. 

The first [[African-American]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[Caribbeanist]] is said to be [[Vera Mae Green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928-1982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633–635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D.

Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dave|date=2016-10-24|title=Anthropology's Contribution to Public Health Policy Development|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine : MJM|volume=13|issue=1|page=76|issn=1201-026X|pmc=3277334|pmid=22363184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
* the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==== Nutritional ====
{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"&gt;{{cite book | last=D'Andrade | first=R. | chapter=The Sad Story of Anthropology: 1950–1999 | editor-first=E.

M. White |display-editors=etal | date = 1992 | title = New Directions in Psychological Anthropology | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"/&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Young | first1=David E. | first2=J.G. | last2=Goulet | date=1994 | title=Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences | publisher=Peterborough: Broadview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=0801419719| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor1=Hent de Vries |editor2=Lawrence E. Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicanthropology.org Borofsky 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature, science and technology ===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001). "Cyborg Anthropology". in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415920922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]].  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer |author1=Weber, Gerhard |author2=Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological ====
{{main|Ecological anthropology}}
Ecological anthropology is defined as the "study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments".&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns "how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how their environment across space and time.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|page=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227632647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=G H|title=Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|page=523|year=1984|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243636746}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}} {{see also|Historical anthropology}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint |  journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 | jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|"It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.]&amp;nbsp;... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion."&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"/&gt;}} and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human [[community]] that worships it.&lt;ref name="Guthrie2000p225"&gt;Guthrie (2000) ''Guide to the Study of Religion''.

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition". Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the "[[Third World]]" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "[[Anthropology#Focus on the "other cultures"|specialists in 'other cultures']]" closer to their homes.&lt;ref name=Hannerz/&gt; There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1466138110370412 |jstor=24047982|title=Chinese consumers: The Romantic reappraisal|journal=Ethnography|volume=11|issue=3|page=331|year=2010|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.

== Key topics by field: archaeological and biological ==
{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
[[Anthrozoology]] (also known as "human–animal studies") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI, pp. 28–30. {{ISBN|0851997244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo (2010).

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L. Leatherman (eds.) |title=Building A New Biocultural Synthesis |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T8ZhpG_B_6MC |isbn= 978-0-472-06606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints.

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]. AAAnet.org. Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613021448/http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Wong, Kate (2007).

==Ethics==
As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics - Participate &amp; Advocate|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|publisher=American Anthropological Association|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = "pbuteh"&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:
* That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derives some of its key notions from it, consciously or not. (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) [http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion'']. London/New York: Routledge. pp. 26–29. {{ISBN|041508024X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That ethnographic work is often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were "out of time" in an "ethnographic present" (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').

=== Cultural relativism ===
As part of their quest for [[scientific objectivity]], present-day anthropologists typically urge [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt; This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude (1962). ''The Savage Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human.''.{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Is there a gene for racism? | Times Higher Education (THE)]. Times Higher Education (2016-10-27). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on "Race"|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.654 |pmid=9841421 |title=CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY:DNA Studies Challenge the Meaning of Race |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5389 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |last1=Marshall |first1=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Allan (1995).

Ortiz|url=https://www.academia.edu/199944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology]. CSMonitor.com (2007-09-07). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century |url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archivedate=21 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of "anthropology" within DoD."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ "AAA Commission Releases Final Report on Army Human Terrain System"].

==Post–World War II developments==
Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato (1993).  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. Inda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, John and Rosaldo, Renato (2007).  ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert; Kilgore, Lynn; Trevathan, Wenda and Ciochon, Russell L. (2007).  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology''. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. chapters I, III and IV. {{ISBN|0495187798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wompack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–20. {{ISBN|0136440711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald (1991).  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughley, Neil (2000).  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork."  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy (2003). ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12. {{ISBN|1442601108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George (1992) "Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology", pp. 342–361 in George Stocking, ''The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0299134148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray (1979). ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures—Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the "[[Third World]]" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hannerz&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz|Hannerz, Ulf]] (1980) ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', {{ISBN|0-231-08376-9}}, p. 1. ISBN Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' "100:" 716–731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody|Goody, Jack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-87069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field |journal = [[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. (2003) ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemical biology''' is a scientific discipline spanning the fields of [[chemistry]] and [[biology]]. The discipline involves the application of chemical techniques, analysis, and often [[small molecule]]s produced through [[chemical synthesis|synthetic chemistry]], to the study and manipulation of biological systems. In contrast to [[biochemistry]], which involves the study of the chemistry of biomolecules and regulation of biochemical pathways within and between cells, chemical biology deals with chemistry ''applied to'' biology.

==Introduction==
Some forms of chemical biology attempt to answer biological questions by directly probing living systems at the chemical level.  In contrast to research using [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], or [[molecular biology]], where [[mutagenesis]] can provide a new version of the organism, cell, or biomolecule of interest, chemical biology probes systems ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' with [[small molecule]]s that have been designed for a specific purpose or identified on the basis of biochemical or cell-based screening (see [[chemical genetics]]).

Chemical biology is one of several [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] sciences that tend to differ from older, [[reductionist]] fields and whose goals are to achieve a description of scientific [[holism]]. Chemical biology has scientific, historical and philosophical roots in [[medicinal chemistry]], [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[bioorganic chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[metabolic engineering]].

==Systems of interest==

===Proteomics===
{{main|Proteomics}}
[[Proteomics]] investigates the [[proteome]], the set of expressed proteins at a given time under defined conditions. As a discipline, proteomics has moved past rapid protein identification and has developed into a biological assay for quantitative analysis of complex protein samples by comparing protein changes in differently perturbed systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Cox Jü)), Mann M | title = Is Proteomics the New Genomics? | journal = Cell | volume = 130 | issue = 3 | pages = 395–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17693247 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current goals in proteomics include determining [[protein sequences]], abundance and any [[post-translational modifications]]. Also of interest are [[protein–protein interactions]], cellular distribution of proteins and understanding protein activity. Another important aspect of proteomics is the advancement of technology to achieve these goals.

Protein levels, modifications, locations, and interactions are complex and dynamic properties. With this complexity in mind, experiments need to be carefully designed to answer specific questions especially in the face of the massive amounts of data that are generated by these analyses. The most valuable information comes from proteins that are expressed differently in a system being studied. These proteins can be compared relative to each other using [[quantitative proteomics]], which allows a protein to be labeled with a mass tag. Proteomic technologies must be sensitive and robust; for these reasons, the [[mass spectrometer]] has been the workhorse of protein analysis. The high precision of mass spectrometry can distinguish between closely related species and species of interest can be isolated and fragmented within the instrument. Its applications to protein analysis was only possible in the late 1980s with the development of protein and peptide ionization with minimal fragmentation. These breakthroughs were [[Electrospray ionization|ESI]] and [[MALDI]]. Mass spectrometry technologies are modular and can be chosen or optimized to the system of interest.

Chemical biologists are poised to impact proteomics through the development of techniques, probes and assays with [[synthetic chemistry]] for the characterization of protein samples of high complexity. These approaches include the development of enrichment strategies, chemical affinity tags and probes.

==== Enrichment techniques ====
Samples for Proteomics contain a myriad of peptide sequences, the sequence of interest may be highly represented or of low abundance. However, for successful MS analysis the peptide should be enriched within the sample. Reduction of sample complexity is achieved through selective enrichment using [[affinity chromatography]] techniques. This involves targeting a peptide with a distinguishing feature like a [[biotin label]] or a [[post translational modification]].&lt;ref name="pmid19743430"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao Y, Jensen ON | title = Modification-specific proteomics: strategies for characterization of post-translational modifications using enrichment techniques | journal = Proteomics | volume = 9 | issue = 20 | pages = 4632–41 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19743430 | pmc = 2892724 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200900398  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods have been developed that include the use of antibodies, lectins to capture glycoproteins, [[Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography|immobilized metal ions]] to capture phosphorylated peptides and suicide enzyme substrates to capture specific enzymes. Here, chemical biologists can develop reagents to interact with substrates, specifically and tightly, to profile a targeted functional group on a proteome scale. Development of new enrichment strategies is needed in areas like non-ser/thr/tyr phosphorylation sites and other post translational modifications. Other methods of decomplexing samples relies on upstream [[chromatography|chromatographic separations]].

==== Affinity tags ====
Chemical synthesis of [[protein tag|affinity tags]] has been crucial to the maturation of quantitative proteomics. [[iTRAQ]], [[Tandem mass tags]] (TMT) and [[Isotope-coded affinity tag]] (ICAT) are protein mass-tags that consist of a covalently attaching group, a mass (isobaric or isotopic) encoded linker and a handle for isolation. Varying mass-tags bind to different proteins as a sort of footprint such that when analyzing cells of differing perturbations, the levels of each protein can be compared relatively after enrichment by the introduced handle. Other methods include [[SILAC]] and [[Isotopic labeling|heavy isotope labeling]]. These methods have been adapted to identify complexing proteins by labeling a bait protein, pulling it down and analyzing the proteins it has complexed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Gingras A-C)), Gstaiger M, Raught B, Aebersold R | title = Analysis of protein complexes using mass spectrometry | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 645–54 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17593931 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another method creates an internal tag by introducing novel amino acids that are genetically encoded in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. These modifications create a new level of control and can facilitate photocrosslinking to probe protein–protein interactions.&lt;ref name="pmid12404640"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chin JW, Schultz PG | title = In vivo photocrosslinking with unnatural amino Acid mutagenesis | journal = Chembiochem | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 1135–7 |date=November 2002 | pmid = 12404640 | doi = 10.1002/1439-7633(20021104)3:11&lt;1135::AID-CBIC1135&gt;3.0.CO;2-M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, keto, acetylene, azide, thioester, boronate, and dehydroalanine- containing amino acids can be used to selectively introduce tags, and novel chemical functional groups into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu W, Brock A, Chen S, Chen S, Schultz PG | title = Genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–44 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17322890 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth1016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Enzyme probes ====
To investigate enzymatic activity as opposed to total protein, activity-based reagents have been developed to label the enzymatically active form of proteins (see [[Activity-based proteomics]]). For example, serine hydrolase- and cysteine protease-inhibitors have been converted to [[suicide inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = López-Otín C, Overall CM | title = Protease degradomics: A new challenge for proteomics | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 509–19 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12094217 | doi = 10.1038/nrm858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy enhances the ability to selectively analyze low abundance constituents through direct targeting. Structures that mimic these inhibitors could be introduced with modifications that will aid proteomic analysis- like an identification handle or mass tag.&lt;ref name="pmid11182321"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adam GC, Cravatt BF, Sorensen EJ | title = Profiling the specific reactivity of the proteome with non-directed activity-based probes | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–95 |date=January 2001 | pmid = 11182321 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(00)90060-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enzyme activity can also be monitored through converted substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tureček F | title = Mass spectrometry in coupling with affinity capture-release and isotope-coded affinity tags for quantitative protein analysis | journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11813306 | doi = 10.1002/jms.275 | bibcode = 2002JMSp...37....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy relies on using synthetic substrate conjugates that contain moieties that are acted upon by specific enzymes. The product conjugates are then captured by an affinity reagent and analyzed. The measured concentration of product conjugate allow the determination of the enzyme velocity. Other factors such as temperature, enzyme concentration and substrate concentration can be visualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warmerdam A, Boom RM, Janssen AE | title = β-galactosidase stability at high substrate concentrations | journal = SpringerPlus | volume = 2 | pages = 402 | date = 2013-08-27 | pmid = 24024090 | pmc = 3765595 | doi = 10.1186/2193-1801-2-402 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/2193-1801-2-402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of enzyme substrates (of which there may be hundreds or thousands, many of which unknown) is a problem of significant difficulty in proteomics and is vital to the understanding of signal transduction pathways in cells; techniques for labelling cellular substrates of enzymes is an area chemical biologists can address. A method that has been developed uses "analog-sensitive" kinases to label substrates using an unnatural ATP analog, facilitating visualization and identification through a unique handle.&lt;ref name="pmid18265343"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blethrow J, Zhang C, Shokat KM, Weiss EL | title = Design and use of analog-sensitive protein kinases | journal = Curr Protoc Mol Biol | volume = Chapter 18 | issue = | pages = Unit 18.11 |date=May 2004 | pmid = 18265343 | doi = 10.1002/0471142727.mb1811s66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycobiology===
While [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and proteins are all encoded at the genetic level, there exists a separate system of trafficked molecules in the cell that are not encoded directly at any direct level: sugars. Thus, [[glycomics|glycobiology]] is an area of dense research for chemical biologists. For instance, live cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars in order to probe the function of the sugars in vivo. [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Carolyn Bertozzi]], previously at [[University of California, Berkeley]], has developed a method for site-specifically reacting molecules the surface of cells that have been labeled with synthetic sugars.

===Combinatorial chemistry===
Chemical biologists used automated synthesis of many diverse compounds in order to experiment with effects of small molecules on biological processes. More specifically, they observe changes in the behaviors of [[protein]]s when small molecules bind to them. Such experiments may supposedly lead to discovery of small molecules with [[antibiotic]] or chemotherapeutic properties.  These approaches are identical to those employed in the discipline of pharmacology.

===Molecular sensing===
Chemical biologists are also interested in developing new small-molecule and biomolecule-based tools to study biological processes, often by molecular imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cb700248m | volume=3 | title=Bright Ideas for Chemical Biology | year=2008 | journal=ACS Chemical Biology | pages=142–155 | vauthors=Lavis LD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of molecular sensing was popularized by [[Roger Tsien]]'s work developing calcium-sensing fluorescent compounds as well as pioneering the use of [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], for which he was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/index.html The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, researchers continue to utilize basic chemical principles to develop new compounds for the study of biological metabolites and processes.

===Employing biology===
Many research programs are also focused on employing natural biomolecules to perform biological tasks or to support a new chemical method or material. In this regard, researchers have shown that DNA can serve as a template for synthetic chemistry, self-assembling proteins can serve as a structural scaffold for new materials, and RNA can be evolved ''in vitro'' to produce new catalytic function. Additionally, heterobifunctional (two-sided) synthetic small molecules such as dimerizers or [[Proteolysis targeting chimera|PROTACs]] bring two proteins together inside cells, which can synthetically induce important new biological functions such as targeted protein degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cermakova K, Hodges HC | title = Next-Generation Drugs and Probes for Chromatin Biology: From Targeted Protein Degradation to Phase Separation | journal = Molecules | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30082609 | pmc = 6102721 | doi = 10.3390/molecules23081958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein misfolding and aggregation as a cause of disease===
A common form of aggregation is long, ordered spindles called amyloid fibrils that are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and that have been shown to consist of cross-linked [[beta sheet]] regions perpendicular to the backbone of the polypeptide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordens S, Adamcik J, Amar-Yuli I, Mezzenga R | title = Disassembly and Reassembly of Amyloid Fibrils in Water−Ethanol Mixtures | journal = Biomacromolecules | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–93 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21142059 | doi = 10.1021/bm101119t }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of aggregation occurs with [[prion| prion proteins]], the glycoproteins found with [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] and [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]]. In both structures, aggregation occurs through [[hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic interactions]] and water must be excluded from the binding surface before aggregation can occur.&lt;ref name="pmid21098298"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy G, Straub JE, Thirumalai D | title = Dry amyloid fibril assembly in a yeast prion peptide is mediated by long-lived structures containing water wires | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 107 | issue = 50 | pages = 21459–64 |date=December 2010 | pmid = 21098298 | pmc = 3003024 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1008616107 |bibcode = 2010PNAS..10721459R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A movie of this process can be seen in "Chemical and Engineering News".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borman SA | title = Water Factors in on Amyloid And Prion Aggregation Rates | journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News | volume = 88 | issue = 49 | pages = 37 | year = 2010 | pmid = | doi =  | url = http://cen.acs.org/articles/88/i49/Water-Factors-Amyloid-Prion-Aggregation.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diseases associated with misfolded proteins are life-threatening and extremely debilitating, which makes them an important target for chemical biology research.

Through the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] process, [[DNA]] encodes for specific sequences of [[amino acids]]. The resulting polypeptides [[Protein folding|fold]] into more complex secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures to form proteins. Based on both the sequence and the structure, a particular protein is conferred its cellular function. However, sometimes the folding process fails due to mutations in the genetic code and thus the amino acid sequence or due to changes in the cell environment (e.g. pH, temperature, reduction potential, etc.). Misfolding occurs more often in aged individuals or in cells exposed to a high degree of [[oxidative stress]], but a fraction of all proteins misfold at some point even in the healthiest of cells.

Normally when a protein does not fold correctly, [[molecular chaperones]] in the cell can encourage refolding back into its active form.   When refolding is not an option, the cell can also target the protein for degradation back into its component amino acids via [[Proteasome|proteolytic]], [[Lysosome|lysosomal]], or [[Autophagy (cellular)|autophagic]] mechanisms. However, under certain conditions or with certain mutations, the cells can no longer cope with the misfolded protein(s) and a disease state results. Either the protein has a loss-of-function, such as in [[cystic fibrosis]], in which it loses activity or cannot reach its target, or the protein has a gain-of-function, such as with [[Alzheimer's disease]], in which the protein begins to aggregate causing it to become insoluble and non-functional.

Protein misfolding has previously been studied using both computational approaches as well as ''in vivo'' biological assays in [[model organisms]] such as ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and ''C. elegans''. Computational models use a ''de novo'' process to calculate possible protein structures based on input parameters such as amino acid sequence, solvent effects, and mutations. This method has the shortcoming that the cell environment has been drastically simplified, which limits the factors that influence folding and stability. On the other hand, biological assays can be quite complicated to perform ''in vivo'' with [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] like efficiency and there always remains the question of how well lower organism systems approximate human systems.
	
[[Chris Dobson|Dobson]] et al. propose combining these two approaches such that computational models based on the organism studies can begin to predict what factors will lead to protein misfolding.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luheshi LM, Crowther DC, Dobson CM | title = Protein misfolding and disease: from the test tube to the organism | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–31 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18295611 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several experiments have already been performed based on this strategy. In experiments on ''Drosophila'', different mutations of beta amyloid peptides were evaluated based on the survival rates of the flies as well as their motile ability. The findings from the study show that the more a protein aggregates, the more detrimental the neurological dysfunction.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luheshi LM, Tartaglia GG, ((Brorsson A-C)), Pawar AP, Watson IE, Chiti F, Vendruscolo M, Lomas DA, Dobson CM | title = Systematic in Vivo Analysis of the Intrinsic Determinants of Amyloid β Pathogenicity | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = e290 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17973577 | pmc = 2043051 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crowther DC, Kinghorn KJ, Miranda E, Page R, Curry JA, ((Duthie FAI)), Gubb DC, Lomas DA | title = Intraneuronal Aβ, non-amyloid aggregates and neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 132 | issue = 1 | pages = 123–35 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15780472 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.12.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies using [[transthyretin]], a component of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] that binds to beta amyloid peptide deterring aggregation but can itself aggregate especially when mutated, indicate that aggregation prone proteins may not aggregate where they are secreted and rather are deposited in specific organs or tissues based on each mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammarström P, Sekijima Y, White JT, Wiseman RL, Lim A, Costello CE, Altland K, Garzuly F, Budka H | title = D18G Transthyretin is Monomeric, Aggregation Prone, and Not Detectable in Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid:  A Prescription for Central Nervous System Amyloidosis?† | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 42 | issue = 22 | pages = 6656–63 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12779320 | doi = 10.1021/bi027319b }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly et al. have shown that the more stable, both kinetically and thermodynamically, a misfolded protein is the more likely the cell is to secrete it from the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] rather than targeting the protein for degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sekijima Y, Wiseman RL, Matteson J, Hammarström P, Miller SR, Sawkar AR, Balch WE, Kelly JW | title = The Biological and Chemical Basis for Tissue-Selective Amyloid Disease | journal = Cell | volume = 121 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–85 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15820680 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the more stress that a cell feels from misfolded proteins the more probable new proteins will misfold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gidalevitz T, Ben-Zvi A, Ho KH, Brignull HR, Morimoto RI | title = Progressive Disruption of Cellular Protein Folding in Models of Polyglutamine Diseases | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5766 | pages = 1471–1474 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16469881 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124514 |bibcode = 2006Sci...311.1471G }}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments as well as others having begun to elucidate both the intrinsic and extrinsic causes of misfolding as well as how the cell recognizes if proteins have folded correctly.

As more information is obtained on how the cell copes with misfolded proteins, new therapeutic strategies begin to emerge. An obvious path would be prevention of misfolding. However, if protein misfolding cannot be avoided, perhaps the cell's natural mechanisms for degradation can be bolstered to better deal with the proteins before they begin to aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen E, Bieschke J, Perciavalle RM, Kelly JW, Dillin A | title = Opposing Activities Protect Against Age-Onset Proteotoxicity | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5793 | pages = 1604–1610 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16902091 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124646 |bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1604C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before these ideas can be realized, many more experiments need to be done to understand the folding and degradation machinery as well as what factors lead to misfolding. More information about protein misfolding and how it relates to disease can be found in the recently published book by Dobson, Kelly, and Rameriz-Alvarado entitled Protein Misfolding Diseases Current and Emerging Principles and Therapies.&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez-Alvarado, M., Kelly, J.

=== Chemical synthesis of peptides ===
{{main|Peptide synthesis}}
In contrast to the traditional biotechnological practice of obtaining [[peptides]] or [[proteins]] by isolation from cellular hosts through cellular [[protein production]], advances in chemical techniques for the synthesis and ligation of peptides has allowed for the total synthesis of some peptides and proteins. Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue specific incorporation of "[[posttranslational modification]]s" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even [[ubiquitin]]ation. These capabilities are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins. Although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends, the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein. Given the widely recognized importance of proteins as cellular catalysts and recognition elements, the ability to precisely control the composition and connectivity of polypeptides is a valued tool in the chemical biology community and is an area of active research.
 
While chemists have been making peptides for over 100 years,&lt;ref name=reference2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimmerlin T, Seebach D | title = '100 years of peptide synthesis': ligation methods for peptide and protein synthesis with applications to beta-peptide assemblies | journal = J Pept Res | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–260 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15705167 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3011.2005.00214.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ability to efficiently and quickly synthesize short peptides came of age with the development of [[Bruce Merrifield]]'s [[peptide synthesis|solid phase peptide synthesis]] (SPPS). Prior to the development of SPPS, the concept of step-by-step polymer synthesis on an insoluble support was without chemical precedent.&lt;ref name="pmid16778881"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kent S | title = Obituary: Bruce Merrifield (1921–2006) | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7095 | pages = 824 |date=June 2006 | pmid = 16778881 | doi = 10.1038/441824a |bibcode = 2006Natur.441..824K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a covalently bound insoluble polymeric support greatly simplified the process of peptide synthesis by reducing purification to a simple "filtration and wash" procedure and facilitated a boom in the field of peptide chemistry. The development and "optimization" of SPPS took peptide synthesis from the hands of the specialized peptide synthesis community and put it into the hands of the broader chemistry, biochemistry, and now chemical biology community. SPPS is still the method of choice for linear synthesis of polypeptides up to 50 residues in length&lt;ref name="pmid16778881"/&gt; and has been implemented in commercially available automated peptide synthesizers. One inherent shortcoming in any procedure that calls for repeated coupling reactions is the buildup of side products resulting from incomplete couplings and side reactions. This places the upper bound for the synthesis of linear polypeptide lengths at around 50 amino acids, while the "average" protein consists of 250 amino acids.&lt;ref name=reference2/&gt; Clearly, there was a need for development of "non-linear" methods to allow synthetic access to the average protein.

Although the shortcomings of linear SPPS were recognized not long after its inception, it took until the early 1990s for effective methodology to be developed to ligate small peptide fragments made by SPPS, into protein sized polypeptide chains (for recent review of peptide ligation strategies, see review by Dawson ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dirksen A, Dawson PE | title = Expanding the scope of chemoselective peptide ligations in chemical biology | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 760–6 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19058994 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.10.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The oldest and best developed of these methods is termed [[native chemical ligation]]. Native chemical ligation was unveiled in a 1994 paper from the laboratory of [[Stephen Kent (chemist)|Stephen B. H. Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawson PE, Muir TW, Clarklewis I, ((Kent SBH)) | title = SYNTHESIS OF PROTEINS BY NATIVE CHEMICAL LIGATION | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5186 | pages = 776–779 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7973629 | doi = 10.1126/science.7973629 |bibcode = 1994Sci...266..776D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Native chemical ligation involves the coupling of a C-terminal thioester and an N-terminal cysteine residue, ultimately resulting in formation of a "native" amide bond. Further refinements in native chemical ligation have allowed for kinetically controlled coupling of multiple peptide fragments, allowing access to moderately sized peptides such as an HIV-protease dimer&lt;ref name="pmid17397076"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torbeev VY, Kent SB | title = Convergent chemical synthesis and crystal structure of a 203 amino acid "covalent dimer" HIV-1 protease enzyme molecule | journal = Angew.

Some of these drawbacks include the installation and preservation of a reactive C-terminal thioester, the requirement of an N-terminal cysteine residue (which is the second-least-common amino acid in proteins),&lt;ref name="pmid3227018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCaldon P, Argos P | title = Oligopeptide biases in protein sequences and their use in predicting protein coding regions in nucleotide sequences | journal = Proteins | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–122 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3227018 | doi = 10.1002/prot.340040204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the requirement for a sterically unincumbering C-terminal residue.

Other strategies that have been used for the ligation of peptide fragments using the acyl transfer chemistry first introduced with native chemical ligation include expressed protein ligation,&lt;ref name="pmid9618476"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muir TW, Sondhi D, Cole PA | title = Expressed protein ligation: a general method for protein engineering | journal = Proc.

Expressed protein ligation allows for the biotechnological installation of a C-terminal thioester using [[intein]] biochemistry, thereby allowing the appendage of a synthetic N-terminal peptide to the recombinantly produced C-terminal portion. This technique allows for access to much larger proteins, as only the N-terminal portion of the resulting protein has to be chemically synthesized. Both sulfurization/desulfurization techniques and the use of removable thiol auxiliaries involve the installation of a synthetic thiol moiety to carry out the standard native chemical ligation chemistry, followed by removal of the auxiliary/thiol. These techniques help to overcome the requirement of an N-terminal cysteine needed for standard native chemical ligation, although the steric requirements for the C-terminal residue are still limiting.
 
A final category of peptide ligation strategies include those methods not based on native chemical ligation type chemistry. Methods that fall in this category include the traceless Staudinger ligation,&lt;ref name="pmid16819875"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soellner MB, Nilsson BL, Raines RT | title = Reaction mechanism and kinetics of the traceless Staudinger ligation | journal = J.

===Protein design by directed evolution===
{{main|Directed evolution}}
One of the primary goals of [[protein engineering]] is the design of novel [[peptides]] or [[proteins]] with a desired structure and chemical activity. Because our knowledge of the relationship between primary sequence, structure, and function of proteins is limited, [[protein design|rational design]] of new proteins with [[enzyme|enzymatic activity]] is extremely challenging. Directed evolution, repeated cycles of genetic diversification followed by a screening or selection process, can be used to mimic [[natural selection|Darwinian evolution]] in the laboratory to design new proteins with a desired activity.&lt;ref name="pmid18573077"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jäckel C, Kast P, Hilvert D | title = Protein design by directed evolution | journal = Annu Rev Biophys | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 153–73 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18573077 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods exist for creating large libraries of sequence variants. Among the most widely used are subjecting [[DNA]] to [[UV radiation]] or [[mutagen|chemical mutagens]], [[PCR|error-prone PCR]], [[genetic code|degenerate codons]], or [[genetic recombination|recombination]].&lt;ref name="Bittker_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15118093"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bittker JA, Le BV, Liu JM, Liu DR | title = Directed evolution of protein enzymes using nonhomologous random recombination | journal = Proc.

Since only proteins with the desired activity are selected, multiple rounds of directed evolution lead to proteins with an accumulation beneficial traits.

There are two general strategies for choosing the starting sequence for a directed evolution experiment: ''de novo'' design and redesign. In a protein design experiment, an initial sequence is chosen at random and subjected to multiple rounds of directed evolution. For example, this has been employed successfully to create a family of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-binding proteins with a new folding pattern not found in nature.&lt;ref name="pmid15024384"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lo Surdo P, Walsh MA, Sollazzo M | title = A novel ADP- and zinc-binding fold from function-directed in vitro evolution | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 382–3 |date=April 2004 | pmid = 15024384 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Random sequences can also be biased towards specific folds by specifying the characteristics (such as polar vs. nonpolar) but not the specific identity of each amino acid in a sequence. Among other things, this strategy has been used to successfully design [[helix bundle|four-helix bundle]] proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamtekar S, Schiffer JM, Xiong HY, Babik JM, Hecht MH | title = Protein Design by Binary Patterning of Polar and Nonpolar Amino-acids | journal = Science | volume = 262 | issue = 5140 | pages = 1680–1685 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8259512 | doi = 10.1126/science.8259512 |bibcode = 1993Sci...262.1680K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14593201"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei Y, Kim S, Fela D, Baum J, Hecht MH | title = Solution structure of a de novo protein from a designed combinatorial library | journal = Proc.

In a protein redesign experiment, an existing sequence serves as the starting point for directed evolution. In this way, old proteins can be redesigned for increased activity or new functions. Protein redesign has been used for protein simplification, creation of new quaternary structures, and topological redesign of a [[chorismate mutase]].&lt;ref name="Bittker_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SV, Walter KU, Kast P, Hilvert D | title = Searching sequence space for protein catalysts | journal = Proc.

In this regard, directed evolution has been used on γ-humulene synthase, an enzyme that creates over 50 different [[sesquiterpenes]], to create enzymes that selectively synthesize individual products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshikuni Y, Ferrin TE, Keasling JD | title = Designed divergent evolution of enzyme function | journal = Nature | volume = 440 | issue = 7087 | pages = 1078–1082 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16495946 | doi = 10.1038/nature04607 |bibcode = 2006Natur.440.1078Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, completely new functions can be selected for from existing protein scaffolds. In one example of this, an RNA [[ligase]] was created from a [[zinc finger]] scaffold after 17 rounds of directed evolution. This new enzyme catalyzes a chemical reaction not known to be catalyzed by any natural enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seelig B, Szostak JW | title = Selection and evolution of enzymes from a partially randomized non-catalytic scaffold | journal = Nature | volume = 448 | issue = 7155 | pages = 828–31 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17700701 | doi = 10.1038/nature06032 |bibcode = 2007Natur.448..828S | pmc = 4476047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[computational chemistry|Computational methods]], when combined with experimental approaches, can significantly assist both the design and redesign of new proteins through directed evolution. Computation has been used to design proteins with unnatural folds, such as a right-handed [[coiled coil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harbury PB, Plecs JJ, Tidor B, Alber T, Kim PS | title = High-resolution protein design with backbone freedom | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5393 | pages = 1462–1467 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9822371 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5393.1462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These computational approaches could also be used to redesign proteins to selectively bind specific target molecules. By identifying lead sequences using computational methods, the occurrence of functional proteins in libraries can be dramatically increased before any directed evolution experiments in the laboratory.

[[Manfred T. Reetz]], [[Frances Arnold]], Donald Hilvert, and [[Jack W. Szostak]] are significant researchers in this field.

===Biocompatible click cycloaddition reactions in chemical biology===
Recent advances in technology have allowed scientists to view substructures of cells at levels of unprecedented detail.  Unfortunately these "aerial" pictures offer little information about the mechanics of the biological system in question.  To be fully effective, precise imaging systems require a complementary technique that better elucidates the machinery of a cell.  By attaching tracking devices (optical probes) to [[biomolecules]] ''in vivo'', one can learn far more about [[cell metabolism]], [[molecular transport]], [[cell-cell interaction]]s and many other processes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jewett JC, Bertozzi CR | title = Cu-free click cycloaddition reactions in chemical biology | journal = Chemical Society Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 1272–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20349533 | pmc = 2865253 | doi = 10.1039/b901970g }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bioorthogonal reactions====
Successful labeling of a molecule of interest requires specific functionalization of that molecule to react chemospecifically with an optical probe.  For a labeling experiment to be considered robust, that functionalization must minimally perturb the system.&lt;ref name="pmid19714693"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sletten EM, Bertozzi CR | title = Bioorthogonal chemistry: fishing for selectivity in a sea of functionality | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. | volume = 48 | issue = 38 | pages = 6974–98 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19714693 | pmc = 2864149 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200900942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, these requirements can often be extremely hard to meet.  Many of the reactions normally available to organic chemists in the laboratory are unavailable in living systems.  Water- and redox- sensitive reactions would not proceed, reagents prone to nucleophilic attack would offer no chemospecificity, and any reactions with large kinetic barriers would not find enough energy in the relatively low-heat environment of a living cell.
Thus, chemists have recently developed a panel of [[bioorthogonal chemistry]] that proceed chemospecifically, despite the milieu of distracting reactive materials ''in vivo''.

====Design of bioorthogonal reagents and bioorthogonal chemical reporters====
The coupling of an optical probe to a molecule of interest must occur within a reasonably short time frame; therefore, the kinetics of the coupling reaction should be highly favorable.  [[Click chemistry]] is well suited to fill this niche, since click reactions are, by definition, rapid, spontaneous, selective, and high-yielding.&lt;ref name="pmid11433435"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolb HC, Finn MG, Sharpless KB | title = Click Chemistry: Diverse Chemical Function from a Few Good Reactions | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

The issue of copper toxicity can be alleviated using copper-chelating ligands, enabling copper-catalyzed labeling of the surface of live cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hong V, Steinmetz NF, Manchester M, Finn MG | title = Labeling Live Cells by Copper-Catalyzed Alkyne−Azide Click Chemistry | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 1912–6 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20886827 | pmc = 3014321 | doi = 10.1021/bc100272z }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To bypass the necessity for a catalyst, the lab of [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi]] introduced inherent strain into the alkyne species by using a cyclic alkyne.  In particular, [[cyclooctyne]] reacts with azido-molecules with distinctive vigor.&lt;ref name="pmid15547999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agard NJ, Prescher JA, Bertozzi CR | title = A strain-promoted [3 + 2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition for covalent modification of biomolecules in living systems | journal = J.

====Use in biological systems====
As mentioned above, the use of bioorthogonal reactions to tag biomolecules requires that one half of the reactive "click" pair is installed in the target molecule, while the other is attached to an optical probe.  When the probe is added to a biological system, it will selectively conjugate with the target molecule.

The most common method of installing bioorthogonal reactivity into a target biomolecule is through metabolic labeling.  Cells are immersed in a medium where access to nutrients is limited to synthetically modified analogues of standard fuels such as sugars.  As a consequence, these altered biomolecules are incorporated into the cells in the same manner as their wild-type brethren.  The optical probe is then incorporated into the system to image the fate of the altered biomolecules.  Other methods of functionalization include enzymatically inserting [[azides]] into [[proteins]],&lt;ref name="pmid19345117"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hur GH, Meier JL, Baskin J, Codelli JA, Bertozzi CR, Marahiel MA, Burkart MD | title = Crosslinking studies of protein–protein interactions in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 372–81 |date=April 2009 | pmid = 19345117 | pmc = 2743379 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2009.02.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and synthesizing [[phospholipid]]s conjugated to cyclooctynes.&lt;ref name="pmid19145623"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neef AB, Schultz C | title = Selective fluorescence labeling of lipids in living cells | journal = Angew.

====Future directions====
As these bioorthogonal reactions are further optimized, they will likely be used for increasingly complex interactions involving multiple different classes of biomolecules.  More complex interactions have a smaller margin for error, so increased reaction efficiency is paramount to continued success in optically probing cellular machinery.  Also, by minimizing side reactions, the experimental design of a minimally perturbed living system is closer to being realized.

===Discovery of biomolecules through metagenomics===
{{main|Metagenomics}}
The advances in modern sequencing technologies in the late 1990s allowed scientists to investigate DNA of communities of organisms in their natural environments, so-called "eDNA", without culturing individual species in the lab. This metagenomic approach enabled scientists to study a wide selection of organisms that were previously not characterized due in part to an incompetent growth condition. These sources of eDNA include, but are not limited to, [[soils]], ocean, [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]], [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal vents]], [[polar ice caps]], hypersaline habitats, and extreme pH environments.&lt;ref name="pmid15040261"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keller M, Zengler K | title = Tapping into microbial diversity | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology  | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–50 |date=February 2004 | pmid = 15040261 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the many applications of metagenomics, chemical biologists and microbiologists such as [[Jo Handelsman]], [[Jon Clardy]], and [[Robert M. Goodman]] who are pioneers of metagenomics, explored metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of biologically active molecules such as [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref name="pmid9818143"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Handelsman J, Rondon MR, Brady SF, Clardy J, Goodman RM | title = Molecular biological access to the chemistry of unknown soil microbes: a new frontier for natural products | journal = Chem.

[[File:Overview of metagenomic methods.jpg|thumb|370px|alt=Overview of metagenomic methods|Overview of metagenomic methods]]
[[Functional symptom|Functional]] or [[homology (biology)|homology]] screening strategies have been used to identify genes that produce small bioactive molecules. Functional metagenomic studies are designed to search for specific [[phenotypes]] that are associated with molecules with specific characteristics. Homology metagenomic studies, on the other hand, are designed to examine genes to identify [[conserved sequences]] that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules.&lt;ref name="Banik_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Banik JJ, Brady SF | title = Recent application of metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of antimicrobials and other bioactive small molecules | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 603–609 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20884282 | pmc = 3111150 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2010.08.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Functional metagenomic studies enable scientists to discover novel genes that encode biologically active molecules. These assays include top agar overlay assays where antibiotics generate zones of growth inhibition against test microbes, and pH assays that can screen for pH change due to newly synthesized molecules using pH indicator on an [[agar]] plate.&lt;ref name="Daniel_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Daniel R | title = The metagenomics of soil | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 470–478 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15931165 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substrate-induced gene expression screening (SIGEX), a method to screen for the expression of genes that are induced by chemical compounds, has also been used to search genes with specific functions.&lt;ref name = "Daniel_2005"/&gt; These led to the discovery and isolation of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, the Schipper group identified three eDNA derived AHL [[lactonase]]s that inhibit [[biofilm]] formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via functional metagenomic assays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schipper C, Hornung C, Bijtenhoorn P, Quitschau M, Grond S, Streit WR | title = Metagenome-Derived Clones Encoding Two Novel Lactonase Family Proteins Involved in Biofilm Inhibition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 224–233 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18997026 | pmc = 2612230 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.01389-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these functional screening methods require a good design of probes that detect molecules being synthesized and depend on the ability to express metagenomes in a host organism system.&lt;ref name="Daniel_2005"/&gt;
	
In contrast, homology metagenomic studies led to a faster discovery of genes that have homologous sequences as the previously known genes that are responsible for the [[biosynthesis]] of biologically active molecules. As soon as the genes are sequenced, scientists can compare thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Banik_2010"/&gt; The advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes, thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes. These also led to the discovery of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, Banik et al. screened for clones containing genes associated with the synthesis of teicoplanin and vancomycin-like [[glycopeptide]] [[antibiotics]] and found two new biosynthetic gene clusters.&lt;ref name="pmid20834152"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bunterngsook B, Kanokratana P, Thongaram T, Tanapongpipat S, Uengwetwanit T, Rachdawong S, Vichitsoonthonkul T, Eurwilaichitr L | title = Identification and characterization of lipolytic enzymes from a peat-swamp forest soil metagenome | journal = Biosci.

There are challenges to metagenomic approaches to discover new biologically active molecules. Only 40% of enzymatic activities present in a sample can be expressed in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gabor EM, ((Alkema WBL)), Janssen DB | title = Quantifying the accessibility of the metagenome by random expression cloning techniques | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 879–86 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15305913 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2004.00640.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the purification and isolation of eDNA is essential but difficult when the sources of obtained samples are poorly understood. However, collaborative efforts from individuals from diverse fields including [[Microbial genetics|bacterial genetics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genomics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[robots]], [[synthetic biology]], and [[chemistry]] can solve this problem together and potentially lead to the discovery of many important biologically active molecules.&lt;ref name="Banik_2010"/&gt;

===Protein phosphorylation===
[[Posttranslational modification]] of proteins with [[phosphate]] groups has proven to be a key regulatory step throughout all biological systems.  Phosphorylation events, either phosphorylation by protein [[kinase]]s or dephosphorylation by [[phosphatases]], result in protein activation or deactivation.  These events have an immense impact on the regulation of physiological pathways, which makes the ability to dissect and study these pathways integral to understanding the details of cellular processes.   There exist a number of challenges—namely the sheer size of the phosphoproteome, the fleeting nature of phosphorylation events and related physical limitations of classical biological and biochemical techniques—that have limited the advancement of knowledge in this area.  A recent review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrant MK, Cole PA | title = The Chemical Biology of Protein Phosphorylation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 78 | issue =  | pages = 797–825 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19489734 | pmc = 3074175 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.78.070907.103047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a detailed examination of the impact of newly developed chemical approaches to dissecting and studying biological systems both in vitro and in vivo.

Through the use of a number of classes of small molecule modulators of protein kinases, chemical biologists have been able to gain a better understanding of the effects of protein phosphorylation.  For example, nonselective and selective kinase inhibitors, such as a class of pyridinylimidazole compounds described by Wilson, et al.,&lt;ref name="pmid9224565"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson KP, McCaffrey PG, Hsiao K, Pazhanisamy S, Galullo V, Bemis GW, Fitzgibbon MJ, Caron PR, Murcko MA, Su MS | title = The structural basis for the specificity of pyridinylimidazole inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 423–31 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9224565 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(97)90194-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are potent inhibitors useful in the dissection of [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAP kinase]] signaling pathways.  These pyridinylimidazole compounds function by targeting the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] binding pocket.  Although this approach, as well as related approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pargellis C, Tong L, Churchill L, Cirillo PF, Gilmore T, Graham AG, Grob PM, Hickey ER, Moss N, Pav S, Regan J | title = Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by utilizing a novel allosteric binding site | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 268–72 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11896401 | doi = 10.1038/nsb770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schindler T, Bornmann W, Pellicena P, Miller WT, Clarkson B, Kuriyan J | title = Structural mechanism for STI-571 inhibition of abelson tyrosine kinase | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5486 | pages = 1938–42 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10988075 | doi = 10.1126/science.289.5486.1938 | bibcode = 2000Sci...289.1938S }}&lt;/ref&gt; with slight modifications, has proven effective in a number of cases, these compounds lack adequate specificity for more general applications.  Another class of compounds, mechanism-based inhibitors, combines detailed knowledge of the chemical mechanism of kinase action with previously utilized inhibition motifs.  For example, Parang, et al. describe the development of a "bisubstrate analog" that inhibits kinase action by binding both the conserved ATP binding pocket and a protein/peptide recognition site on the specific kinase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parang K, Till JH, Ablooglu AJ, Kohanski RA, Hubbard SR, Cole PA | title = Mechanism-based design of a protein kinase inhibitor | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–41 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11135668 | doi = 10.1038/83028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no published in vivo data on compounds of this type, the structural data acquired from in vitro studies have expanded the current understanding of how a number of important kinases recognize target substrates.

The development of novel chemical means of incorporating [[phosphomimetics]] into proteins has provided important insight into the effects of phosphorylation events.  Historically, phosphorylation events have been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site ([[serine]], [[threonine]] or [[tyrosine]]) to an amino acid, such as [[alanine]], that cannot be phosphorylated.   While this approach has been successful in some cases, mutations are permanent in vivo and can have potentially detrimental effects on protein folding and stability. Thus, chemical biologists have developed new ways of investigating protein phosphorylation.  By installing phospho-serine, phospho-threonine or analogous [[phosphonate]] mimics into native proteins, researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often-unfavorable effects of mutations.  Protein semisynthesis, or more specifically [[expressed protein ligation]] (EPL), has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either the C- or the N-terminus.&lt;ref name="pmid9618476"/&gt; In addition, researchers have built upon an established technique in which one can insert an unnatural amino acid into a peptide sequence by charging synthetic tRNA that recognizes a nonsense codon with an unnatural amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noren CJ, Anthony-Cahill SJ, Griffith MC, Schultz PG | title = A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4901 | pages = 182–188 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2649980 | doi = 10.1126/science.2649980 |bibcode = 1989Sci...244..182N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments indicate that this technique can also be employed in vivo, although, due to permeability issues, these in vivo experiments using phosphomimetic molecules have not yet been possible.&lt;ref name="pmid16689635"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L, Xie J, Schultz PG | title = Expanding the genetic code | journal = Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 225–49 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16689635 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.35.101105.121507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in chemical biology have also improved upon classical techniques of imaging kinase action.  For example, the development of [[peptide biosensors]]—peptides containing incorporated [[fluorophore]] molecules—allowed for improved temporal resolution in in vitro binding assays.&lt;ref name="pmid17881302"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma V, Wang Q, Lawrence DS | title = Peptide-based fluorescent sensors of protein kinase activity: design and applications | journal = Biochim.

One of the most useful techniques to study kinase action is [[Förster resonance energy transfer|Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer]] (FRET).  To utilize FRET for phosphorylation studies, fluorescent proteins are coupled to both a phosphoamino acid binding domain and a peptide that can by phosphorylated.  Upon phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a substrate peptide, a conformational change occurs that results in a change in fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Violin JD, Zhang J, Tsein RY, Newton AC | title = A genetically encoded fluorescent reporter reveals oscillatory phosphorylation by protein kinase C | journal = J.

Through the augmentation of classical biochemical methods as well as the development of new tools and techniques, chemical biologists have improved accuracy and precision in the study of protein phosphorylation.

===Chemical approaches to stem-cell biology===
{{main|Stem Cell|Induced stem cells}}
Advances in stem-cell biology have typically been driven by discoveries in [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]]. These have included optimization of culture conditions for the maintenance and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of [[Cell potency|pluripotent]] and multipotent stem-cells and the deciphering of [[cell signaling|signaling circuits]] that control stem-cell fate. However, chemical approaches to stem-cell biology have recently received increased attention due to the identification of several [[small molecules]] capable of modulating stem-cell fate in vitro.&lt;ref name="pmid17493865"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Emre N, Coleman R, Ding S | title = A chemical approach to stem cell biology | journal = Curr Opin Chem Biol | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 252–8 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17493865 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.04.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small molecule approach offers particular advantages over traditional methods in that it allows a high degree of temporal control, since compounds can be added or removed at will, and tandem inhibition/activation of multiple cellular targets.

Small molecules that modulate stem-cell behavior are commonly identified in [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput screens]]. Libraries of compounds are screened for the induction of a desired phenotypic change in cultured stem-cells. This is usually observed through activation or repression of a fluorescent reporter or by detection of specific cell surface markers by [[fluorescence-activated cell sorting|FACS]] or [[immunohistochemistry]]. Hits are then structurally optimized for activity by the synthesis and screening of secondary libraries. The cellular targets of the small molecule can then be identified by [[affinity chromatography]], [[mass spectrometry]], or [[DNA microarray]].  
	
A trademark of pluripotent stem-cells, such as [[embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem-cells]] (ESCs), is the ability to [[biological immortality|self-renew]] indefinitely. The conventional use of feeder cells and various exogenous growth factors in the culture of ESCs presents a problem in that the resulting highly variable culture conditions make the long-term expansion of un-differentiated ESCs challenging.&lt;ref name="pmid20714081"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vazin T, Freed WJ | title = Human embryonic stem cells: derivation, culture, and differentiation: a review | journal = Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 589–603 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20714081 | pmc = 2973558 | doi = 10.3233/RNN-2010-0543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, chemically defined culture conditions could be developed to maintain ESCs in a pluripotent state indefinitely. Toward this goal, the Schultz and Ding labs at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] identified a small molecule that can preserve the long-term self-renewal of ESCs in the absence of feeder cells and other exogenous growth factors.&lt;ref name="pmid17088537"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen S, Do JT, Zhang Q, Yao S, Yan F, Peters EC, Schöler HR, Schultz PG, Ding S | title = Self-renewal of embryonic stem cells by a small molecule | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 103 | issue = 46 | pages = 17266–71 |date=November 2006 | pmid = 17088537 | pmc = 1859921 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0608156103 |bibcode = 2006PNAS..10317266C }}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel molecule, called pluripotin, was found to simultaneously inhibit multiple differentiation inducing pathways.

[[File:Stemcellmodulators.tif|thumb|275px|Small molecule modulators of stem-cell fate.]]
The utility of stem-cells is in their ability to differentiate into all cell types that make up an organism. Differentiation can be achieved in vitro by favoring development toward a particular cell type through the addition of lineage specific growth factors, but this process is typically non-specific and generates low yields of the desired phenotype. Alternatively, inducing differentiation by small molecules is advantageous in that it allows for the development of completely chemically defined conditions for the generation of one specific cell type. A small molecule, neuropathiazol, has been identified which can specifically direct differentiation of multipotent [[neural stem cells]] into [[neurons]].&lt;ref name="pmid16323231"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warashina M, Min KH, Kuwabara T, Huynh A, Gage FH, Schultz PG, Ding S | title = A synthetic small molecule that induces neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells | journal = Angew.

Because of the ethical issues surrounding ESC research, the generation of pluripotent cells by reprogramming existing [[somatic cells]] into a more "stem-like" state is a promising alternative to the use of standard ESCs. By genetic approaches, this has recently been achieved in the creation of ESCs by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Egli D, Rosains J, Birkhoff G, Eggan K | title = Developmental reprogramming after chromosome transfer into mitotic mouse zygotes | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7145 | pages = 679–85 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17554301 | doi = 10.1038/nature05879 |bibcode = 2007Natur.447..679E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the generation of [[induced pluripotent stem cell|induced pluripotent stem-cells]] by viral [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] of specific genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a therapeutic perspective, reprogramming by chemical means would be safer than genetic methods because induced stem-cells would be free of potentially dangerous [[transgenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anastasia L, Pelissero G, Venerando B, Tettamanti G | title = Cell reprogramming: Expectations and challenges for chemistry in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine | journal = Cell Death and Differentiation | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 1230–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20168332 | doi = 10.1038/cdd.2010.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples of small molecules that can de-differentiate somatic cells have been identified. In one report, lineage-committed [[myoblasts]] were treated with a compound, named reversine, and observed to revert to a more stem-like phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen S, Zhang Q, Wu X, Schultz PG, Ding S | title = Dedifferentiation of Lineage-Committed Cells by a Small Molecule | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 410–1 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14719906 | doi = 10.1021/ja037390k }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells were then shown to be capable of differentiating into [[osteoblasts]] and [[adipocytes]] under appropriate conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid17566101"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen S, Takanashi S, Zhang Q, Xiong W, Zhu S, Peters EC, Ding S, Schultz PG | title = Reversine increases the plasticity of lineage-committed mammalian cells | journal = Proc.

Stem-cell therapies are currently the most promising treatment for many [[degenerative diseases]]. Chemical approaches to stem-cell biology support the development of cell-based therapies by enhancing stem-cell growth, maintenance, and differentiation in vitro. Small molecules that have been shown to modulate stem-cell fate are potential therapeutic candidates and provide a natural lean-in to pre-clinical drug development. Small molecule drugs could promote endogenous stem-cells to differentiate, replacing previously damaged tissues and thereby enhancing the body's own [[regenerative medicine|regenerative]] ability. Further investigation of molecules that modulate stem-cell behavior will only unveil new therapeutic targets.

===Fluorescence for assessing protein location and function===

====Fluorophores and techniques to tag proteins====
Organisms are composed of cells that, in turn, are composed of macromolecules, e.g. proteins, ribosomes, etc. These macromolecules interact with each other, changing their concentration and suffering chemical modifications. The main goal of many biologists is to understand these interactions, using [[MRI]], ESR, [[electrochemistry]], and [[fluorescence]] among others. The advantages of fluorescence reside in its high sensitivity, non-invasiveness, safe detection, and ability to modulate the fluorescence signal. Fluorescence was observed mainly from small organic dyes attached to antibodies to the protein of interest. Later, fluorophores could directly recognize organelles, nucleic acids, and important ions in living cells. In the past decade, the discovery of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP), by [[Roger Y. Tsien]], hybrid system and quantum dots have enable assessing protein location and function more precisely.&lt;ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Giepmans BNG)), Adams SR, Ellisman MH, Tsien RY | title = The Fluorescent Toolbox for Assessing Protein Location and Function | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5771 | pages = 217–224 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16614209 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124618 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312..217G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of fluorophores are used: small organic dyes, green fluorescent proteins, and [[quantum dots]]. Small organic dyes usually are less than 1 kD, and have been modified to increase photostability, enhance brightness, and reduce self-quenching. Quantum dots have very sharp wavelength, high molar absorptivity and quantum yield. Both organic dyes and quantum dyes do not have the ability to recognize the protein of interest without the aid of antibodies, hence they must use [[immunolabeling]]. Since the size of the fluorophore-targeting complex typically exceeds 200 kD, it might interfere with multiprotein recognition in protein complexes, and other methods should be use in parallel.  An advantage includes diversity of properties and a limitation is the ability of targeting in live cells. Green fluorescent proteins are genetically encoded and can be covalently fused to your protein of interest. A more developed genetic tagging technique is the tetracysteine biarsenical system, which requires modification of the targeted sequence that includes four cysteines, which binds membrane-permeable biarsenical molecules, the green and the red dyes "FlAsH" and "ReAsH", with picomolar affinity. Both fluorescent proteins and biarsenical tetracysteine can be expressed in live cells, but present major limitations in ectopic expression and might cause lose of function. Giepmans shows parallel applications of targeting methods and fluorophores using GFP and tetracysteine with ReAsH for α-tubulin and β-actin, respectively. After fixation, cells were immunolabeled for the Golgi matrix with QD and for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome with Cy5.&lt;ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"/&gt;

====Protein dynamics====
Fluorescent techniques have been used assess a number of protein dynamics including protein tracking, conformational changes, protein–protein interactions, protein synthesis and turnover, and enzyme activity, among others.

Three general approaches for measuring protein net redistribution and diffusion are single-particle tracking, [[correlation spectroscopy]] and photomarking methods. In single-particle tracking, the individual molecule must be both bright and sparse enough to be tracked from one video to the other. Correlation spectroscopy analyzes the intensity fluctuations resulting from migration of fluorescent objects into and out of a small volume at the focus of a laser. In photomarking, a fluorescent protein can be dequenched in a subcellular area with the use of intense local illumination and the fate of the marked molecule can be imaged directly. Michalet and coworkers used quantum dots for single-particle tracking using biotin-quantum dots in HeLa cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalet X, Pinaud FF, Bentolila LA, Tsay JM, Doose S, Li JJ, Sundaresan G, Wu AM, Gambhir SS | title = Quantum Dots for Live Cells, in Vivo Imaging, and Diagnostics | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5709 | pages = 538–544 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15681376 | pmc = 1201471 | doi = 10.1126/science.1104274 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..538M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best ways to detect conformational changes in proteins is to sandwich said protein between two fluorophores. [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] will respond to internal conformational changes result from reorientation of the fluorophore with respect to the other. Dumbrepatil sandwiched an estrogen receptor between a CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) and a YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) to study conformational changes of the receptor upon binding of a ligand.&lt;ref name="pmid20049819"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dave SR, Gao X | title = Monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles for biodetection, imaging, and drug delivery: a versatile and evolving technology | journal = Wiley Interdiscip Rev Nanomed Nanobiotechnol | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 583–609 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20049819 | doi = 10.1002/wnan.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorophores of different colors can be applied to detect their respective antigens within the cell. If antigens are located close enough to each other, they will appear colocalized and this phenomenon is known as [[colocalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zinchuk V, Grossenbacher-Zinchuk O | title = Recent advances in quantitative colocalization analysis: Focus on neuroscience | journal = Progress in Histochemistry and Cytochemistry | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–72 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19822255 | doi = 10.1016/j.proghi.2009.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized computer software, such as [[CoLocalizer Pro]], can be used to confirm and characterize the degree of colocalization.

FRET can detect dynamic protein–protein interaction in live cells providing the fluorophores get close enough. Galperin ''et al.'' used three fluorescent proteins to study multiprotein interactions in live cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galperin E, Verkhusha VV, Sorkin A | title = Three-chromophore FRET microscopy to analyze multiprotein interactions in living cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 209–17 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15782196 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetracysteine biarsenical systems can be used to study protein synthesis and turnover, which requires discrimination of old copies from new copies. In principle, a tetracysteine-tagged protein is labeled with FlAsH for a short time, leaving green labeled proteins.  The protein synthesis is then carried out in the presence of ReAsH, labeling the new proteins as red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaietta G, Deerinck TJ, Adams SR, Bouwer J, Tour O, Laird DW, Sosinsky GE, Tsien RY, Ellisman MH | title = Multicolor and Electron Microscopic Imaging of Connexin Trafficking | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5567 | pages = 503–507 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11964472 | doi = 10.1126/science.1068793 |bibcode = 2002Sci...296..503G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also use fluorescence to see endogenous enzyme activity, typically by using a quenched [[activity based proteomics]] (qABP). Covalent binding of a qABP to the active site of the targeted enzyme will provide direct evidence concerning if the enzyme is responsible for the signal upon release of the quencher and regain of fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Terai T, Nagano T | title = Fluorescent probes for bioimaging applications | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 515–21 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18771748 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique combination of high spatial and temporal resolution, nondestructive compatibility with living cells and organisms, and molecular specificity insure that fluorescence techniques will remain central in the analysis of protein networks and systems biology.&lt;ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"/&gt;

It is sometimes necessary in [[communication]] (for example, to avoid [[accidental gap|lexical gaps]] that would cause [[untranslatability]]), but it can also be undesirable (when an uncommon or easily misunderstood [[figure of speech]] is used).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail Ramshaw|title=Liturgical Language: Keeping it Metaphoric, Making it Inclusive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8GphoHlB2wC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=29 September 2013|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-2408-1|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roundabout speech is the use of many words to describe something that already has a common and concise term (for example, saying "''a tool used for cutting things such as paper and hair''" instead of "[[scissors]]").&lt;ref name="Byrne2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Máire Byrne|title=The Names of God in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: A Basis for Interfaith Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Krnw3eHdwggC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=29 September 2013|date=8 September 2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-5356-2|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most dictionaries use circumlocution to define words. Circumlocution is often used by people with [[aphasia]] and people learning a new language, where simple terms can be paraphrased to aid learning or communication (for example, paraphrasing the word "grandfather" as "the father of one's father"). [[Euphemism]], [[innuendo]] and [[equivocation]] are different forms of circumlocution.

==Euphemism==
{{Main|Euphemism}}
''Euphemistic language'' often uses circumlocution to avoid saying words that are [[taboo]] or considered offensive. For example, "'''Holy mother of [[Jesus]]'''!" is a circumlocution of "[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]!", but "heck", while still euphemistic, is not a circumlocution of "[[hell]]".

Euphemistic circumlocution is also used to avoid saying "unlucky words"&amp;mdash;words which are taboo for reasons connected with [[superstition]]: for example, calling the [[devil]] "Old Nick",&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Speak of the devil, and he will appear" is the proverb.&lt;/ref&gt; calling [[Macbeth]] "[[the Scottish Play]]" or saying "[[baker's dozen]]" instead of [[triskaidekaphobia|thirteen]].

==Innuendo==
{{Main|Innuendo}}
''Innuendo'' refers to something suggested but not explicitly stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/innuendo |title=innuendo – definition of innuendo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivocation==
{{main|Equivocation}}
''Equivocation'' is the use of ambiguous language to avoid telling the truth or forming commitments.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary 2nd edition 2005 by Oxford University Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Banque de France]] has announced the opening of the '''Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie''' during a press conference held by Governor [[Christian Noyer]], on May 25, 2011. Its opening is programmed for the end of 2014.

This educational place aims at explaining the economy and its concepts to the general public; it will be hosted in the [[Hotel Gaillard]], located at 1, Place du General Catroux, in the 17th district in [[Paris]].

==The project==

[[File:Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.jpg|thumb|alt=Grand lobby of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie|Grand Lobby of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie, architectural and museographic contest, 2011.]]

This place will invite the general public to discover economics, to tackle issues often met in everyday life, or to allow a better understanding of worldwide events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citedeleconomie.fr/IMG/pdf/Discours_C_Noyer_conf_presse_2505.pdf Banque de France Governor Christian Noyer's speech]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Press conference, May 25th, 2011 : Launching of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie project&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie will inter alia address teachers and their students, to help illustrate concepts studied at school (indeed half of the 100 000 annual visitors expected should be of school age).&lt;ref&gt;Banque de France press release [http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/communiques/2011/cite-economie-monnaie.htm "''Un grand projet pour un lieu unique : Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie'']", May 25th, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is launched by the [[Banque de France]], which collaborates with several partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/telechar/communiques/dossier-presse-CEM.pdf Press kit: Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among those partners:

* The [[Ministry of National Education (France)]] supports the project and has delegated several teachers to help on the content of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The museums of other Central Banks which already exist, like those of the [[European Union]] or the [[Interactive Museum of Economics]] (MIDE), in Mexico.
* Universcience, and especially the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] : [[Christian Noyer]], Governor of the [[Banque de France]], and [[Claudie Haigneré]], head of Universcience, have signed a cooperation agreement on the museography of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The ''Institut pour l'Education Financière du Public'', with whom a partnership has been concluded in late 2010.
* The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]](BnF) : Governor [[Christian Noyer]] and President of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [[Bruno Racine]] have signed a cooperation agreement on January 3, 2012, regarding the presentation of coin and banknote collections in the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The Rencontres des SES : initiative developed by the [[:fr:Académie de Paris|Académie de Paris]], where 11th grade students studying Economics and Social Sciences are invited to meet economists, in order to discuss themes linked to current issues.
* The Little Conferences of the [[:fr:Nouveau Théâtre de Montreuil|Nouveau Théâtre de Montreuil]] : a partnership with the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie was announced on February 11, 2012, during [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] (former [[Banque de France]] Governor and former President of the [[European Central Bank]])'s conference on the history of money. The partnership is developed around their shared objective of increasing young people's access to knowledge.

==The building==

The Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie will be hosted in the [[Hotel Gaillard]], located at 1, Place du Général Catroux, in the 17th district in [[Paris]].

This neo-gothic mansion has been realized by architect Jules Février at request of Emile Gaillard, banker from the city of [[Grenoble]] and amateur and collector of [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] art. The [[Hotel Gaillard]] was sold to the [[Banque de France]] in 1919.

From 1919 to 1921, architectural works have been directed by architect Alphonse Defrasse for the [[Banque de France]], especially the building of a steel structure which housed the cashier's desks and other services to the visitors. He also imagined the impressive strong room which could be accessed by a lift bridge, over two-meters-deep moats.&lt;ref&gt;Historical study on the Hotel Gaillard, led by the ''Groupe de Recherche Art Histoire Architecture et Littérature'' (GRAHAL), on request of the Banque de France.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hôtel Gaillard - Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie - travaux Grand Hall 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Grand Lobby construction|Grand Lobby construction works, conceived by the architect Alphonse Defrasse, 1921]]

Listed as a historic monument in 1999, this branch closed in 2006, as a consequence of the plan to close half of the [[Banque de France]]'s branches on the French territory.

==The architectural contest==

The project of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie was the object of an architectural contest. Over 100 teams of architects and museographers have participated in this contest which aimed at transforming this former branch of the Banque de France in an educational Cité, while respecting the architecture of the building which is listed as historic monument.

The team of architects – museographers was selected by the [[Banque de France]] amongst the six final projects chosen by the jury of the contest. The team is made of Ateliers Lion for the architecture, François Confino for the museography, and Eric Pallot as architect in charge of historic monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/telechar/communiques/dossier-presse-CEM.pdf Press kit: Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The College of Wooster''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Wooster, Ohio]]. It is primarily known for its emphasis on mentored undergraduate research and enrolls approximately 2,000 students. Founded in 1866 by the [[Presbyterian]] Church as the University of Wooster, it officially has been non-sectarian since 1969, when ownership ties with the Presbyterian Church ended. From its creation, the college has been a [[coeducation|co-educational]] institution. The school is a member of The [[Five Colleges of Ohio]], [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]], and the [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]]. As of December 31, 2017, Wooster's endowment stood at $311 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wooster.edu/about/facts&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooster is one of forty colleges named in [[Loren Pope]]'s book ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]'', in which he called it his "original best-kept secret in higher education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Loren |last=Pope |title=Colleges that Change Lives |url=http://www.ctcl.com/colleges/wooster/index.htm |publisher=ctcl.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128203814/http://www.ctcl.com/colleges/wooster/index.htm |archivedate=2006-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is consistently ranked among the nation's top liberal arts colleges, according to [[U.S. News and World Report]].  In US News' "Best Colleges 2018", for the sixteenth year in a row, Wooster is recognized for its “outstanding” undergraduate research opportunities and its senior capstone program, the  {{small|I.S.}} (Independent Study). 

==History==
[[File:University of Wooster, Ohio, c1867.jpg|thumb|200px|left|University of Wooster, lithograph, c1867]]
Founded as '''The University of Wooster''' in 1866 by [[Presbyterians]], the institution opened its doors in 1870 with a faculty of five and a student body of thirty men and four women. Wealthy Wooster citizen Ephraim Quinby donated the first {{convert|22|acre}}, a large oak grove situated on a hilltop overlooking the town.  After being founded with the intent to make Wooster open to everyone, the university's first Ph.D. was granted to a woman, Annie B. Irish, in 1882.  The first black student, Clarence Allen, began his studies later in the same decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wooster.edu/About-Wooster/History-Traditions|title=Official website: Our history &amp; traditions|accessdate=2011-08-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826055604/http://www.wooster.edu/About-Wooster/History-Traditions|archivedate=2011-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rumored that when the college was founded, it was gifted a mummy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-daily-record.com/living/2005/09/18/egyptian-mummy-is-the-centerpiece-of-college-of-wooster-art-exhibit| title=Egyptian Mummy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the head of [[Nat Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/longform/skullduggery-nat-turner-skull/| title=Mystery of Nat Turner's missing head}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the mummy is still located on campus, at the basement of the art center, the head of Nat Turner was lost in Old Main after a fire broke out.

In the pre-dawn hours of December 11, 1901, a fire destroyed the five-story Old Main building, the centerpiece of the campus.  Within two years, it was replaced by several new buildings which (after substantial renovations within the last 30 years) remain the primary structures for the classes, labs, and faculty offices.  These include Kauke Hall (the center of campus), Scovel Hall, Severance Hall (which together form a large courtyard in front of Kauke Hall), and Taylor Hall.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

About ten years after the fire and rebuilding, there were eight divisions, including a medical school whose faculty outnumbered those in the college of arts and sciences. However, the university had gradually begun to define itself as a liberal arts institution and, in 1915, after a bitter dispute between the faculty and the Trustees, chose to become The College of Wooster in order to devote itself entirely to the education of undergraduate students in the liberal arts. The enrollment of the college is kept intentionally small, around 2000 students, to allow for close interaction between faculty and students.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

In the 1920s, during the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy|clashes between liberal and fundamentalists]], [[William Jennings Bryan]], a prominent Presbyterian layman, and former [[United States Secretary of State]], attacked the college for its teaching of evolution. The subject had been taught at the college for several decades and defended by then president [[Charles F. Wishart]]. Bryan called for the General Assembly of the church to cut off funding to the college. But in 1923 Wishart defeated Bryan for the position of [[Moderator of the General Assembly]] largely on the evolution issue, and the college continued to teach evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Tait |first = L.

The {{convert|240|acre|ha|adj=on}} college has a tree endowment, established in 1987, which supports tree conservation, maintenance, and a tree replacement program.   The Oak Grove, a pleasant green space near the center of campus, plays host to commencement ceremonies each May.  Several of the Grove's trees are older than the college itself, including an eastern black oak near Galpin Hall that dates to 1681, as well as a 1766 white oak.  Each senior class plants a class tree in the Oak Grove on the day before graduation.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

On November 10, 2015, the College named [[Sarah Bolton (physicist)|Sarah Bolton]] as its 12th president, and first female president. Her term began July 1, 2016. Bolton was a dean and physics professor at [[Williams College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sarah Bolton named 12th president of The College of Wooster {{!}} The College of Wooster |url=http://wooster.edu/news/releases/2015/november/president-bolton/ |website=wooster.edu |accessdate=2015-12-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202181205/http://wooster.edu/news/releases/2015/november/president-bolton/ |dead-url=no |archivedate=2015-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
[[Image:COWkaukehall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Kauke Hall is the main academic building on campus]]
Upon completion of at least 32 courses, students may earn a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Music Education degree.

In addition to the programs listed below, students may design their own major with approval from the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and the Provost. Some of the pre-professional programs are cooperative ones in which students spend a certain period of time at the College of Wooster before transferring to accelerated courses at other colleges and universities.

===Independent Study program===
The College of Wooster also has an Independent Study program, in which all students work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to complete a written [[thesis]] or other significant project during the course of the senior year, usually about 50 to 100 pages in length.&lt;ref name=twsAprWab&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student also presents an oral defense of the thesis before a faculty committee.  The program, begun in 1947 by Howard Lowry (the college's 7th President), has received attention from other colleges and universities, and a number of other institutions have modeled programs after it. In 2003, the independent study program at Wooster was recognized by ''[[US News and World Report]]'' as the second best 'senior capstone experience' in the US, behind only [[Princeton University]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.  Wooster ranks 14th in the United States among independent colleges whose graduates earned Ph.D.s between 1920 and 1995 (according to the Baccalaureate Origins of Doctorate Recipients, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/CollegeRelations/BacOrigins/bacorigins.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215122033/http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/CollegeRelations/BacOrigins/bacorigins.html |archivedate=December 15, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation and completion of the thesis can be time consuming, and led to one view in which a student, writing in the weekly ''The Wooster Voice'', suggested that the independent study program be interwoven with career planning as well as applications to graduate schools.&lt;ref name=twsAprWtr&gt;{{cite news

Special traditions have been developed surrounding Independent Study. Upon completion, a student receives a yellow button saying 'I did it!' as well as the highly coveted [[Tootsie Roll]].&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; The tradition began in 1974&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; when the registrar at the time, Lee Culp (also a graduate of the College of Wooster), gave out candy along with the buttons one year; the Tootsie Roll itself was chosen simply because it was cheap to buy in bulk. Beginning in 1989, buttons were given out to indicate the order in which theses had been handed in.&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; The 'due date,' or the last day that students can turn in their completed Independent Study project, is the first Monday after spring break. On I.S. Monday, the [[pipe band]] strikes up including drums and trumpets,&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; and with the Provost leading the way, the seniors march through the Kauke Arch in a jubilant parade, described by one professor as a "celebration of both scholarship and survival", ending at Kittredge dining hall, where a celebratory dinner with advisors and college administrators follows.

===Libraries===
The College of Wooster Libraries consists of three branches (Andrews Library, The Flo K. Gault Library and The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall) and a music library located at the Scheide Music Center. Andrews Library, the largest library in the system, houses more than 850,000 volumes and can accommodate over 500 readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrews Library - College of Wooster Campus Tour |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/admissions/campustour/library.php |publisher=Wooster.edu |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909181328/http://www.wooster.edu/admissions/campustour/library.php |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews Library houses the college's Special Collections, media library and the student writing center. The Flo K. Gault Library, built as an addition to Andrews Library in 1995, primarily serves as a place for class seniors to work on their Independent Study projects. The Gault Library contains carrels devoted to Independent Study for every senior student of the humanities and social sciences. The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall (1900, 1998), which is the oldest branch in the system, served as the original academic library for the college from 1900 to 1962. After three decades as an art museum, the building reopened as the science library in 1998, with substantial funding from the Timken Foundation of Canton, Ohio, and now primarily serves students in the math and sciences departments. The library provides Independent Study carrels for math and science seniors.

* '''CONSORT:''' The College of Wooster became a founding member of the Five Colleges of Ohio Consortium in 1996. The College of Wooster merged its library catalogue with [[Denison University]], [[Kenyon College]] and [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] to form the [[CONSORT Colleges|CONSORT]] library system. The CONSORT library system provides its patrons access to the combined holdings of all four colleges.
* '''OhioLINK:''' CONSORT is a member of [[OhioLINK]], a statewide consortium of academic libraries as well as the State Library of Ohio, which agreed to make their collections available to library patrons within this network. CONSORT's membership into OhioLink gives its patrons immediate access to a collection of books, online journals and databases that rivals the largest academic libraries in the country. The OhioLINK catalogue represents 89 libraries in the state and lists nearly 11.5 million unique titles from total holdings of 48 million items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is OhioLINK |url=http://www.ohiolink.edu/about/what-is-ol.html |publisher=Ohiolink.edu |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206205827/http://www.ohiolink.edu/about/what-is-ol.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art Museum===
The College of Wooster Art Museum was established in the 1930s as a small gallery to facilitate the teaching of art and art research at the college. The current museum was established at the Ebert Art Center in 1997. The museum houses two small galleries, the Charlene Derge Sussel Art Gallery and the Burton D. Morgan Gallery, as well as storage for the college's permanent art collection. The museum's encyclopedic collection spans from ancient to contemporary art. Permanent collections include the John Taylor Arms Print Collection - which represents works by [[Edward Hopper]], [[Winslow Homer]], [[Isabel Bishop]], [[Martin Lewis (artist)|Martin Lewis]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]] and [[Félix Bracquemond]] - the William C. Mithoefer Collection of African Art, Middle Eastern pottery and Chinese decorative art.

==Student life==

===Residence life===

The College of Wooster is a residential campus and has 16 residence halls, which house 16 to 270 students each, and 30 program houses that 99% of the student body live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residences|url=http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=22 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104105228/http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residence halls include Andrews Hall, Armington Hall, Babcock Hall, Bissman Hall, Bornhuetter Hall, Brush Hall, Compton Hall, Douglass Hall, Gault Manor, Gault Schoolhouse, Holden Hall, Kenarden Lodge, Luce Hall, Stevenson Hall, and Wagner Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halls|url=http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/halls/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=21 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020124652/http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/halls/|archivedate=20 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International presence===
Elias Compton, former dean of the College, founded the Wooster in India program during the 1930s, which established a sister school relationship with [[Ewing Christian College]] in [[Allahabad, India]]. Over a forty-year time span, Wooster sent several former students to serve as Head Resident at Ewing while Ewing faculty were brought to Wooster as Ewing Fellows; a plaque with the names of Ewing Fellows hangs in Babcock Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Education Week {{pipe}} Cosmos |date=October 2008 |volume=22 Issue 3 |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/oisa/COSMOS/2008-09/november.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Wooster.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209072013/http://www.wooster.edu/oisa/COSMOS/2008-09/november.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wooster in India program helped build this unique bond between Wooster and India that enhanced the exchange of students, ideas and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Thewoostervoice.com |title=International Insight |url=http://thewoostervoice.com/2009/08/international-insight-3/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208232922/http://thewoostervoice.com/2009/08/international-insight-3/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-12-08 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This international presence affected the entire campus, establishing a tradition which continues to influence the College. Today, approximately six percent of the student body is international in origin, representing more than 30 different countries.&lt;ref name='wooster.edu'/&gt; The College offers majors in Cultural Area Studies and International Relations, instruction in seven foreign languages and opportunities to study abroad in 60 countries. Fifty-nine percent of Wooster students are from outside of Ohio.&lt;ref name='wooster.edu'/&gt;

* '''Luce Residence Hall''': Luce Hall houses six language suites (Chinese, Classics, French, German, Spanish &amp; Russian) providing students with a living/learning environment focusing on developing foreign language skills. The building features submarine-inspired architectural details, like a winding floorplan and porthole windows.

===Athletics===
Wooster's athletic history dates back to its first baseball team, in 1880, which played only one game, losing 12-2 to [[Kenyon College]].  The football program was established in 1889; over its first two seasons, the team won all seven games it played, by a total score of 306-4.  Included was a 64-0 victory at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] on November 1, 1890, in the Buckeyes' first-ever home football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=12442 |title=Site of First Ohio State Home Football Game / The Ohio State University First Football Team 1890 Marker |publisher=Hmdb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, intercollegiate sports were banned by the College President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/archives/history.php |title=Athletics - College of Wooster |publisher=Athletics.wooster.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602063939/http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/archives/history.php |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After varsity athletics returned in 1901, Wooster became an early member of the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]]  (OAC).  In 1983, Wooster (along with the rest of the [[Five Colleges of Ohio|Ohio Five]]) broke away from the OAC to form the [[North Coast Athletic Conference]] (NCAC).  The NCAC, which competes at the non-scholarship [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] level of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], was founded primarily on the principle of offering women equal opportunity to participate in varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northcoast.org/history.html |title=NCAC History |publisher=Northcoast.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607184750/http://www.northcoast.org/history.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its first season of competition, 1984–85, the NCAC sponsored 21 sports, eleven for men and ten for women.  Women's softball was added in 1998, and women's golf in 2010, giving the NCAC its current 23 sports.  Wooster fields varsity athletic teams in all 23 of these sports.

====Scottish heritage====
Wooster's school colors are black and old gold, and its mascot is the 'Fighting [[Scottish ethnicity|Scot]]'.  Early Wooster teams were known as the Presbyterians, or unofficially as the 'Presbyterian Steamroller', due to the football team's success.&lt;ref&gt;The Presbyterian church in America is descended from the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1939, a large donation from alumnus Birt Babcock funded the purchase of kilts for the marching band, in the yellow-and-black [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeod]] tartan (MacLeod of Lewis), which had no particular significance, except that it matched the school colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.wooster.edu/traditions/kilts.php |title=Admissions &amp; Financial Aid - College of Wooster |publisher=Admissions.wooster.edu |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509172602/http://admissions.wooster.edu/traditions/kilts.php |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scotland|Scottish]] culture eventually became an important part of the school's heritage; today, the [[American football|football]] games feature a Scottish [[pipe band]] with Highland dancers in addition to a traditional marching band, with all three groups clad in the MacLeod tartan.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} The college offers the "Scottish Arts Scholarship" for students who perform as pipers, drummers, or Scottish dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Arts Scholarship|url=http://www.wooster.edu/admissions/scholarships/scottish/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baseball====
The baseball team has made five appearances in the [[NCAA Division III Baseball Championship|NCAA Division III World Series]], including second-place finishes in 2009 and 1997.  Wooster has made 23 appearances in the NCAA baseball tournament under head coach Tim Pettorini, who has led the Scots since 1982. Pettorini has guided the Scots to over 1,100 victories, placing him in the all-time top ten among D-III baseball coaches, and the winningest active coach as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/baseball_RB/2016/coach.pdf|title=NCAA Baseball Coaching Records|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scots have also won a conference-record seventeen NCAC championships, most recently in 2017, under Pettorini.  Prior to Pettorini's tenure, Bob Morgan led the Scots to the NCAA tournament in each of his final five seasons, giving Wooster a total of 25 appearances since the event began in 1976.  During the first decade of the 21st century, the Scots had a record of 372-98, winning more games than any other team in Division III, and were second in winning percentage over that span, trailing only  [[The College of St. Scholastica]].  Following his graduation in 2010, All-American second baseman Matthew Johnson signed with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] organization, and played for four seasons in their minor-league system.

====Basketball====
Long-time head men's basketball coach Steve Moore has won over 700 games at Wooster, and in 2017 became the second-winningest coach all-time in NCAA Division III.  His teams have won 17 NCAC championships and have made 24 appearances in the [[NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northcoast.org/mb/mballtime.pdf |title=North Coast Athletic Conference : Men's Basketball All-Time Standings |publisher=Northcoast.org |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326150528/http://www.northcoast.org/mb/mballtime.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a record 14 in a row from 2003 through 2016. The team reached the national semifinals ("Final Four") of the NCAA D-III Tournament in 2003, 2007, and 2011.  The 2011 team set a school record for victories, with a record of 31-3, and reached the national championship game before falling to [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|St. Thomas (Minnesota)]].  The 2003 team was close behind at 30-3, with center Bryan Nelson named D-III Men's Basketball Player of the Year.  Home games are contested in the 3,400-seat Timken Gym,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woosterathletics.com/facilities/files/timken.html |title=College of Wooster Athletics : Timken Gymnasium |publisher=Woosterathletics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is often filled to capacity for big games, including the rivalry contest with [[Wittenberg University]] and post-season tournaments.  Since 2000, the Scots have been in the top ten in D-III basketball attendance every year, ranking 2nd in some seasons, with over 2,000 fans per home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/Reports/attend/2011.pdf|title=2011 NCAA MEN’S BASKETBALL ATTENDANCE|publisher=[[NCAA]]|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Football====
The University of Wooster scored the first touchdown in the state of Ohio against Denison University in 1888 and was a football powerhouse in Ohio. [[Charles Follis]], the first black professional football player, attended the University of Wooster and starred on the baseball team before signing with the Shelby Athletic Club to play professional football in 1902. Wooster was the last State of Ohio team not to be beaten by Ohio State, when it tied the Buckeyes at home on November 1, 1924. (as of 2018)
The football team's greatest success occurred between 1916 and 1934; during this era, Wooster had a record of 118-31-12,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/results/1900.php |title=Athletics - College of Wooster |publisher=Athletics.wooster.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008042459/http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/results/1900.php |archivedate=2008-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and won four outright OAC championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.org/documents/2008FBGuidecb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611072809/http://www.oac.org/documents/2008FBGuidecb.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1934 title would be the Scots' last outright conference championship for 70 years, with only a trio of shared conference titles (1959/1970 OAC and 1997 NCAC) during that time.  In 2004, the team recorded a perfect 10-0 regular season and won its first outright NCAC conference championship, as well as its first  [[NCAA Division III National Football Championship|NCAA D-III football tournament]] game.  The 2004 team was led by senior All-American running back Tony Sutton, who set multiple NCAA Division III career rushing records and was a 2014 finalist for the Gagliardi Trophy, the D-III equivalent of the [[Heisman Trophy]].   From 1995 through 2008, Wooster's record was 99-43, making this the most successful era since [[World War II]].  In 2009, lights and artificial turf were added to the Scots' 4,500-seat John Papp stadium.  The first-ever nighttime football game at Wooster was played on October 10, 2009, against [[Case Western Reserve University]], with Case retaining the [[Baird Brothers Trophy]] by virtue of a 53-32 victory over the Scots.

====Other sports====
In the early 21st century, the women's field hockey and women's lacrosse teams each won their multiple NCAC championships, earning automatic bids to their national NCAA D-III tournaments.  The only national championship won by a Wooster athletic team came in 1975, when the men's golf team won the NCAA D-III title.

====Academic All-Americans====
Since 2000, Scots have been named Academic All-Americans 32 times by [[College Sports Information Directors of America]], in the College division, which includes NCAA Division II and Division III institutions, as well as NAIA schools, a total of over 1000 colleges.

===Performing arts===
Wooster is the home of the [[Ohio Light Opera]], an enterprise founded within the college in 1979, but not part of the college curriculum. It is the only professional company in the United States entirely devoted to [[operetta]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. OLO performs the entire [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] repertoire, but also regularly revives rarely performed continental works of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Over the years, the Company has produced eighty different operettas.

Wooster's performing ensembles include the Wooster Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1915 by Daniel Parmelee, then Professor of Violin at the college. The orchestra currently is the second-oldest orchestra in continuous performance in the state of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wooster.edu/Academics/Areas-of-Study/Music/Ensembles/Orchestra |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525193416/http://www.wooster.edu/Academics/Areas-of-Study/Music/Ensembles/Orchestra |archivedate=May 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional ensembles include the Scot Symphonic and Marching Bands, the Wooster Chorus, and the Wooster Jazz Ensemble.

Wooster has an active on-campus pipe band. Officially called the College of Wooster Pipe Band, members perform at many official on-campus events such as commencement, sports games (football, basketball, swim meets, and sometimes lacrosse games) and many spontaneous student-run events. During the spring season they perform and compete at a grade 3 level, having won prizes at the Scots wi' Shotts event in Cleveland hosted by the local Lochaber Pipe Band.  The Pipe Band also placed first in the grade 3 contest at the 2009 Toronto Indoor Highland Games, as the only American band competing.

The College's department of Theatre and Dance produces two dance concerts per year, a fall concert in the round, and a spring concert in a more formal proscenium setting.  Additionally, the college produces at least two plays each academic year.  Further plays are produced by student groups and seniors pursuing their Independent Study projects.  In 2007, Wooster's theatre production of 'Nocturne' was invited to perform at the Kennedy Center's American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C. Wooster's production was one of four shows chosen from a field of approximately 400 entries.

===Student activities and clubs===
The College of Wooster has over one hundred student organizations, from the Jenny Investment Club, which allows students to invest real money for the college as they learn about the stock market, to Common Grounds, a student-run coffee shop and house program offering 'an alternative atmosphere to the partying scene' for the college community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wooster.edu/commongrounds/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030910134443/http://www.wooster.edu/commongrounds/index.html |archivedate=September 10, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently ten active Greek groups at the College of Wooster, six sororities and four fraternities.  Called ''clubs'' and ''sections'', these groups are not affiliated with national Greek organizations, and approximately fifteen percent of the student body participates.

The college has a wide variety of student-run media. ''The Wooster Voice'' is the weekly student newspaper with a newly launched website, and has been published continuously since 1886 (see [[list of college newspapers]]), while [[WCWS]] (WOO 91) is the college radio station. ''The Goliard'' is the annual literary magazine. Each year, English professor Daniel Bourne also publishes an international literary magazine called ''Artful Dodge''. Additionally, the English Department has classes every two years on journalism and magazine writing; these students create and publish a newspaper and a magazine respectively.
 
The college also has a successful [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate Frisbee]] program. The Women's team, Betty Gone Wild, won USAUltimate's D-III College Championship Sectionals in 2014 and 2015. Also in 2014 and 2015 they came in 2nd at USAUltimate's D-III College Championship Regionals. They attended the National College Championship in 2014 and came in 15th place with a 1st place award in spirit.

The college is well known for its Moot Court team as part of the American Moot Court Association, and is currently ranked second in the nation by the ACMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmamootcourt.org/top-programs-in-intercollegiate-moot-court|title=Top Programs in Intercollegiate Moot Court|website=www.acmamootcourt.org|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the teams regional championships, the College routinely qualifies teams to the Moot Court Nationals tournament and was the 2008 National Champion. In 2017, Wooster qualified five teams to the nationals tournament and had teams finish 12th, 16th, and 18th in oral argument, 13th and 14th in oration, and third in appellate brief writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmamootcourt.org/results|title=Results|website=www.acmamootcourt.org|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is led by professor of political theory Desiree Weber and professor emeritus and President of the ACMA Mark Weaver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wooster.edu/academics/areas/pre-law/moot-court/tournament/|title=Regional Tournament Information {{!}} The College of Wooster|website=www.wooster.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colored dissolved organic matter''' (CDOM) is the optically measurable component of dissolved [[organic matter]] in water.

CDOM most strongly absorbs short wavelength light ranging from blue to [[ultraviolet]], whereas pure water absorbs longer wavelength red light. Therefore, water with little or no CDOM, such as the open ocean, appears blue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/living-ocean/ocean-color|title=Ocean Color|last=|first=|date=|website=NASA Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Waters containing high amounts of CDOM can range from brown, as in many rivers, to yellow and yellow-brown in coastal waters. In general, CDOM concentrations are much higher in fresh waters and estuaries than in the open ocean, though concentrations are highly variable.

== Significance ==
[[File:Sediment off the Carolinas on October 9, 2016.jpg|thumb|Variations in the concentration of colored dissolved organic matter can even be seen from space. The dark brown water in the inland waterways contains high concentrations of CDOM. As this dark, CDOM-rich water moves offshore, it mixes with the low CDOM, blue ocean water from offshore.]]
The concentration of CDOM can have a significant effect on biological activity in aquatic systems. CDOM diminishes light intensity as it penetrates water. Very high concentrations of CDOM can have a limiting effect on [[photosynthesis]] and inhibit the growth of [[phytoplankton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stedmon|first=C.A.|last2=Markager|first2=S.|last3=Kaas|first3=H.|date=2000|title=Optical properties and signatures of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Danish coastal waters|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771400906450|journal=Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science|volume=51|pages=267-278|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which form the basis of oceanic [[food chains]] and are a primary source of atmospheric [[oxygen]]. CDOM also absorbs harmful UVA/B radiation, protecting organisms from DNA damage.

Absorption of UV radiation causes CDOM to "bleach", reducing its optical density and absorptive capacity. This bleaching (photodegradation) of CDOM produces low-molecular-weight organic compounds which may be utilized by microbes, release nutrients that may be used by phytoplankton as a nutrient source for growth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=John R.|last2=Stubbins|first2=Aaron|last3=Perdue|first3=E.

CDOM can be detected and measured from space using satellite [[remote sensing]] and often interferes with the use of satellite [[spectrometer]]s to remotely estimate phytoplankton populations. As a pigment necessary for photosynthesis, [[chlorophyll]] is a key indicator of the phytoplankton abundance. However, CDOM and chlorophyll both absorb light in the same spectral range so it is often difficult to differentiate between the two.

Although variations in CDOM are primarily the result of natural processes including changes in the amount and frequency of precipitation, human activities such as logging, agriculture, effluent discharge, and wetland drainage can affect CDOM levels in fresh water and estuarine systems.

'''Comic opera''' denotes a sung dramatic work of a light or comic nature, usually with a happy ending.

Forms of comic opera first developed in late 17th-century Italy. By the 1730s, a new operatic genre, ''[[opera buffa]]'', emerged as an alternative to ''[[opera seria]]''. It quickly made its way to France, where it became ''[[opéra bouffon]]'', and eventually, in the following century, [[Operetta#Operetta in French|French ''operetta'']], with [[Jacques Offenbach]] as its most accomplished practitioner.

The influence of the Italian and French forms spread to other parts of Europe. Many countries developed their own genres of comic opera, incorporating the Italian and French models along with their own musical traditions. Examples include Viennese ''operetta'', German ''[[singspiel]]'', Spanish ''[[zarzuela]]'', Russian comic opera, English ''[[ballad opera]]'', and ''[[Savoy Opera]]''.

==Italian comic opera==
{{See also|Opera buffa}}

In late 17th-century Italy, light-hearted musical plays began to be offered as an alternative to weightier ''opera seria'' (17th-century Italian opera based on [[classical mythology]]). ''[[Il Trespolo tutore]]'' (1679) by [[Alessandro Stradella]] (1639&amp;ndash;1682) was an early precursor of ''opera buffa''. The opera has a farcical plot, and the characters of the ridiculous guardian Trespolo and the maid Despina are prototypes of characters widely used later in the ''opera buffa'' genre.

The form began to flourish in Naples with [[Alessandro Scarlatti]]'s ''Il trionfo dell'onore'' (1718). At first written in Neapolitan dialect, these works became "Italianized" with the operas of Scarlatti, [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]] (''[[La serva padrona]]'', 1733), [[Niccolò Piccinni|Piccinni]] (''[[La Cecchina]]'', 1760), [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]] (''[[Nina (opera)|Nina]]'', 1789), [[Domenico Cimarosa|Cimarosa]] (''[[Il matrimonio segreto]]'', 1792), and then the great comic operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and, later, [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]].

At first, comic operas were generally presented as intermezzi between acts of more serious works. Neapolitan and then Italian comic opera grew into an independent form and became the most popular form of staged entertainment in Italy from about 1750 to 1800. In 1749, thirteen years after Pergolesi's death, his ''La serva padrona'' swept Italy and France, evoking the praise of such [[French Enlightenment]] luminaries as [[Rousseau]].

In 1760, [[Niccolò Piccinni]] wrote the music to ''[[La buona figliuola|La Cecchina]]'' to a text by the great Venetian playwright, [[Carlo Goldoni]]. That text was based on [[Samuel Richardson]]'s popular English novel, ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740). Many years later, [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] called ''La Cecchina'' the "first true Italian comic opera" &amp;ndash; that is to say, it had everything: it was in standard Italian and not in dialect; it was no longer simply an intermezzo, but rather an independent piece; it had a real story that people liked; it had dramatic variety; and, musically, it had strong melodies and even strong supporting orchestral parts, including a strong "stand-alone" overture (i.e., you could even enjoy the overture as an independent orchestral piece). Verdi was also enthusiastic because the music was by a southern Italian and the text by a northerner, which appealed to Verdi's pan-Italian vision.

The genre was developed further in the 19th century by [[Gioachino Rossini]] in his masterpieces such as ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' (1816) and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' (1817).

== French ''opéra comique'' and ''opérette''==
{{See also|Opéra comique|operetta}}
French composers eagerly seized upon the Italian model and made it their own, calling it ''opéra comique''. Early proponents included [[François-Adrien Boïeldieu]] (1775&amp;ndash;1834), [[Daniel-François-Esprit Auber|Daniel François Auber]] (1782&amp;ndash;1871) and [[Adolphe Adam]] (1803&amp;ndash;1856). Although originally reserved for less serious works, the term ''opéra comique'' came to refer to any opera that included spoken dialogue, including works such as [[Cherubini|Cherubini's]] ''[[Médée (Cherubini)|Médée]]'' and [[Bizet|Bizet's]] ''[[Carmen]]'' that are not "comic" in any sense of the word.

[[Hervé (composer)|Florimond Hervé]] (1825&amp;ndash;1892) is credited as the inventor of French ''[[opéra bouffe]]'', or ''[[opérette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/french/operette001.html Operette001] at Theatrehistory.com, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the same model, Jacques Offenbach (1819&amp;ndash;1880) quickly surpassed him, writing over ninety [[operetta]]s. Whereas earlier French comic operas had a mixture of sentiment and humour, Offenbach's works were intended solely to amuse. Though generally well crafted and full of humorous satire and grand opera parodies, plots and characters in his works were often interchangeable. Given the frenetic pace at which he worked, Offenbach sometimes used the same material in more than one opera.  Another Frenchman who took up this form was [[Charles Lecocq]] (1832&amp;ndash;1918).

== German ''singspiel'' and Viennese ''operetta'' ==
{{See also|Singspiel|operetta}}

The [[singspiel]] developed in 18th-century Vienna and spread throughout Austria and Germany. As in the French ''opéra comique'', the ''singspiel'' was an opera with spoken dialogue, and usually a comic subject, such as [[Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail ]]'' (1782). Later ''singspiels'', such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] ''[[Fidelio]]'' and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber's]] ''[[Der Freischütz]]'', retained the form, but explored more serious subjects.

19th century Viennese ''[[operetta]]'' was built on both the ''singspiel'' and the French model. [[Franz von Suppé]] (1819&amp;ndash;1895) is remembered mainly for his ''overtures''. [[Johann Strauss II]] (1825&amp;ndash;1899), the "waltz king", contributed ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' (1874) and ''[[The Gypsy Baron]]'' (1885).  [[Carl Millöcker]] (1842–1899) a long-time conductor at the [[Theater an der Wien]], also composed some of the most popular Viennese operettas of the late 19th century, including ''[[Der Bettelstudent]]'' (1882), ''[[Gasparone]]'' (1884) and ''Der arme Jonathan'' (1890).

After the turn of the 20th century, [[Franz Lehár]] (1870&amp;ndash;1948) wrote ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1905); and [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]] (1870&amp;ndash;1954) supplied ''[[Ein Walzertraum]]'' ("A Waltz Dream", 1907) and ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'' (1908).

== Spanish ''zarzuela'' ==
{{See also|Zarzuela}}

Zarzuela, introduced in [[Spain]] in the 17th century, is rooted in popular Spanish traditional musical theatre.  It alternates between spoken and sung scenes, the latter incorporating dances, with chorus numbers and humorous scenes that are usually duets.  These works are relatively short, and ticket prices were often low, to appeal to the general public.   There are two main forms of zarzuela: Baroque zarzuela (c. 1630–1750), the earliest style, and Romantic zarzuela (c. 1850–1950), which can be further divided into the two subgenres of ''género grande'' and [[género chico]].

[[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] was the first playwright to adopt the term zarzuela for his work entitled ''El golfo de las sirenas'' ("The Gulf of the Sirens", 1657).  [[Lope de Vega]] soon wrote a work titled ''La selva sin amor, drama con orquesta'' ("The Loveless Jungle, A Drama with Orchestra").  The instruments orchestra was hidden from the audience, the actors sang in harmony, and the musical composition itself was intended to evoke an emotional response.  Some of these early pieces were lost, but ''Los celos hacen estrellas'' ("Jealousies Turn Into Stars") by [[Juan Hidalgo de Polanco|Juan Hidalgo]] and Juan Vélez, which premiered in 1672, survives and gives us some sense of what the genre was like in the 17th century.

In the 18th century, the Italian operatic style influenced Zarzuela.  But beginning with the reign of Bourbon King Charles III, anti-Italian sentiment increased.  Zarzuela returned to its roots in popular Spanish tradition in works such as the sainetes (or Entr'actes) of Don Ramón de la Cruz. This author's first work in this genre was ''Las segadoras de Vallecas'' ("The Reapers of Vallecas", 1768), with music by [[Antonio Rodríguez de Hita|Rodríguez de Hita]].

Single act zarzuelas were classified as género chico (the "little genre" or "little form") and zarzuelas of three or more acts were género grande (the "big genre" or "big form"). Zarzuela grande battled on at the Teatro de la Zarzuela de Madrid, but with little success and light attendance. In spite of this, in 1873 a new theater, the [[Teatro Apolo (Madrid)|Teatro Apolo]], was opened for zarzuela grande, which shared the failures of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, until it was forced to change its program to género chico.

== English light opera ==
{{See also|Ballad opera|Savoy opera}}

England traces its light opera tradition to the [[ballad opera]], typically a comic play that incorporated songs set to popular tunes. [[John Gay|John Gay's]] ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' was the earliest and most popular of these. [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Brinsley Sheridan's]] ''[[The Duenna]]'' (1775), with a score by [[Thomas Linley the younger|Thomas Linley]], was expressly described as "a comic opera".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iment.com/maida/familytree/henry/music/duenna.htm "The Duenna"], Mary S. Van Deusen, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-musop.html "The Origins of Comic Opera"] at the stagebeauty website, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the 19th century, the London musical stage was dominated by [[pantomime]] and [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]], as well as bawdy, badly translated continental operettas, often including "ballets" featuring much prurient interest, and visiting the theatre became distasteful to the respectable public, especially women and children.  Mr. and Mrs. [[Thomas German Reed]], beginning in 1855, and a number of other Britons, deplored the risqué state of musical theatre and introduced [[German Reed Entertainment|short comic operas]] designed to be more family-friendly and to elevate the intellectual level of musical entertainments.  [[Jessie Bond]] wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The stage was at a low ebb, Elizabethan glories and Georgian artificialities had alike faded into the past, stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute to the righteous British householder....  A first effort to bridge the gap was made by the German Reed Entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/intro.html Introduction to Jessie Bond's ''Reminiscences''] reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 7 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, an 1867 production of Offenbach's ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein|The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (seven months after its French première) ignited the English appetite for light operas with more carefully crafted librettos and scores, and continental European operettas continued to be extremely popular in Britain in the 1860s and 1870s, including ''[[Les Cloches de Corneville]]'', ''[[Madame Favart]]'' and others into the 1880s, often adapted by [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]].&lt;ref name=Gillan/&gt;  [[F. C. Burnand]] collaborated with several composers, including [[Arthur Sullivan]] in ''[[Cox and Box]]'', to write several comic operas on English themes in the 1860s and 1870s.

In 1875, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], one of the impresarios aiming to establish an English school of family-friendly light opera by composers such as [[Frederic Clay]] and [[Edward Solomon]] as a countermeasure to the continental operettas, commissioned Clay's collaborator, [[W. S. Gilbert]], and the promising young composer, [[Arthur Sullivan]], to write a short one-act opera that would serve as an afterpiece to Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]''.  The result was ''[[Trial by Jury]]''; its success launched the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] partnership. "Mr. R. D'Oyly Carte's Opera Bouffe Company" took ''Trial'' on tour, playing it alongside French works by Offenbach and [[Alexandre Charles Lecocq]].  Eager to liberate the English stage from risqué French influences, and emboldened by the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte formed a syndicate in 1877 to perform "light opera of a legitimate kind".&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/C/CarteRichardD'Oyly.htm "Richard D'Oyly Carte",] ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan were commissioned to write a new comic opera, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', starting the series that came to be known as the [[Savoy Operas]] (named for the [[Savoy Theatre]], which Carte later built for these works) that included ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', which became popular around the world.  The [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] continued to perform Gilbert and Sullivan almost continuously until it closed in 1982.

The Gilbert and Sullivan style was widely imitated by their contemporaries (for example, in ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]''), and the creators themselves wrote works in this style with other collaborators in the 1890s.  None of these, however, had lasting popularity, leaving the Savoy Operas as practically the sole representatives of the genre surviving today.  Only recently, some of these other English light operas have begun to be explored by scholars and to receive performances and recordings.

== Russian comic opera ==
The first opera presented in [[Russia]], in 1731, was a comic opera (or "commedia per musica"), ''[[Calandro]]'', by an Italian composer, [[Giovanni Alberto Ristori]]. It was followed by the comic operas of other Italians, like [[Baldassare Galuppi|Galuppi]] and [[Domenico Cimarosa|Cimarosa]], and also the [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]]/[[List of French composers|French]] composer [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry|Grétry]].

The first Russian comic opera was ''[[Anyuta]]'' (1772). The text was written by [[Mikhail Vasilyevich Popov|Mikhail Popov]], with music by an unknown composer, consisting of a selection of popular songs specified in the libretto. Another successful comic opera, ''Melnik &amp;ndash; koldun, obmanshchik i svat'' ("The Miller who was a Wizard, a Cheat and a Match-maker"', text by [[Alexander Ablesimov]], [[Moscow]], 1779), on a subject resembling [[Rousseau]]'s ''Devin'', is attributed to [[Mikhail Matveyevich Sokolovsky|Mikhail Sokolovsky]]. [[Ivan Kerzelli]], [[Vasily Pashkevich]] and [[Yevstigney Fomin]] also wrote a series of successful comic operas in the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Russian comic opera was further developed by [[Alexey Verstovsky]] who composed more 30 opera-vaudevilles and 6 grand operas (most of them with spoken dialogue).  Later, [[Modest Mussorgsky]] worked on two comic operas, ''[[The Fair at Sorochyntsi]]'' and ''[[Zhenitba]]'' ("The Marriage"), which he left unfinished (they were completed only in the 20th century). [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] wrote a comic opera, ''[[Cherevichki]]'' (after [[Nikolai Gogol]], 1885, 1887 [[Moscow]]). [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] composed ''[[May Night]]'' 1878&amp;ndash;1879 and ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]'' 1906&amp;ndash;1907.

In the 20th century, the best examples of comic opera by Russian composers were [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922) and ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951), [[Sergey Prokofiev]]'s ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'' (1919) and ''[[Betrothal in a Monastery]]'' (1940&amp;ndash;1941), and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' (1928, staged 1930). Simultaneously, the genres of light music, operetta, musical comedy, and later, [[rock opera]], were developed by such composers as [[Isaak Dunayevsky]], [[Dmitri Kabalevsky]], Dmitri Shostakovich (Opus 105: ''[[Moscow, Cheryomushki]]'', operetta in 3 acts, (1958)), [[Tikhon Khrennikov]], and later by [[Gennady Gladkov]], [[Alexey Rybnikov]], and [[Alexander Zhurbin]].

The 21st century in Russian comic opera began with the noisy premieres of two works whose genre could be described as "opera-farce":

''Tsar Demyan'' (''Царь Демьян'') &amp;ndash; ''A frightful opera performance''.  A collective project of five authors wrote the work: [[Leonid Desyatnikov]] and Vyacheslav Gaivoronsky from [[St. Petersburg]], Iraida Yusupova and Vladimir Nikolayev from [[Moscow]], and the creative collective "Kompozitor", which is a pseudonym for the well-known music critic Pyotr Pospelov.  The libretto is by Elena Polenova, based on a folk-drama, ''Tsar Maksimilyan'', and the work premiered on June 20, 2001, at the [[Mariinski Theatre]], St Petersburg. Prize "Gold Mask, 2002" and "Gold Soffit, 2002".

''[[The Children of Rosenthal]]'' (''Дети Розенталя''), an opera in two acts by [[Leonid Desyatnikov]], with a libretto by [[Vladimir Sorokin]].  This work was commissioned by the Bolshoi theatre and premiered on March 23, 2005. The staging of the opera was accompanied by juicy scandal; however it was an enormous success.

In the United States, [[Victor Herbert]] (1859&amp;ndash;1924) was one of the first to pick up the family-friendly style of light opera that Gilbert and Sullivan had made popular, although his music was also influenced by the European operetta composers. His earliest pieces, starting with ''Prince Ananias'' in 1894, were styled "comic operas," but his later works were described as "musical extravaganza", "musical comedy", "musical play", "musical farce", and even "opera comique." His two most successful pieces, out of more than half a dozen hits, were ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1903) and ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicaltheatreguide.com/composers/herbert_victor/victorherbert.html "Victor Herbert"] at the Musical Theatre Guide, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who wrote in a similar vein included [[Reginald de Koven]] (1859&amp;ndash;1920), [[John Philip Sousa]] (1854&amp;ndash;1932), [[Sigmund Romberg]] and [[Rudolf Friml]].  The modern American [[musical theatre|musical]] incorporated elements of the British and American light operas, with works like ''[[Show Boat]]'' and ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' that explored more serious subjects and featured a tight integration among book, movement and lyrics.

In Canada, [[Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann]] and [[George Frederick Cameron]] composed in the Gilbert and Sullivan style of light opera. ''[[Leo, the Royal Cadet]]'' was performed for the first time on 11 July 1889 at Martin's Opera House in [[Kingston, Ontario]].

The line between light opera and other recent forms is difficult to draw.  Several works are variously called operettas or musicals, such as ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', depending on whether they are performed in opera houses or in theaters.  In addition, some recent American and British musicals make use of an operatic structure, for example, containing recurring motifs, and may even be sung through without dialogue.  Those with orchestral scores are usually styled "musicals", while those played on electronic instruments are often styled [[rock opera]]s.

'''Economic history''' is the study of [[Economy|economies]] or economic phenomena of the past. Analysis in economic history is undertaken using a combination of [[historical method]]s, [[statistical methods]] and the [[Applied economics|application of economic theory]] to historical situations and [[institution]]s. The topic includes [[Template:History of finance|financial]] and [[business history]] and overlaps with areas of [[social history]] such as [[Historical demography|demographic]] and [[Labor history (discipline)|labor history]]. The [[Quantitative research|quantitative]]—in this case, [[econometric]]—study of economic history is also known as [[cliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, "Cliometrics" by Robert Whaples in S. Durlauf and L. Blume (eds.), ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd ed. (2008). [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000173&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Economic%20history&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development as a separate field==
In Germany in the late 19th century, scholars in a number of universities, led by [[Gustav von Schmoller]], developed the [[Historical school of economics|historical school of economic history]]. It ignored quantitative and mathematical approaches. Historical approach dominated German and French scholarship for most of the 20th century. The approach was spread to Great Britain by [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]], 1860–1927, and dominated British economic history for much of the 20th century. Britain's first professor in the subject was George Unwin at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name=MaxBODNB&gt;[[Maxine Berg|Berg, Maxine L.]] (2004) ‘Knowles , Lilian Charlotte Anne (1870–1926)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45651, accessed 6 Feb 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MBerg&gt;Berg, M. (1992). The first women economic historians. ''The Economic History Review'', 45(2), 308–329.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, economic history was heavily influenced by the [[Annales School]] from the early 20th century to the present. It exerts a worldwide influence through its Journal ''[[Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales]].''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forster, "Achievements of the Annales school." ''Journal of Economic History'' 38.01 (1978): 58–76. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2119315 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating economic history as a discrete academic discipline has been a contentious issue for many years.  Academics at the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] had numerous [[London School of Economics#LSE vs. Cambridge|disputes]] over the separation of economics and economic history in the [[interwar era]]. Cambridge economists believed that pure economics involved a component of economic history and that the two were inseparably entangled. Those at the LSE believed that economic history warranted its own courses, research agenda and academic chair separated from mainstream economics.

In the initial period of the subject's development, the LSE position of separating economic history from economics won out. Many universities in the UK developed independent programmes in economic history rooted in the LSE model. Indeed, the [[Economic History Society]] had its inauguration at [[London School of Economics|LSE]] in 1926 and the [[University of Cambridge]] eventually established its own economic history programme. However, the past twenty years have witnessed the widespread closure of these separate programmes in the UK and the integration of the discipline into either history or economics departments. Only the LSE and the [[University of Edinburgh]] retain a separate economic history department and stand-alone undergraduate and graduate programme in economic history. Cambridge, Glasgow, the LSE and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] together train the vast majority of economic historians coming through the British [[Universities in the United Kingdom|higher education system]] today.

===United States===

Meanwhile, in the US, the field of economic history has in recent decades been largely subsumed into other fields of economics and is seen as a form of [[applied economics]]. As a consequence, there are no specialist economic history graduate programs at any universities anywhere in the country. Economic history remains as a special field component of regular economics or history PhD programs in universities including at [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Harvard University]], [[Northwestern University]] and [[Yale University]].

==Economic history and economics==

[[Yale University]] economist [[Irving Fisher]] wrote in 1933 on the relationship between economics and economic history in his "Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions" (''Econometrica'', Vol. 1, No. 4: 337–38):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The study of dis-equilibrium may proceed in either of two ways. We may take as our unit for study an actual historical case of great dis-equilibrium, such as, say, the panic of 1873; or we may take as our unit for study any constituent tendency, such as, say, deflation, and discover its general laws, relations to, and combinations with, other tendencies. The former study revolves around events, or facts; the latter, around tendencies. The former is primarily economic history; the latter is primarily economic science. Both sorts of studies are proper and important. Each helps the other. The panic of 1873 can only be understood in light of the various tendencies involved—deflation and other; and deflation can only be understood in the light of various historical manifestations—1873 and other.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a school of thought among economic historians that splits economic history—the study of how economic phenomena evolved in the past—from historical economics—testing the generality of economic theory using historical episodes. US economic historian [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] explained this position in his 1990 book ''Historical Economics: Art or Science?''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles P. Kindleberger (1990), [http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft287004zv;brand=ucpress ''Historical Economics: Art or Science?''], University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[new economic history]], also known as [[cliometrics]], refers to the systematic use of economic theory and/or [[econometrics|econometric]] techniques to the study of economic history. The term cliometrics was originally coined by Jonathan R. T. Hughes and Stanley Reiter in 1960 and refers to [[Clio]], who was the [[muse]] of history and heroic poetry in [[Greek mythology]]. Cliometricians argue their approach is necessary because the application of theory is crucial in writing solid economic history, while historians generally oppose this view warning against the risk of generating anachronisms. Early cliometrics was a type of [[counterfactual history]]. However, counterfactualism is no longer its distinctive feature. Some have argued that cliometrics had its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s and that it is now neglected by economists and historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whaples |first=Robert |title=Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study? |journal=Historically Speaking |year=2010 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=17–20 &amp; 20–27 (responses) |doi=10.1353/hsp.0.0109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades economic historians, following [[Douglass North]], have tended to move away from narrowly quantitative studies toward institutional, [[Social history|social]], and [[cultural history]] affecting the evolution of economies.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass C. North (1965). "The State of Economic History," ''American Economic Review'', 55(1/2)  pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1816246 86–91].

[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767026401 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this trend has been criticized, most forcefully by [[Francesco Boldizzoni]], as a form of economic imperialism "extending the neoclassical explanatory model to the realm of social relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boldizzoni |first=Francesco |authorlink= Francesco Boldizzoni |title=The Poverty of Clio: Resurrecting Economic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=18 |year=2011 |location= |isbn=9780691144009 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9476.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, economists in other specializations have started to write on topics concerning economic history.&lt;ref group=a&gt;For example: [[Carmen M. Reinhart]] and [[Kenneth S. Rogoff]] (2009),  ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly''. Princeton.

==Economic history and the history of capitalism==
{{main|History of capitalism}}
A new field calling itself the "History of Capitalism" has emerged in US history departments since about the year 2000. It includes many topics traditionally associated with the field of economic history, such as insurance, banking and regulation, the political dimension of business, and the impact of capitalism on the middle classes, the poor and women and minorities. The field utilizes the existing research of [[business history]], but has sought to make it more relevant to the concerns of history departments in the United States, including by having limited or no discussion of individual business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;See Jennifer Schuessler "In History Departments, It’s Up With Capitalism" [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/education/in-history-departments-its-up-with-capitalism.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'' April 6, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lou Galambos, "Is This a Decisive Moment for the History of Business, Economic History, and the History Of Capitalism?

The '''Environmental Research Institute of Michigan''' (ERIM) was a [[research institute]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], founded in 1972. The institute contributed to the development of [[remote sensing]], [[radar]], and [[holography]]. 

ERIM grew out of a military and environmental research arm of the [[University of Michigan]]. A for-profit enterprise, ERIM International, split off from it in 1997. This was successively acquired by Veridian Corporation, by [[General Dynamics]] - moving to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]] - and in 2014 by [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates]] (MDA). Meanwhile, the remaining non-profit portion became the [[Altarum Institute]] in 2001. Part of Altarum was in 2006 merged into the [[Michigan Tech Research Institute]] (MTRI), conducting environmental and remote sensing research, while health systems research continues at Altarum Institute.

==History==

The Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) began as Willow Run Laboratories in 1946, but was established as a private [[not for profit]] research institute when it formally separated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070528235741/http://www.engin.umich.edu/alumni/engineer/00FW/connections.html ''University of Michigan Engineering School:  Former CoE Lab Endows New Professorship'']&lt;/ref&gt;  ERIM contributed to the development of [[remote sensing]] for [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[military]] applications.  Much of the laboratory's early history is not publicized because ERIM and its predecessor organizations were developing remote sensing and [[surveillance]] systems to collect [[military intelligence]] from [[aircraft]] and [[satellite]]s.&lt;ref name="findarticles1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311024001/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_2000_Sept/ai_68325979 ''What's ERIM? Secretive Past, Automotive Future'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Willow Run Laboratories==

Prior to Willow Run Laboratories's establishment in 1946, with the [[Cold War]] just beginning, the War Department was concerned about keeping the U.S. in the forefront of applied science. University researchers newly returned from WWII service were anxious to use their expertise to address those concerns.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Qe80pZ6H?url=http://mtri.org/QuickPlace/mtri/Main.nsf/h_Toc/DE1AD8280F7DF2E1852571FC0074F9D7/?OpenDocument ''History of the Michigan Tech Research Institute.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University of Michigan’s College of Engineering, Professors [[William Gould Dow]] and [[Emerson W. Conlon]] approached [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] scientists with their proposal to conduct a large-scale research project. The project was designed to prove the feasibility of what would later be referred to as an [[antiballistic missile system]]. The proposal was accepted, called WIZARD, and it was this contract that gave birth to ERIM’s first predecessor organization, the [[Michigan Aeronautical Research Center|Michigan Aeronautical Research Laboratory]] (MARC).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], protesters at the University of Michigan forced the University to sever formal ties with Willow Run Laboratories.  Research from ERIM provided technology for military surveillance, as well as information and models for better prediction and understanding of floods, fires, agricultural crops and remotely sensed information, including studies of the [[Bering Glacier]].

==Key technologies==

ERIM became well known in the [[scientific]] community through a series of international conferences on remote sensing and [[geospatial]] [[information technologies]], in the spirit of the first International Symposium on Remote Sensing of the Environment held in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 1962.

ERIM played key-roles in the development and implementation of [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR), at the time, an entirely new concept of radar technology. Development of an optical processing system for SAR data led [[Emmett Leith]], Adam Kozma and [[Juris_Upatnieks|Juris Upatnieks]] to use the newly invented laser in conjunction with the holographic theories outlined by Dennis Gabor. Leith and Upatnieks developed a practical technique for wave-front recording and reconstruction using lasers, thereby making possible the field now known as [[holography]]. Holograms have since found a wide variety of applications.

==Corporate history==

In 1997, claiming an inability to compete with for-profit industry, President Peter Banks and ERIM's board of trustees spun off a for-profit [[subsidiary]] under the name ERIM International, Incorporated.  Nearly all of ERIM's R&amp;D work and contracts moved to the for-profit entity, while the buildings, property, and a small fraction of personnel and contracts were retained by the not-for-profit ERIM.  Banks and many board members allotted themselves high numbers of shares in the new for-profit venture, which were exercised for considerable sums when ERIM International, Inc. was sold to Veridian Corp. of [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1999.  Veridian was later bought by [[General Dynamics| General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems]] in 2003, and the heritage-ERIM part of the organization became its [[Michigan Research and Development Center]] (MRDC) and moved from Ann Arbor to nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]].  Proceeds from the sale of ERIM International were used by the not-for-profit ERIM to acquire Center for Electronic Commerce (CEC), another Ann Arbor not for profit in 1998.&lt;ref name="findarticles1"/&gt;  ERIM acquired Vector Research, Inc. (VRI) in 2001 to form the [[Altarum Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070321213915/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_2001_May_21/ai_74869484/print ''Vector Research Acquired by ERIM'']&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

On October 1, 2006, [[Michigan Technological University]] purchased the Altarum Institute's Environmental and Emerging Technologies Division (EETD), which was mostly comprised by the heritage-ERIM portion of the Institute, to form the [[Michigan Tech Research Institute]] (MTRI).  The Altarum Institute is a nonprofit now solely focused on health systems research,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; while the environmental and remote sensing research continues at MTRI.

On October 3, 2014, [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates]] (MDA), Canadian corporation, completed the acquisition of the Ypsilanti, Michigan building and employees therein from General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdaus.com/news/Default.aspx?id=143 ''MDA completes strategic capability acquisition in the United States'']&lt;/ref&gt; With MDA's corporate restructuring following the acquisition of [[Digital Globe]] in 2017, this line of business was shifted into the newly-formed subsidiary [[Radiant Solutions]] .

'''Gender identity''' is the personal sense of one's own [[gender]].&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"&gt;''Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression in Social Work Practice'', edited by Deana F. Morrow and Lori Messinger (2006, {{ISBN|0231501862}}), page 8: "Gender identity refers to an individual's personal sense of identity as masculine or feminine, or some combination thereof."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity can correlate with [[assigned sex]] at birth, or can differ from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions|title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Definitions - Human Rights Campaign|first=Human Rights|last=Campaign|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's [[social identity]] in relation to other members of society.&lt;ref&gt;V. M. Moghadam, ''Patriarchy and the politics of gender in modernising societies'', in ''International Sociology'', 1992: "All societies have gender systems."&lt;/ref&gt; In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females,&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{citation| last1= Carlson| first1= Neil R.| last2= Heth| first2= C.

(G. O. MacKenzie, ''Transgender Nation'' (1994, {{ISBN|0879725966}}), page 43.) — "There are records of males and females crossing over throughout history and in virtually every culture. It is simply a naturally occurring part of all societies." (Charles Zastrow, ''Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People'' (2013, {{ISBN|128554580X}}), page 234, quoting the North Alabama Gender Center.)&lt;/ref&gt; some of those people are [[transgender]], [[Genderqueer|genderqueer or non-binary]]. There are some societies that have [[third gender]] categories.

Core gender identity is usually formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender, power, and communication in human relationships|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1995|pages=366 pages|accessdate=June 3, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyMo1RUJwj0C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=Gender,%20power,%20and%20communication%20in%20human%20relationships|isbn=978-0805814040|author1=Pamela J.

Kaufman }}&lt;/ref&gt; After age three, it is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; Both biological and social factors have been suggested to influence its formation.

==Age of formation==
There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's [[Language acquisition|lack of language]] requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"&gt;Boles, 2013. Pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few authorities say it forms between ages 3-4 rather than precisely at age 3, e.g. George J. Bryjak and Michael P. Soraka, ''Sociology: Cultural Diversity in a Changing World'' (ed. Karen Hanson), Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997; 209-245&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bates Doob, ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society''&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Coleman, ''Developmental stages of the coming out process'', in ''Journal of homosexuality'', 1982: "Core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 (Money &amp; Ehrhardt, 1972). This is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth&lt;ref name="Kleeman"&gt;J. A. Kleeman, ''The establishment of core gender identity in normal girls. I.(a) Introduction;(b) Development of the ego capacity to differentiate'', in the ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 1971: "Though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer, core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3[.]"&lt;/ref&gt; to sixth years of age,&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein MT, Zucker KJ, Dixon SD. December, 1997. "Gender Identity", ''The Nurse Practitioner''. Vo. 22, No. 12, P. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and continues into young adulthood.&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt;

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this "peak of rigidity," fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C. | last2 = Ruble | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Children's Search for Gender Cues Cognitive Perspectives on Gender Development | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13| issue = 2|pages = 67–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning [[gender role]] standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newmann|first=Barbara|title=Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111344665|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTY_7osGmqUC|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing formation==

===Nature vs. nurture===
{{Main|Nature versus nurture}}

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as "nature versus nurture". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"&gt;''Effects of male sex hormones on gender identity, sexual behavior, and cognitive function'', ''Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao, Yi Xue Ban'' (''Journal of Central South University, Medical Sciences''), April 2006, 31(2):149-61&lt;/ref&gt; While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not inflexibly determine it.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Golombok, Robyn Fivush, ''Gender Development'' (1994, {{ISBN|0521408628}}), page 44: "When assigned and raised as boys, these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role, showing that a Y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction."&lt;/ref&gt;

Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life.&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=978-0-536-94185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/factors-influencing-gender-identity/|title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Michael, "Cultural Identity, Language Identity, Gender Identity", "The English Academy of South Africa", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social learning theory]] posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way,&lt;ref name=myers&gt;Myers, David G. (2008). ''Psychology''. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C. L. | last2 = Ruble | first2 = D. N. | last3 = Szkrybalo | first3 = J. | year = 2002 | title = Cognitive theories of early gender development | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 6| pages = 903–906 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 | pmid=12405137| citeseerx = 10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of [[David Reimer]], otherwise known as "John/Joan". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781308211503|pages=368|edition=6}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Carol |author2=Diane Ruble |author3=Joel Szkrybalo |title=Cognitive Theories of Early Gender Development |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2002 |volume=128|issue=6 |pages=903–913|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 |pmid=12405137|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Several prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shuvo|title=Gender Identity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/917990-overview|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization.

Hormonal influences are also complex; [[Sexual differentiation in humans|sex-determining hormones]] are produced at an early stage of foetal development,&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke, ''In Pursuit Of Difference, scientific studies of women and men'', in ''The Gender and Science Reader'', page 310&lt;/ref&gt; and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|date=2017-02-02|title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=170–182|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006|issn=0091-3022| pmc=3296090 |pmid=21333673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones may affect differences between males' and females' verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with "women's sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke suggests that during the early stage of fetal development, specific hormones will enter the brain and “permanently affect how the hypothalamus works. As before, high levels of hormones known as androgens will stop the hypothalamus from ever organizing hormone cycles. If there are low levels, then it will be cyclic.” This early influence on brain determines the different frequency of hormone secretion later in male or female’s life. “Obviously, women’s sex hormones usually follow a monthly cycle,” while “men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.” {{cite book|last=Birke|first=Lynda|title=The Gender and Science Reader|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity. Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth, and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oswalt |first=Angela |title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity |url=http://www.sevencounties.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=37697&amp;cn=1272 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415234240/http://www.sevencounties.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=37697&amp;cn=1272 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |publisher=Seven Countries Services, Inc. |accessdate=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and environmental factors===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

In 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;J. Money, J. G. Hampson, and J. L. Hampson, ''An examination of some basic sexual concepts'', 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDDSD"&gt;A. L. C. de Vries, et al., ''Gender Dysphoria and Disorders of Sex Development'' (2013, {{ISBN|1461474418}})&lt;/ref&gt; Money's hypothesis has since been discredited,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling, ''Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construct''&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother's wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; with a 2004 article noting that "solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Swaab, ''Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation'', in ''Gynecological Endocrinology'', 2004: "...direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation. Solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. C. Wallien, ''Psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the attitudes of the child's parents may affect the child's gender identity, although evidence is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;M Weinraub, LP Clemens, A Sockloff, T Ethridge, ''The development of sex role stereotypes in the third year: relationships to gender labeling, gender identity, sex-types toy preference, and family characteristics'', in ''Child Development'', 1984: "Previous investigators have failed to observe a relationship between parental attitudes and children's early sex role acquisition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parental establishment of gender roles====
Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"/&gt; Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite book|last=Spade|first =Joan|title=The Kaleidoscope of Gender|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=978-1-4129-7906-1|pages= 177–184|date =2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; with Kane stating that "the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity."&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as [[ultrasound]]. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class "professional" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Hillary Paul|title=Parents' Gender Ideology and Gendered Behavior as Predictors of Children's Gender-Role Attitudes: A Longitudinal Exploration|journal=Sex Roles|volume=74|issue=11–12|pages=527–542|doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0539-0|pmid=27445431|pmc=4945126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms ''gender identity'' and ''core gender identity'' were first used with their current meaning — one's personal experience of one's own gender&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101"&gt;Boles, 2013. Page 101: "Gender identity is the individual's personal and private experience of his/her gender."&lt;/ref&gt; — sometime in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=GID&gt;"The term 'gender identity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. ... gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness." {{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the Psychology of Women and Gender'' (2004, {{ISBN|0471653578}}), page 102: "''Gender identity'' was introduced into the professional lexicon by Hooker and Stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s (see Money, 1985). For example, Stoller (1964) used the slightly different term ''core gender identity''..."&lt;/ref&gt; To this day they are usually used in that sense,&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the [[sexual orientation]] and [[sexual identity]] categories ''[[gay]]'', ''[[lesbian]]'' and ''[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brym, Roberts, Lie, Rytina. "Sociology". Nelson Education Ltd., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called "inverts", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a "dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework". During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their "correct" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.&lt;ref name = Padawer&gt;{{cite news|last=Padawer|first=Ruth|title=What's So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress?| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress.html | accessdate = October 29, 2012|work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud and Jung's views===
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] presented his theory of [[psychosexual development]] in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the [[phallic stage]], at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt; In 1913, [[Carl Jung]] proposed the [[Electra complex]] as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freud | first1 = Sigmund | year = 1931 | title = Female Sexuality | url = | journal = The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume = 21 | issue = | page = 229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of [[homosexuality]] (which was viewed as a [[mental disorder]] at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] for the study of [[intersex]] and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst [[Robert Stoller]] generalized many of the findings of the project in his book ''Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity'' (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term ''gender identity'' to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] in 1963. Behavioral psychologist [[John Money]] was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medical School]]'s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an [[interactionist]] theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'' (1972) became widely used as a [[college textbook]], although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraway |first=Donna |authorlink=Donna Haraway |year=1991 |title=Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature |page=133 |publisher=[[Free Association Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-90386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] by Katrina Karkazis, Duke University Press, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's views===
In the late 1980s, [[Judith Butler]] began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]'', introducing the concept of [[gender performativity]] and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |year=1990 |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |pages=front/backmatter |publisher=[[Routledge Classic]] |location=London |isbn=978-0415389556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present views==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}&lt;!--also needs expansion--&gt;

===Medical field===
{{As of|2018}}, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Medical practitioners, as well as an increasing number of parents, generally no longer support or believe in the idea of [[conversion therapy]],&lt;ref name="nymag-7feb2016"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got a Leading Sex Researcher Fired|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely discredited as unethical and ineffective.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - prayer and pain"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tom Dart |title=Prayer and pain: why gay conversion therapy is still legal despite dangers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/gay-conversion-therapy-republican-party-platform |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=July 15, 2016 |ref=Prayer_and_pain |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stonewall - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conversion Therapy |url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy |website=Stonewall |publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=stonewall_conversion|date=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the [[NHS]], have concluded that conversion therapy to 'cure' sexual orientation is dangerous and work is being done to extend this position to include gender identity.&lt;ref name="MOU - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Memorandum-of-understanding-on-conversion-therapy.pdf |website=www.pyschotherapy.org |publisher=UKCP - UK Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=MOU_CT |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are still a number of clinicians who continue to believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name="Padawer"/&gt;

[[Transsexual]] self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their [[primary sexual characteristics]], secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, [[sex reassignment surgery]] is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|title=Sex and Gender are Different: Sexual Identity and Gender Identity are Different|journal=Clinical Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=7|issue=3|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2002-sex-and-gender.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, it was decided under the Affordable Care Act that [[health insurance exchange]]s would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Kellan|title=FAQ: Collecting Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2012/10/16/41620/faq-collecting-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-data/|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===
[[Gender dysphoria]] (previously called "gender identity disorder" or GID in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant [[dysphoria]] (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Identity Disorder | Psychology Today." Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness Find a Therapist. Psychology Today, 24 Oct. 2005. Web. 17 Dec. 2010. http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/gender-identity-disorder.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100306075726/http://www.genderdysphoria.org/genderdysphoria_medical.html Gender Dysphoria Organization Research and Education - About Gender Dysphoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."&lt;ref name="GID" /&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made, and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age, for example [[gender identity disorder in children]] (for children who experience gender dysphoria).

The concept of gender identity appeared in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in its third edition, [[DSM-III]] (1980), in the form of two [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the [[DSM-III-R]], added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Historical Note"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zucker | first1 = KJ | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL  |date=Jan–Feb 2005 | title = Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a [[mental disorder]], speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,&lt;ref name="Historical Note"/&gt; although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.

===International human rights law===
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on the application of [[international human rights law]], provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual [[experience]] of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that "Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], ''Principle 3. The Right to recognition before the law''&lt;/ref&gt; and Principle 18 states that "Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, ''Principle 18. Protection from medical abuse''&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to this principle, the "Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles" observed that "Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected [[gender expression]], have been treated as a form of [[mental illness]]. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques — including [[electroshock therapy]] — as a 'cure'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles, page 43] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf |date=November 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Yogyakarta Principles in Action" says "it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, 'gender identity' or 'gender identity disorder' often remains in consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypinaction.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Activists_Guide_English_nov_14_2010.pdf|title=Activist's Guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, p. 100|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Principles influenced the [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]]
In 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges  in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-binary gender identities==
{{See also|Gender binary|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a [[gender binary|binary]] in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms ''non-binary'' or ''[[genderqueer]]''. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman." These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

===Fa'afafine===
{{Main|Fa'afafine}}
In some [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies, [[fa'afafine]] are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (''see references''), fa'afafine in [[Samoa]] at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Sua'ali'i, Tamasailau, "[[Samoa]]ns and Gender: Some Reflections on Male, Female and Fa'afafine Gender Identities", in: ''Tangata O Te Moana Nui: The Evolving Identities of Pacific Peoples in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]'', Palmerston North (NZ): Dunmore Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86469-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Johanna|title=Paradise Lost? Social Change and Fa'afafine in Samoa|journal=Current Sociology|date=May 2003|issue=3|pages=417–432|doi=10.1177/0011392103051003014|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijras===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}
In some cultures of [[Asia]], a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically [[male]] or [[intersex]], but some are anatomically [[female]]. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes [[prostitute]]s, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to [[transvestism|transvestites]] or [[drag queen]]s of contemporary western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khanith===
{{Main|Khanith}}
The [[khanith]] form an accepted third gender in [[Oman]]. The khanith are [[male]] [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]]s whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at [[wedding]]s or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their [[society]], khaniths can marry women, proving their [[masculinity]] by consummating the [[marriage]]. Should a [[divorce]] or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-spirit identities===
{{Main|Two-Spirit}}
&lt;!--section needs slight expansion--&gt;
Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North American Nations]] had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond [[cisgender]] man and woman, are now often collectively termed "two-spirit" or "two-spirited." There are parts of the community that take "two-spirit" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sarah|year=2016|title=An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|journal=National Collaborative Centre Aboriginal Health|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004508/http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19887">'''Glottochronology''' (from [[Attic Greek]] γλῶττα "tongue, language" and χρóνος "time") is the part of [[lexicostatistics]] dealing with the chronological relationship between languages.&lt;ref name=Embleton&gt;Sheila Embleton (1992). HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS: Mathematical concepts. In W. Bright (Ed.), International Encyclopedia of Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}}

The idea was developed by [[Morris Swadesh]] under two assumptions: that there does, indeed, exist a relatively stable "basic vocabulary" (referred to as "[[Swadesh list]]s") in all languages of the world; and that any replacements happen in a way analogous to [[radioactive decay]], in constant percentages per time elapsed. Meanwhile, there exist many different methods, partly extensions of the Swadesh method, now more and more under the biological assumptions of replacements in genes. However, Swadesh's technique is so well known that, for many people, 'glottochronology' refers to it alone.&lt;ref name=Embleton/&gt;{{rp|133}}&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Hans J. (2007). The new Arboretum of Indo-European 'Trees'; Can new algorithms reveal the Phylogeny and even Prehistory of IE?. Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 14-2:167–214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

===Word list===
The original method presumed that the core vocabulary of a language is replaced at a constant (or constant average) rate across all languages and cultures, and can therefore be used to measure the passage of time. The process makes use of a list of lexical terms. Lists were compiled by Morris Swadesh and assumed to be resistant against borrowing (originally designed in 1952 as a list of 200 items; however, the refined 100 word list in Swadesh (1955)&lt;ref name=swadesh1955&gt;Swadesh, Morris. (1955). Towards greater accuracy in lexicostatistic dating. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'', ''21'', 121&amp;ndash;137&lt;/ref&gt; is much more common among modern day linguists). This core vocabulary was designed to encompass concepts common to every human language (such as personal pronouns, body parts, heavenly bodies, verbs of basic actions, numerals 'one' and 'two', etc.), eliminating concepts that are specific to a particular culture or time. It has been found that this ideal is not in fact possible and that the meaning set may need to be tailored to the languages being compared.  Many alternative word lists have been compiled by other linguists, often using fewer meaning slots.

The percentage of [[cognate]]s (words that have a common origin) in these word lists is then measured.  The larger the percentage of cognates, the more recently the two languages being compared are presumed to have separated.

===Glottochronologic constant===
[[Robert Lees (linguist)|Robert Lees]] obtained a value for the "glottochronological constant" ('''r''') of words by considering the known changes in 13 pairs of languages using the 200 word list.  He obtained a value of 0.805&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.0176 with 90% confidence.  For the 100 word list Swadesh obtained a value of 0.86, the higher value reflecting the elimination of semantically unstable words.  This constant may be related to the retention rate of words by:-

:&lt;math&gt;L = 2\ln(r) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the rate of replacement, ln is the logarithm to base e, and ''r'' is the glottochronological constant

===Divergence time===
The basic formula of glottochronology in its shortest form is:-

: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\ln(c)}{-L}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' = a given period of time from one stage of the language to another, ''c'' = proportion of wordlist items retained at the end of that period, and ''L'' = rate of replacement for that word list.

One can also therefore formulate that:

: &lt;math&gt; t = -\frac{\ln(c)}{2\ln(r)}&lt;/math&gt;

By testing historically verifiable cases where we have knowledge of ''t'' through non-linguistic data (e. g. the approximate distance from Classical Latin to modern Romance languages), Swadesh arrived at the empirical value of approximately 0.14 for ''L'' (meaning that the rate of replacement constitutes around 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium).

===Results===
Glottochronology was found to work in the case of Indo-European, accounting for 87% of the variance. It is also postulated to work for Hamito-Semitic (Fleming 1973), Chinese (Munro 1978) and Amerind (Stark 1973; Baumhoff and Olmsted 1963). For the latter, correlations have been obtained with radiocarbon dating and blood groups as well as archaeology.
Note that the approach of Gray and Atkinson,&lt;ref&gt;''Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin, Russell D. Gray &amp; Quentin D. Atkinson, Nature 426, 435&amp;ndash;439'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; as they say, has nothing to do with "glottochronology".

==Discussion==
The concept of language change is old, and its history is reviewed in Hymes (1973) and Wells (1973).  Glottochronology itself dates back to the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=swadesh1955/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swadesh, Morris (1972). What is glottochronology? In M.

Glottochronology has been controversial ever since, partly owing to issues of accuracy, as well as the question of whether its basis is sound (see e.g. Bergsland 1958; Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Fodor 1961; Chretien 1962; Guy 1980).  These concerns have been addressed by Dobson et al. (1972), Dyen (1973)&lt;ref name=dyen1973&gt;Dyen, Isidore, ed. (1973). ''Lexicostatistics in genetic linguistics: Proceedings of the Yale conference, April 3&amp;ndash;4, 1971''. La Haye: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kruskal, Dyen and Black (1973).&lt;ref name=kruskal1973&gt;Some Results From the Vocabulary Method of Reconstructing Language Trees, Joseph B. Kruskal, Isidore Dyen and Paul Black, Lexicostatistics in Genetic Linguistics, Isidore Dyen (editor), Mouton, The Hague, 1973, pp. 30-55&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of a single-word replacement rate can distort the divergence-time estimate when borrowed words are included (Thomason and Kaufman 1988). Chrétien purported to disprove the mathematics of the Swadesh-model. At a conference at Yale in 1971 his criticisms were shown to be invalid. See the published proceedings under Dyen (1973)&lt;ref name=dyen1973/&gt; The same conference saw the application of the theory to [[Creole language]] (Wittmann 1973).
An overview of recent arguments can be obtained from the papers of a conference held at the McDonald Institute in 2000.&lt;ref name=renfrew2002&gt;Renfrew, C., McMahon, A., &amp; L. Trask, Eds. (2000). Time Depth in Historical LInguistics. Cambridge, England: The McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.
&lt;/ref&gt; These presentations vary from "Why linguists don't do dates" to the one by [[Sergei Starostin|Starostin]] discussed above.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}
Since its original inception, glottochronology has been rejected by many linguists, mostly Indo-Europeanists of the school of the traditional [[comparative method]]. Criticisms have been answered in particular around three points of discussion.

* Criticism levelled against the higher stability of lexemes in Swadesh lists alone (Haarmann 1990) misses the point, because a certain amount of losses only enables the computations (Sankoff 1970).
* Traditional glottochronology did presume that language changes at a stable rate.
:Thus, in Bergsland &amp; Vogt (1962), the authors make an impressive demonstration, on the basis of actual language data verifiable by extra-linguistic sources, that the "rate of change" for [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] constituted around 4% per millennium, whereas for closely connected [[Riksmal]] (Literary Norwegian) it would amount to as much as 20%. (Swadesh's proposed "constant rate" was supposed to be around 14% per millennium).
:This and several other similar examples effectively proved that Swadesh's formula would not work on all available material&amp;mdash;a serious accusation considering that evidence that can be used to "calibrate" the meaning of ''L'' (i. e. language history recorded during prolonged periods of time) is not overwhelmingly large in the first place.
:It is highly likely that the chance of replacement is in fact different for every word or feature ("each word has its own history", among hundreds of other sources:&lt;ref&gt;Kirk JM, St Anderson, &amp; JDA Widdowson, 1985 Studies in Linguistic Geography: The Dialects of English in Britain and Ireland. London: Croom Helm&lt;/ref&gt;).
:This global assumption has been modified and downgraded to single words even in single languages in many newer attempts (see below).
*A serious argument is that language change arises from socio-historical events which are of course unforeseeable and, therefore, uncomputable.
:New methods developed by Gray &amp; Atkinson are claimed to avoid these issues, but are still seen as controversial, primarily since they often produce results that are incompatible with known data and because of additional methodological issues.

==Modified==

Somewhere in between the original concept of Swadesh and the rejection of glottochronology in its entirety lies the idea that glottochronology as a formal method of linguistic analysis becomes valid with the help of several important modifications.  Thus, inhomogeneities in the replacement rate were dealt with by Van der Merwe (1966)&lt;ref&gt;van der Merwe, N. J. 1966 "New mathematics for glottochronology", Current Anthropology 7: 485&amp;ndash;500&lt;/ref&gt; by splitting the word list into classes each with their own rate, while Dyen, James and Cole (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Dyen, I., James, A. T., &amp; J. W. L. Cole 1967 "Language divergence and estimated word retention rate", &lt;Language 43: 150--171&lt;/ref&gt; allowed each meaning to have its own rate. Simultaneous estimation of divergence time and replacement rate was studied by Kruskal, Dyen and Black.&lt;ref name=kruskal1973/&gt;

Brainard (1970) allowed for chance cognation and drift effects was introduced by Gleason (1959). Sankoff (1973) suggested introducing a borrowing parameter and allowed synonyms.

A combination of these various improvements is given in Sankoff's "Fully Parameterised Lexicostatistics".  In 1972 Sankoff in a biological context developed a model of genetic divergence of populations. Embleton (1981) derives a simplified version of this in a linguistic context. She carries out a number of simulations using this which are shown to give good results.

Improvements in statistical methodology related to a completely different branch of science &amp;ndash; [[Phylogenetics|changes in DNA over time]] &amp;ndash; have sparked a recent renewed interest. These methods are more robust than the earlier ones because they calibrate points on the tree with known historical events and smooth the rates of change across these. As such, they no longer require the assumption of a constant rate of change ([http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/publications/index.php?pub=Gray_and_Atkinson2003Nature Gray &amp; Atkinson 2003]).

===Starostin's method===

Another attempt to introduce such modifications was performed by the Russian linguist [[Sergei Starostin]], who had proposed that

* systematic [[loanword]]s, borrowed from one language into another, are a disruptive factor and have to be eliminated from the calculations; the one thing that really matters is the "native" replacement of items by items from the same language. The failure to notice this factor was a major reason in Swadesh's original estimation of the replacement rate at under 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium, when the real rate is, in fact, much slower (around 5 or 6). Introducing this correction effectively cancels out the "Bergsland &amp; Vogt" argument, since a thorough analysis of the Riksmal data shows that its basic wordlist includes about 15&amp;ndash;16 borrowings from other Germanic languages (mostly [[Danish language|Danish]]) &amp;ndash; exclusion of these elements from the calculations brings the rate down to the expected rate of 5&amp;ndash;6 "native" replacements per millennium;
* the rate of change is not really constant, but actually depends on the time period during which the word has existed in the language (i. e. chances of lexeme X being replaced by lexeme Y increase in direct proportion to the time elapsed – the so-called "aging of words", empirically understood as gradual "erosion" of the word's primary meaning under the weight of acquired secondary ones);
* individual items on the 100 wordlist have different stability rates (for instance, the word "I" generally has a much lower chance of being replaced than the word "yellow", etc.).

The resulting formula, taking into account both the time dependence and the individual stability quotients, looks as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;t = \sqrt \frac{\ln(c)}{-Lc}&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, &amp;minus;''Lc'' reflects the gradual slowing down of the replacement process due to different individual rates (the less stable elements are the first and the quickest to be replaced), whereas the square root represents the reverse trend &amp;ndash; acceleration of replacement as items in the original wordlist "age" and become more prone to shifting their meaning. The formula is obviously more complicated than Swadesh's original one, but, as shown in Starostin's work, yields more credible results than the former (and more or less agrees with all the cases of language separation that can be confirmed by historical knowledge). On the other hand, it shows that glottochronology can really only be used as a serious scientific tool on language families the historical phonology of which has been meticulously elaborated (at least to the point of being able to clearly distinguish between cognates and loanwords).

===Time-depth estimation===
The McDonald Institute hosted a conference on the issue of time-depth estimation in 2000.  The published papers&lt;ref name=renfrew2002/&gt; give an idea of the views on glottochronology at that time.  These vary from "Why linguists don't do dates" to the one by Starostin discussed above. Note that in the referenced Gray and Atkinson paper, they hold that their methods can not be called "glottochronology", by confining this term to its original method.

'''Houghton College''' is a Christian [[liberal arts]] college in [[Houghton, New York|Houghton]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is affiliated with the [[Wesleyan Church]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.houghton.edu/about-us/history/ History of Houghton]. Houghton.edu. Retrieved on 2013-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The college is a member of both the [[Christian College Consortium]] and the [[Council for Christian Colleges and Universities]].

==History==
Houghton College began in 1883 as Houghton Seminary, a [[coeducation]]al [[high school]] founded by [[Willard J. Houghton]], a [[Wesleyan]] [[Methodist]] minister. In 1899, the first few college classes were offered. James S. Luckey was appointed president in 1908 and Houghton College received its provisional charter from New York in 1923.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; A permanent charter was granted in 1927, and accreditation by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] came in 1935. [[Stephen W. Paine|Stephen Paine]] was appointed president in 1937.  When the former Buffalo Bible Institute merged with Houghton College in 1969, the West Seneca campus was created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.houghton.edu/orgs/star/issues/Oct%207%202005.pdf ''Houghton Star'', October 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904014808/http://campus.houghton.edu/orgs/star/issues/Oct%207%202005.pdf |date=September 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber Dayton was appointed president in 1972 and he was succeeded by [[Daniel R. Chamberlain]] in 1976. The college initiated its first [[master’s degree]] program in 2004 and currently offers nine such degrees.  [[Shirley Mullen]] was appointed president in 2006. From 2012 to 2013, the college set new records of giving to the institution for two years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-college-sets-record-giving-second-year-running/284/|title=Houghton College Sets Record Giving, Second Year Running|publisher=Houghton College |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Houghton College faced financial and enrollment challenges which led to academic budget cuts for the 2014–2015 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2013/11/09/college-announces-significant-academic-budget-cuts-for-2014-2015/|title=College Announces Significant Academic Budget Cuts for 2014–2015 |first=Sarah|last=Hutchinson |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/09/private-colleges-remain-under-weather|title=Private colleges remain under the weather|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a "strategic reallocation of resources"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-announces-strategic-realignment-of-academic-programs/335/|title=Houghton Announces Strategic Realignment of Academic Programs|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the development of several new majors including Music Industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2014/12/08/new-music-industry-major/|title=New Music Industry Major |first=Laura |last=Johnson |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports Management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/news-media/recent-news/houghton-gets-approval-to-offer-bs-in-sport-recreation-and-wellness-management/586/|title=Houghton Gets Approval to  Offer B.S. in Sport, Recreation and Wellness Management|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Data Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghtonstar.com/2015/01/30/houghton-first-in-nation/|title=Houghton First in Nation to Offer Liberal Arts Data Science Class |first=Luke |last=Lauer |work=Houghton Star |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Houghton College’s main [[campus]] is in the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Houghton, in [[Allegany County, New York]], about {{convert|65|mi|km}} southeast of [[Buffalo, New York]] and {{convert|70|mi|km}} southwest of [[Rochester, New York]]. The {{convert|1300|acre|km2}} of campus sit on the [[Allegheny Plateau]] at roughly {{convert|1300|ft|m}}, on the site of the former [[Caneadea]] Indian Reservation. A new Adult Education program offers a B.S. in Management at a variety of locations. Houghton College opened two locations in Niagara County for their Adult Education Program in 2013, in the city of [[Niagara Falls, N.Y.]], and in [[Lockport, N.Y.]]

==Academics==
Houghton College grants two-year and four-year degrees in 46 majors. The college also offers six graduate degrees through the Greatbatch School of Music.

===First Year Honors===
A distinctive First Year Honors Program is for qualified first-year students.  There are three options: London Honors, East Meets West, and Science Honors. Previously the college offered a Contemporary Contexts program, but was replaced by London Honors in 2014. During London Honors, students spend their spring semester in London studying the development of the western world. East Meets West involves taking integrated classes during normal semester then traveling abroad during "May Term", exploring the roots of Western culture. Science Honors takes place during both first-year semesters at Houghton, involving research in recent real-world issues such as fuel-efficiency, climate change, and energy sources. The theme for 2012-13 was [[Global Warming]] and ways in which to improve Houghton's efforts in [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houghton.edu/academics/Honors-at-Houghton/ Houghton College: Prospective Students Website – Academics – Honors Program]. Explore.houghton.edu. Retrieved on 2012-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of this commitment, the school has built one of the largest solar arrays in the state of New York, with a ribbon cutting ceremony on April 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/calendar-events/solar-array-ribbon-cutting-tour/2426/|title=Solar Array Ribbon Cutting &amp; Tour|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
There are four traditional residence halls and four townhouses residences. Two of the traditional residence halls, Gillette Hall and Lambein Hall, are female residences. Rothenbuhler Hall and Shenawana Hall are male residences. Sophomore, Junior and senior students have the option to live in the townhouses. Houghton College is a distinctly residential campus but does allow for upper class students the opportunity to apply to live in approved off-campus housing, called Community Living Opportunities (CLOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houghton.edu/students/residence-life/college-residences/|title=Residence Life - College Residences|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations and clubs are available for students to join or found their own.  &lt;!-- Detailed lists should not be included, can be found at houghton.edu --&gt;

'''Ideal managerial climate''' ('''IMC''') is a concept within [[organizational communication]].&lt;ref name="redding1"&gt;Redding, W. C. (1972). Communication within the organization: An interpretive review of theory and research. New York, N.Y.: Industrial Communication Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced by [[W. Charles Redding]] in 1972, this theoretical concept serves as a comprehensive model for management, and organizations as a whole, that places emphasis on relationships, interactions, and leadership functions. IMC furthers discussion in organizational communication beyond formal relations and structures, and assesses those characteristics that can produce the most ideal environment in an organization, and/or its management. This model presents an ideal situation rather than an attainable one, and should be a used as a tool for comparison, self-assessment, and improvement for organizations.&lt;ref name="redding1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buzzanell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buzzanell | first1 = P. | last2 = Stohl | first2 = C. | year = 1999 | title = The redding tradition of organizational communication scholarship: W. charles redding and his legacy | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3669/is_199901/ai_n8852242/ | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 324–336 | doi=10.1080/10510979909388503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheney"&gt;[[George Edward Cheney|Cheney, G.]], Christensen, L.T., Zorn, Jr., T.E., Ganesh, S.

&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Theoretical perspective==

W. Charles Redding, commonly credited as the father of organizational communication, conducted significant research that made substantial contributions to organizational and managerial communication.&lt;ref name="buzzanell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, P. (1994, September). W. charles redding. Spectra, p. 2. Retrieved from Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete database.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding was one of the first to investigate the [[Organisation climate|climates of organizations]]. His quantitative studies examined communicative dynamics among the members of organizations across various structures. Prior to Redding’s contributions, research pertaining to organizational climate was limited specifically to the analysis of events or isolated messages rather than the larger dynamics of the organization. Based on his findings, Redding developed a prescriptive model for managers known as the ''ideal managerial climate'', which connects leadership functions to the organizational communication climate.&lt;ref name="cheney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhetorical"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redding | first1 = W. C. | year = 1999 | title = Communication research and the 'rhetorical environment.' | doi = 10.1080/10510979909388504 | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 337–351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redding claimed that any experience in an organizational setting is a [[message]], including both [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal and verbal communication]].&lt;ref name="prospects"&gt;Tompkins, P.K. &amp; Wanca-Thibault, M. (2001) Organizational communication: prelude and prospects. In Pace, R. W., Fauls, D. F. (3rd Ed.). (1994). Organizational communication. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: A Paramount Communications Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Message and message-related practices are the basic premise by which organizational environments and climates are created. Climate can be defined as “the psychological environment in which organizational behavior occurs.” &lt;ref name="cheney" /&gt; As this applies to organizational communication, “organizational climate” can be defined as the relationships and interactions that contribute to the formation of workplace environments among and across various organizational structures.&lt;ref&gt;Falcione, R. L., Sussman, L, &amp; Herden, R. P. (1987). Communication climate in organizations. In F.M. Jablin, L.L. Putnam, K.H. Roberts, &amp; L W. Porter (Ed.), Handbook of organizational communication (pp. 195–227). Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pace"&gt;Pace, R. W., Fauls, D. F. (3rd Ed.). (1994). Organizational communication. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: A Paramount Communications Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding states that “the communication ‘climate’ of the organization is more crucial than are communication skills or techniques (taken by themselves) in creating an effective organization.” &lt;ref name="buzzanell" /&gt; When evaluating organizational climate using IMC, the ideal productive environment of an organizational is related to the culture and values an organization possesses.&lt;ref name="redding1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cheney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhetorical" /&gt;

==Components of IMC==

Based on Redding’s research and consultation experience, he found five dynamics to be key in the attempt to produce a stable, satisfying, and content atmosphere in the workplace. These characteristics were reflective on organizational productivity, preventing workplace conflicts, and positive influence and fluency in organizational structure.

1. Trust: Trust, confidence, and credibility should be maintained in the relationships between members of the organization at all levels of the hierarchy.

2. Supportiveness: Personnel should feel free to speak what is on their minds in an atmosphere of acceptance, regardless of their positioning as superior or subordinate.

3. Openness: The dynamics in an organizational setting should be clear and free of confusion. However, although there may be formal [[hierarchical structure]]s, communication should be not limited by rigid boundaries.

4. Emphasis on [[Goal setting|high-performance goals]]: All members of an organization should be committed to high-performance goals such as high productivity, high quality, low cost, and a concern for other members.

5. [[Participative decision making|Participative decision-making]]: Employees at all levels in the organization should be communicated to and consulted with in decision-making and goal-setting relevant to their positions.&lt;ref name="pace" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redding, W.C. (1979). Organizational communication theory and ideology: an overview. In D. Nimmo (Ed.), Communication Yearbook 3 (pp. 321–322). New Brunswick, N.J.: International Communication Association. https://books.google.com/books?id=rWBCpXlOLqsC&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;ots=jn3xTJG-m8&amp;dq=W.%20Charles%20redding&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA309#v=onepage&amp;q=W.%20Charles%20redding&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

6.Emotional connections: If employees feel an emotional connection to the work that is facilitated through the manager, work will be done more effectively and the employees will be able to be more productive.

==Expansion of IMC==

In 1976, Peterson and Pace expanded on the IMC model with the development of the communication climate inventory (CCI). Similar to Redding’s, this model was designed to analyze the communication dynamics of an organizational setting according to six categories of “communication effects.” Peterson and Pace used the five components of IMC as a foundational premise upon which to base their model.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, B.D., Pace, R..W. (1976). Communication climate and organizational
satisfaction. Unpublished manuscript. {{doi|10.1177/0893318988001004003}}

The word "[[Value (ethics)|value]]" is both a verb and a noun, each with multiple meanings. But its root meaning always involves social judgments of qualities such as [[good]]ness, worth, [[truth]], [[justice]], [[beauty]]. The word names either the rational criterion applied when judging, or results of judging, the presence of such qualities.&lt;ref name="Dew 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Theory of Valuation|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1-3}}&lt;ref name="Tile"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tiles|first1=Mary|last2=Oberdiek|first2=Hans|title=Living in a Technological Culture|publisher=Routledge|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37–44}} 

Humans attribute qualities to objects, beliefs, and behaviors as they identify means that "work" to carry on [[social interaction|social life]], and ends that are "right" for social life itself.  Qualities that "work" are judged by the '''instrumental criterion''', and are said to possess instrumental value.  Qualities that are "right" in themselves are judged by the '''intrinsic criterion''', and are said to possess intrinsic value.  The value of a smart phone or a scientific theory is instrumental.  The value of the [[Ten Commandments]] or the [[US Constitution]] is intrinsic.

==Overview==
The noun value sometimes names the instrumental or intrinsic criterion being applied.  More often, it names things judged to possess instrumental or intrinsic value.  Modern scholars have refined these ancient common-sense meanings of value.  [[sociology|Sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] applied the labels instrumental and intrinsic value to two patterns of social action.  Here are his original definitions, followed by current labels for the two criteria from the ''Oxford Handbook of Value Theory''.

{{quotation
|Social action, like all action, may be [judged] ...:
     1) ''instrumentally rational'' (''zweckrational''), that is, determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment of other human beings; these expectations are used as "conditions" or "means" for the attainment of the actor's own rationally pursued and calculated ends'

     2) ''value-rational'' (''wertrational''), that is, determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake of some ethical, [[aesthetic]], religious, or other form of behavior, independently of its prospects of success;...,&lt;ref name="Max 22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24–5}}}}

{{quotation
|... the distinction between what is good "in itself" and what is good "as a means."}}

{{quotation
|The concept of intrinsic value has been glossed variously as what is ''valuable for its own sake, in itself, on its own, in its own right'', as ''an end'', or ''as such''.  By contrast, extrinsic value has been characterized mainly as what is valuable as a means, or for something else's sake.}}

{{quotation
|Among nonfinal values, instrumental value--intuitively, the value attaching a means to what is finally valuable--stands out as a [[bona fide]] example of what is not valuable for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirose|first1=Iwao|last2=Olson|first2=Jonas|title=The Oxford Handbook of Value Theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14, 29, 34}}}}

The assumption that humans apply two distinct criteria of judgment creates problems.  People ask, "How can we know which objects have which qualities?"  Things that "work" may appear obvious, but can stop working or have bad consequences.  Things that are "right" are not-at-all obvious and are often controversial.  This article samples usages of instrumental and intrinsic value and some disputes they generate.  Evidence is drawn from the work of four scholars.

Philosopher [[John Dewey]] and economist [[John Fagg Foster]] denied legitimacy to intrinsic value.  They treated it as contaminated application of instrumental value, and showed how instrumental value alone can judge ends and means that both work and are right.  Philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]] argued that instrumental value had itself become contaminated by inhuman industrial power unregulated by intrinsic supernatural value.  Philosopher [[Anjan Chakravartty]] argued that modern [[scientific realism]] confirms the truth of intrinsic value and the fallacy of relativistic instrumental value.

To reduce ambiguity, throughout this article the noun "value" names a criterion of judgment but not an object judged valuable.  The noun "valuation" names an object judged valuable.  The plural noun "values" identifies collections of valuations, without identifying the criterion applied.

==John Dewey==
[[John Dewey]] judged the human belief in intrinsic value to be a futile and failed search for a community [[moral compass]]. He saw no need for intrinsic value because instrumental value enables human groups to coordinate beliefs and behaviors that both work and are right.  Every social transaction has good or bad consequences depending on prevailing conditions that are satisfied or not.  Continuous reasoning adjusts patterns to keep them working on the right track as conditions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Tool|first=Marc|title=John Dewey|editor-last=Hodgson|editor-first=Geoffrey M.|encyclopedia=Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics|date=1994|volume=1|pages=152–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey thought that belief in intrinsic value contaminates instrumental value by isolating judgments of what is right from judgments of what works. For him, "restoring integration and cooperation between man's [[beliefs]] about the world in which he lives and his beliefs about the values [valuations] and purposes that should direct his conduct is the deepest problem of modern life."&lt;ref name="Dew 29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Quest for Certainty|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|date=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255}}  "A culture which permits science to destroy traditional values [valuations] but which distrusts its power to create new ones is a culture which is destroying itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Freedom and Culture|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|date=1963|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey agreed with Max Weber that people talk as if they apply instrumental and intrinsic criteria.  And he agreed with Weber's observation that intrinsic value is problematic because it ignores the relationship between context and consequences of beliefs and behaviors.  Both men questioned how anything valued intrinsically "for its own sake" can  have operationally efficient consequences.

{{quotation
|... the more the value to which action is oriented is elevated to the status of an absolute [intrinsic] value, the more "irrational" in this [instrumental] sense the corresponding action is.  For the more unconditionally the actor devotes himself to this value for its own sake, ... the less he is influenced by considerations of the consequences of his action.&lt;ref name="Max 22"/&gt;{{rp|26, 399–400}}}}

But Dewey rejected the common belief--shared by Weber--that supernatural intrinsic value is necessary to show humans what is permanently "right."  He argued that both efficient and legitimate qualities are discovered in daily life, where conditions are always changing.

{{quotation
|Man who lives in a world of hazards ... has sought to attain [security] in two ways.  One of them began with an attempt to propitiate the [intrinsic] powers which environ him and determine his destiny.  It expressed itself in supplication, sacrifice, ceremonial rite and magical cult  ....  The other course is to invent [instrumental] arts and by their means turn the powers of nature to account;...&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|3}}}}

{{quotation
|... for over two thousand years, the ... most influential and authoritatively orthodox tradition ... has been devoted to the problem of a purely cognitive certification (perhaps by revelation, perhaps by intuition, perhaps by reason) of the antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness.  ....  The crisis in contemporary culture, the confusions and conflicts in it, arise from a division of authority.  Scientific [instrumental] inquiry seems to tell one thing, and traditional beliefs [intrinsic valuations] about ends and ideals that have authority over conduct tell us something quite different.  ....  As long as the notion persists that knowledge is a disclosure of [intrinsic] reality ... prior to and independent of knowing, and that knowing is independent of a purpose to control the quality of experienced objects, the failure of natural science to disclose significant values [valuations] in its objects will come as a shock.&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|43–4}}}}

Finding no evidence of "antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness...," Dewey argued that both efficient and legitimate qualities are discovered in the continuity of human [[experience]], which always has [[Antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedent]]s, and is always mutable.

{{quotation
|Dewey's ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end or supreme principle that can serve as a criterion of ethical evaluation with the goal of identifying a method for improving our value judgments.  Dewey argued that ethical inquiry is of a piece with empirical inquiry more generally.  ....  This pragmatic approach requires that we locate the conditions of warrant for our value judgments in human conduct itself, not in any ''a priori'' fixed reference point outside of conduct, such as in God's commands, Platonic Forms, pure reason, or "nature," considered as giving humans a fixed ''telos'' [intrinsic end].;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Anderson|first=Elizabeth|title=Dewey's Moral Philosophy|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://lplato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dewey-moral}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|114, 172–3; 197}}}}

Philosophers label a "fixed reference point outside of conduct' a "natural kind," and presume it to have eternal existence knowable in itself without being experienced.  Natural kinds are "mind-independent" and "theory-independent" valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Bird|first1=Alexander|last2=Tobin|first2=Emma|title=Natural Kinds|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/natural-kinds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey granted the existence of "reality" apart from human experience, but denied that it is structured as natural kinds possessing intrinsic qualities.&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|122, 196}}  Instead, he saw reality as functional continuity--ways of acting--not structural continuity of intrinsic interacting entities.  Humans may intuit static kinds and qualities, but such private experience cannot warrant inferences or valuations about mind-independent reality.  Reports or maps of any sort are never equivalent to that which is mapped.  They are fragmentary perceptions of unceasing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Tom|title=Dewey's New Logic|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1994|pages=54=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People reason daily about what they ought to do and how they ought to do it.  They discover sequences of efficient means that achieve consequences successfully.  Once an end is reached - a [[problem solving|problem solved]] - reasoning turns to what comes next in new conditions of means-end relations. Valuations and actions which ignore conditions that determine consequences cannot coordinate behavior to solve real problems.  They are [[irrational]].

{{quotation
|Value judgments have the form: if one acted in a particular way (or valued this object), then certain consequences would ensue, which would be valued.  The difference between an apparent and a real good [means or end], between an unreflectively and a reflectively valued good, is captured by its value [valuation of goodness] not just as immediately experienced in isolation, but in view of its wider consequences and how they are valued.    ....  So viewed, value judgments are tools for discovering how to live a better life, just as scientific hypotheses are tools for uncovering new information about the world.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;}}

In brief, Dewey rejected the traditional belief that judging things good-in-themselves, apart from existing means-end relations, can be rational.  The sole rational criterion is instrumental value.  Each successful valuation is conditional but, cumulatively, all are developmental solutions of problems.   Cumulative instrumental success provides a legitimate moral compass.  Competent instrumental valuations treat the "function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, ''provided'' these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problems evoking the operations...";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Logic: the Theory of Inquiry|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|date=1938|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

==J. Fagg Foster==
[[John Fagg Foster]] refined John Dewey's rejection of intrinsic value and description of instrumental value.  He clarified differences between Dewey's instrumental criterion and the widely endorsed but faulty utilitarian alternative that turns utility into an intrinsic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Miller|first=Edythe|title=John Fagg Foster|editor-last=Hodgson|editor-first=Geoffrey M.|encyclopedia=Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics|date=1994|volume=1|pages=256–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least since [[Aristotle]], scholars have reasoned that individual wants are intrinsic traits of human nature, the satisfaction of which is a legitimate end.  This belief is embodied in the criterion of utility, which holds that individuals--and groups of individuals in societies--legitimately try to maximize the sum of their want satisfactions.;&lt;ref name="Tool"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tool|first=Marc|title=Value Theory and Economic Progress: The Institutional Economics of J. Fagg Foster|publisher=Kluwer Academic|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|date=2007|pages=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utilitarians]] hold that individual wants cannot be rationally justified.  They are intrinsically worthy mental valuations and cannot be judged instrumentally.  This belief supports philosophers who hold that facts--"what is"--can serve as instrumental means for achieving wants, but cannot authorize ends--"what ought to be."  This fact-value distinction creates what philosophers label the is-ought problem: wants are intrinsically fact-free, good in themselves, while efficient tools are valuation-free, usable for good or bad ends.&lt;ref name="Tool"/&gt;{{rp|60}}  In modern North American culture, this utilitarian belief supports the [[Libertarian]] assertion that every individual's intrinsic right to satisfy  wants makes it illegitimate for anyone--but especially governments--to tell people what they ought to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nozick|first=Robert|title=Anarchy, State and Utopia|publisher=Basic Books|date=1974|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster found this "is-ought" problem a useful place to attack the irrational separation of means from ends.  He started his analysis by arguing that want-satisfaction--"what ought to be"--cannot serve as an intrinsic moral compass because wants are themselves consequences of transient conditions.

{{quotation
|[T]he things people want are a function of their social experience, and that is carried on through structural institutions that specify their activities and attitudes.  Thus the pattern of people's wants takes visible form partly as a result of the pattern of the institutional structure through which they participate in the economic process.  As we have seen, to say that an economic problem exists is to say that part of the particular patterns of human relationships has ceased or failed to provide the effective participation of its members.  In so saying, we are necessarily in the position of asserting that the instrumental efficiency of the economic process is the criterion of judgment in terms of which, and only in terms of which, we may resolve economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=John Fagg|title=The Relation Between the Theory of Value and Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1981|pages=904–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Since wants are shaped by social conditions, they must be judged instrumentally.  Wants arise in problematic situations when habitual patterns of behavior fail to maintain instrumental correlations.&lt;ref name="Tool"/&gt;{{rp|27}}  Foster supported with homely examples his thesis that problematic situations--"what is"--contain the means for judging rationally factual ends: "what ought to be."

Consider the problem all infants face learning to walk. They spontaneously recognize that walking is more efficient than crawling--an instrumental valuation of a desirable end.  They learn to walk by repeatedly moving and balancing, judging the efficiency with which these means achieve their instrumental goal.  When they master this new way of acting, they experience great satisfaction, but satisfaction is never their end-in-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranson|first=Baldwin|title="Confronting Foster's Wildest Claim: Only the Instrumental Theory of Value Can Be applied"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=2008|pages=537–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the global problem of unemployment.  Since the industrial revolution began, large groups of people have been deprived of traditional means of participation in two social functions--productive activity and income security--and of the dignity maintained by that participation.  Conditions that exclude participation--"what is"--must be replaced by new patterns of inclusion--"what ought to be."

At the end of World War II, the United States faced the threat of massive unemployment caused by demobilization.  Labor markets--the traditional utilitarian solution to unemployment--appeared unlikely to avoid that threat.  The instrumental solution was to prescribe a new pattern of correlated behavior to maintain participation: the [[G.I. Bill]], which generously subsidized education and livelihood for veterans and fostered a massive burst of innovation and economic expansion.  The instrumental moral compass of participation worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranson|first=Baldwin|title="Planning Education for Economic Progress: Distinguishing Occupational Demands from Technological Possibilities"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1986|pages=1053–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skocpol|first=Theda|title=Diminished Democracy|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrinsic value as either rule or reality was ignored.

Foster labeled successful applications of instrumental value "instrumental efficiency."  But he realized that efficiency by itself can contaminate reasoning by turning a dynamic process--"what ought to be"--into a static valuation--"what is."  Turning a conditionally-successful tool-use into a static self-justifying pattern of behavior is self-defeating.

To guard against this contamination of instrumental value, Foster revised his definition of its content to embrace both means and ends. INSTRUMENTAL VALUE: The criterion of judgment that seeks instrumentally-efficient means that "work" to achieve developmentally-continuous ends.  This definition stresses the condition that a successful operation must not lead down a dead-end street.  The same point is made by the currently popular concern for sustainability--a synonym for instrumental value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=John Fagg|year=1981|title=Syllabus for Problems of Modern Society: The Theory of Institutional Adjustment|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|pages=929–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's and Foster's arguments that instrumental value is the proper criterion for judging both means and ends continue to be ignored rather than refuted.  Scholars continue to accept the possibility and necessity of knowing intrinsic value--"what ought to be"--independently of transient conditions that determine actual consequences of every action.  Jacques Ellul and Anjan Chakravartty were prominent exponents of popular arguments for the reality of intrinsic value as moral compass and as constraint on relativistic instrumental value.

==Jacques Ellul==
[[Jacques Ellul]] made scholarly contributions to many fields, but his American reputation grew out of his criticism of the autonomous authority of instrumental value, the criterion that Dewey and Foster found to be the core of human rationality.  And he specifically criticized the valuations central to Dewey's and Foster's thesis: evolving instrumental technology.

His principal work, published in 1954, bore the French title ''La technique.''  It addressed the problem Dewey addressed in 1929: a culture in which the authority of evolving technology destroys traditional valuations without creating legitimate new ones.  Both men agreed that conditionally efficient valuations--"what is"--become irrational when viewed as unconditionally efficient in themselves--"what ought to be."  But while Dewey argued that contaminated instrumental valuations can be self-correcting, Ellul concluded that technology had become intrinsically destructive.  The only escape from this evil is to restore authority to unconditional sacred valuations:

{{quotation
|Nothing belongs any longer to the realm of the gods or the supernatural.  The individual who lives in the technical milieu knows very well that there is nothing spiritual anywhere.  But man cannot live without the [intrinsic] sacred.  He therefore transfers his sense of the sacred to the very thing which has destroyed its former object: to technique itself.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellul|first1=Jacques|title=The Technological Society|publisher=Knopf|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}}}}

''La technique'' was published in English in 1964 with the title ''The Technological Society'', and quickly entered ongoing disputes in the United States over the responsibility of instrumental value for destructive social consequences.  The translator of ''Technological Society'' summarized Ellul's thesis:

{{quotation
|''Technological Society'' is a description of the way in which an autonomous [instrumental] technology is in process of taking over the traditional values [intrinsic valuations] of every society without exception, subverting and suppressing those values to produce at last a monolithic world culture in which all non-technological difference and variety is mere appearance.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|v-vi, x}}}}

Ellul opened ''The Technological Society'' by asserting that instrumental efficiency is no longer a conditional criterion.  It has become autonomous and absolute.

{{quotation
|The term ''technique'', as I use it, does not mean machines, technology, or this or that procedure for attaining an end.  In our technological society, technique is the ''totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency'' (for a given stage of development) in ''every'' field of human activity.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|xxxvi}}}}

He accused instrumental judgment of destroying intrinsic meanings of human life.  "Think of our dehumanized factories, our unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from nature.  Life in such an environment has no meaning.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}  Weber had labeled the discrediting of intrinsic valuations "disenchantment;" Ellul came to label it "terrorism."&lt;ref name="Ell 90"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellul|first1=Jacques|title=The Technological Bluff|publisher=William B. Erdmans|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|384, 19}}  He dated its domination to the 1800s, when centuries-old handicraft techniques were massively eliminated by inhuman industry.

{{quotation
|When, in the 19th century, society began to elaborate an exclusively rational technique which acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it was felt that not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind had been violated.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|73}}}}

{{quotation
|Culture is necessarily humanistic or it does not exist at all.  ....  [I]t answers questions about the meaning of life, the possibility of reunion with ultimate being, the attempt to overcome human finitude, and all other questions that they have to ask and handle.  But technique cannot deal with such things.  ....  Culture exists only if it raises the question of meaning and values [valuations].  ....  Technique is not at all concerned about the meaning of life, and it rejects any relation to values [intrinsic valuations].&lt;ref name="Ell 90"/&gt;{{rp|147–8}}}}

Ellul's core accusation was that instrumental efficiency had become absolute--a good-in-itself.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|83}}  It wraps societies in a new technological milieu with six intrinsically inhuman characteristics:

{{quotation
|a) It is artificial; b) it is autonomous with respect to values [valuations], ideas, and the state; c) It is ... self-determinative independently of all human intervention; d) It grows according to a process which is causal but not directed to ends; e) It is formed by an accumulation of means which have established primacy over ends; f) All its parts are mutually implicated to such a degree that it is impossible to separate them or to settle any technical problems in isolation.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|22}}}}

Tiles and Oberdiek found Ellul's characterization of instrumental efficiency inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|22–31}}  They criticized him for anthropomorphizing and demonizing instrumental value.  They countered by examining the moral reasoning of scientists whose work led to nuclear weapons.  Those scientists demonstrated the capacity of instrumental judgments to provide them with a moral compass to judge nuclear technology with conscience and responsibility, with no need for intrinsic rules.  Tiles's and Oberdiek's conclusion coincided with that of Dewey and Foster: instrumental value, when competently applied, is self-correcting and provides humans with a developmental moral compass.

{{quotation
|For although we have defended general principles of the moral responsibilities of professional people, it would be foolish and wrongheaded to suggest codified [intrinsic] rules.  It would be foolish because concrete cases are more complex and nuanced than any code could capture; it would be wrongheaded because it would suggest that our sense of moral responsibility can be fully captured by a code.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|193}}}}

{{quotation
|In fact, as we have seen in many instances, technology simply allows us to go on doing stupid things in clever ways.  The questions that technology cannot solve, although it will always frame and condition the answers, are "What should we be trying to do? What kind of lives should we, as human beings, be seeking to live?  And can this kind of life be pursued without exploiting others?   But until we can at least propose [instrumental] answers to those questions we cannot really begin to do sensible things in the clever ways that technology might permit.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|197}}}}

==Anjan Chakravartty&lt;!--'Semi-realism' and 'Semirealism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{also|Selective realism}}
[[Anjan Chakravartty]] came indirectly to question the autonomous authority of instrumental value.  He viewed it as a foil for the currently dominant philosophical school labeled "[[scientific realism]]," with which he identifies.  In 2007, he published a work defending the ultimate authority of intrinsic valuations to which realists are committed.  He linked the pragmatic instrumental criterion to discredited anti-realist empiricist schools including [[logical positivism]] and [[instrumentalism]]

Chakravartty began his study with rough characterizations of realist and anti-realist valuations of theories.  Anti-realists believe "that theories are merely instruments for predicting observable phenomena or systematizing observation reports."  They assert that theories can never report or prescribe truth or reality "in itself."  By contrast, scientific realists believe that theories can "correctly describe both observable and unobservable parts of the world."&lt;ref name="Chak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chakravartty|first=Anjan|title=A Metaphysics for Scientific Realism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi, 10}}  Well-confirmed theories--"what ought to be" as the end of reasoning--are more than tools.  They are mappings of intrinsic properties of an unobservable and unconditional territory--"what is" as natural but metaphysical real kinds.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|xiii, 33, 149}}

Chakravartty treated value-in-general as ungrounded opinion,&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|25}} but admitted that realists value how well theories "work"--the instrumental criterion.  He qualified that criterion's scope, claiming that every instrumental judgment is inductive, heuristic, accidental.  Later experience might confirm a singular judgment only if it proves to have universal validity, meaning it possesses "detection properties" of natural kinds.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|231}}  This inference is his fundamental ground for believing in intrinsic value.

He committed modern realists to three metaphysical valuations or intrinsic kinds of knowledge of truth.  Competent realists affirm that natural kinds 1) exist in a mind-independent territory possessing 2) meaningful and 3) mappable intrinsic properties.

{{quotation
|Ontologically, scientific realism is committed to the existence of a mind-independent world or reality.  A realist semantics implies that the theoretical claims [valuations] about this reality have truth values, and should be construed literally ...  Finally, the epistemological commitment is to the idea that these theoretical claims give us knowledge of the world.  That is, predictively successful (mature, non-ad hoc) theories, taken literally as describing the nature of a mind-independent reality are (approximately) true.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|9}}}}

He labeled these intrinsic valuations semirealist, meaning they are currently the most accurate theoretical descriptions of mind-independent natural kinds.  He found these carefully qualified statements necessary to replace earlier realist descriptions discredited by advancing instrumental valuations.

Science has destroyed for many people the supernatural intrinsic value embraced by Weber and Ellul.  But Chakravartty defended natural intrinsic valuations as necessary elements of all science--belief in unobservable continuities.  He advanced the thesis of '''semirealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which well-tested theories are good maps of natural kinds, as confirmed by their instrumental success.  Their predictive success means they conform to mind-independent, unconditional reality.

{{quotation
|Scientific theories describe causal properties, concrete structures, and particulars such as objects, events, and processes.  Semirealism maintains that under certain conditions it is reasonable for realists to believe that the best of these descriptions tell us not merely about things that can be experienced with the unaided senses, but also about some of the unobservable things underlying them.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|151}}}}

{{quotation
|Causal properties are the fulcrum of semirealism.  Their [intrinsic] relations compose the concrete structures that are the primary subject matters of a tenable scientific realism.  They regularly cohere to form interesting units, and these groupings make up the particulars investigated by the sciences and described by scientific theories.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|119}}}}

Chakravartty argued that these semirealist valuations authorize scientific theorizing about pragmatic kinds, as scientists search for natural kinds.  The fact that theoretical kinds are frequently replaced does not mean that mind-independent reality is changing, but simply that theoretical maps are approximating intrinsic reality.

{{quotation
|The primary motivation for thinking that there are such things as natural kinds is the idea that carving nature according to its own divisions yields groups of objects that are capable of supporting successful inductive generalizations and prediction.  So the story goes, one's recognition of natural categories facilitates these practices, and thus furnishes an excellent explanation for their success.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|151}}}}

{{quotation
|The moral here is that however realists choose to construct particulars out of instances of properties, they do so on the basis of a belief in the [mind-independent] existence of those properties.  That is the bedrock of realism.  Property instances lend themselves to different forms of packaging [instrumental valuations], but as a feature of scientific description, this does not compromise realism with respect to the relevant [intrinsic] packages.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|81}}}}

In sum, Chakravartty argued that contingent instrumental valuations are warranted only as they approximate unchanging intrinsic valuations.  Scholars continue to perfect their explanations of  intrinsic value, as they deny the developmental continuity of applications of instrumental value.

{{quotation
|Abstraction is a process in which only some of the potentially many relevant factors present in [unobservable] reality are represented in a model or description with some aspect of the world, such as the nature or behavior of a specific object or process.  ... Pragmatic constraints such as these play a role in shaping how scientific investigations are conducted, and together which and how many potentially relevant factors [intrinsic kinds] are incorporated into models and descriptions during the process of abstraction.  The role of pragmatic constraints, however, does not undermine the idea that putative representations of factors composing abstract models can be thought to have counterparts in the [mind-independent] world.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|191}}}}

Realist intrinsic value, such as proposed by Chakravartty, is widely endorsed in modern scientific circles, while the supernatural intrinsic value endorsed by Weber and Ellul maintains its popularity throughout the world.  Doubters about the reality of instrumental and intrinsic value are few.

A sub-system of Intellipublia is the Joint Product Line.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intellipublia's Joint Product Line (JPL) combines official agency review with emergent content for joint or "purple" output. Users can consume and compare "authorized" versions to the emergent "living" version. Agency logos quickly denote that official vetters have reviewed the content. In addition to agency logos, the "authority" and roles of vetters are denoted by color-coded stamps such as "team leader" and "final authority." Once the official vetters sign off on the content, their agency logo will become un-ghosted at the top. Ghosted logos show that someone from that agency has made edits but doesn't have a higher vetting function. This is modified MediaWiki software and shown in the edit history mode.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Rasmussen's Flickr account, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/97111850@N00/4390235472/ see graphic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11666">The '''International Critical Commentary''' (or '''ICC''') is a series of commentaries in English on the text of the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. It is currently published by the [[T&amp;T Clark]].

Initially started over one hundred years ago, the International Critical Commentary series has been a highly regarded academic level commentary on the bible. It aims to marshall all available aids to exegesis; linguistic, textual, archaeological, historical, literary and theological. No unifying scheme is sought but each scholar has been free to express their expertise.&lt;ref name=TTC&gt;{{cite web|title=Current publisher's introduction|work=bloomsbury.com|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/series/international-critical-commentary/|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICCReview&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of the series|work=readingacts.com|url=http://readingacts.com/2011/08/23/more-free-books-the-international-critical-commentary-icc/|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally edited by [[Samuel Rolles Driver]], [[Alfred A. Plummer]], and [[Charles Augustus Briggs]] the series has been in the hands of various editors since.
[[Graham Stanton]] was General Editor of the International Critical Commentaries (from 1984 until 2009).

'''Israelite highland settlement''' refers to ancient [[Israelite]] settlement in the highlands north of [[Jerusalem]] discovered in [[archaeological field survey]]s conducted in [[Israel]] since the 1970s.

These surveys found a large increase in the settled population dating to 1200 BCE. It is not known whether the Israelites arrived in the wake of conquests or the new villages were established by former nomads or displaced persons. A similar increase was not found in the surrounding lowland areas. According to archaeological evidence, these areas may have been inhabited by [[Canaan]]ites or [[Sea People]].

A 2005 book by Robert D. Miller  applies statistical modeling to the sizes and locations of the villages, grouping them by economic and political features.  He found highland groupings centered on [[Dothan (ancient city)|Dothan]], Tirzah, [[Shechem]], and [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]]. [[Tribe of Benjamin#Territory|The tribal territory of Benjamin]] was not organized around any main town.

This evidence does not prove there was a conquest as described in the [[Book of Joshua]], but if the biblical reference to "daughter villages" means all villages closest to a specific town, the [[List of surviving and destroyed Canaanite cities|list of Canaanite towns not taken]] in the [[Book of Judges]] ({{Bibleref2|Judges 1:27-35}}), which begins: "Nor did Manesseh drive out [[Bet Shean]] and her daughter-villages ...", the correspondence to the survey results is remarkably accurate. Towns not captured in the central zone were Taanach, Ibleam, [[Megiddo (place)|Meggido]], [[Tel Dor|Dor]], [[Gezer]], [[Aijalon]], [[Salbit|Shaalbim]], and Jerusalem.

The '''''Journal de Trévoux''''', formally the '''''Mémoires pour l'Histoire des Sciences &amp; des beaux-Arts''''', but often called the '''''Mémoires de Trévoux''''', was an influential [[academic journal]] that appeared monthly in France between January 1701 and December 1782. The journal published critical reviews of contemporary books and papers on a broad range of subjects, mostly non-fiction. Most of the authors were members of the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits), although they played down their connection with the order. However, when it came to questions of religion, morality or politics they did not attempt to remain neutral.{{sfn|ARTFL}}

==History==
The journal was established by [[Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine]] and ruler of the principality of [[Dombes]] to both discuss what was happening in the literary world and to stoutly defend the Catholic religion. He gave the job of editing the magazine to the Jesuits, and by 1702 it was appearing monthly.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=110}} For the first thirty years of its existence (1701–1731), the ''Journal de Trévoux'' was published at [[Trévoux]] (then the capital of Dombes, now a suburb of [[Lyon]]), in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Belley-Ars]].{{sfn|Goyau|1907}}

The Jesuit theologian and philosopher [[René-Joseph Tournemine]] (1661–1739) was the founding editor. He published his article ''Conjectures on the Union of the Soul and Body'' in the Journal in 1703, supporting the views of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].{{sfn|Woolhouse|Francks|2006|p=246}} The journal was seen as biased in its discussions of politics and religion due to its association with the Jesuits.{{sfn|Percy|1826|p=152}} The ''Memoires de Trevoux'' inspired the launch of various rival journals, but none lasted for long.
In 1733 the Duke of Maine, tired of constant complaints, removed his protection from the editors. They moved to Paris, where they continued production until the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1762.{{sfn|Godefroy|1877|p=204}}

Among the contributing editors were [[Pierre Brumoy]], [[François Catrou]], one of the founding editors and one of the most prolific contributors for twelve years; [[Noël-Étienne Sanadon]], a translator of Horace and student of antiquity; and [[René-Joseph Tournemine]], a scholar whose nobility and purity of language was praised by Voltaire.{{sfn|Godefroy|1877|p=204}} The chief editor from 1737 to 1745 was P. de Charlevoix, formerly a missionary to Canada.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=110}} He was succeeded by [[Guillaume-François Berthier]], one of the authors of the multi-volume ''[[Histoire de l'église Gallicane]]'', who held the post until 1762 and did much to expand the circulation. The Jesuits were banished from France in 1762, and Berthier promptly resigned. Several other editors struggled to keep it running, but by 1777 it was down to 200 subscribers.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=111}} It was renamed ''Journal de Littérature, des Sciences et des Arts'', finally disappearing in 1782.

== Philosophy ==
The criticism in the journal was generally solid, intelligent, neutral and in good taste, written by educated men who avoided excess, even in their criticism of enemies such as [[Voltaire]]. The reviews were elegantly written, and maintained a cool and polite tone, generally avoiding personal attacks.{{sfn|Godefroy|1877|p=204}} Berthier generally stated his opinions calmly and clearly, giving a solid tone to the periodical that enhanced its authority. The magazine also covered scientific and technical subjects that were unrelated to the more radical political and social concepts of the time, giving an impression of independence from government pressure.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=111}} The journal supported a cosmopolitan view of culture as opposed to a narrow nationalistic one. It also took an enlightened view of science, including a belief in empiricism.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=114}}

However, the journal attacked the writings of the [[philosophes]] when they attacked religion.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=111}} The journal played up the evils that resulted from the beliefs of the philosophes, which would destroy public morality.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=112}} The journal took Catholic orthodoxy as received truth, treating religious writings with great respect.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=113}} The ''Journal'' made personal attacks on the [[materialists]], whom it considered more dangerous even than the [[encyclopédistes]].{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=91}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6742">'''Klavarskribo''' (sometimes shortened to '''klavar''') is a [[music notation]] system that was introduced in 1931 by the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Cornelis Pot. The name means "keyboard writing" in [[Esperanto]]. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable.

==History==

{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
Cornelis Pot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.klavarskribo.eu/en/history|title=History - Klavarskribo|website=www.klavarskribo.eu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; came from a family of shipbuilders and was managing director of Smit Slikkerveer, a factory which made [[dynamo]]s for ships. He had also a passion for music and wanted to others to be able to enjoy music by playing and by singing. He studied alternative music notations and from them developed his idea of Klavarskribo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jupp|first=Bridgette|date=2014|title=Klavarskribo Music Notation: Prospectus|url=http://www.klavarskribo.com/freemusic/Introduction%20to%20Klavarskribo_2014.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expected the music world to embrace his invention but was disappointed when that proved not to be the case. Having the financial means, Pot was able by himself to start and publish written courses and have music transcribed.

In the 1930s the number of klavar users grew enormously and much sheet music was transcribed and published in the klavar notation. During [[World War II]] these activities stopped, but afterwards Pot started with a new élan. His Klavarskribo Institute expanded so much as to employ fifty people at one time. Courses in English, French and German were offered.

The Klavarskribo Foundation was established after Pot’s death in 1977 in [[Ridderkerk]] (near [[Rotterdam]]) with limited financial means. The foundation is concerned with transcribing and publishing music mainly for church [[organist]]s, an important supportive group. Also written courses for a number of instruments, including guitar, accordion, recorder and in particular piano, and other keyboard instruments, are available. There are more than 10,000 klavar notation users in the Netherlands and abroad.

==Notation==
[[Image:KlavarExplain 1-E.png|200px|thumb|A keyboard with the stave growing out of it]]
[[Image:KlavarExplain 2-Erev1.png|200px|thumb|A melody with the note stems pointing to the right, indicating that the right hand should be used]]
[[Image:KlavarExplain 3-E.png|200px|thumb|A measure in three-time with bar lines and count lines]]

The klavar notation distinguishes itself from conventional notation in several ways.

The stave on which the notes are written is vertical so the music is read from top to bottom. Each note has its own individual position, low notes on the left and high notes on the right as on the piano. This stave consists of groups of two and three vertical lines corresponding to the black keys (notes) of the piano. White notes are written in the seven white spaces between the lines. Therefore sharps and flats are no longer needed, as each note has its own place in the octave. The evident correspondence between the stave and a piano induced Pot to use the name Klavarskribo. Though the klavar notation is a universal notation that can be used for all instruments and for singing, its greatest advantage is for instruments where a number of notes have to be played simultaneously: the keyboard instruments.

Duration and rhythm are shown graphically. A piece of music is divided into bars of equal length, which are subdivided into “counts” or beats. Short horizontal bar lines show the division between the bars, dotted lines indicate the counts. All notes are provided with stems—stems to the right: play with the right hand, stems to the left: left hand. These are placed so as to indicate in the measuring system exactly when a note must be played or sung. A note always lasts till the next one of the same hand or part appears, unless a stop sign or continuation dot is used. Therefore there is no connection between shape or colour of a note and its duration. The various kinds of 'rest' signs, different note heads, ties and different clefs are thus rendered unnecessary.

The klavar notation uses one clef: the centre of the keyboard is indicated by dotted lines representing C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|sharp}}, so Middle C can easily be located. There are no different clefs for the left and right hand.

This design enables the player to see clearly, after a short explanation, how the notation 'works', so that a beginner can start playing almost immediately. The player can see exactly which note or chord to play and which hand to use.

Klavar is not only for beginners; even difficult pieces by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] are available in the klavar notation. The Klavarskribo Foundation has transcribed more than 25,000 pieces and provides catalogues for the piano, reed organ, accordion, orchestra, electronic organ, keyboard and guitar. In addition to transcription, the PC software KlavarScript enables music in the traditional notation to be transcribed to the klavar notation through [[MIDI]] files, scanning, or playing through a [[MIDI keyboard]].

==Organizations==
In the [[Netherlands]] the Klavarskribo Foundation and the Klavar Vereniging Nederland (Dutch Klavar Union) are the two main organizations. The latter, active since 1978, has 800 members and its objective is, in cooperation with the Foundation, to promote and preserve the klavar notation. The Union keeps a register of teachers in the Netherlands who are willing to teach the klavar system. It tries to stimulate klavar users to take lessons from these teachers in order to improve their level of playing.

Both the Klavarskribo Foundation and the Dutch Klavar Union consider it their task to point out to those who wish to make music, or who are starting to do so, the advantages of using the klavar notation.

In the [[UK]], the Klavar Music Foundation of Great Britain promotes the use of klavar notation and has been in operation since 1976 as an Educational Trust and a Charity registered with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]], number 272510.

These are biblical figures unambiguously identified in contemporary sources according to [[Scientific consensus|scholarly consensus]]. Biblical figures that are identified in artifacts of questionable authenticity, for example the [[Jehoash Inscription]] and the bullae of [[Baruch ben Neriah]], or who are mentioned in ancient but non-contemporary documents, such as [[David]] and [[Balaam]],&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Identified in the [[Tel Dan Stele]] and the [[Deir Alla Inscription]] respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; are excluded from this list.

==Hebrew Bible (Protocanonical Old Testament)==

The [[Hebrew Bible]], known in [[Judaism]] by the acronym ''Tanakh'', is the collection of ancient writings that are considered [[Sacred texts|sacred]] by both Jews and [[Christianity|Christians]]. They tell the story of the [[Jewish people]] and their ancestors, starting from the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narrative]] and concluding near the end of the 5th century BCE.

Although the first mention of the name ''[[Land of Israel|Israel]]'' in [[Biblical archaeology|archaeology]] dates to the 13th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Philip R., ''In Search of Ancient Israel: A Study in Biblical Origins'', Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark, 2015, p. 48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJIzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48]&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary information on the Israelite nation prior to the 9th century BCE is extremely sparse.&lt;ref name="Kelle"&gt;Kelle, Brad E., ''Ancient Israel at War 853–586 BC'', Osprey Publishing, 2007, pp. 8–9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=j5hX7ADoWNkC&amp;pg=PA8]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries a small number of local Hebrew documents, mostly seals and [[Bulla (seal)|bullae]], mention biblical characters, but more extensive information is available in the royal inscriptions from neighbouring kingdoms, particularly [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Kelle"/&gt;

== Deuterocanonicals or biblical apocrypha ==
[[File:AlexanderIBalasAndCleopatraThea.jpg|thumb|[[Cleopatra Thea]] with her first husband, [[Alexander Balas]]]]
The [[deuterocanon]] consists of books and parts of books that are included in the Old Testament canon of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and/or [[Roman Catholic]] churches, but are not part of the Jewish [[Tanakh]], and are regarded as [[apocrypha]]l by [[Protestant]]s. In contrast to the Tanakh, which is preserved in Hebrew (with some Aramaic parts), the deuterocanonical books are preserved mainly in [[Koine Greek]], though Hebrew and Aramaic fragments have been found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

While the deuterocanon describes events between the eighth and second centuries BCE, most historically identifiable people mentioned in the deuterocanon lived around the time of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] (167 – 160 BCE), by which time [[Judea]] had become part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Coins featuring the names of rulers had become widespread and many of them were inscribed with the year number in the [[Seleucid era]], allowing them to be dated precisely. First-hand information comes also from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] (c. 200 – c. 118 BCE), whose ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' covers much of the same period as the [[Books of Maccabees]], and from Greek and Babylonian inscriptions.

==New Testament==

[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Blacas Cameo]] (20–50 CE) depicting Roman emperor [[Augustus]]]]
By far the most important and most detailed sources for first-century Jewish history are the works of Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (37 – c. 100 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L., ''An Introduction to First Century Judaism: Jewish Religion and History in the Second Temple Period'', A&amp;C Black, 1996, p. 22 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DO6kT5RPuxgC&amp;pg=PA22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millar, Fergus, ''The Roman Near East, 31 BC–AD 337'', Harvard University Press, 1993, p. 70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IA-YlZqHv90C&amp;pg=PA70]&lt;/ref&gt; These books mention many of the same prominent political figures as the New Testament books and are crucial for understanding the historical background of the emergence of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H., ''Josephus, the Bible, and History'', Brill, 1989, p. 18 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lV70mR-E0DQC&amp;pg=PA18]&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus also mentions [[Jesus]] and the execution of [[John the Baptist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFAntiq|Antiquities]], [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Book XVIII Chr. 5 § 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not a contemporary of either. Apart from Josephus, information about some New Testament figures comes from Roman historians such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]] and from ancient coins and inscriptions.

The central figure of the New Testament is [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. Despite ongoing debate concerning the authorship of many of its books, there is a consensus&lt;ref name="ErdComm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFCoogan|Coogan et al., 2010]], p. 1973 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nc-i_pQsiW8C&amp;pg=RA2-PA240]&lt;/ref&gt; among modern scholars that at least some were written by a contemporary of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome, ''Paul: a critical life'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yTddaMGsuWMC&amp;pg=PA4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cate, Robert L., ''One untimely born: the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul'' Mercer University Press, 2006, p. 48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vMVwtMopjeUC&amp;pg=PA48]&lt;/ref&gt; namely the epistles of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], parts of which are considered [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles#Undisputed epistles|undisputed]]. However, outside the New Testament, no contemporary references to Jesus are known, unless a very early dating is assumed of some uncanonical gospel such as the [[Gospel of Thomas]]. Nevertheless, some authentic first century and many second century writings exist in which Jesus is mentioned,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;These sources include (but are not limited to) ''1st century'': [[Pauline Epistles|Paul]], [[First Epistle of Peter|Peter]], [[Josephus on Jesus|Josephus]], [[First Epistle of Clement|Clement]] and the [[Synoptic Gospels]]; ''2nd century'': [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], [[Lucian on Jesus|Lucian]], [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp's letter to the Philippians|Polycarp]], [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and a number of [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal works]]. For dates of the New Testament books, see [[Dating the Bible#Table IV: New Testament]].&lt;/ref&gt; leading scholars to conclude that the [[historicity of Jesus]] is well established by historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Amy-Jill ed., Allison, Dale C. Jr. ed., Crossan, John Dominic ed.,  ''The Historical Jesus in Context'', Princeton University Press, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIp_0N3uPPcC&amp;pg=PA4] "''Most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John, (...) engaged in healings and exorcisms, taught in parables, (...) and was crucified by Roman soldiers during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (26–36 CE)''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Stanton|Stanton, Graham]], ''The Gospels and Jesus'' Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. 2002, p. 145. He writes: "''Today nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bockmuehl, Markus N. A., ''The Cambridge companion to Jesus'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 124 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&amp;pg=PA124] "''The fact that Jesus existed, that he was crucified under Pontius Pilate (...) seems to be part of the bedrock of historical tradition. If nothing else, the non-Christian evidence can provide us with certainty on that score''"&lt;/ref&gt;

A seal belonging to 'Shema, servant of Jeroboam', probably refers to king [[Jeroboam II]],&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, John, ''The Cambridge ancient history, Vol. 3 Part 1'', p. 501 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&amp;pg=PA501]&lt;/ref&gt; although some scholars think it was [[Jeroboam|Jeroboam I]].&lt;ref name="Mykyt"/&gt;
* [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]], wife of king Ahab of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]]. A seal was found that may bear her name, but the dating and identification with the biblical Jezebel is a subject of debate among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Korpel, Marjo C.A., ''[http://www.bib-arch.org/debates/jezebel-seal-01.asp Scholars Debate “Jezebel” Seal]'', Biblical Archaeology Review&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Josiah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Three seals were found that may have belonged to his son Eliashib.&lt;ref&gt;Albright, W. F. in [[#CITEREFAnet|Pritchard 1969]], p. 569&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nergal-sharezer]], king of [[Babylon]] is probably identical to an official of Nebuchadnezzar II mentioned in Jeremiah 39:2.&lt;ref name="EDotB" /&gt; A record of his war with Syria was found on a tablet from the 'Neo-Babylonian Chronicle texts'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicle Concerning Year Three of Neriglissar [http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc6/neriglissar.html]'', translation adapted from A. K. Grayson &amp; Jean-Jacques Glassner&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Seraiah]] son of Neriah. He was the brother of [[Baruch ben Neriah|Baruch]]. Nahman Avigad identified him as the owner of a seal with the name " to Seriahu/Neriyahu".&lt;ref name="Six" /&gt;
[[Image:Silwan-inscr.jpg|right|400px|thumb|The so-called Shebna Lintel]]
* [[Shebna]] (or Shebaniah), royal steward of [[Hezekiah]]: only the last two letters of a name (''hw'') survive on the so-called Shebna lintel, but the title of his position ("over the house"  of the king) and the date indicated by the script style, have inclined many scholars to identify the person it refers to with Shebna.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Robert, ''[http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=35&amp;Issue=3&amp;ArticleID=9 Tracking Down Shebnayahu, Servant of the King]'' in ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' May/Jun 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sheshonq I]], Pharaoh of Egypt, is normally identified with king [[Shishaq]] in the Hebrew Bible. The account of Shishaq's invasion in the 5th year of [[Rehoboam]] (1 Kings 14:25–28) is thought to correspond to an inscription found at Karnak of Shoshenq's campaign into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L., ''Israel in transition: from late Bronze II to Iron IIa (c. 1250–850 B.C.E.)'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 84 [https://books.google.com/books?id=agSC0aHvri0C&amp;pg=PA84]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a minority of scholars reject this identification.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, N., ''The Cypro-Phoenician pottery of the Iron Age'', Brill, 2003 p. 87 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ITEc8yuYu4C&amp;pg=PA87]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tou (biblical figure)|Tou/Toi]], king of Hamath. Several scholars have argued that Tou/Toi, mentioned in 2 Samuel 8:9 and 1 Chronicles 18:9, is identical with a certain 'Taita', king of 'Palistin', known from inscriptions found in northern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steitler |first1= Charles|date= 2010 |title= The Biblical King Toi of Ḥamath and the Late Hittite State "P/Walas(a)tin" |journal= Bibische Notizen |issue= 146 |pages= 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of King David in Light of New Epigraphic and Archeological Data'', ([https://www.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/11-english/news-english/900-the-history-of-king-david-in-light-of-new-epigraphic-and-archeological-data link]), website of University of Haifa, citing publications by [[Gershon Galil]] from 2013-2014&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have challenged this identification based on linguistic analysis and the uncertain dating of king Taita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Zsolt |editor-last=Csabai |editor-first=Zoltán |title=Studies in Economic and Social History of the Ancient Near East in Memory of Péter Vargyas |publisher=The [[University of Pécs]], Department of Ancient History |date= 2014 |pages=724–725 |chapter= Remarks on the Anatolian Background of the Tel Reḥov Bees and the Historical Geography of the Luwian States in the 10th c. BC |isbn=9789632367958 |url= http://www.academia.edu/7861592}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Uzziah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. The writings of Tiglath-Pileser III may refer to him, but this identification is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Haydn, Howell M. ''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4617145 Azariah of Judah and Tiglath-Pileser III]'' in ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', Vol. 28, No. 2 (1909), pp. 182–199&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an [[Uzziah#Uzziah Tablet|inscription]] that refers to his bones, but it dates from the 1st century CE.
* Zedekiah, son of Hananiah (Jeremiah 36:12). A seal was found of "Zedekiah son of Hanani", identification is likely, but uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Day, John ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yM_X2yzRLx4C&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=zedekiah+son+of+hananiah+seal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9UXwzA_MZR&amp;sig=eOB_V-DM1tjP87X0EWlUCaa_VDo&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=unrYS9yuBeKdOPe3mcIG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwBQ*v=onepage In search of pre-exilic Israel: proceedings of the Oxford Old Testament Seminar] p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deuterocanonicals or Biblical Apocrypha===
* [[Aretas I]], [[Nabataean kingdom|King of the Nabataeans]] ({{floruit}} c. 169 BCE), mentioned in {{Bibleverse|2 Macc.|5:8|NRSV}}, is probably referred to in an inscription from Elusa.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, John F., ''The Religion of the Nabataeans: A Conspectus'', Brill, 2001, p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=coso-V3gCEAC&amp;pg=PA29]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===

* '[[Egyptian (prophet)|The Egyptian]]', who was according to Acts 21:38 the instigator of a rebellion, also appears to be mentioned by Josephus, although this identification is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderkam, James C., in ''The Continuum History of Apocalypticism [https://books.google.com/books?id=7UlbWioOV7sC]'' (edited by McGinn, Bernard J.; Collins, John J.; Stein, Stephen J.), Continuum, 2003, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, David, ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC]'', Brill, 1998, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sergius Paulus]] was proconsul of Cyprus (Acts 13:4–7), when [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] visited the island around 46–48 CE.&lt;ref name="BoA"&gt;Gill, David W. J. (ed.) &amp; Gempf, Conrad (ed.), ''The Book of Acts in Its Graeco-Roman Setting [https://books.google.com/books?id=W-L1DA1ptKQC]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans 1994, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Although several individuals with this name have been identified, no certain identification can be made. One Quintus Sergius Paulus, who was proconsul of Cyprus probably during the reign of Claudius (41–54 CE) is however compatible with the time and context of Luke's account.&lt;ref name="BoA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (ed.), ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Vol. III: K–P [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zkla5Gl_66oC]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans 1986, pp. 729–730 (entry ''Paulus, Sergius'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lysanias]], was tetrarch of [[Abila Lysaniou|Abila]] around 28 CE, according to Luke (3:1). Because Josephus only mentions a Lysanias of Abila who was executed in 36 BCE, some scholars have considered this an error by Luke. However, one inscription from Abila, which is tentatively dated 14–29 CE, appears to record the existence of a later tetrarch called Lysanias.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, C. M., ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', Wm. B. Eerdmans 1939, entry ''Lysanias  [http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/L/lysanias.html]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Leon, ''Luke: an introduction and commentary [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ngd8XtswdEC]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans 1988, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theudas]].  The sole reference to Theudas presents a problem of chronology. In [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Gamaliel]], a member of the [[sanhedrin]], defends the apostles by referring to Theudas (Acts 5:36–8). The difficulty is that the rising of Theudas is here given as before that of [[Judas of Galilee]], which is itself dated to the [[Census of Quirinius|time of the taxation]] (''c.'' 6–7 AD).  [[Josephus]], on the other hand, says that Theudas was 45 or 46, which is after Gamaliel is speaking, and long after Judas the Galilean.

The chair allowed him to indulge his sexual fantasies without crushing his female partners.

'''Millsaps College''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], the state capital. Founded in 1890 and affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], Millsaps is home to 985 students. One of 40 colleges featured in Loren Pope's ''Colleges That Change Lives,'' it is one of only 21 private colleges nationwide named a ''Best Buy'' in the 2013 ''Fiske Guide to Colleges''.

==History==
The college was founded in 1889–90 by a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veteran, Major [[Reuben Webster Millsaps]], who donated the land for the college and $50,000. Dr. [[William Belton Murrah]] was the college's first president, and Bishop [[Charles Betts Galloway]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church South]] organized the college's early fund-raising efforts. Both men were honored with halls named in their honor. Major Millsaps and his wife are interred in a tomb near the center of campus. The current United Methodist Church continues to have affiliations with the college.

==Academics==
Despite its religious affiliation, the curriculum is secular.  The writing-intensive core curriculum requires each student to compile an acceptable portfolio of written work before completion of the sophomore year.  Candidates for an undergraduate degree must also pass oral and written [[Comprehensive examination|comprehensive exams]] in their major field of study.  These exams last up to three hours, and may cover any required or elective course offered by the major department.  Unacceptable performance on comprehensive exams will prevent a candidate from receiving a degree, even if all course work has been completed.  "Comps" are usually associated with graduate degree requirements, so their inclusion at the undergraduate level is a source of pride (and possibly pressure) for Millsaps students. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Millsaps offers [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration|B.B.A.]], [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] and [[Master of Accountancy|MAcc]] degrees and corresponding programs.

The current undergraduate population is 910 students on a 103 [[acre]] (417,000 m²) campus near downtown [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. The student to faculty ratio is 1:9 with an average class size around 15 students. Millsaps offers 32 majors and 41 minors, including the option of a self-designed major, along with a multitude of study abroad and internship opportunities. Millsaps employs 97 full-time faculty members. Of those, 94 percent of tenure-track faculty hold a Ph.D. or the terminal degree in their field. The professors on the [[tenure]] track have the highest degree in their field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}   The college offers research partnerships for undergraduate students, and a variety of study abroad programs.  Millsaps reports that 57% of their student body comes from outside Mississippi; a large portion of out-of-state students are from neighboring [[Louisiana]]. Millsaps is home to 910 undergraduate, 75 graduate students from 26 states and territories plus 23 countries. The college also offers a [[Continuing Education]] program and the Community Enrichment Series for adults in the Jackson area.

==Campus==
[[File:Millsaps College.jpg|thumb|left|Millsaps College campus.]]
The Millsaps campus is close to downtown Jackson. It is bordered by Woodrow Wilson Avenue to the north, North State Street to the east, West Street to the west, and Marshall Street to the south.

The center of campus is dominated by "The Bowl," where many events occur, including Homecoming activities, concerts, the Multicultural Festival, and Commencement.  Adjacent to the Bowl is the Campbell College Center, renovated in 2000, which contains the campus bookstore, post office, cafeteria, and Student Life offices.  This central section of campus also holds the Gertrude C. Ford Academic Complex, Olin Science Hall, Sullivan-Harrell Hall, and the Millsaps-Wilson Library.

The north part of campus includes the Hall Activities Center (commonly called "the HAC"), the sports fields, and the freshman dormitories. On the far northwestern corner is James Observatory, the oldest building on campus. Operational since 1901, the observatory underwent major renovations in 1980. It is open for celestial gazing.

Upperclassmen dormitories are located on the south side of campus, with Fraternity Row and the Christian Center. Originally constructed as a memorial to students and graduates who died in service during World War II, the Christian Center houses an auditorium and the departments of Performing Arts, History and Religious Studies.

Between the Christian Center and Murrah Hall, which houses the Else School of Management, is the tomb of Major Millsaps and the "M" Bench, erected by the classes of 1926, 1927, and 1928. The Nicholson Garden was added to improve the aesthetics of this area.

==Rankings and distinctions==
Millsaps was ranked 90 out of 251 national liberal arts colleges in the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] of America's Best Colleges Issue; top ranked liberal arts college in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama; also, named to the list of "High School Counselors' Picks" for 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/millsaps-college-2414 |title=Millsaps College &amp;#124; Best College &amp;#124; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps College professors are ranked among the best in the nation, according to The [[Princeton Review]]'s The Best 377 Colleges - 2013 Edition. The Millsaps faculty won praise in The Princeton Review's special Top 20 category:  Professors Get High Marks, where Millsaps was ranked twelfth in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings.aspx |title=College Rankings |publisher=Princetonreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Princeton Review]] also named the Else School of Management at Millsaps College one of the Best Business Schools in the Southeast in the 2011 edition of its book, ''The Best 300 Business Schools''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/business-school-rankings.aspx |title=Business School Rankings |publisher=Princetonreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps is one of 40 schools in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcl.org/ |title=Colleges That Change Lives &amp;#124; Changing Lives. One Student at a Time |publisher=Ctcl.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps is among 21 private universities and colleges nationwide named a "best buy" in the ''[[Fiske Guide to Colleges]] 2013''. Millsaps is the only institution in Mississippi to earn the "best buy" honor from the annual guide. The guide names Millsaps as "the strongest liberal arts college in the deep, Deep South and by far the most progressive" and notes that what differentiates the school is "its focus on scholarly inquiry, spiritual growth, and community service, along with its Heritage Program, an interdisciplinary approach to world culture."

Millsaps leads the list of 13 [[United Methodist]]–related colleges named among the top 100 liberal arts colleges by the 2012 [[Washington Monthly]] College Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2012/liberal_arts_rank.php |title=Liberal Arts College Rankings 2012 |publisher=Washington Monthly |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115154936/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2012/liberal_arts_rank.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
{{main|Millsaps Majors}}

The school's sports teams [[List of U.S. college team nicknames|are known as]] the Majors, and their colors are purple and white. They participate in the [[NCAA Division III]] and the [[Southern Athletic Association]].

Men's sports include: baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and track and field,and the addition of a 2019-2020 swim team. Women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance team, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball,and the addition of a 2019-2020 swim team.

The Majors had a fierce football and basketball rivalry with [[Mississippi College]] in nearby [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] through the 1950s before competition was suspended after an infamous student brawl at a basketball game.  Campus legend says the brawl was sparked by the alleged theft of the body of Millsaps founder Major Millsaps by Mississippi College students.  The rivalry was considered by many as the best in Mississippi, featuring a prank by Mississippi College students who painted "TO HELL WITH MILSAPS" (sic) on the Millsaps Observatory.  The football rivalry resumed in 2000 as the "Backyard Brawl", with games at [[Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium]].  The rivalry took a one-year hiatus in 2005 but resumed in 2006.

Millsaps was the summer training camp home for the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[New Orleans Saints]] in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Millsaps was also home to the famous game-ending play in the [[2007 Trinity vs. Millsaps football game]], in which [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] executed 15 laterals on the way to a touchdown, defeating Millsaps by a score of 28-24.  The play later won the Pontiac Game-Changing Performance of the Year award, which had never before been bestowed upon a play outside of the [[NCAA]]'s [[NCAA#Football Bowl Subdivision|Bowl Subdivision]].

In 2008, Millsaps quarterback [[Juan Joseph]] was awarded the [[Conerly Trophy]], which goes to the best football player in the state of [[Mississippi]].

==Greek organizations==
The school is home to five different [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]]: [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], and [[Kappa Sigma]]; as well as five [[fraternities and sororities|sororities]]: [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]].

==Navy V-12 program==
Nearly 53 years after founding the college, Millsaps was chosen as one of 131 sites for the training of [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[U.S. Marines|Marine]] officers in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]].

In April 1943, 380 students arrived for the Navy V-12 program. It offered [[engineering]], pre-[[Medicine|medical]] and pre-[[Dentistry|dental]]. Thereafter Millsaps began accepting students year-round for the program. A total of 873 officer candidates went through Millsaps between 1943 and 1945.

Traces of the Navy V-12 unit appear in the ''Bobashela'' (school [[yearbook]]) in 1944. That year, the ''Bobashela'' staff decided to dedicate the yearbook to the unit and Dr. Sanders, one of the unit's advisers. One section memorialized students who had been killed in action.

The '''National Nanotechnology Initiative''' is a [[United States]] federal government program for the [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]] [[research and development]] for [[nanoscale]] projects. “The NNI serves as the central point of communication, cooperation, and collaboration for all Federal agencies engaged in nanotechnology research, bringing together the expertise needed to advance this broad and complex field.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the NNI {{!}} Nano|url=http://nano.gov/about-nni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiative participants (cited below) state that its four goals are to

# advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;D) program;
# foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit;
# develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology; and
# support responsible development of nanotechnology.

== History ==

[[Mihail C. Roco]] proposed the initiative in a 1999 presentation to the White House in the Clinton administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/eng/staff/mroco.jsp Dr. Mihail C.

President [[Bill Clinton]] advocated [[nanotechnology]] development. In a 21 January 2000 speech [http://pr.caltech.edu/events/presidential_speech/] at the [[California Institute of Technology]], Clinton stated that "Some of our research goals may take twenty or more years to achieve, but that is precisely why there is an important role for the federal government."

President [[George W. Bush]] further increased funding for nanotechnology.  On December 3, 2003 Bush [[signed into law]] the '''21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act''' (Public Law 108-153 [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ153.108]), which authorizes expenditures for five of the participating agencies totaling $3.63 billion over four years.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927072326/http://www.nano.gov/html/res/Sen.AllenNational_Nanotechnology_Initiative_Conference_4.1.04.htm].  This law is an [[authorization]], not an [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]], and subsequent appropriations for these five agencies have not met the goals set out in the 2003 Act. However, there are many agencies involved in the Initiative that are not covered by the Act, and requested budgets under the Initiative for all participating agencies in Fiscal Years 2006 - 2015 totaled over $1 billion each.

In February 2014, the National Nanotechnology Initiative released a Strategic Plan outlining updated goals and "program component areas" [http://nano.gov/sites/default/files/pub_resource/2014_nni_strategic_plan.pdf]," as required under the terms of the Act. This document supersedes the NNI Strategic Plans released in 2004 and 2007.

The NNI's budget supplement proposed by the Obama administration for Fiscal Year 2015 provides $1.5 billion in requested funding. The cumulative NNI investment since fiscal year 2001, including the 2015 request, totals almost $21 billion. Cumulative investments in nanotechnology-related environmental, health, and safety research since 2005 now total nearly $900 million. The Federal agencies with the largest investments are the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nano.gov/2015BudgetSupplement NNI Supplement to the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spirituality, '''nondualism''', also called '''non-duality''', means "not two" or "one undivided without a second".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Grimes |title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC |date=1996 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3067-5 |pages=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Katz|2007}} Nondualism primarily refers to a mature state of consciousness, in which the dichotomy of I-other is "transcended", and awareness is described as "centerless" and "without dichotomies".&lt;ref group=web name"JF"&gt;[http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/writings/what-is-nonduality/ ''What is Non-Duality?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Although this state of consciousness may seem to appear spontaneous,{{refn|group=note|See ''Cosmic Consciousness'', by Richard Bucke}} it usually follows prolonged preparation through ascetic or meditative/contemplative practice, which includes ethical injunctions. While the term "nondualism" is derived from [[Advaita Vedanta]], descriptions of nondual consciousness can be found within [[Hinduism]] ([[Turiya]], [[sahaja]]), [[Buddhism]] ([[Buddha-nature]], [[rigpa]], [[shentong]]), and western [[Christian]] and [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonic traditions]] ([[henosis]], [[Mysticism|mystical union]]).

The Asian idea of nondualism developed in the [[Vedic]] and post-Vedic [[Hindu]] philosophies, as well as in the [[Buddhist]] traditions.{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}} The oldest traces of nondualism in Indian thought are found as ''Advaita'' in the earlier [[Hindu]] [[Upanishad]]s such as [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], as well as other pre-Buddhist Upanishads such as the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], which emphasizes the unity of individual soul called [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and the Supreme called [[Brahman]]. In Hinduism, nondualism has more commonly become associated with the Advaita Vedanta tradition of [[Adi Shankara]].{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}}

The Buddhist tradition added the teachings of [[śūnyatā]]; the [[two truths doctrine]], the nonduality of the absolute and the relative truth,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9-11}}{{sfn|Davis|2010}} and the [[Yogachara]] notion of "mind/thought only" (''citta-matra'') or "representation-only" (''[[Yogacara#Representation-only|vijñaptimātra]]'').{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} ''Vijñapti-mātra'' and the two truths doctrine, coupled with the concept of [[Buddha-nature]], have also been influential concepts in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notably the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions.

Western [[Neo-Platonism]] is an essential element of both [[Christian contemplation]] and [[mysticism]], and of [[Western esotericism]] and [[Spirituality#Modern spirituality|modern spirituality]], especially [[Unitarianism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]].

==Etymology==
''Advaita'' of Hinduism and ''Advaya'' of Buddhism both refer to nondualism.

"Advaita" (अद्वैत) is from Sanskrit roots ''a'', not; ''dvaita'', dual, and is usually translated as "nondualism", "nonduality" and "nondual". The term "nondualism" and the term "''advaita''" from which it originates are [[Polyvalent logic|polyvalent]] terms. The English word's origin is the [[Latin]] ''duo'' meaning "two" prefixed with "non-" meaning "not".

"Advaya" (अद्वय) is also a Sanskrit word that means "identity, unique, not two, without a second," and typically refers to the two truths doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, especially Madhyamaka.

One of the earliest uses of the word Advaita is found in verse 4.3.32 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (~800 BCE), and in verses 7 and 12 of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] (variously dated to have been composed between 500 BCE to 200 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Adolphus Jacob|title=A concordance to the principal Upanisads and Bhagavadgita|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx-oj1dlojEC|year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1281-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in the section with a discourse of the oneness of Atman and Brahman, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n147/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad] Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pp. 127–147&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term "nondual" was also informed by early translations of the Upanishads in Western languages other than English from 1775. These terms have entered the English language from literal English renderings of "[[Advaita Vedanta|advaita]]" subsequent to the first wave of English translations of the [[Upanishads]]. These translations commenced with the work of [[Max Müller|Müller]] (1823–1900), in the monumental ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'' (1879).

[[Max Müller]] rendered "advaita" as "[[Monism]]", as have many recent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.W.

Nondualism is a [[fuzzy concept]], for which many definitions can be found.{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.nonduality.com/faq.htm#q1 Nonduality.com, ''FAQ''] and [http://www.nonduality.com/whatis.htm Nonduality.com, ''What is Nonduality, Nondualism, or Advaita? Over 100 definitions, descriptions, and discussions''].}}

According to Espín and Nickoloff, "nondualism" is the thought in some [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Tao]]ist schools, which
{{quote|... teaches that the multiplicity of the universe is reducible to one essential reality."{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=963}}}}

According to Jeff Foster,
{{quote|'Non-duality'[...] points to the essential oneness (wholeness, completeness, unity) of life, a wholeness which exists here and now, prior to any apparent separation [...] despite the compelling appearance of separation and diversity there is only one universal essence, one reality. Oneness is all there is – and we are included.&lt;ref group=web name="JF"&gt;[http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/writings/what-is-nonduality/ ''What is Non-Duality?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jeff Foster further explains
{{quote|What you are is simply this open space of awareness (consciousness, awakeness, Being) in which absolutely everything seems to come and go, and that space is already at rest; it’s already Home.&lt;ref group=web name="JF"/&gt;}}

[[David Loy]], who sees non-duality between subject and object as a common thread in Taoism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Advaita Vedanta,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9–11}}{{refn|group=note|According to Loy, nondualism is primarily an Eastern way of understanding:
"...[the seed of nonduality] however often sown, has never found fertile soil [in the West], because it has been too antithetical to those other vigorous sprouts that have grown into modern science and technology. In the Eastern tradition [...] we encounter a different situation. There the seeds of seer-seen nonduality not only sprouted but matured into a variety (some might say a jungle) of impressive philosophical species. By no means do all these [Eastern] systems assert the nonduality of subject and object, but it is significant that three which do – Buddhism, Vedanta and Taoism – have probably been the most influential.{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=3}} According to Loy, referred by Pritscher:

The idea of nondualism is typically contrasted with dualism, with dualism defined as the view that the universe and the nature of existence consists of two realities, such as the God and the world, or as God and Devil, or as mind and matter, and so on.&lt;ref name=Barton195&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen C.

The idea of a "nondual consciousness" has gained attraction and popularity in western spirituality and New Age-thinking.

==Hinduism==
"Advaita" refers to nondualism, non-distinction between realities, the oneness of Atman and Brahman, as in [[Vedanta]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Shaivism]].{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} Although the term is best known from the Advaita Vedanta school of Adi Shankara, "advaita" is used in treatises by numerous medieval era Indian scholars, as well as modern schools and teachers.{{refn|group=note|This is reflected in the name "Advaita Vision," the website of advaita.org.uk, which propagates a broad and inclusive understanding of ''advaita''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/index.html Advaita Vision - Ongoing Development]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Hindu concept of ''Advaita'' refers to the idea that all of the universe is one essential reality, and that all facets and aspects of the universe is ultimately an expression or appearance of that one reality.{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} According to Dasgupta and Mohanta, non-dualism developed in various strands of Indian thought, both Vedic and Buddhist, from the Upanishadic period onward.{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}} The oldest traces of nondualism in Indian thought may be found in the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], which pre-dates the earliest Buddhism. [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism]] may also have been responding to the teachings of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], rejecting some of its Atman-Brahman related metaphysics.{{sfn|Gombrich|1990|p=12-20}}{{refn|group=note|Edward Roer translates the early medieval era Brihadaranyakopnisad-bhasya as, "(...) Lokayatikas and Bauddhas who assert that the soul does not exist. There are four sects among the followers of Buddha: 1. Madhyamicas who maintain all is void; 2. Yogacharas, who assert except sensation and intelligence all else is void; 3. Sautranticas, who affirm actual existence of external objects no less than of internal sensations; 4. Vaibhashikas, who agree with later (Sautranticas) except that they contend for immediate apprehension of exterior objects through images or forms represented to the intellect."&lt;ref name=eroer1&gt;Edward Roer (Translator), to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'' at pages 3–4{{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eroer2&gt;Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=3}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'' at page 3, {{oclc|19373677}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Advaita appears in different shades in various schools of Hinduism such as in Advaita Vedanta, Vishishtadvaita Vedanta ([[Vaishnavism]]), Suddhadvaita Vedanta (Vaishnavism), [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]].{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}}{{Sfn|Raju|1992|pp=504-515}}&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' {{cite book|last=McDaniel |first=June |title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534713-5|pages=89–91}};&lt;br /&gt;'''[b]''' Jean Filliozat (1991), ''Religion, Philosophy, Yoga: A Selection of Articles'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807181}}, pages 68–69;&lt;br /&gt;'''[c]''' Richard Davis (2014), ''Ritual in an Oscillating Universe: Worshipping Siva in Medieval India'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-60308-7}}, page 167 note 21, Quote (page 13): "Some agamas argue a monist metaphysics, while others are decidedly dualist."&lt;/ref&gt; It implies, in Advaita Vedanta of [[Adi Shankara]], that all of the reality is [[Brahman]],{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} and that the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) and Brahman (ultimate unchanging reality) are one.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Milne (1997), "Advaita Vedanta and typologies of multiplicity and unity: An interpretation of nondual knowledge," ''International Journal of Hindu Studies'', Volume 1, Issue 1, pages 165-188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Comans |first=Michael |year=2000 |title=The Method of Early Advaita Vedānta: A Study of Gauḍapāda, Śaṅkara, Sureśvara, and Padmapāda |pages=183–184 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita ideas of schools within Hinduism contrasts with its Dvaita schools such as of [[Madhvacharya]] who stated that the experienced reality and God are two (dual) and distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhva (1238–1317) |first=Valerie|last=Stoker|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2011 |accessdate=2 February 2016|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/madhva/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Betty Stafford (2010), Dvaita, Advaita, and Viśiṣṭādvaita.

===Vedanta===
{{Main article|Vedanta}}

Several schools of Vedanta teach a form of nondualism. The best-known is Advaita Vedanta, but other nondual Vedanta schools also have a significant influence and following, such as [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] and [[Shuddhadvaita]],{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} both of which are [[bhedabheda]].

The oldest surviving manuscript on Advaita Vedanta is by [[Gaudapada|Gauḍapāda]] (6th century CE),{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} who has traditionally been regarded as the teacher of [[Govinda bhagavatpāda]] and the grandteacher of Shankara.

Advaita, states Murti, is the knowledge of Brahman and self-consciousness (Vijnana) without differences.{{sfn|Murti|2008|p=217}} The goal of [[Vedanta]] is to know the "truly real" and thus become one with it.{{sfn|Murti|2008|pp=217–218}} According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the highest [[Absolute (philosophy)|Reality]],{{sfn|Potter|2008|p=6–7}}&lt;ref name=james122&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Brahman", ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ptraju&gt;PT Raju (2006), ''Idealistic Thought of India'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1-4067-3262-7}}, page 426 and Conclusion chapter part XII&lt;/ref&gt; The universe, according to Advaita philosophy, does not simply come from Brahman, it ''is'' Brahman.

=====Advaita Vedanta – Three levels of reality=====
Advaita Vedanta adopts sublation as the criterion to postulate three levels of ontological reality:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref name=asharmapr176&gt;Arvind Sharma (1995), The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta, Penn State University Press, {{ISBN|978-0271028323}}, pp. 176–178 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{IAST|Pāramārthika}}'' (''paramartha'', absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved". This experience can't be sublated (exceeded) by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref name=asharmapr176/&gt;
* ''{{IAST|Vyāvahārika}}'' (''vyavahara''), or ''samvriti-saya'',{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} consisting of the empirical or pragmatic reality. It is ever-changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] true. It is "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake". It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.&lt;ref name=asharmapr176/&gt;
* ''{{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}}'' (''pratibhasika'', apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone". It is the level of experience in which the mind constructs its own reality. A well-known example is the perception of a rope in the dark as being a snake.&lt;ref name=asharmapr176/&gt;

=====Similarities and differences with Buddhism=====
Scholars state that Advaita Vedanta was influenced by [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], given the common terminology and methodology and some common doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;John Grimes, Review of Richard King's Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, Journal of the American Academy of Religion Vol. 66, No. 3 (Autumn, 1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;684–686&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Mudgal, ''Advaita of Sankara, A Reappraisal, Impact of Buddhism and Samkhya on Sankara's thought'', Delhi 1975, p.187"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliot Deutsch]] and Rohit Dalvi state:
{{quote|In any event a close relationship between the Mahayana schools and Vedanta did exist, with the latter borrowing some of the dialectical techniques, if not the specific doctrines, of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, pp.` 126, 157&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Advaita Vedanta is related to Madhyamaka via Gaudapada, who took over the Buddhist doctrine that [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]].{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} Shankara harmonised [[Gaudapada]]'s ideas with the Upanishadic texts, and provided an orthodox hermeneutical basis for heterodox Buddhist phenomology.{{sfn|Isaeva|1992|p=240}}{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=64}}

Gaudapada adopted the Buddhist concept of [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]].{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} The Buddhist term is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings.

Michael Comans states there is a fundamental difference between Buddhist thought and that of Gaudapada, in that Buddhism has as its philosophical basis the doctrine of [[Dependent Origination]] according to which "everything is without an essential nature (''nissvabhava''), and everything is empty of essential nature (''svabhava-sunya'')", while Gaudapada does not rely on this principle at all. Gaudapada's ''Ajativada'' is an outcome of reasoning applied to an unchanging nondual reality according to which "there exists a Reality (''sat'') that is unborn (''aja'')" that has essential nature (''svabhava''), and this is the "eternal, fearless, undecaying Self (Atman) and Brahman".{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}} Thus, Gaudapada differs from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, states Comans, by accepting the premises and relying on the fundamental teaching of the Upanishads.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}} Among other things, Vedanta school of Hinduism holds the premise, "Atman exists, as self evident truth", a concept it uses in its theory of nondualism.

====Vishishtadvaita Vedanta====
[[File:Ramanujacharya.jpg|thumb|[[Ramanuja]], founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, taught 'qualified nondualism' doctrine.]]
{{See also|Bhedabheda}}
[[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] is another main school of Vedanta and teaches the nonduality of the qualified whole, in which Brahman alone exists, but is characterized by multiplicity. It can be described as "qualified monism," or "qualified non-dualism," or "attributive [[monism]]."

According to this school, the world is real, yet underlying all the differences is an all-embracing unity, of which all "things" are an "attribute." [[Ramanuja]], the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy contends that the Prasthana Traya ("The three courses") – namely the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Gita|Bhagavad Gita]], and the [[Brahmasutra|Brahma Sutras]] – are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity, for any other way would violate their consistency.

[[Vedanta Desika]] defines ''Vishishtadvaita'' using the statement: ''Asesha Chit-Achit Prakaaram Brahmaikameva Tatvam'' – "[[Brahman]], as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the only reality."

====Neo-Vedanta====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}
Neo-Vedanta, also called "neo-Hinduism"{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a modern interpretation of [[Hinduism]] which developed in response to western [[colonialism]] and [[orientalism]], and aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

[[Neo-Vedanta]], as represented by [[Vivekananda]] and [[Radhakrishnan]], is indebted to Advaita vedanta, but also reflects Advaya-philosophy. A main influence on neo-Advaita was [[:Ramakrishna]], himself a bhakta and tantrika, and the guru of Vivekananda. According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of formlessness and form.{{sfn|Taft|2014}} Ramakrishna regarded the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive:
{{quote|When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive – neither creating nor preserving nor destroying – I call Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God. When I think of Him as active – creating, preserving and destroying – I call Him Sakti or Maya or Prakriti, the Personal God. But the distinction between them does not mean a difference. The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Ramakrisha The Great Master, by Swami Saradananda, (tr.) Swami Jagadananda, 5th ed., v.1,  pp. 558–561, Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras.|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/sri-ramakrishna-the-great-master/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Radhakrishnan acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda]]-Vedanta than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world. Nicholas F. Gier: "Ramakrsna, Svami Vivekananda, and Aurobindo (I also include M.K. Gandhi) have been labeled "neo-Vedantists," a philosophy that rejects the Advaitins' claim that the world is illusory. Aurobindo, in his ''The Life Divine'', declares that he has moved from Sankara's  "universal illusionism" to his own "universal realism" (2005: 432), defined as metaphysical realism in the European philosophical sense of the term."{{sfn|Gier|2013}}}} According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita "reconciles [[Dvaita]] or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism":{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}
{{quote|The Neo-Vedanta is also Advaitic inasmuch as it holds that Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is one without a second, ''ekamevadvitiyam''. But as distinguished from the traditional Advaita of Sankara, it is a synthetic Vedanta which reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism and also other theories of reality. In this sense it may also be called concrete monism in so far as it holds that Brahman is both qualified, ''saguna'', and qualityless, ''nirguna''.{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}}}

Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but "a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real."&lt;ref group=web name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/#H2 Michael Hawley, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888–1975)'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sarma, standing in the tradition of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], Advaitavāda means "spiritual non-dualism or absolutism",{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1}} in which opposites are ''manifestations'' of the Absolute, which itself is immanent and transcendent:{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1–2}}
{{quote|All opposites like being and non-being, life and death, good and evil, light and darkness, gods and men, soul and nature are viewed as manifestations of the Absolute which is immanent in the universe and yet transcends it.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1-2}}}}

===Kashmir Shaivism===
{{Main article|Shaivism|Kashmir Shaivism}}
{{Saivism}}
Advaita is also a central concept in various schools of Shaivism, such as [[Kashmir Shaivism]]{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} and [[Shiva Advaita]].

Kashmir Shaivism is a school of [[Śaivism]], described by [[Abhinavagupta]]{{refn|group=note|Abhinavgupta (between 10th – 11th century AD) who summarized the view points of all previous thinkers and presented the philosophy in a logical way along with his own thoughts in his treatise Tantraloka.&lt;ref group=web name="Kashmir" /&gt;}} as "paradvaita", meaning "the supreme and absolute non-dualism".&lt;ref group=web name="Kashmir"&gt;[http://www.shaivism.net/articles/11.html Piyaray L. Raina, ''Kashmir Shaivism versus Vedanta – A Synopsis'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is categorized by various scholars as [[monistic]]&lt;ref&gt;Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, Swami Lakshman Jee, pp. 103&lt;/ref&gt; [[idealism]] ([[absolute idealism]], theistic monism,&lt;ref&gt;The Trika Śaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit&lt;/ref&gt; realistic idealism,&lt;ref name="Vibration pp. 51"&gt;The Doctrine of Vibration: An Analysis of Doctrines and Practices of Kashmir Shaivism, Mark S. G. Dyczkowski, pp. 51&lt;/ref&gt; transcendental physicalism or concrete monism&lt;ref name="Vibration pp. 51"/&gt;).

Kashmir Saivism is based on a strong monistic interpretation of the ''Bhairava Tantras'' and its subcategory the ''Kaula Tantras'', which were tantras written by the [[Kapalikas]].&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 1996. P.164-167"&gt;Flood, Gavin. D. 1996. An Introduction to Hinduism. pp. 164–167&lt;/ref&gt; There was additionally a revelation of the ''Siva Sutras'' to [[Vasugupta]].&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 1996. P.164-167"/&gt; Kashmir Saivism claimed to supersede the dualistic [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. D. 2006. The Tantric Body. P.61&lt;/ref&gt; Somananda, the first theologian of monistic Saivism, was the teacher of Utpaladeva, who was the grand-teacher of [[Abhinavagupta]], who in turn was the teacher of Ksemaraja.&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 1996. P.164-167"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. D. 2006. The Tantric Body. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism can be seen in contrast to Shankara's Advaita.&lt;ref&gt;Consciousness is Everything, The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism, Swami Shankarananda pp. 56-59&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita Vedanta holds that Brahman is inactive (''niṣkriya'') and the phenomenal world is an illusion (''māyā''). In Kashmir Shavisim, all things are a manifestation of the Universal Consciousness, ''[[Chit (Shaivism)|Chit]]'' or ''[[Brahman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pratyãbhijñahṛdayam, Jaideva Singh, Moltilal Banarsidass, 2008 p.24-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine of Vibration: An Analysis of Doctrines and Practices of Kashmir Shaivism, By Mark S. G. Dyczkowski, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmir Shavisim sees the phenomenal world (''Śakti'') as real: it exists, and has its being in Consciousness (''Chit'').&lt;ref&gt;Ksemaraja, trans. by Jaidev Singh, Spanda Karikas: The Divine Creative Pulsation, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashmir Shaivism was influenced by, and took over doctrines from, several orthodox and heterodox Indian religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} These include Vedanta, Samkhya, Patanjali Yoga and Nyayas, and various Buddhist schools, including Yogacara and Madhyamika,{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} but also Tantra and the Nath-tradition.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=26}}

===Contemporary vernacular Advaita===
''Advaita'' is also part of other Indian traditions, which are less strongly, or not all, organised in monastic and institutional organisations. Although often called "Advaita Vedanta," these traditions have their origins in vernacular movements and "householder" traditions, and have close ties to the [[Nath]], [[Nayanars]] and [[Sant Mat]] traditions.

====Ramana Maharshi====

====Natha Sampradaya and Inchegeri Sampradaya====
{{Main article|Nath|Sahaja|Inchegeri Sampradaya}}

The Natha Sampradaya, with [[Nath]] yogis such as [[Gorakhnath]], introduced [[Sahaja]], the concept of a spontaneous spirituality. Sahaja means "spontaneous, natural, simple, or easy".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1193-sah.jpg] (accessed: Friday November 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ken Wilber, this state reflects nonduality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Wilber |title=One Taste: Daily Reflections on Integral Spirituality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhbLjCH9aFMC&amp;pg=PA294 |year=2000|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2270-2 |pages=294–295 with footnotes 33–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
The Advaya concept of nonduality refers to the "non-two" understanding of reality, which has its origins in Madhyamaka-thought, which in turn is built on earlier Buddhist thought, and expressed in the two truths doctrine. In Nagarjuna's interpretation it is the non-duality of conventional and ultimate truth, or the overcoming of dichotomies such as that between [[samsara]] (conditioned or relative reality, rebirth) and [[nirvana]] (unconditioned and absolute reality, liberation).&lt;ref name="Davis2010p5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leesa S. Davis|title=Advaita Vedanta and Zen Buddhism: Deconstructive Modes of Spiritual Inquiry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_kHcG0tspgC |year=2010|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2068-8 |pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy McCagney |title=Nāgārjuna and the Philosophy of Openness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCH7ueXrJowC |date=1997 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-8476-8627-8 |pages=40–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nondualism in Buddhism is explicitly represented by the concept of Buddha-nature, and Tibetan concepts like rigpa and shentong. It has its roots in Buddhist ideas of luminous mind, the "pure" consciousness which shines through when purified from the defilements of hatred, anger and ignorance. Nondualism can also be found in Yogacara thought, and its concept of the alaija-vijnana. Subsequently, combinations of Buddha-nature thought and Yogacara, and also of Yogacara and Madhyamaka, developed in India, Tibet and China, and can be found in Tibetan Buddhism and Zen.

The nonduality of relative and ultimate truth was further developed and re-interpreted in Chinese Buddhism, where the two truths doctrine came to refer to the nonduality of nirvana and samsara, re-incorporating essentialist notions.

===Indian Buddhism===

====Madhyamaka – nonduality of conventional and ultimate truth====
{{Main|Madhyamika|Shunyata|Two truths doctrine}}
[[File:Nagarjuna and Aryadeva as Two Great Indian Buddhist Scholastics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nagarjuna]] and [[Aryadeva]]]]

In Madhyamaka Buddhism ''Advaya'' refers to the nonduality of conventional and ultimate truth,{{sfn|Garfield|1995|pp=296, 298}} or the relative (phenomenal) world and the Absolute, such as in [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]].{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} Madhyamaka, also known as ''Śūnyavāda'', refers primarily to a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] school of philosophy{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=140}} founded by [[Nāgārjuna]].

In Madhyamaka, the two truths refer to conventional and ultimate truth.{{sfn|Cheng|1981}} The ultimate truth is [[Sunyata|"emptiness"]], or non-existence of inherently existing "things",{{sfn|Kalupahana|2006|p=1}} and the "emptiness of emptiness": emptiness does not in itself constitute an absolute reality. Conventionally, "things" exist, but ultimately, they are "empty" of any existence on their own, as described in [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'':
{{quote|The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction drawn between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound truth. Without a foundation in the conventional truth the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved.{{refn|group=note|Nagarjuna, Mūlamadhyamakakārika 24:8-10. Jay L. Garfield, ''Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way''{{sfn|Garfield|1995|pp=296, 298}}}}}}

"Emptiness" is a consequence of ''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'' (dependent arising),{{sfn|Cabezón|2005|p=9387}} the teaching that no ''dharma'' ("thing") has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence on other ''dharmas''. According to Madhyamaka all [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|phenomena]] are [[śūnyatā|empty]] of "substance" or "essence" ({{lang-sa|[[svabhāva]]}}) because they are [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently co-arisen]]. Likewise it is because they are dependently co-arisen that they have no intrinsic, independent reality of their own. Madhyamaka also rejects the existence of an absolute reality or Self.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}} Ultimately, "absolute reality" is not an absolute, or the non-duality of a personal self and an absolute Self, but the deconstruction of such reifications.

It also means that there is no "transcendental ground," and that "ultimate reality" has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind.&lt;ref group=web name="PatrickJennings" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|See, for an influential example, [[Tsongkhapa]], who states that "things" ''do'' exist conventionally, but ultimately everything is dependently arisen, and therefor void of inherent existence.&lt;ref group=web name="PatrickJennings"&gt;[http://thenonbuddhist.com/2014/01/12/tsongkhapa-in-praise-of-relativity-the-essence-of-eloquence/ Patrick Jennings, ''Tsongkhapa: In Praise of Relativity; The Essence of Eloquence''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074106/http://thenonbuddhist.com/2014/01/12/tsongkhapa-in-praise-of-relativity-the-essence-of-eloquence/ |date=18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Susan Kahn further explains:
{{quote|Ultimate truth does not point to a transcendent reality, but to the transcendence of deception. It is critical to emphasize that the ultimate truth of emptiness is a negational truth. In looking for inherently existent phenomena it is revealed that it cannot be found. This absence is not findable because it is not an entity, just as a room without an elephant in it does not contain an elephantless substance. Even conventionally, elephantlessness does not exist.

In Madhyamaka-Buddhism, "Advaya" is an epistemological approach.{{sfn|Murti|2008|p=217}} It is the recognition that ultimately everything is impermanent ([[anicca]]) and devoid of "self" or "essence" ([[anatta]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

The later Madhyamikas, states Yuichi Kajiyama, developed the ''Advaya'' definition as a means to ''Nirvikalpa-Samadhi'' by suggesting that "things arise neither from their own selves nor from other things, and that when subject and object are unreal, the mind, being not different, cannot be true either; thereby one must abandon attachment to cognition of nonduality as well, and understand the lack of intrinsic nature of everything". Thus, the Buddhist nondualism or Advaya concept became a means to realizing absolute emptiness.&lt;ref name="KiyotaJones1991p120" /&gt;

====Yogacara====
{{Main|Yogacara}}

In Yogacara, ''adhyava'' may also refer to overcoming the dichotomies of cognitum and cognition imposed by conceptual thought.{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} Yogācāra ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]; literally: "yoga practice"; "one whose practice is yoga"){{sfn|Jones|2005|p=9897}} is an influential school of [[Buddhist]] [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] emphasizing [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and (some argue){{clarify|date=March 2017}} [[ontology]]&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhahood Embodied: Sources of Controversy in India and Tibet'' by John Makransky. SUNY Press: 1997. {{ISBN|0-7914-3431-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=I4qmkptncxQC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=yogacara+ontology&amp;lr=]&lt;/ref&gt; through the interior lens of [[meditative]] and [[yogic]] practices. It developed within [[India]]n [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhism]] in about the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Zim, Robert (1995). ''Basic ideas of ''Yogācāra'' Buddhism.'' San Francisco State University. Source: [http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Yogacara/basicideas.htm] (accessed: October 18, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''adyava'' in Yogacara is an epistemological stance on the nature of knowledge. Early Buddhism schools such as [[Sarvastivada]] and [[Sautrāntika]], that thrived through the early centuries of the common era, postulated a dualism, ''dvaya'', wherein grasping (''grahaka'', "cognition") and the grasped (''gradya'', "cognitum"){{sfn|King|1995|p=156}} both are really existing.&lt;ref name="KiyotaJones1991p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuichi Kajiyama |editor=Minoru Kiyota and Elvin W.

In Yogacara-thought, cognition is a modification of the base-consciousness, ''alaya-vijnana''. By the reification of these modifications into separate consciousnesses, the Eighth Consciousnesses of Yogacara came into existence.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999}} In later Buddhist thought, which took an idealistic turn, the storehouse-consciousness or base-consciousness came to be seen as a pure consciousness, from which everything arises. According to the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] and the schools of Chan/Zen Buddhism, the alaya-vijnana is identical with the ''[[tathagata-garbha]]''{{refn|group=note|The womb or matrix of the Thus-come-one, the Buddha}}, and is fundamentally pure.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vijñapti-mātra'', coupled with ''[[Buddha-nature]]'' or ''tathagatagarba'', has been an influential concept in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notable in the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions.

According to Kochumuttom, Yogacara is a ''realistic pluralism''. It does not deny the existence of individual beings,  but denies the following:{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}}
{{quote|1. That the absolute mode of reality is consciousness/mind/ideas,&lt;br /&gt;2. That the individual beings are transformations or evolutes of an absolute consciousness/mind/idea,&lt;br /&gt;3. That the individual beings are but illusory appearances of a monistic reality.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1-2}}}}

''[[Yogacara#Representation-only|Vijñapti-mātra]]'', "consciousness-only" or "representation-only" is one of the main features of Yogācāra philosophy. It is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Several modern researchers object to this translation, and the accompanying label of "absolute idealism" or "idealistic monism".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} A better translation for ''vijñapti-mātra'' is ''representation-only''.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}

''Vijñapti-mātra'' then means "mere representation of consciousness":
{{quote|[T]he phrase ''vijñaptimātratā-vāda'' means a theory which says that the world ''as it appears'' to the unenlightened ones is mere representation of consciousness. Therefore, any attempt to interpret ''vijñaptimātratā-vāda'' as idealism would be a gross misunderstanding of it.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}}}

The term ''vijñapti-mātra'' replaced the "more metaphysical"{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=135}} term ''citta-mātra'' used in the Lankavatara Sutra.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=126}} The Lankavatara Sutra "appears to be one of the earliest attempts to provide a philosophical justification for the Absolutism that emerged in Mahayana in relation to the concept of Buddha".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=122}} It uses the term ''citta-mātra'', which means properly "thought-only". By using this term it develops an ''ontology'', in contrast to the ''epistemology'' of the term vijñapti-mātra. The Lankavatara Sutra equates ''citta'' and the absolute. According to Kochumuttom, this is not the way Yogacara uses the term vijñapti:{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5-6}}
{{quote|[T]he absolute state is defined simply as emptiness, namely the emptiness of subject–object distinction. Once thus defined as emptiness (''sunyata''), it receives a number of synonyms, none of which betray idealism.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=6}}}}

The Yogācārins defined three basic modes by which we perceive our world.  These are referred to in Yogācāra as the three natures of perception.  They are:
# ''Parikalpita'' (literally, "fully conceptualized"): "imaginary nature", wherein things are incorrectly comprehended based on conceptual construction, through attachment and erroneous discrimination.
# ''Paratantra'' (literally, "other dependent"): "dependent nature", by which the correct understanding of the [[dependently originated]] nature of things is understood.
# ''Pariniṣpanna'' (literally, "fully accomplished"): "absolute nature", through which one comprehends things as they are in themselves, uninfluenced by any conceptualization at all.

Also, regarding perception, the Yogācārins emphasized that our everyday understanding of the existence of external objects is problematic, since in order to perceive any object (and thus, for all practical purposes, for the object to "exist"), there must be a sensory organ as well as a correlative type of consciousness to allow the process of cognition to occur.

====Buddha-nature====
{{Main|Buddha-nature}}
{{See also|Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Schayer – Precanonical Buddhism|l1=Precanonical Buddhism}}
''Vijñapti-mātra'' and the two truths doctrine, as understood in Chinese Buddhism, are closely linked to ''[[Buddha-nature]]''. Those teachings have had a profound influence on Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notably the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions. They may be related to an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs, elements of which are preserved in the Nikayas,{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Lindtner|1999}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}}{{sfn|Ray|1999}} and survived in the Mahayana tradition.{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}}{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} Contrary to popular opinion, the Theravada and Mahayana traditions may be "divergent, but equally reliable records of a pre-canonical Buddhism which is now lost forever."{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}} The Mahayana tradition may have preserved a very old, "pre-Canonical" tradition, which was largely, but not completely, left out of the Theravada-canon.{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}}

The Buddhist teachings on the ''Buddha-nature'' may be regarded as a form of nondualism.&lt;ref&gt;King (1991), ''Buddha Nature'', SUNY Press&lt;/ref&gt; ''Buddha-nature'' is the essential element that allows [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] to become Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, Buddha nature, is a translation of the Sanskrit coinage, 'Buddha-dhātu', which seems first to have appeared in the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Second Edition, Routledge, Oxford, 2009, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; where it refers to 'a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas.'&lt;ref name="Kevin Trainor 2004, p. 207"&gt;Kevin Trainor, ''Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The term seems to have been used most frequently to translate the Sanskrit "''Tathāgatagarbha''". The Sanskrit term "''tathāgatagarbha''" may be [[parse]]d into ''[[tathāgata]]'' ("the one thus gone", referring to the Buddha) and ''garbha'' ("womb").{{refn|group=note|The term "garbha" has multiple denotations. A denotation of note is the [[garba (dance)|garba]] of the [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]: where a spiritual [[circle dance]] is performed around a light or candle placed at the centre, ''[[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]''. This dance informs the ''Tathāgatagarbha'' Doctrine. The ''[[Dzogchenpa]]'' ''[[tertön]]'' [[Namkai Norbu]] teaches a similar dance upon a [[mandala]], the Dance of the [[Six Lokas]] as ''[[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]'', where a candle or light is similarly placed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}}} The tathagatagarbha, when freed from ''avidya'' ("ignorance"), is the [[dharmakaya]], the ''Absolute''.

====Tantric Buddhism====
{{Main|Tantra}}

Tantra is a religious tradition that originated in India in the middle of the first millennium CE, and has been practiced by Buddhists, Hindus and Jains throughout south and southeast Asia.{{sfn|White|2000|p=7}} It views humans as a microcosmos which mirrors the macrocosmos.{{sfn|White|2000|p=8-9}} Its aim is to gain access to the energy or enlightened consciousness of the godhead or absolute, by embodying this energy or consciousness through rituals.{{sfn|White|2000|p=8-9}} It views the godhead as both transcendent and immanent, and views the world as real, and not as an illusion:{{sfn|White|2000|p=9}}
{{quote|Rather than attempting to see through or transcend the world, the practitioner comes to recognize "that" (the world) as "I" (the supreme egoity of the godhead): in other words, s/he gains a "god's eye view" of the universe, and recognizes it to be nothing other than herself/himself. For East Asian Buddhist Tantra in particular, this means that the totality of the cosmos is a "realm of Dharma", sharing an underlying common principle.{{sfn|White|2000|p=10–11}}}}

[[Ramakrishna]] too was a tantric adherent, although his tantric background was overlaid and smoothed with an Advaita interpretation by his student [[Vivekananda]].{{sfn|King|2002}}

===East-Asian Buddhism===

====Chinese Buddhism – nonduality of mundane and highest reality====
{{Main|Buddhism in China}}

In Chinese Buddhism the [[Two truths doctrine]] was interpreted as an ontological teaching of three truths,&lt;ref name=whalenlai45&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whalen Lai|title=Nonduality of the Two Truths in Sinitic Madhyamika: Origin of the Third Truth |journal=The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies|volume=2|number=2|year=1979|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; states Whalen Lai, wherein "[[samsara|samsaric]] being and [[nirvana|nirvanic]] emptiness as well any and all distinctions are not two".{{sfn|Lai|2003|pp=10–11}} The Chinese Buddhist scholars posited that there is a third truth above the mundane truth of samsaric being and the highest truth nirvanic emptiness (sunyata).{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}}&lt;ref name=whalenlai45 /&gt; In one description, everything is posited to be simultaneously "empty, real and neither".{{sfn|Lai|2003|pp=10–11}} According to Lai, most scholars of Chinese Buddhism, unlike Nagarjuna, failed to realize that the two truths were epistemic, not ontological.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} This mistake was identified and discussed by Jizang of Sanlun school.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}}

Chinese Buddhism evolved over time.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=10}} Before 400 CE, states Lai, the Chinese understood the Buddhist doctrine to be that "karmic rebirth entailed the transmigration of soul".{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=10}} It was monk Mindu who understood that the Buddha taught a no soul doctrine, and he tried to explain this to his Buddhist ''sangha'', but was vilified for denying the existence of soul.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=10}} Mindu's ideas, however, began a momentum that led to the emergence of ''six prajna'' schools in the 4th and 5th century CE.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=10}} In the 6th century CE it became clear that anatman and sunyata are central Buddhist teachings, which make the postulation of an eternal self problematic.{{sfn|Lai|2003|pp=10-11}}&lt;ref name=Whalenlai47&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whalen Lai| title=Nonduality of the Two Truths in Sinitic Madhyamika: Origin of the Third Truth | journal= The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies| volume= 2| number= 2|year = 1979| pages=45–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of confusion was the [[Two truths doctrine]] of [[Madhyamaka]], the mundane truth and the highest truth. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists at two levels, the mundane level of samsara and the highest level of nirvana emptiness. But in Madhyamaka these are two ''epistemological truths'', two different ways to look at reality. The early Chinese scholars supposed that there is an essential truth above the two truths, which unites both these.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}}&lt;ref name=Whalenlai47 /&gt; This three truths doctrine was different from a similarly named doctrine of Yogacara and Indian Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Whalenlai47 /&gt;

====Hua-yen Buddhism====
{{Main|Huayan school|Indra's net}}
The Huayan school or Flower Garland is a tradition of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] [[philosophy]] that flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang period]] particularly with [[Fazang]] (~700 CE). It is based on the Sanskrit [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Garland Sutra]] (S. ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'', C. ''Huayan Jing'') and on a lengthy Chinese interpretation of it, the [[Huayan Lun]].  The name Flower Garland is meant to suggest the crowning glory of profound understanding. Huayan teaches the [[Four Dharmadhatu]], four ways to view reality:
# All dharmas are seen as particular separate events;
# All events are an expression of the absolute;
# Events and essence interpenetrate;
# All events interpenetrate.{{sfn|Garfield|Edelglass|2011|p=76}}

====Zen Buddhism====
[[File:DogenP2.JPG|thumb|[[Dogen]]]]
{{Main|Zen|Buddha-nature|Kenshō|Shikan-taza}}
{{See also|Bodhicitta|Karuṇā|Ten Bulls}}

The Buddha-nature and Yogacara philosophies have had a strong influence on Chán and Zen. The teachings of Zen are expressed by a set of polarities: Buddha-nature – sunyata;{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–29}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=138–142}} absolute-relative;{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} [[Subitism|sudden]] and gradual enlightenment.{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=123–138}}

The Lankavatara-sutra, a popular sutra in Zen, endorses the Buddha-nature and emphasizes purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra, another popular sutra, emphasizes sunyata, which "must be realized totally or not at all".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–28}} The [[Prajnaparamita]] Sutras emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[Heart Sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} According to [[Chinul]], Zen points not to mere emptiness, but to ''suchness'' or the [[dharmadhatu]].{{sfn|Buswell|1991|p=240-241}}

The idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not explain how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]].

The continuous pondering of the break-through [[kōan]] (''shokan''{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=132}}) or [[Hua Tou]], "word head",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} leads to [[kensho]], an initial insight into "seeing the [[Buddha-nature|(Buddha-)nature]].{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}} According to Hori, a central theme of many koans is the "identity of opposites", and point to the original nonduality.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289–290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}} Victor Sogen Hori describes [[kensho]], when attained through [[Koan|koan-study]], as the absence of subject–object duality.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30–31}} The aim of the so-called break-through koan is to see the "nonduality of subject and object", {{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289–290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}}
in which "subject and object are no longer separate and distinct."{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=288–289}}

Zen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life,{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|Glassman|2007|pp=54, 140}} to fully manifest the nonduality of absolute and relative.{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005|p=225}} To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by [[Linji Yixuan]] in his [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three Mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} the [[Five Ranks]], and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]]{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} which detail the steps on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Path]].

====Essence-function in Korean Buddhism====
{{See also|Korean Buddhism|Essence-Function}}
The polarity of absolute and relative is also expressed as "essence-function". The absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can't be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. The distinction does not "exclude any other frameworks such as ''neng-so'' or 'subject-object' constructions", though the two "are completely different from each other in terms of their way of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-bae  (1983).

====Buddha-nature and the nature of mind====

=====Shentong=====
{{Main|Rangtong-Shentong}}
In Tibetan Buddhism, the essentialist position is represented by ''shentong'', while the nominalist, or non-essentialist position, is represented by ''rangtong''.

Shentong is a philosophical sub-school found in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Its adherents generally hold that the nature of mind, the substratum of the [[mindstream]], is "empty" ({{bo|w=stong}}) of "other" ({{bo|w=gzhan}}), i.e., empty of all qualities other than an inherently existing, ineffable nature. Shentong has often been incorrectly associated with the Cittamātra ([[Yogacara]]) position, but is in fact also Madhyamaka,&lt;ref&gt;Stearns p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; and is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the [[Jonang]] school, although it is also taught by the [[Sakya]]&lt;ref&gt;Stearns p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kagyu]] schools.&lt;ref name=TaiSitupa&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pema Tönyö Nyinje, 12th Tai Situpa|authorlink1=Pema Tönyö Nyinje|title=Ground, Path and Fruition|publisher=Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal Charitable Trust|isbn=978-1-877294-35-8|page=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hookham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hookham|first1=S.K.|authorlink1=Shenpen Hookham|title=The Buddha Within: Tathagatagarbha Doctrine According to the Shentong Interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga|date=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-0-7914-0358-7|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shentongpa (proponents of shentong), the emptiness of ultimate reality should not be characterized in the same way as the emptiness of apparent phenomena because it is ''[[ösel (yoga)|prabhāśvara]]-[[mindstream|saṃtāna]]'', or "luminous mindstream" endowed with limitless Buddha qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahs.org.uk/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=1847 Lama Shenpen, ''Emptiness Teachings''.

The contrasting [[Prasaṅgika]] view that all phenomena are [[sunyata]], empty of self-nature, and that this "emptiness" is not a concretely existing "absolute" reality, is labeled [[rangtong]], "empty of other."&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;

The shentong-view is related to the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of [[Śāntarakṣita]]. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the empty nature of mind. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind.

=====Dzogchen=====
{{Main|Dzogchen|Rigpa}}

Dzogchen is concerned with the "natural state" and emphasizes direct experience. The state of nondual awareness is called ''[[rigpa]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This primordial nature is clear light, unproduced and unchanging, free from all defilements. Through meditation, the [[Dzogchen]] practitioner experiences that thoughts have no substance. Mental phenomena arise and fall in the mind, but fundamentally they are empty. The practitioner then considers where the mind itself resides. Through careful examination one realizes that the mind is emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=John|title=Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|pages=334–342|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other eastern religions==
Apart from Hinduism and Buddhism, self-proclaimed nondualists have also discerned nondualism in other religious traditions.

===Sikhism===
Sikh theology suggests human souls and the monotheistic God are two different realities (dualism),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nirmal Kumar |title=Sikh Philosophy and Religion: 11th Guru Nanak Memorial Lectures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xh69K5Ilm3EC |year=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishers |isbn=978-1-932705-68-3 |pages=89–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishing it from the monistic and various shades of nondualistic philosophies of other Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-pal Singh Mandair|title=Religion and the Specter of the West: Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics of Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzeCy_zL0Q8C |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51980-9|pages=76, 430–432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sikh scholars have attempted to explore nondualism exegesis of Sikh scriptures, such as during the neocolonial reformist movement by Bhai Vir Singh of the Singh Sabha.

===Taoism===
{{Main article|Taoism}}
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Taijitu]]]]

Taoism's ''[[wu wei]]'' (Chinese ''wu'', not; ''wei'', doing) is a term with various translations{{refn|group=note|Inaction, non-action, nothing doing, without ado}} and interpretations designed to distinguish it from passivity. The concept of [[Yin and Yang]], often mistakenly conceived of as a symbol of dualism, is actually meant to convey the notion that all apparent opposites are complementary parts of a non-dual whole.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Erickson, Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. 2013. p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western traditions==
{{See also|Spirituality|New Age|Syncretism|Neo-Advaita|Western esotericism|Perennial philosophy{{!}}Perennialism|Syncretism}}

A modern strand of thought sees "nondual consciousness" as a universal psychological state, which is a common stratum and of the same essence in different spiritual traditions.{{sfn|Katz|2007}} It is derived from [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[neo-Advaita]], but has historical roots in [[neo-Platonism]], [[Western esotericism]], and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]]. The idea of nondual consciousness as "the central essence"{{sfn|Wolfe|2009|p=iii}} is a [[Universalism|universalistic]] and [[Perennial philosophy|perennialist]] idea, which is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and [[Western esotericism|esoteric traditions]] and Asian religious revival and reform movements.{{refn|group=note|See McMahan, "The making of Buddhist modernity"{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Richard E. King]], "Orientalism and Religion"{{sfn|King|2002}} for descriptions of this mutual exchange.}}

Central elements in the western traditions are [[Neo-Platonism]], which had a strong influence on [[Christian contemplation]] c.q. [[Christian mysticism|mysticism]], and it's accompanying [[apophatic theology]]; and [[Western esotericism]], which also incorporated Neo-Platonism and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic elements]] including [[Hermeticism]]. Western traditions are, among others, the idea of a [[Perennial Philosophy]], [[Swedenborgianism]], [[Unitarianism]], [[Orientalism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and [[New Age]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}}

Eastern movements are the [[Hindu reform movements]] such as [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda's]] [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Shri Aurobindo|Aurobindo's]] Integral Yoga, the [[Vipassana movement]], and [[Buddhist modernism]].{{refn|group=note|The awareness of historical precedents seems to be lacking in nonduality-adherents, just as the subjective perception of [[Parallelomania|parallels]] between a wide variety of religious traditions lacks a rigorous philosophical or theoretical underpinning.}}

====Christian contemplation and mysticism====
[[File:Mystic m.jpg|thumb|right|The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, St John the Baptist, St Antony Abbot]]
{{Main article|Christian contemplation|Christian Mysticism|Apophatic theology}}
{{See also|Henosis}}

In Christian mysticism, [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Apophatic theology]] are central elements. In contemplative prayer, the mind is focused by constant repetition a phrase or word. Saint [[John Cassian]] recommended use of the phrase "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/350810.htm John Cassian, ''Conferences'', 10, chapters 10-11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;[http://www.meditatio.ca/Transcripts/Meditatio%20Talks%20Series%20D%202005.pdf Laurence Freeman 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Another formula for repetition is the name of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iE45LzrfZuwC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=repetition+of+the+name+of+Jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Nicholas Cabasilas, ''The Life in Christ'' (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 19740-913836-12-5), p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xXRMGv9UfBEC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=repetition+of+the+name+of+Jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 James W. Skehan, ''Place Me with Your Son'' (Georgetown University Press 1991] {{ISBN|0-87840-525-9}}), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Jesus Prayer]], which has been called "the mantra of the Orthodox Church",&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt; although the term "Jesus Prayer" is not found in the Fathers of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm John S. Romanides, ''Some Underlying Positions of This Website'', 11, note]&lt;/ref&gt; The author of ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' recommended use of a monosyllabic word, such as "God" or "Love".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VFBg1J0MQ84C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Cloud+of+Unknowing%22+monosyllabic&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 ''The Cloud of Unknowing'' (Wordsworth Classics of World Literature 2005] {{ISBN|1-84022-126-7}}), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Apophatic theology is derived from [[Neo-Platonism]] via [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]. In this approach, the notion of God is stripped from all positive qualifications, leaving a "darkness" or "unground." It had a strong influence on western mysticism. A notable example is [[Meister Eckhart]], who also attracted attention from Zen-Buddhists like [[D.T. Suzuki]] in modern times, due to the similarities between Buddhist thought and Neo-Platonism.

[[The Cloud of Unknowing]] – an anonymous work of [[Christian mysticism]] written in [[Middle English]] in the latter half of the 14th century – advocates a mystic relationship with God. The text describes a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] union with God through the heart. The author of the text advocates [[centering prayer]], a form of inner silence. According to the text, God can not be known through knowledge or from intellection. It is only by emptying the mind of all created images and thoughts that we can arrive to experience God. Continuing on this line of thought, God is completely unknowable by the mind. God is not known through the intellect but through intense [[contemplation]], motivated by love, and stripped of all thought.&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Jaegher, Donald Attwater ''Christian Mystics of the Middle Ages: An Anthology of Writings'' 2004, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomism]], though not non-dual in the ordinary sense, considers the unity of God so absolute that even the duality of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], to describe him, can be true only by [[analogy]]. In Thomist thought, even the [[Tetragrammaton]] is only an approximate name, since "I am" involves a predicate whose own essence is its subject.&lt;ref&gt;Koren, Henry J (1955). ''An Introduction to the Science of Metaphysics''. B. Herder Book Co. {{ISBN|1258017857}}, {{ISBN|978-1258017859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former nun and contemplative [[Bernadette Roberts]] is considered a nondualist by Jerry Katz.{{sfn|Katz|2007}}

====Jewish Hasidism and Kabbalism====
{{Main article|Judaism|Hasidism|Kabbalah}}

According to [[Jay Michaelson]], nonduality begins to appear in the medieval Jewish textual tradition which peaked in [[Hasidism]].&lt;ref name="Michaelson, Jay 2009 p.130"/&gt; According to Michaelson:
{{quote|''Judaism'' has within it a strong and very ancient mystical tradition that is deeply nondualistic. "[[Ein Sof]]"  or infinite nothingness is considered the ground face of all that is. God is considered beyond all proposition or preconception. The physical world is seen as emanating from the nothingness as the many faces "partsufim" of god that are all a part of the sacred nothingness.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, Jay (2009). ''Everything Is God: The Radical Path of Nondual Judaism.'' Shambhala Publications. {{ISBN|1-59030-671-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59030-671-0}}.

One of the most striking contributions of the Kabbalah, which became a central idea in Chasidic thought, was a highly innovative reading of the monotheistic idea. The belief in "one G-d" is no longer perceived as the mere rejection of other deities or intermediaries, but a denial of any existence outside of G-d.{{refn|group=note|As Rabbi Moshe Cordovero explains: "Before anything was emanated, there was only the Infinite One (Ein Sof), which was all that existed. And even after He brought into being everything which exists, there is nothing but Him, and you cannot find anything that existed apart from Him, G-d forbid. For nothing existed devoid of G-d's power, for if there were, He would be limited and subject to duality, G-d forbid. Rather, G-d is everything that exists, but everything that exists is not G-d... Nothing is devoid of His G-dliness: everything is within it... There is nothing but it" (Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, ''Elimah Rabasi'', p. 24d-25a; for sources in early Chasidism see: Rabbi Ya'akov Yosef of Polonne, ''Ben Poras Yosef'' (Piotrków 1884), pp. 140, 168; ''Keser Shem Tov'' (Brooklyn: Kehos 2004) pp. 237-8; Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, ''Pri Ha-Aretz'', (Kopust 1884), p. 21.).

====Neoplatonism in Islam====
{{Main|Platonism in Islam}}

===Western esotericism===
{{Main|Western esotericism}}

Western esotericism (also called esotericism and esoterism) is a scholarly term for a wide range of loosely related ideas and movements which have developed within [[Western society]]. They are largely distinct both from orthodox [[Judeo-Christian|Judeo-Christian religion]] and from [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]]. The earliest traditions which later analysis would label as forms of Western esotericism emerged in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] during [[Late Antiquity]], where [[Hermetism]], [[Gnosticism]], and [[Neoplatonism]] developed as schools of thought distinct from what became mainstream Christianity. In [[Renaissance]] Europe, interest in many of these older ideas increased, with various intellectuals seeking to combine "[[pagan]]" philosophies with the [[Kabbalah]] and with Christian philosophy, resulting in the emergence of esoteric movements like [[Christian theosophy]].

====Perennial philosophy====
{{Main article|Perennial philosophy}}

The Perennial philosophy has its roots in the Renaissance interest in [[neo-Platonism]] and its [[Theory of Forms|idea]] of [[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]], from which all existence emanates. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) sought to integrate ''[[Corpus Hermeticum|Hermeticism]]'' with Greek and Jewish-Christian thought,{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} discerning a [[Prisca theologia]] which could be found in all ages.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}} [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94) suggested that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. He proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] and other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) coined the term ''philosophia perennis''.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}}

====Orientalism====
{{Main article|Orientalism}}

The western world has been exposed to Indian religions since the late 18th century.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} The first western translation of a Sanskrit text was made in 1785.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} It marked a growing interest in Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} The first translation of the dualism and nondualism discussing Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802{{sfn|Renard|2010|pp=177-184}} and influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them "the consolation of my life".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}}

====Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism====
{{Main article|Transcendentalism}}

Transcendentalism was an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement that developed in the 1830s and 1840s in the Eastern region of the [[United States]]. It was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]].&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Transcendentalism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis"&gt;[http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm Jone John Lewis, ''What is Transcendentalism?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of [[Hindu]] texts appeared, which were read by the Transcendentalists and influenced their thinking.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; The Transcendentalists also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Andrews"&gt;[http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html Barry Andrews, ''THE ROOTS OF UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST SPIRITUALITY IN NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |date=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent goodness of both people and nature. Transcendentalists believed that society and its institutions&amp;mdash;particularly organized religion and political parties&amp;mdash;ultimately corrupted the purity of the individual. They had faith that people are at their best when truly "self-reliant" and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community could be formed.

The major figures in the movement were [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[John Muir]], [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]].

====Neo-Vedanta====
Unitarian Universalism had a strong impact on Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj, and subsequently on Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of [[Neo-Vedanta]], a modern interpretation of Hinduism in line with [[Western esotericism|western esoteric traditions]], especially [[Transcendentalism]], [[New Thought]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India,{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West.{{Sfn|Dutta|2003|p=110}}

Narendranath Datta (Swami Vivekananda) became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge "at some point before 1884"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshab Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833), the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} who were closely connected to the [[Transcendentalists]], who in turn were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on.{{sfn|Versluis|1993}} It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97-100}} [[Debendranath Tagore]] brought this "neo-Hinduism" closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen,{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=47}} who was also influenced by [[transcendentalism]], which emphasised personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and theology.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen's influence brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=50}}

Vivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like [[Transcendentalism]] and [[New thought]].{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}}

In 1897 he founded the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], which was instrumental in the spread of Neo-Vedanta in the west, and attracted people like Alan Watts. Aldous Huxley, author of ''[[The Perennial Philosophy (book)|The Perennial Philosophy]]'', was associated with another neo-Vedanta organisation, the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

====Theosophical Society====
{{Main article|Theosophical Society}}
A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185–188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|"Masters of Wisdom"]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H. S.

====New Age====
{{Main article|New Age}}

The ''New Age movement'' is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[spirituality|spiritual]] movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as "drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] traditions and infusing them with influences from [[self-help]] and motivational [[psychology]], [[holistic health]], [[parapsychology]], consciousness research and [[quantum physics]]".{{sfn|Drury|2004| p=12}}
The New Age aims to create "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas" that is inclusive and [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]].{{sfn|Drury|2004| p=8}} It holds to "a holistic worldview",{{sfn|Drury|2004| p=11}} emphasising that the [[dialectical monism|Mind, Body and Spirit]] are interrelated&lt;ref name="JGMelton"&gt;Melton, J.

==Scholarly debates==

===Nondual consciousness and mystical experience===
{{Main article|Religious experience|Mystical experience|Altered states of consciousness|Ego-death}}

Insight (''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajna]]'', ''[[kensho]]'', ''[[satori]]'', ''[[gnosis]]'', ''[[theoria]]'', ''[[Divine illumination|illumination]]''), especially ''[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]'' or the realization of the illusory nature of the autonomous "I" or self, is a key element in modern western nondual thought. It is the personal realization that ultimate reality is nondual, and is thought to be a validating means of knowledge of this nondual reality. This insight is interpreted as a psychological state, and labeled as religious or mystical experience.

====Development====
According to Hori, the notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that [[Moral obligation|moral experience]] justified [[religious belief]]s, [[John Wesley]] in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the [[Methodist movement]] (paralleling the [[Romantic Movement]]) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 68, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher and [[Albrecht Ritschl|Albert Ritschl]] to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies [[religious belief]]s.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

Such religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was&amp;nbsp;– during the period in-between world wars&amp;nbsp;– famously rejected by [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 114, 116–119&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] view are [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Raven]] and the Oxford physicist/theologian [[Charles Coulson]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, p. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "religious experience" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196–197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

====Criticism====
The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=1}}}}

Insight is not the "experience" of some transcendental reality, but is a cognitive event, the (intuitive) understanding or "grasping" of some specific understanding of reality, as in [[kensho]]{{sfn|Hori|2000}} or [[anubhava]].{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

"Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception",{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}} would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}

===Nondual consciousness as common essence===

====Common essence====
A main modern proponent of perennialism was [[Aldous Huxley]], who was influenced by [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekanda's]] [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Universalism]].{{sfn|Roy|2003}} This popular approach finds supports in the "common-core thesis". According to the "common-core thesis",{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321–325}} different descriptions can mask quite similar if not identical experiences:{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}}

According to Elias Amidon there is an "indescribable, but definitely recognizable, reality that is the ground of all being."{{sfn|Amidon|2012|p=4}} According to Renard, these are based on an experience or intuition of "the Real".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}} According to Amidon, this reality is signified by "many names" from "spiritual traditions throughout the world":{{sfn|Amidon|2012|p=4}}
{{quote|[N]ondual awareness, pure awareness, open awareness, presence-awareness, unconditioned mind, [[rigpa]], primordial experience, This, the basic state, the sublime, [[buddhanature]], original nature, [[Sahaja|spontaneous presence]], the oneness of being, the ground of being, the Real, clarity, God-consciousness, divine light, the clear light, illumination, realization and enlightenment.{{sfn|Amidon|2012|p=4}}}}

According to Renard, nondualism as common essence prefers the term "nondualism", instead of [[monism]], because this understanding is "nonconceptual", "not graspapable in an idea".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "Niet in een denkbeeld te vatten".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}} Even to call this "ground of reality", "One", or "Oneness" is attributing a characteristic to that ground of reality. [[Apophasis|The only thing that can be said]] is that it is "not two" or "non-dual":&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.swamij.com/pdf/nondualism-paper-101105.pdf Swami Jnaneshvara, ''Faces of Nondualism'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Anderson|2009|p=xvi}} According to Renard, Alan Watts has been one of the main contributors to the popularisation of the non-monistic understanding of "nondualism".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|According to Renard, Alan Watts has explained the difference between "non-dualism" and "monism" in ''The Supreme Identity'', Faber and Faber 1950, p.69 and 95; ''The Way of Zen'', Pelican-edition 1976, p.59-60.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59, p.285 note 17}}}}

====Criticism====
The "common-core thesis" is criticised by "diversity theorists" such as S.T Katz and W. Proudfoot.{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}} They argue that 
{{quote|[N]o unmediated experience is possible, and that in the extreme, language is not simply used to interpret experience but in fact constitutes experience.{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}}}}

The idea of a common essence has been questioned by Yandell, who discerns various "religious experiences" and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the "evidential value" they present.{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=19–23}} Yandell discerns five sorts:{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=23–31}}
# [[Numinous]] experiences – [[Monotheism]] (Jewish, Christian, Vedantic){{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24–26}}
# [[Nirvana|Nirvanic]] experiences – [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24–25, 26–27}} "according to which one sees that the self is but [[Anatta|a bundle of fleeting states]]"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24–25}}
# [[Kevala Jnana|Kevala]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=30}} – [[Jainism]],{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}} "according to which one sees the self as an indestructible subject of experience"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}}
# [[Moksha]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=29}} – Hinduism,{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}} Brahman "either as a cosmic person, or, quite differently, as qualityless"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}}
# Nature mystical experience{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=30}}

The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} The notion of what exactly constitutes "liberating insight" varies between the various traditions, and even within the traditions. Bronkhorst for example notices that the conception of what exactly "liberating insight" is in Buddhism was developed over time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the Four Truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}

[[File:Nyctograph reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed nyctograph, with scale demonstrated by a 5 [[euro]] cent.]]
'''Nyctography''' is a form of [[substitution cipher]] writing created by [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1891.

Nyctography is written with a nyctograph (also invented by Carroll) and uses a system of dots and strokes all based on a dot placed in the upper left corner. Using the Nyctograph, one could quickly jot down ideas or notes without the aid of light.

Carroll invented the Nyctograph and Nyctography because he was often awakened during the night with thoughts that needed to be written down immediately, and didn't want to go through the lengthy process of lighting a lamp just to have to extinguish it shortly thereafter.

==Nyctograph==
The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen square holes, each a quarter inch wide, and system of symbols representing an alphabet of Carroll's design, which could then be transcribed the following day. 

He first named it "typhlograph", but at the suggestion of one of his brother-students,{{clarify|reason=What does this term mean? Is this a fellow student? I'm not sure if Caroll was a student in 1891. Note: the wording is present in the original source as-is, so not an error.|date=November 2018}} this was subsequently changed into "Nyctograph".&lt;ref name="life"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11483/11483-h/11483-h.htm “The Life And Letters Of Lewis Carroll (Rev. C. L. Dodgson)” by  Stuart Dodgson Collingwood  B.A. Christ Church, Oxford]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Carroll used an oblong of card with an oblong cut out of the centre to guide his writing in the dark.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; This did not appear to be satisfactory as the results were illegible. The new and final version of the nyctograph is recorded in his journal of September 24, 1891, and is the subject of a letter to ''The Lady'' magazine of October 29, 1891: 
{{quote|Any one who has tried, as I have often done, the process of getting out of bed at 2 a.m. in a winter night, lighting a candle, and recording some happy thought which would probably be otherwise forgotten, will agree with me it entails much discomfort. All I have now to do, if I wake and think of something I wish to record, is to draw from under the pillow a small memorandum book containing my Nyctograph, write a few lines, or even a few pages, without even putting the hands outside the bed-clothes, replace the book, and go to sleep again. … I tried rows of square holes, each to hold one letter (quarter of an inch square I found a very convenient size), and this proved a much better plan than the former; but the letters were still apt to be illegible. Then I said to myself ‘Why not invent a square alphabet, using only dots at the corners, and lines along the sides?’ I soon found that, to make the writing easy to read, it was necessary to know where each square began. This I secured by the rule that every square-letter should contain a large black dot in the N.W. corner. … [I] succeeded in getting 23 of [the square-letters] to have a distinct resemblance to the letters they were to represent. Think of the number of lonely hours a blind man often spends doing nothing, when he would gladly record his thoughts, and you will realise what a blessing you can confer on him by giving him a small ‘indelible’ memorandum-book, with a piece of paste-board containing rows of square holes, and teaching him the square-alphabet.}}

From the description it appears that Carroll’s nyctograph was a single row of 16 boxes cut from a piece of card. Carroll would enter one of his symbols in each box, then move the card down to the next line (which, in the darkness, probably, he would have to estimate) and then repeat the process.

==Nyctographic alphabet==
[[File:Nyctographic alphabet.png|thumb|Lewis Carroll's nyctographic alphabet]]
Each character had a large dot or circle in the upper-left corner. Beside the 26 letters of the alphabet, there were five additional characters for 'and', 'the', the corners of the letter 'f' to indicate that the following characters were digits ('figures'), the corners of the letter 'l' to indicate that they were letters, and the corners of the letter 'd' to indicate that the following six characters were a date in DDMMYY format. There was no capitalization, punctuation or digits ''per se'', though modern font designers have created them (e.g. capitals may be double-scored, punctuation marks may have the large dot at the bottom right corner, digits at the bottom left). 

==Numbers==
As in braille, letters were assigned to represent digits. The values were taken from his [[Memoria Technica]], which assigned two consonants to each digit, with vowels unassigned, so that any number could be read off as a word. For nyctography, one of the consonants was used for each digit. Most are the initials of the numerals, as follows. (In brackets are the other values of the Memoria Technica, which apart from leftover ''j'' for 3 have their own motivations.)

* 1 – b (first consonant) [also c]
* 2 – d (for ''duo'' and ''deux'') [also w of 'two']
* 3 – t (for 'three') [also j]
* 4 – f (for 'four') [also q of ''quatre'']
* 5 – l (roman numeral 50) [also v of 'five']
* 6 – s (for 'six') [also x of 'six']
* 7 – m (final of ''septem'') [also p of ''septem'']
* 8 – h (for ''huit'') [also k]
* 9 – n (for 'nine') [also g]
* 0 – z (for 'zero') [also r of 'zero']

'''Ozone''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|z|oʊ|n}}, or '''trioxygen''', is an inorganic [[molecule]] with the [[chemical formula]] '''{{Chem|O|3|}}'''. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively [[pungent]] smell. It is an [[allotrope]] of [[oxygen]] that is much less stable than the [[diatomic]] allotrope {{Chem|O|2}}, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to {{Chem|O|2}} or [[dioxygen]]. Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) and  electrical discharges within the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the [[ozone layer]] of the [[stratosphere]], which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

Ozone's odour is reminiscent of [[chlorine]], and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as {{val|0.1|ul=ppm}} in air. Ozone's O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be [[diamagnetic]]. In [[standard conditions]], ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue [[liquid]] and finally a violet-black [[solid]]. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.&lt;ref name=streng&gt;{{Cite journal

It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.

Ozone is a powerful [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidising potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about {{val|0.1|u=ppm}}. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.

==Nomenclature==
The [[trivial name]] ''ozone'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic names ''2λ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-trioxidiene'' and ''catena-trioxygen'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ''ozone'' derives from ''ozein'' (ὄζειν), the [[greek language|Greek]] verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.

In appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as [[trioxidane]] with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, ''trioxidanylidene'' may be used as a context-specific systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named ''trioxidanediyl''.

''Trioxidanediyl'' (or ''ozonide'') is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for ozone given above.

==History==
[[File:Schönbein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] (18 October 1799 – 29 August 1868)]]
[[File:Smyths revised ozonometer, 1865. (9660571191).jpg|right|thumb|A prototype ozonometer built by John Smyth in 1865]]
In 1785, the Dutch chemist [[Martinus van Marum]] was conducting experiments involving electrical sparking above water when he noticed an unusual smell, which he attributed to the electrical reactions, failing to realize that he had in fact created ozone.&lt;ref name="colostate"/&gt; 

A half century later, [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] noticed the same pungent odour and recognized it as the smell often following a bolt of [[lightning]]. In 1839, he succeeded in isolating the gaseous chemical and named it "ozone", from the Greek word ''{{lang|el|ozein}}'' ({{lang|el|ὄζειν}}) meaning "to smell".&lt;ref name="ozo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Mordecai B.|year=2001 |title=The History of Ozone: The Schönbein Period, 1839–1868 |journal=[[Bull.

For this reason, Schönbein is generally credited with the discovery of ozone.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Jacewicz |first1=Natalie  |title=A Killer of a Cure |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=34–37 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/a-killer-of-a-cure|accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Prestre"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Le Prestre|editor1-first=Philippe G.|title=Protecting the ozone layer : lessons, models, and prospects ; [product of the Tenth Anniversary Colloquium of the Montreal Protocol, held on September 13, 1997 ; part of a series of events held in Montreal to mark the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, September 16, 1987]|date=1998|publisher=Kluwer|location=Boston|isbn=9780792382454 |page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuesUPcIOq8C&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Schönbein|first1=Christian Friedrich|title=Research on the nature of the odour in certain chemical reactions|journal=Letter to the Académie des Sciences in Paris|date=1840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colostate"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/dev/hillger/precursor.htm#schonbein|title=Precursor Era Contributors to Meteorology|work=colostate.edu|date = |first1= Gary|last1= Toth|first2= Don|last2= Hillger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula for ozone, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, was not determined until 1865 by [[Jacques-Louis Soret]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

For much of the second half of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, ozone was considered a healthy component of the environment by naturalists and health-seekers. [[Beaumont, California|Beaumont]], [[California]] had as its official slogan "Beaumont: Zone of Ozone", as evidenced on postcards and Chamber of Commerce letterhead.&lt;ref&gt;Redlands Chamber of Commerce Collection, City Archives, A.K. Smiley Public Library, Redlands, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists working outdoors often considered the higher elevations beneficial because of their ozone content. "There is quite a different atmosphere [at higher elevation] with enough ozone to sustain the necessary energy [to work]", wrote naturalist [[Henry Henshaw]], working in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Henshaw to William Brewster, July 2, 1902, Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Seaside air was considered to be healthy because of its believed ozone content; but the smell giving rise to this belief is in fact that of halogenated seaweed metabolites.&lt;ref name="ashfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/6044238/The-science-behind-that-fresh-seaside-smell.html|title=The science behind that fresh seaside smell|accessdate=|work = The Telegraph |last = O'Connell|first = Sanjida|date = 18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ozone's appeal seems to have resulted from its "fresh" smell, which evoked associations with purifying properties. Scientists, however, noted its harmful effects. In 1873 [[James Dewar]] and [[John Gray McKendrick]] documented that frogs grew sluggish, birds gasped for breath, and rabbits’ blood showed decreased levels of oxygen after exposure to "ozonized air", which "exercised a destructive action".&lt;ref name="Anstie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anstie|first1=Francis|title=Clinic of the Month: Dr. McKendrick on Ozone|journal=The Practitioner: A Journal of Therapeutics and Public Health|date=1874|volume=12|issue=January–June|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrsvAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; Schönbein himself reported that chest pains, irritation of the [[mucous membranes]] and difficulty breathing occurred as a result of inhaling ozone, and small mammals died.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Mordecai B.|title=THE HISTORY OF OZONE.

The only thoroughly well-ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone, so far attained, is that it causes irritation and œdema of the lungs, and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time."&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=L.|last2=Flack|first2=M.|title=The Physiological Influence of Ozone|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=28 December 1911|volume=84|issue=573|pages=404–415|doi=10.1098/rspb.1911.0086|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/84/573/404|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], ozone was tested at [[Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital]] in London as a possible [[disinfectant]] for wounds.  The gas was applied directly to wounds for as long as 15 minutes. This resulted in damage to both bacterial cells and human tissue. Other sanitizing techniques, such as irrigation with [[antiseptics]], were found preferable.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoker |first=George | title=The Surgical Uses of Ozone| journal =Lancet |volume=188 |issue=4860 | year = 1916 | page = 712 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)31717-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Ozone is colourless or pale blue gas (blue when liquefied), slightly soluble in water and much more soluble in inert non-polar solvents such as [[carbon tetrachloride]] or fluorocarbons, in which it forms a blue solution. At {{convert|161|K}}, it condenses to form a dark blue [[liquid]]. It is dangerous to allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point, because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate. At temperatures below {{convert|80|K}}, it forms a violet-black [[solid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most people can detect about 0.01 μmol/mol of ozone in air where it has a very specific sharp odour somewhat resembling [[chlorine bleach]]. Exposure of 0.1 to 1 μmol/mol produces headaches, burning eyes and irritation to the respiratory passages.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book

Even low concentrations of ozone in air are very destructive to organic materials such as latex, plastics and animal lung tissue.

Ozone is [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]], with all its electrons paired. In contrast, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], containing two unpaired electrons.

==Structure==
According to experimental evidence from [[microwave spectroscopy]], ozone is a bent molecule, with C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] (similar to the [[water]] molecule). The O – O distances are {{convert|127.2|pm|Å|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The O – O – O angle is 116.78°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(70)90148-7 | last1 = Tanaka | first1 = Takehiko | last2 = Morino | first2 = Yonezo | year = 1970 | title = Coriolis interaction and anharmonic potential function of ozone from the microwave spectra in the excited vibrational states |journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 538–551 |bibcode = 1970JMoSp..33..538T }}&lt;/ref&gt; The central atom is ''sp''² hybridized with one lone pair.

The arrangement possesses an overall [[bond order]] of 1.5 for both sides.

==Reactions==
Ozone is among the most powerful [[oxidizing]] agents known, far stronger than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also unstable at high concentrations, decaying into ordinary oxygen. Its [[half-life]] varies with atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air movement. In a sealed chamber with a fan that moves the gas, ozone has a half-life of approximately one day at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Half-life time of ozone as a function of air conditions and movement McClurkin, J.D.*#1, Maier, D.E.2. {{DOI|10.5073/jka.2010.425.167.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unverified claims assert that ozone can have a half life of as short as thirty minutes under atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/FAQs/ozone.html – Earth Science FAQ: Where can I find information about the ozone hole and ozone depletion?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601061532/http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/FAQs/ozone.html |date=2006-06-01 }} ''Goddard Space Flight Center'', National Aeronautics and Space Administration, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 {{chem|O|3}} → 3 {{chem|O|2}}

This reaction proceeds more rapidly with increasing temperature. [[Deflagration]] of ozone can be triggered by a spark and can occur in ozone concentrations of 10 [[wt%]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jlp.2005.07.020|title=Explosion properties of highly concentrated ozone gas|year=2005|last1=Koike|first1=K|last2=Nifuku|first2=M|last3=Izumi|first3=K|last4=Nakamura|first4=S|last5=Fujiwara|first5=S|last6=Horiguchi|first6=S|journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries|volume=18|page=465|issue=4–6|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327085613/http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can also be produced from oxygen at the anode of an electrochemical cell. This reaction can create smaller quantities of ozone for research purposes.

H. Freeman|year=2007|isbn=9780716776949|location=|pages=279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be observed as an unwanted reaction in a Hoffman gas apparatus during the electrolysis of water when the voltage is set above the necessary voltage.

===With metals===
Ozone will oxidize most [[metal]]s (except [[gold]], [[platinum]], and [[iridium]]) to [[oxide]]s of the metals in their highest [[oxidation state]]. For example:

: {{chem|Cu}} + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|Cu|O}} + {{chem|O|2}}

===With nitrogen and carbon compounds===
Ozone also oxidizes [[nitric oxide]] to [[nitrogen dioxide]]:
: NO + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|O|2}}
This reaction is accompanied by [[chemiluminescence]]. The {{chem|N|O|2}} can be further oxidized:
: {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|3}} + {{chem|O|2}}
The {{chem|N|O|3}} formed can react with {{chem|N|O|2}} to form {{chem|N|2|O|5|link=Dinitrogen pentoxide}}.

Solid [[nitronium perchlorate]] can be made from NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and {{chem|O|3}} gases:
: {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|Cl|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|2|Cl|O|4}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}

Ozone does not react with ammonium [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]]s, but it oxidizes [[ammonia]] to [[ammonium nitrate]]:
: 2 {{chem|N|H|3}} + 4 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|H|4|N|O|3}} + 4 {{chem|O|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Ozone reacts with [[carbon]]&lt;!--graphite?--&gt; to form [[carbon dioxide]], even at room temperature:
: C + 2 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|C|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}

===With sulfur compounds===
Ozone oxidises [[sulfide]]s to [[sulfate]]s. For example, [[lead(II) sulfide]] is oxidised to [[lead(II) sulfate]]:
: PbS + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Sulfuric acid]] can be produced from ozone, water and either elemental [[sulfur]] or [[sulfur dioxide]]:
: S + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
: 3 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

In the [[gas phase]], ozone reacts with [[hydrogen sulfide]] to form sulfur dioxide:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In an [[aqueous]] solution, however, two competing simultaneous reactions occur, one to produce elemental sulfur, and one to produce [[sulfuric acid]]:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → S + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
: 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

===With alkenes and alkynes===
{{main|ozonolysis}}
Alkenes can be oxidatively cleaved by ozone, in a process called [[ozonolysis]], giving alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, depending on the second step of the workup.

:[[File:Ozonolysis scheme.svg]]

Ozone can also cleave alkynes to form a [[acid anhydride]] or [[diketone]] product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey|first= P. S. |chapter=Chapter 2| title=Ozonation in Organic Chemistry |volume=2 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York, NY |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-12-073102-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the reaction is performed in the presence of water, the anhydride hydrolyzes to give two [[carboxylic acid]]s.

:[[File:Ozonolysis-alkyne.png|none|450px]]

Usually ozonolysis is carried out in a solution of [[dichloromethane]], at a temperature of −78&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. After a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement, an organic ozonide is formed. With reductive workup (e.g. [[zinc]] in [[acetic acid]] or [[dimethyl sulfide]]), ketones and aldehydes will be formed, with oxidative workup (e.g. aqueous or alcoholic [[hydrogen peroxide]]), carboxylic acids will be formed.&lt;ref name="OrgChem"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other substrates===

All three [[atom]]s of ozone may also react, as in the reaction of [[tin(II) chloride]] with [[hydrochloric acid]] and ozone:
: 3 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + {{chem|O|3}} → 3 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Iodine perchlorate can be made by treating [[iodine]] dissolved in cold [[anhydrous]] [[perchloric acid]] with ozone:
: I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 I(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Combustion===
Ozone can be used for [[combustion]] reactions and combustible gases; ozone provides higher temperatures than burning in [[dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The following is a reaction for the combustion of [[carbon subnitride]] which can also cause higher temperatures:

: 3 {{chem|C|4|N|2}} + 4 {{chem|O|3}} → 12 CO + 3 {{chem|N|2}}

Ozone can react at cryogenic temperatures. At {{convert|77|K}}, atomic [[hydrogen]] reacts with liquid ozone to form a hydrogen [[superoxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]], which [[dimerizes]]:&lt;ref name="Horvath M. 1985. pg 44"&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=Ozone|pages=44–49|author1=Horvath M. |author2=Bilitzky L. |author3=Huttner J. |isbn=978-0-444-99625-1|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: H + {{chem|O|3}} → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O
: 2 HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|H|2|O|4}}

===Reduction to ozonides===
Reduction of ozone gives the [[ozonide]] anion, O{{sup sub|−|3}}. Derivatives of this anion are explosive and must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. Ozonides for all the [[alkali metal]]s are known. KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, RbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be prepared from their respective superoxides:
: KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Although KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be formed as above, it can also be formed from [[potassium hydroxide]] and ozone:&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2 KOH + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
NaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and LiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must be prepared by action of CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on an [[ion exchange resin]] containing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
A solution of [[calcium]] in ammonia reacts with ozone to give to ammonium ozonide and not calcium ozonide:&lt;ref name="Horvath M. 1985. pg 44"/&gt;
: 3 Ca + 10 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 {{chem|O|3}} → Ca·6NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Applications===
Ozone can be used to remove [[iron]] and [[manganese]] from [[water]], forming a [[precipitate]] which can be filtered:
: 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
: 2 Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 MnO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
Ozone will also oxidize dissolved [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water to [[sulfurous acid]]:
: 3 {{chem|O|3}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These three reactions are central in the use of ozone based well water treatment.

Ozone will also detoxify [[cyanide]]s by converting them to [[cyanate]]s.
: CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|CNO|-}} + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Ozone will also completely decompose [[urea]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=Ozone|pages=259, 269–270|author1=Horvath M. |author2=Bilitzky L. |author3=Huttner J. |isbn=978-0-444-99625-1|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Spectroscopic properties==

Ozone is a bent [[triatomic molecule]] with three vibrational modes: the symmetric stretch (1103.157&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), bend (701.42&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and antisymmetric stretch (1042.096&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=B4000064&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=800#ref-1|title = Ozone |date = |accessdate = |website =NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology |publisher =U.S. Department of Commerce |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symmetric stretch and bend are weak absorbers, but the antisymmetric stretch is strong and responsible for ozone being an important minor [[greenhouse gas]]. This IR band is also used to detect ambient and atmospheric ozone although UV based measurements are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapterurl = https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/Ed2008Up2010/Part-I/WMO8_Ed2008_PartI_Ch16_Up2010_en.pdf|chapter= Chapter 16: Measurement of Ozone|title = Part I: Measurement of Meteorological Variables|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = World Meteorological Organization|first = |deadurl =yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160331164807/https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/Ed2008Up2010/Part-I/WMO8_Ed2008_PartI_Ch16_Up2010_en.pdf|archivedate =31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electronic spectrum of ozone is quite complex. An overview can be seen at the MPI Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Ozone/O3_overview_log.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Max Planck Institute – Mainz|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the bands are dissociative, meaning that the molecule falls apart to {{nobr|O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} after absorbing a photon. The most important absorption is the Hartley band, extending from slightly above 300&amp;nbsp;nm down to slightly above 200&amp;nbsp;nm. It is this band that is responsible for absorbing UV&amp;nbsp;C in the stratosphere.

On the high wavelength side, the Hartley band transitions to the so-called Huggins band, which falls off rapidly until disappearing by ~360&amp;nbsp;nm. Above 400&amp;nbsp;nm, extending well out into the NIR, are the Chappius and Wulf bands. There, unstructured absorption bands are useful for detecting high ambient concentrations of ozone, but are so weak that they do not have much practical effect.

There are additional absorption bands in the far UV, which increase slowly from 200&amp;nbsp;nm down to reaching a maximum at ~120&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Ozone in Earth's atmosphere==
[[File:Atmospheric ozone.svg|thumb|The distribution of atmospheric ozone in partial pressure as a function of altitude]][[File:Nimbus ozone Brewer-Dobson circulation.jpg|thumb|Concentration of ozone as measured by the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus-7]] satellite]]
[[File:IM ozavg ept 200006.png|thumb|Total ozone concentration in June 2000 as measured by EP-TOMS satellite instrument]]
The standard way to express total ozone levels (the amount of ozone in a given vertical column) in the atmosphere is by using [[Dobson unit]]s. Point measurements are reported as [[mole fraction]]s in nmol/mol (parts per billion, ppb) or as [[concentration]]s in μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The study of ozone concentration in the atmosphere started in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozmeas.htm|title=Measured Ozone Depletion| work= Ozone-Information.com| accessdate=2014-01-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130914112129/http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozmeas.htm |archivedate = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone layer===
{{Main|Ozone layer}}

====Location and production====
The highest levels of ozone in the atmosphere are in the [[stratosphere]], in a region also known as the [[ozone layer]] between about 10&amp;nbsp;km and 50&amp;nbsp;km above the surface (or between about 6 and 31 miles). However, even in this "layer", the ozone concentrations are only two to eight parts per million, so most of the oxygen there is dioxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at about 210,000 parts per million by volume.&lt;ref name=“Hultman”&gt;{{cite book | last= Hultman | first= G. Eric | date= 1980-01-01 | title= The Ozone Survival Manual |url= |location= |publisher= McGraw-Hill |page= |isbn= 9780915498734 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone in the stratosphere is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160&amp;nbsp;nm. Oxygen starts to absorb weakly at 240&amp;nbsp;nm in the Herzberg bands, but most of the oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong '''[[Schumann–Runge bands]]''' between 200 and 160&amp;nbsp;nm where ozone does not absorb. While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121&amp;nbsp;nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest: O2, Lyman-alpha|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keller-Rudek|first = Hannelore|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015120/http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of ozone creation and destruction is called the [[Chapman cycle]] and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen

:{{chem|O|2}} + [[photon]] (radiation λ &lt; 240 nm) → 2 O
followed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.
:O + {{chem|O|2}} + M → {{chem|O|3}} + M

where "M" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction. The ozone molecule can then absorb a UV-C photon and dissociate

{{chem|O|3}} → O + {{chem|O|2}} + kinetic energy

The excess kinetic energy heats the stratosphere when the O atoms and the molecular oxygen fly apart and collide with other molecules. This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone. In the clear atmosphere, with only nitrogen and oxygen, ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:{{chem|O|3}} + O → 2 {{chem|O|2}}

An estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The termination reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th Century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC) and similar [[Haloalkane|chlorinated and brominated organic molecules]]. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], the ban on the production of many [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting]] chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st Century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.

====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====
[[Image:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|Levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation. Essentially all UVC (100–280&amp;nbsp;nm) is blocked by dioxygen (at 100–200&amp;nbsp;nm) or by ozone (at 200–280&amp;nbsp;nm) in the atmosphere. The shorter portion of this band and even more energetic UV causes the formation of the ozone layer, when single oxygen atoms produced by UV [[photolysis]] of dioxygen (below 240&amp;nbsp;nm) react with more dioxygen. The ozone layer itself then blocks most, but not quite all, sunburn-producing UVB (280–315&amp;nbsp;nm). The band of UV closest to visible light, UVA (315–400&amp;nbsp;nm), is hardly affected by ozone, and most of it reaches the ground.]]

Ozone in the ozone layer filters out sunlight wavelengths from about 200&amp;nbsp;nm UV rays to 315&amp;nbsp;nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr0205255|title=Photolysis of Atmospheric Ozone in the Ultraviolet Region|year=2003|last1=Matsumi|first1=Yutaka|last2=Kawasaki|first2=Masahiro|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=103|issue=12|pages=4767–82|pmid=14664632}} See the graphical absorption of ozone in two of its absorption bands, as a function of wavelength.&lt;/ref&gt; This ozone UV absorption is important to life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;nm) through the lower UV-C (200–280&amp;nbsp;nm) and the entire UV-B band (280–315&amp;nbsp;nm). The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290&amp;nbsp;nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of [[vitamin D]] in humans.

The ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315–400&amp;nbsp;nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see [[ultraviolet]] for more information on near ultraviolet).

===Low level ozone===
{{Main|Tropospheric ozone|Photochemical smog}}

Low level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.&lt;ref name=who-Europe&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf Health Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide]. WHO-Europe report 13–15 January 2003 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not emitted directly by [[Internal combustion engine|car engines]] or by industrial operations, but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing [[Volatile organic compound|hydrocarbon]]s and [[nitrogen oxide]]s that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers down wind.

Ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as [[aldehyde]]s and thus begins their removal from the air, but the products are themselves key components of [[photochemical smog|smog]]. Ozone [[photolysis]] by UV light leads to production of the [[hydroxyl radical]] HO• and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as [[peroxyacyl nitrates]], which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =Stevenson| year=2006|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005JD006338.shtml|title=Multimodel ensemble simulations of present-day and near-future tropospheric ozone| publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|accessdate=2006-09-16|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with [[photosynthesis]] and stunts overall growth of some plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-07-31|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=23565|title=Rising Ozone Levels Pose Challenge to U.S. Soybean Production, Scientists Say|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutters|first=Randall|date=March 1999|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/abstracts/94-345.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040217151427/http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/abstracts/94-345.htm|archivedate=2004-02-17|title=Statewide Potential Crop Yield Losses From Ozone Exposure|publisher=California Air Resources Board|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] is proposing a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage, in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health.

Certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are [[Houston, Texas]], and [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. Houston has a reading of around 41 nmol/mol, while Mexico City is far more hazardous, with a reading of about 125 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"/&gt;

====Ozone cracking====
[[File:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|right|Ozone cracking in [[natural rubber]] tubing]]
Ozone gas attacks any [[polymer]] possessing olefinic or [[double bond]]s within its chain structure, such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]], and [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding [[antiozonant]]s, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. [[Ozone cracking]] used to be a serious problem in car tires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Layer|first1=Robert W.|last2= Lattimer|first2= Robert P.|title = Protection of Rubber against Ozone|journal = Rubber Chemistry and Technology|date = July 1990|volume = 63|number =3|pages = 426-450| doi = 10.5254/1.3538264}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, but it is not an issue with modern tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like [[gasket]]s and [[O-ring]]s, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. [[Fuel line]]s made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electric motor]] can accelerate ozone cracking. The [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.

====Ozone as a greenhouse gas====
Although ozone was present at ground level before the [[Industrial Revolution]], peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1998|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/TOP08-98/page004.html|title=Tropospheric Ozone in EU – The consolidated report|publisher=European Environmental Agency|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710143636/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|archivedate=2006-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone acts as a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing some of the [[infrared]] energy emitted by the earth. Quantifying the greenhouse gas potency of ozone is difficult because it is not present in uniform concentrations across the globe. However, the most widely accepted scientific assessments relating to [[climate change]] (e.g. the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[Third Assessment Report]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/|title=Climate Change 2001|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-09-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913043522/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/|archivedate=2006-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the [[radiative forcing]] of tropospheric ozone is about 25% that of [[carbon dioxide]].

The annual [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is between 918–1022 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]]/tons tropospheric ozone. This means on a per-molecule basis, ozone in the troposphere has a [[radiative forcing]] effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as [[carbon dioxide]]. However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived [[greenhouse gas]], which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than [[carbon dioxide]]. This means that over a 20-year span, the [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is much less, roughly 62 to 69 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] / ton tropospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;Life Cycle Assessment Methodology Sufficient to Support Public Declarations and Claims, Committee Draft Standard, Version 2.1. Scientific Certification Systems, February 2011. Annex B, Section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its short-lived nature, tropospheric ozone does not have strong global effects, but has very strong radiative forcing effects on regional scales. In fact, there are regions of the world where tropospheric ozone has a [[radiative forcing]] up to 150% of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://acdb-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data_services/cloud_slice/ NASA GODDARD HOMEPAGE FOR TROPOSPHERIC OZONE NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Code 613.3, Chemistry and Dynamics Branch].

[[File:SignboardAirQualityHouston.JPG|thumb|Signboard in [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]], [[Houston]] indicating an ozone watch]]
[[Ozone precursors]] are a group of pollutants, predominantly those emitted during the combustion of [[fossil fuels]]. Ground-level ozone pollution ([[tropospheric ozone]]) is created near the Earth's surface by the action of daylight [[ultraviolet|UV]] rays on these precursors. The ozone at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors, but [[methane]] is a natural precursor, and the very low natural background level of ozone at ground level is considered safe. This section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel burning, which raises ground level ozone far above background levels.

There is a great deal of evidence to show that ground-level ozone can harm lung function and irritate the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref name="who-Europe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf Answer to follow-up questions from CAFE (2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909162153/http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf |date=2005-09-09 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to ozone (and the pollutants that produce it) is linked to premature [[death]], [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]], [[heart attack]], and other cardiopulmonary problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=[[EPA]] Course Developers |title=Health Effects of Ozone in the General Population |url=https://www.epa.gov/ozone-pollution-and-your-patients-health/health-effects-ozone-general-population |publisher=[[EPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=Ozone nation: EPA standard panned by the people |journal=Environ.

Long-term exposure to ozone has been shown to increase risk of death from [[respiratory illness]]. A study of 450,000 people living in United States cities saw a significant correlation between ozone levels and respiratory illness over the 18-year follow-up period. The study revealed that people living in cities with high ozone levels, such as Houston or Los Angeles, had an over 30% increased risk of dying from lung disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jerrett |first1=Michael |last2=Burnett |first2=Richard T. |last3=Pope |first3=C.

Air quality guidelines such as those from the [[World Health Organization]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[European Union]] are based on detailed studies designed to identify the levels that can cause measurable ill [[health effect]]s.

According to scientists with the US EPA, susceptible people can be adversely affected by ozone levels as low as 40 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1440818 | title=Ozone Overload: Current Standards May Not Protect Health | journal=Environ.

Retrieved on 2013-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone concentration is measured as a maximum daily mean of 8 hour averages and the target should not be exceeded on more than 25 calendar days per year, starting from January 2010. Whilst the directive requires in the future a strict compliance with 120&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; limit (i.e. mean ozone concentration not to be exceeded on any day of the year), there is no date set for this requirement and this is treated as a long-term objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:152:0001:0044:EN:PDF |publisher=EC |accessdate=2010-08-23 |date=2008-06-11 |title=DIRECTIVE 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] directs the EPA to set [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] for several pollutants, including ground-level ozone, and counties out of compliance with these standards are required to take steps to reduce their levels. In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"/&gt; Many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comments of the American Lung Association, Environmental Defense, Sierra Club on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Proposed Revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone July 11, 2007 – 72 FR 37818 |url=http://www.lungusa.org/get-involved/advocate/advocacy-documents/Comments-to-the-Environmental-Protection-Agency-re-National-Ambient-Air-Quality-Standard-for-Ozone.PDF |format=PDF |publisher=Lungusa.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710051224/http://www.lungusa.org/get-involved/advocate/advocacy-documents/Comments-to-the-Environmental-Protection-Agency-re-National-Ambient-Air-Quality-Standard-for-Ozone.PDF |archivedate=July 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]] recommends 51 nmol/mol.

On January 7, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for the pollutant ozone, the principal component of smog:

:... EPA proposes that the level of the 8-hour primary standard, which was set at 0.075 μmol/mol in the 2008 final rule, should instead be set at a lower level within the range of 0.060 to 0.070 μmol/mol, to provide increased protection for children and other ‘‘at risk’’ populations against an array of {{Chem|O|3}} – related adverse health effects that range from decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms to serious indicators of respiratory morbidity including emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, and possibly cardiovascular-related morbidity as well as total non- accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/fr/20100119.pdf National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone]. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Proposed rule&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2015, the EPA published a final rule with an effective date of December 28, 2015 that revised the 8-hour primary NAAQS from 0.075 ppm to 0.070 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/26/2015-26594/national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-ozone|title=Federal Register {{!}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone|website=www.federalregister.gov|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has developed an [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI) to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. Under the current standards, eight-hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 nmol/mol are described as "unhealthy for sensitive groups", 105 nmol/mol to 124 nmol/mol as "unhealthy", and 125 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as "very unhealthy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airinfonow.org/html/ed_ozone.html What is Ozone?] airinfonow.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can also be present in [[indoor air pollution]], partly as a result of electronic equipment such as photocopiers. A connection has also been known to exist between the increased pollen, fungal spores, and ozone caused by thunderstorms and hospital admissions of [[asthma]] sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=W. |last =Anderson |author2=G.J.

In the [[Victorian era]], one British folk myth held that the smell of the sea was caused by ozone. In fact, the characteristic "smell of the sea" is caused by [[dimethyl sulfide]], a chemical generated by [[phytoplankton]]. Victorian British folk considered the resulting smell "bracing".&lt;ref&gt;University of East Anglia press release, [http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/research/reshigh/cloning Cloning the smell of the seaside], February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology===
{{See also|Trioxidane}}
Ozone, along with reactive forms of oxygen such as [[superoxide]], [[singlet oxygen]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hypochlorite]] ions, is produced by [[white blood cell]]s and other biological systems (such as the roots of [[Tagetes|marigold]]s) as a means of destroying foreign bodies. Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen [[free radical]]s, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many [[Organic compound|organic molecules]]. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of [[inflammation]]. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. A team headed by Paul Wentworth Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] has shown evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human [[Immune system|immune response]] to the production of ozone. In this system, ozone is produced by antibody-catalyzed production of [[trioxidane]] from water and neutrophil-produced singlet oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Story of O| first=Roald |last=Hoffmann| journal=American Scientist|volume=92|issue= 1|page=23|date=January 2004|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/29647?&amp;print=yes| doi=10.1511/2004.1.23 |accessdate=2006-10-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925011907/http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/29647?&amp;print=yes |archivedate = 2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When inhaled, ozone reacts with compounds lining the lungs to form specific, cholesterol-derived metabolites that are thought to facilitate the build-up and pathogenesis of [[atherosclerotic plaques]] (a form of [[heart disease]]). These metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human atherosclerotic arteries and are categorized into a class of secosterols termed ''[[atheronals]]'', generated by [[ozonolysis]] of cholesterol's double bond to form a [[atheronals|5,6 secosterol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Smith|first = LL|title = Oxygen, oxysterols, ouabain, and ozone: a cautionary tale|journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 318–24 |year = 2004|pmid = 15223065|doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.04.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a secondary condensation product via aldolization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence for Ozone Formation in Human Atherosclerotic Arteries|doi=10.1126/science.1089525|author=Paul Wentworth|year=2003|journal=Science|volume=302|pmid=14605372|last2=Nieva|first2=J|last3=Takeuchi|first3=C|last4=Galve|first4=R|last5=Wentworth|first5=AD|last6=Dilley|first6=RB|last7=Delaria|first7=GA|last8=Saven|first8=A|last9=Babior|first9=BM|last10=Janda|first10=K.

Ozone has been implicated to have an adverse effect on plant growth: "... ozone reduced total chlorophylls, carotenoid and carbohydrate concentration, and increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content and ethylene production. In treated plants, the ascorbate leaf pool was decreased, while lipid peroxidation and solute leakage were significantly higher than in ozone-free controls. The data indicated that ozone triggered protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in citrus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Iglesias |first = Domingo J. |author2=Ángeles Calatayuda |author3=Eva Barrenob |author4=Eduardo Primo-Milloa |author5=Manuel Talon|title = Responses of citrus plants to ozone: leaf biochemistry, antioxidant mechanisms and lipid peroxidation|journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry|volume = 44|issue = 2–3|pages = 125–131|year = 2006|doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2006.03.007|pmid = 16644230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety regulations===
Because of the strongly oxidizing properties of ozone, ozone is a primary irritant, affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations. The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-o-zone.cc/research/abstracts/OSHC.pdf What are the main health hazards associated with breathing in ozone?], Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, [[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 μmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and [[NIOSH]] has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 μmol/mol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH)]: NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95)&lt;/ref&gt; Work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL. Continuous monitors for ozone are available from several suppliers.

==Production==
[[File:THC 2003.902.021 E. H. Johnson Ozone Production.jpg|thumb|right | Ozone production demonstration, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926]]

Ozone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not react.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Ozone used in industry is measured in μmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.

Temperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.

===Corona discharge method===
[[File:Shkarkese elektrike.jpg|thumb|A homemade ozone generator. Ozone is produced in the corona discharge|alt=]]
This is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the "hot spark" coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a [[Corona discharge|corona discharge tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Smith, L. I.; Greenwood, F. L. and Hudrlik, O. |collvol=3|collvolpages=673 |volume=26|pages=63|year=1946|title=A laboratory ozonizer|prep=cv3p0673}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s as a by-product. Use of an [[air dryer]] can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an [[oxygen concentrator]] can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.

===Ultraviolet light===
UV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dohan |first=J. M. |author2=W. J. Masschelein |year=1987 |journal=Ozone Sci. Eng.|title=Photochemical Generation of Ozone: Present State-of-the-Art |volume=9 |pages=315–334 |doi=10.1080/01919518708552147 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive.  However UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], for example). Production of ozone is one of the [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Potential dangers|potential dangers]] of [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and [[spa]] applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.

===Cold plasma===
In the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by [[dielectric barrier discharge]]. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.

Cold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production. However, because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive, they are found less frequently than the previous two types.

The discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.

Some cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. These species are even more reactive than ordinary {{chem|O|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gujral, et al|first=Sarbjeet Singh|year=2013|title=Ozone Therapy: A Milestone in the Treatment of Ailments|url=http://www.iglobaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/8.-Sarbjeet-S-Gujral-et-al-IGJPS-2013_edited.pdf|journal=Indo Global Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=167–173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrolytic===
Electrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
In most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20–30% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high [[overpotential]] required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are [[lead dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Foller, Peter C. |author2=Tobias, Charles W. |title=The Anodic Evolution of Ozone|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=129|issue=3|pages=506|doi=10.1149/1.2123890|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; or boron-doped diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arihara, Kazuki |author2=Terashima, Chiaki |author3=Fujishimam Akira |title= Electrochemical Production of High-Concentration Ozone-Water Using Freestanding Perforated Diamond Electrodes|journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= E71|doi= 10.1149/1.2509385|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special considerations===
Ozone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20&amp;nbsp;kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around {{convert|2|bar|lk=on}} absolute in oxygen and {{convert|3|bar}} absolute in air. Several megawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] may be installed in large facilities, applied as one phase AC [[Electric current|current]] at 50 to 8000&amp;nbsp;Hz and peak [[voltage]]s between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.

The dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.

Because of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like [[stainless steel]] (quality 316L), [[titanium]], [[aluminium]] (as long as no moisture is present), [[glass]], [[polytetrafluorethylene]], or [[polyvinylidene fluoride]]. [[Viton]] may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). [[Hypalon]] may be used with the restriction that no water come in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. [[Embrittlement]] or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like [[O-rings]].

[[Silicone rubber]]s are usually adequate for use as [[gaskets]] in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.

===Incidental production===
Ozone may be formed from {{chem|O|2}} by electrical discharges and by action of high energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Arc suppression|Unsuppressed arcing]] in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [{{chem|O|2}} → 2O]. Free radicals of oxygen in and around the arc recombine to create ozone [{{chem|O|3}}].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression'' | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[electrical equipment]] generate significant levels of ozone. This is especially true of devices using [[high voltage]]s, such as [[Air ioniser|ionic air purifiers]], [[laser printer]]s, [[photocopier]]s, [[electroshock weapon|tasers]] and [[arc welding|arc welders]]. [[Electric motor]]s using [[brush (electric)|brush]]es can generate ozone from repeated [[spark gap|spark]]ing inside the unit. Large motors that use brushes, such as those used by elevators or hydraulic pumps, will generate more ozone than smaller motors.

Ozone is similarly formed in the [[Catatumbo lightning|Catatumbo lightning storms]] phenomenon on the [[Catatumbo River]] in [[Venezuela]], though ozone's instability makes it dubious that it has any effect on the ozonosphere.&lt;ref name="Zulia"&gt;[http://www.agenciadenoticias.luz.edu.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4965&amp;Itemid=151 ¿Relámpagos del Catatumbo regeneran la capa de ozono?]. Agencia de noticias de la [[Universidad del Zulia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the world's largest single natural generator of ozone, lending calls for it to be designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="meteo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire in the Sky|url=http://www.meteogroup.co.uk/uk/home/weather/weather_news/news_archive/archive/2007/november/ch/f540146dcc/article/fire_in_the_sky.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215231/http://www.meteogroup.co.uk/uk/home/weather/weather_news/news_archive/archive/2007/november/ch/f540146dcc/article/fire_in_the_sky.html|archivedate=2011-07-21|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory production===
In the laboratory, ozone can be produced by [[electrolysis]] using a [[9 volt battery]], a pencil graphite rod [[cathode]], a [[platinum]] wire [[anode]] and a 3 [[molar (concentration)|molar]] [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ibanez|first=Jorge G. |author2=Rodrigo Mayen-Mondragon |author3=M. T. Moran-Moran|year=2005|title=Laboratory Experiments on the Electrochemical Remediation of the Environment. Part 7: Microscale Production of Ozone|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=82|issue=10|page=1546|url=http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2005/Oct/abs1546.html|accessdate=2006-05-10|doi=10.1021/ed082p1546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[half cell]] reactions taking place are:

: 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Table of standard electrode potentials|ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;]] = −1.53 [[Volt|V]])
: 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 V)
: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.23 V)

In the net reaction, three equivalents of water are converted into one equivalent of ozone and three equivalents of [[hydrogen]]. Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.

It can also be generated by a [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|arc]]. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a [[Neon-sign transformer]] is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.

It is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry  {{chem|O|2}} is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, [[electricity]] will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form {{chem|O|3}} and {{chem|O|2}} which will flow out the top port. The reaction can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;

: 3 {{chem|O|2}} — ''electricity'' → 2 {{chem|O|3}}

==Applications==

===Industry===
The largest use of ozone is in the preparation of [[pharmaceuticals]], [[synthetic lubricants]], and many other commercially useful [[organic compounds]], where it is used to sever [[carbon]]-carbon bonds.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; It can also be used for [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]ing substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ozonesolutions.com/Ozone_Color_Removal.html|work = Ozone Information|title = Ozone and Color Removal| accessdate = 2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common [[chlorine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoigné |first= J.|title=Handbook of Environmental Chemistry, Vol. 5 part C|pages=83–141|year=1998 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone has a very high [[oxidation potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ozone-information.com/Oxidation_Potential_Ozone.html|title=Oxidation Potential of Ozone| work= Ozone-Information.com| accessdate=2008-05-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419034421/http://www.ozone-information.com/Oxidation_Potential_Ozone.html |archivedate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone does not form [[organochlorine]] compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen [[bromate]] in source water with high [[bromide]] concentrations. The U.S. [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual [[free chlorine]] in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where [[Electric power|electrical power]] is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.

Although low levels of ozone have been advertised to be of some disinfectant use in residential homes, the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid, substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Humidity control can vastly improve both the killing power of the ozone and the rate at which it decays back to oxygen (more humidity allows more effectiveness). [[Spore]] forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations at which asthma patients start to have issues.

Industrially, ozone is used to:

Ozone is a [[reagent]] in many [[organic reactions]] in the laboratory and in industry. [[Ozonolysis]] is the cleavage of an [[alkene]] to [[carbonyl]] compounds.

Many hospitals around the world use large ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between surgeries. The rooms are cleaned and then sealed airtight before being filled with ozone which effectively kills or neutralizes all remaining bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Boer |first1=Hero E.

===Consumers===
{{see also|Air purifier#Potential ozone hazards}}
Devices generating high levels of ozone, some of which use ionization, are used to sanitize and deodorize uninhabited buildings, rooms, ductwork, woodsheds, boats and other vehicles.

In the U.S., [[air purifier]]s emitting low levels of ozone have been sold. This kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has declared that there is "evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals" or "viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants". Furthermore, its report states that "results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer’s operating instructions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html EPA report on consumer ozone air purifiers]. Epa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonated water is used to launder clothes and to sanitize food, drinking water, and surfaces in the home. According to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), it is "amending the [[food additive]] regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial agent]] on food, including meat and poultry." Studies at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] demonstrated that 0.3 μmol/mol levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food-borne microorganisms as salmonella, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and ''Campylobacter''. This quantity is 20,000 times the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]-recommended limits stated above.&lt;ref name="food"&gt;{{cite web|last=Montecalvo |first=Joseph |author2=Doug Williams |title=Application of Ozonation in Sanitizing Vegetable Process Washwaters |publisher=California Polytechnic State University |url=http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-24 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528140629/http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Long| first=Ron| year=2008| url=http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715132442/http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archivedate=2011-07-15| format=PDF| title=POU Ozone Food Sanitation: A Viable Option for Consumers &amp; the Food Service Industry}} (the report also shows that tapwater removes 99.95% of pathogens from lettuce; samples were inoculated with pathogens before treatment)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is used in homes and [[hot tub]]s to kill bacteria in the water and to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state. Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with [[halogens]]. Gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_07_13_mdbp_alternative_disinfectants_guidance.pdf |format=PDF|title=Alternative Disinfectants and Oxidant Guidance Manual|date=April 1999|publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is also widely used in treatment of water in aquariums and fish ponds. Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate "yellowing" of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fish's gill structures. Natural salt water (with life forms) provides enough "instantaneous demand" that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ion to [[hypobromous acid]], and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen, fish's gill structures will atrophy and they will become dependent on higher dissolved oxygen levels.

===Aquaculture===
Ozonation – a process of infusing water with ozone – can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown. Ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce [[nitrite]] levels&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0959-8030(96)90006-X | last1 = Noble | first1 = A.C. | last2 = Summerfelt | first2 = S.T. | year = 1996 | title = Diseases encountered in rainbow trout cultured in recirculating systems |journal = Annual Review of Fish Diseases | volume = 6 |pages = 65–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through conversion into [[nitrate]]. If nitrite levels in the water are high, nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish, where it interferes with oxygen transport (it causes oxidation of the heme-group of [[haemoglobin]] from ferrous ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) to ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}), making haemoglobin unable to bind {{chem|O|2}}).&lt;ref name="Ferreira"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0044-8486(03)00524-6 | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = O| last2 = de Costa | first2 = O.T. | last3 = Ferreira | first3 = Santos | last4 = Mendonca | first4 = F. | year = 2004 | title = Susceptibility of the Amazonian fish, Colossoma macropomum (Serrasalminae), to short-term exposure to nitrite |journal = Aquaculture | volume = 232 |pages = 627–636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these apparent positive effects, ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of bioavailable iodine in salt water systems, resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goitre and decreased growth in Senegalese sole (''[[Solea senegalensis]]'') larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ribeiro | first1 = A.R.A. | last2 = Ribeiro | first2 = L. | last3 = Saele | first3 = Ø. | last4 = Hamre | first4 = K. | last5 = Dinis | first5 = M.T. | last6 = Moren | first6 = M. | title = Iodine-enriched rotifers andArtemiaprevent goitre in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae reared in a recirculation system | journal = Aquaculture Nutrition | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00740.x | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonate seawater is used for surface disinfection of [[haddock]] and [[Atlantic halibut]] eggs against nodavirus. Nodavirus is a lethal and vertically transmitted virus which causes severe mortality in fish. Haddock eggs should not be treated with high ozone level as eggs so treated did not hatch and died after 3–4 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaeng.2005.10.001 | last1 = Buchan | first1 = K. | last2 = Martin-Robinchaud | first2 = D. | last3 = Benfey | first3 = T.J. | last4 = MacKinnon | year = 2006 | first4 = A | last5 = Boston | first5 = L | title = The efficacy of ozonated seawater for surface disinfection of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) eggs against piscine nodavirus |journal = Aquacultural Engineering | volume = 35 |pages = 102–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Ozone application on freshly cut pineapple and banana shows increase in flavonoids and total phenol contents when exposure is up to 20 minutes. Decrease in [[ascorbic acid]] (one form of [[vitamin C]]) content is observed but the positive effect on total phenol content and flavonoids can overcome the negative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ifset.2010.08.008 | last1 = Alothman | first1 = M. | last2 = Kaur | first2 = B. | last3 = Fazilah | first3 = A. | last4 = Bhat | year = 2010 | first4 = Rajeev | last5 = Karim | first5 = Alias A. | title = Ozone-induced changes of antioxidant capacity of fresh-cut tropical fruits |journal = Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 666–671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomatoes upon treatment with ozone shows an increase in β-carotene, lutein and lycopene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.03.004 | last1 = Tzortzakis | first1 = N. | last2 = Borland | first2 = A. | last3 = Singleton | first3 = I. | year = 2007 | last4 = Barnes | first4 = J | title = Impact of atmospheric ozone-enrichment on quality-related attributes of tomato fruit |journal = Postharvest Biology and Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 317–325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ozone application on strawberries in pre-harvest period shows decrease in ascorbic acid content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.12.003 | last1 = Keutgen | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Pawelzik | first2 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Influence of pre-harvest ozone exposure on quality of strawberry fruit under simulated retail conditions |journal = Postharvest Biology and Technology | volume = 49 |pages = 10–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone facilitates the extraction of some heavy metals from soil using [[EDTA]]. EDTA forms strong, water-soluble coordination compounds with some heavy metals ([[Lead|Pb]], [[Zinc|Zn]]) thereby making it possible to dissolve them out from contaminated soil. If contaminated soil is pre-treated with ozone, the extraction efficacy of [[Lead|Pb]], [[Americium|Am]] and [[Plutonium|Pu]] increases by 11.0–28.9%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.03.005 | last1 = Lestan | first1 = D. | last2 = Hanc | first2 = A. | last3 = Finzgar | first3 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Influence of ozonation on extractability of Pb and Zn from contaminated soils |journal = Chemosphere | volume = 61 | issue = 7| pages = 1012–1019 | pmid = 16257321 | bibcode = 2005Chmsp..61.1012L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 43.5%&lt;ref name="Plaue"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1524/ract.91.6.309.20026 | last1 = Plaue | first1 = J.W. | last2 = Czerwinski | first2 = K.R. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of ozone on ligand-assisted extraction of 239Pu and 241Am from rocky flats soil |journal = Radiochim.

'''''Pars pro toto''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɑːr|z|_|p|r|əʊ|_|ˈ|t|əʊ|t|əʊ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pars_pro_toto|title=pars pro toto {{!}} Definition of pars pro toto in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-la|ˈpars proː ˈtoː.toː|lang}}), [[Latin]] for "a part (taken) for the whole",&lt;ref name="m-w"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pars%20pro%20toto |title=pars pro toto - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[figure of speech]] where the name of a ''portion'' of an object, place, or concept represents its ''entirety''. It is distinct from a [[merism]], which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts; [[metonymy]], where an object, place, or concept is called by something or some place associated with the object, place, or concept; or [[synecdoche]], which can refer both to this and its inverse: the whole representing a part.

In the context of language, ''pars pro toto'' means that something is named after a part of it, or after a limited characteristic, in itself not necessarily representative for the whole.  For example, "glasses" is a ''pars pro toto'' name for something that consists of more than just two pieces of glass.
Examples of common ''pars pro toto'' usage in political geography include "[[Russia]]" or "[[Russian people|Russians]]", for the entire former [[Russian Empire]] or former [[Soviet Union]] or its people, [[China]] for [[People's Republic of China]], [[Holland]] for the [[Netherlands]], and, particularly in languages other than English, using the translation of "[[England]]" in that language for "[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]". Among English-speakers "[[Great Britain]]" or "Britain" is a common ''pars pro toto'' shorthand for the entire United Kingdom. [[Switzerland]]'s name (in German ''Schweiz'') comes from its central Canton of [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]].

The inverse of a ''pars pro toto'' is a ''[[totum pro parte]]'', in which the whole is used to describe a part, such as widespread use of "[[Americas|America]]" (which originally named the entire western hemisphere to place it geographically, with alliteration, alongside Asia, Africa, "Europa", and ultimately [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]]) in place of "[[United States of America]]", "United States" or "US".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Blair Arts Ltd. |url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/totum_pro_parte.html |title=Online Dictionary of Language Terminology (ODLT) s.v. totum pro parte |publisher=ODLT |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''[[synecdoche]]'' is used for both, as well as similar metaphors, though in Greek it literally means "simultaneous understanding".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38677">{{sexual orientation}}
The hormonal theory of sexuality holds that, just as exposure to certain hormones plays a role in fetal [[sex differentiation]], such exposure also influences the [[sexual orientation]] that emerges later in the adult. '''Prenatal hormones''' may be seen as the primary determinant of adult sexual orientation, or a co-factor with genes, [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological factors]] and/or environmental and social conditions.

==Sex-typed behavior==

The hormonal theory of sexuality and gender identity holds that, just as exposure to certain [[hormones]] plays a role in fetal sex differentiation, such exposure also influences the sexual orientation and or gender identity that emerges later in the adult. Differences in brain structure that come about from chemical messengers and genes interacting on developing brain cells are believed to be the basis of sex differences in countless behaviors, including sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia-Falgueras A, Swaab DF. Sexual hormones and the brain: an essential alliance for sexual identity and sexual orientation.  Endocr Dev. 2010;17:22-35. {{DOI|10.1159/000262525}} {{PMID|19955753}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}    Prenatal factors that affect or interfere with the interaction of these hormones on the developing brain can influence later [[Childhood gender nonconformity|sex-typed behavior]] in children.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}} This hypothesis is originated from countless experimental studies in non-human mammals, yet the argument that similar effects can be seen in human neurobehavioral development is a much debated topic among scholars.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt; Recent studies, however, have provided evidence in support of prenatal androgen exposure influencing childhood sex-typed behavior.&lt;ref name="Hines Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|title=Sex-related variation in human behavior and the brain.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=October 2010|volume=14|issue=10|pages=448–456|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.005|pmid=20724210|pmc=2951011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetal hormones may be seen as either the primary influence upon adult sexual orientation or as a co-factor interacting with genes and/or environmental and social conditions.&lt;ref name=BornGay&gt;Wilson, G., &amp; Q. Rahman, ''Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Human Sex Orientation'', Peter Owen Publishers; 2nd edition (May 1, 2008) {{ISBN|9780720613094}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} However, Garcia-Falgueras and [[Dick Swaab]] disagree that social conditions influence sexual orientation to a large degree. As seen in young children as well as in vervet and rhesus monkeys, sexually differentiated behavior in toy preference is differing in males versus females, where females prefer dolls and males prefer toy balls and cars; these preferences can be seen as early as 3–8 months in humans.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  It is impossible to completely rule out the social environment or the child's cognitive understanding of gender when discussing sex typed play in androgen-exposed girls.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  Conversely, children tend towards objects which have been labelled for their own sex, or toys that they have seen members of their sex playing with previously.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;

An endocrinology study by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab postulated that "In humans, the main mechanism responsible of {{sic}} sexual identity and orientation involves a direct effect of testosterone on the developing brain."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|25}} Further, their study puts forward that intrauterine exposure to hormones is largely determinative. Sketching the argument briefly here, the authors say that sexual organs are differentiated first, and then the brain is sexually differentiated "under the influence, mainly, of sex hormones such as testosterone, estrogen and progesterone on the developing brain cells and under the presence of different genes as well ... . The changes brought about in this stage are permanent. ... [S]exual differentiation of the brain is not caused by hormones alone, even though they are very important for gender identity and sexual orientation."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

===Organizational aspects===

Fetal gonads develop primarily based on the presence or absence of [[androgen]] hormones, mainly [[testosterone]], [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) and [[androstenedione]]; production of testosterone and conversion into dihydrotestosterone during weeks 6 to 12 of pregnancy are key factors in the production of a male fetus's penis, scrotum and prostate.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;  In a female, on the other hand, absence of these levels of androgens results in development of typically female genitals.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Following this, sexual differentiation of the brain occurs; sex hormones exert organizational effects on the brain that will be activated in puberty.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bao|first=Ai-Min|author2=Dick F.

Most extensively studied in organizational effects of hormones is [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH).&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hines |first=Melissa |year=2011 |title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=170–182 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006 |pmid=21333673|pmc=3296090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CAH is a genetic disease that results in exposure to high levels of [[androgens]] beginning early in gestation.  Girls with CAH are born with masculinized genitalia, which is corrected surgically as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum/&gt;&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011/&gt;  CAH provides the opportunity for [[natural experiments]], as people with CAH can be compared to people without it.  However, "CAH is not a perfect experiment", since, "social responses to masculinized genitalia or factors related to the disease itself" can [[confound]] results.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum/&gt;   Nonetheless several studies have shown that CAH has a clear but not determining influence on sexual orientation; women with CAH are less likely to be exclusively heterosexual than are other women.&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011/&gt;
  
Since hormones alone do not determine sexual orientation and differentiation of the brain, the search for other factors that act upon sexual orientation have led genes such as the [[SRY]] and ZFY to be implicated.&lt;ref name="Ngun et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngun|first=Tuck C. |author2=Negar Ghahramani |author3=Francisco J.

===Prenatal maternal stress===

As of 2006 results from studies in humans had found conflicting evidence regarding the effect of prenatal exposure to hormones and psychosexual outcomes; Gooren noted in 2006 that studies in subprimate mammals are invalid measures of human sexual differentiation, as sex hormones follow a more "on-off" role in sex-typed behavior than is found in primates.&lt;ref name=Gooren&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gooren|first=Louis|title=The biology of human psychosexual differentiation|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=November 2006|volume=50|issue=4|pages=589–601|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.011|pmid=16870186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies do suggest that prenatal stress significantly increases the likelihood of [[homosexuality]] or [[bisexuality]], although varying evidence exists for which trimester is most important.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}  Studies of endocrinology have found implications for amphetamines and thyroid-gland hormones to increase homosexuality in female offspring as well, although it has not been examined in conjunction with prenatal stress levels.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Some have postulated that postnatal (e.g., social and environmental factors) development can play a role in the sexual orientation of an individual, yet solid evidence of this has yet to be discovered. Children born through artificial insemination with donor sperm and consequently raised by lesbian couples have typically been heterosexually oriented.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Summed up by Bao and Swaab, "The apparent impossibility of getting someone to change their sexual orientation ... is a major argument against the importance of the social environment in the emergence of homosexuality, as well as against the idea that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;

====Fraternal birth order====
According to some studies, gay men have more older [[brother]]s on average, a phenomenon known as the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]].  It has been suggested that the greater the number of older male siblings the higher the level of [[androgen]] fetuses are exposed to&lt;!--I think this is a reference to Williams et al. Nature paper, but I don't think it says quite says what this last sentence says--&gt;. No evidence of birth order effects have been observed in women. The theory holds that the fraternal birth order effect is a result of a maternal immune response that is produced towards a factor of male development over several male pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  Bogaert's hypothesis argues that "the target of the immune response may be malespecific molecules on the surface of male fetal brain cells (e.g., including those in the anterior hypothalamus). Antimale antibodies might bind to these molecules and thus interfere with their role in normal sexual differentiation, leading some later born males to being attracted to men as opposed to women."&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state that  "The ... fraternal birth order effect ... is putatively explained by an immunological response by the mother to a product of the Y chromosome of her sons. The chance of such an immune response to male factors would increase with every pregnancy resulting in the birth of a son."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

While direct support has not been found for these hypotheses, evidence that favours this theory exists.&lt;ref name="Blanchard/Lippa cite"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Ray|author2=Richard Lippa|title=Birth Order, Sibling Sex Ratio, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation of Male and Female Participants in a BBC Internet Research Project|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=April 2007|volume=36|issue=2|pages=163–176|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9159-7|pmid=17345165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, while percentages of the likelihood of homosexuality have been estimated to be increased by 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Birth Order, Sibling Sex Ratio, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation of Male and Female Participants in a BBC Internet Research Project|author1=Ray Blanchard|author2=Richard Lippa|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2007|volume=36|issue=2|pages=163–76|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9159-7|pmid=17345165}}&lt;/ref&gt;–48% per older brother, these odds really account for only a few percent of the population; thus, this hypothesis cannot be universally applied to the majority of homosexual men.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt; Not all studies have been able to reproduce the fraternal birth order effect.

In conjunction with fraternal birth order, [[Handedness and sexual orientation|handedness]] provides further evidence of prenatal effects on sexual orientation, because handedness is regarded by many as a marker of early neurodevelopment. Other correlates to handedness (e.g., cerebral laterality, prenatal hormonal profiles, spatial ability) have been linked to sexual orientation, either empirically and/or theoretically.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  In right-handed individuals, the number of older brothers increased the odds of homosexual orientation, but this effect was not seen in left-handed individuals.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt; As with other purported marks indicating higher incidence of homosexuality, however, the link with handedness remains ambiguous and several studies have been unable to replicate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=====Implicated genes in fraternal birth order=====

A gene of the ''Rh'' system has been discussed as a possible candidate for affecting fraternal birth order, as it has been linked to both handedness and immune system functioning.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaert|first=Anthony|author2=Ray Blanchard |author3=Lesley Crothswait |title=Interaction of Birth Order, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation in the Kinsey Interview Data|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|date=October 2007|volume=121|issue=5|pages=845–853|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.121.5.845|pmid=17907817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gene variants in the ''Rh'' system are implicated in a maternal response to what is known as [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]]. ''Rh'' is a factor in blood, and in cases where the mother is absent of this (''Rh-'') while carrying an ''Rh+'' fetus, an immune response may develop with deleterious effects. The ''Rh'' gene hypothesis is a strong candidate because not only does it involve the maternal immune response, but it has been implicated in handedness as well.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;

Variants of the androgen receptor (''AR'') gene have also been discussed, in that non-right-handedness in men has been linked with greater CAG repeats in the ''AR'' gene, which in turn is associated with lower testosterone. A theory that high prenatal testosterone leads to neuronal and axonal loss in the corpus callosum is supported by this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Witelson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witelson|first=Sandra|author2=R.

===Male homosexuality as hypomasculine===
{{main|Hypomasculinity}}

In a 1991 study, [[Simon LeVay]] demonstrated that a tiny clump &lt;!--name that 'clump' (&amp; call it a nucleus) --&gt; of neurons of the anterior [[hypothalamus]]—which is believed to control sexual behavior and linked to prenatal hormones—known as the interstitial nuclei of the anterior was, on average, more than twice the size in heterosexual men when contrasted to homosexual men. Due to this area also being nearly twice the size in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women, the implication is that the sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus in homosexuals is in a female direction.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  In 2003 scientists at [[Oregon State University]] announced that they had replicated his findings in sheep. Later studies in humans, however, have yet to confirm this finding.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt; &lt;!-- I believe this has also been replicated in human subjects: Byne, W., S. Tobet, ''et al.'' (2001). "The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and hiv status." Horm Behav 40(2): 86–92. Dr. Simon LeVay, in his study of the hypothalamic differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men, offered the following criticisms of his own research, "It's important to stress what I didn't find. I did not prove that homosexuality is genetic, or find a genetic cause for being gay. I didn't show that gay men are born that way, the most common mistake people make in interpreting my work. Nor did I locate a gay center in the brain."--&gt;

===Female homosexuality===

Most empirical or theoretical research into women's sexual orientation has, historically, been guided by the idea of lesbians as essentially masculine and heterosexual women as essentially feminine.&lt;ref name=Peplau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peplau|first=Letitia|author2=Mark Huppin|title=Masculinity, Femininity and the Development of Sexual Orientation in Women|journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health|date=October 2008|volume=12|issue=1–2|pages=145–165|doi=10.1300/J529v12n01_09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, this belief is traced to the early "inversion theory" of sex researchers who state that homosexuality is a result of biological abnormalities that "invert" sexual attraction and personality.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;  Handedness research has provided implications; because more men than women present a preference for their left hand, the higher proportion of non-right handedness that has been discovered among lesbians when compared to heterosexual women demonstrates a possible link of prenatal masculinization and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt; Backing this up are reports that lesbians display more masculinized 2D;4D digit ratios than heterosexual women, based on data gathered from at least six different laboratories.&lt;ref name="2d4d twins" /&gt;  This effect has not yet been observed between homosexual and heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="2d4d twins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobrogge|first=Kyle L|author2=S.

these findings,&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  leaving the validity of this measure unconfirmed.

[[Diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), a drug that has been in the past prescribed to prevent miscarriages, has also been studied in relation to women's sexual orientation. It has been observed to exert a masculinizing/defeminizing  effect on the developing brain of the fetus.&lt;ref name=Peplau /&gt; When compared to controls, higher percentages of DES-exposed women (17% vs 0%) reported that they had engaged in same-sex relations; however, the great majority of DES women stated an exclusively heterosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;

However, the degree to which the girls' genitals are masculinized does not correlate with their sexual orientation, suggesting that prenatal hormones are a stronger causal factor, not parental influence.

Together with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, DES studies have provided little support of the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation; they do, however, provide the framework for possible pathways to a homosexual orientation for a small number of women.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;

===Gender dysphoria===
{{main|Gender dysphoria}}

In individuals with [[gender dysphoria]], previously known as gender identity disorder (GID), prenatal exposure to testosterone has been hypothesized to have an effect on gender identity differentiation. The 2D;4D finger ratio, or relative lengths of the 2nd "index" and 4th "ring" fingers, has become a popular measure of prenatal androgen because of accumulated evidence suggesting the 2D;4D ratios are related to prenatal exposure to testosterone.&lt;ref name="2d4d wallien"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallien|first=Madeleine|author2=Kenneth J. Zucker |author3=Thomas D. Steensma |author4=Peggy T. Cohen-Kettenis |title=2D:4D finger-length ratios in children and adults with gender identity disorder|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=August 2008|volume=54|issue=3|pages=450–454|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.05.002|pmid=18585715}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many children with GID differentiate a homosexual orientation during adolescence, but not all of them; adults with "early onset", or a childhood history of cross-gender behavior, often have a homosexual orientation. Adults with "late onset", or those without a childhood history of said behavior, are more likely to have a non-homosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="2d4d wallien"/&gt;

Prenatal androgen exposure has  been associated with an increased chance of patient-initiated [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment]] to male after being initially raised as female in early childhood or infancy.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer-Bahlburg 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer-Bahlburg|first=Heino|title=gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile albation|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=28 August 2005|volume=34|issue=4|pages=423–438|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gooren found that organizational effects of prenatal androgens are more prevalent in gender role behavior than in gender identity, and that there are preliminary findings that suggest evidence of a male gender identity being more frequent in patients with fully male-typical prenatal androgenization.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Individuals with complete [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] are almost always brought up as females, and the differentiation of gender identity/role is feminine.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;   This example is important in demonstrating that chromosomes and gonads alone do not dictate gender identity and role.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

====Transsexualism====
{{main|Transsexualism}}

Because organ differentiation and brain differentiation occur at different times, in rare cases transsexualism can result.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}} Only 23% of childhood gender problems will result in transsexuality in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;  
 
Drawing on some transsexualism cases, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state that "[f]rom these examples it appears that the direct action of testosterone on the developing brain in boys and the lack of such action on the developing brain in girls are crucial factors in the development of male and female gender identity and sexual orientation ... ."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|26}} Countless studies have been run on peripheral levels of sex steroids in male and female homosexuals, a considerable number of which claimed to find "less 'male hormone' and/or more 'female hormone' in male homosexuals and vice versa in female homosexuals".&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  However, these findings have been reviewed and have subsequently been dismissed by scholars as suffering from faulty design and interpretation.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Factors implicated in the development of transsexuality include chromosomal abnormalities, polymorphisms of certain genes, and variations in [[aromatase]] (cytochrome P450 CYP19) and [[CYP17]].&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia show an increase in probability of transsexuality later in life; however, this risk is still only 1–3% in CAH.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  Although historically abnormal sexual differentiation has pointed to androgens as a causal factor, there are codeterminants of gender identity and sexual orientation with overriding effects of androgens on the brain, in male transsexuals or homosexuals, or making androgen effects on the brain redundant, as in female transsexuals or homosexuals.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  These factors are currently unknown, and thus no clear cut answer for the cause of transsexualism and homosexuality exists.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Due to relatively small population sizes, generalizability of studies on transsexuality cannot be assumed.

==Endocrine disruptors==
[[Endocrine disruptors|Endocrine disrupting chemicals]] (EDCs) are chemicals that, at certain doses, can interfere with the endocrine system in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, NIEHS. Last Reviewed, June 05, 2013.

'''''Science in Action''''' is a long-running weekly radio programme produced by the [[BBC World Service]] and currently hosted by British journalists Roland Pease&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journalisted.com/roland-pease |title=Roland Pease |publisher=Media Standards Trust|website=journa''listed'' |language=en |access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marnie Chesterton, and scientist and broadcaster Professor [[Adam Hart]]. It is broadcast on Thursdays at 18.32 [[GMT]] and repeated twice the following day, at 01.32 and 08.32.

A programme with the title ''Science in Action'' is believed to have begun life in 1964, when it replaced an earlier series, dating from the 1950s, called ''Science and Industry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1965 a short-lived series called ''Science in Action'' ran on the [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]]; it was broadcast at 19.30 on Thursdays, later 21.30. In December 1965 it was moved to 14.30 on Fridays. The present weekly World Service series, also called ''Science in Action'', began on Saturday 7 July 1979.

'''Sense about Science''' is a UK charity that promotes the [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]]. Sense about Science was founded in 2002 by [[Lord Taverne]], [[Bridget Ogilvie]] and others to promote respect for [[scientific evidence]] and [[Scientific method|good science]]. Sense about Science was established as a [[charitable trust]] in 2003, with 14 trustees, an advisory council and a small office staff. Tracey Brown has been the director since 2002.&lt;ref name="Team" /&gt;

Sense about Science aims to work with scientists, journalists and others to ensure that scientific evidence is at the forefront of public discussions about science, and to correct unscientific [[misinformation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/workshops.html Sense About Science 'Voice of Young Science' workshop], "Ellen Raphael talked about Sense about Science, discussing projects and the ways we correct misinformation with examples from the last five years."&lt;/ref&gt; They encourage and assist scientists to engage in public debates about their area of [[expert]]ise, to respond to scientifically inaccurate claims in the media, to help people contact scientists with appropriate expertise, and to prepare briefings about the scientific background to issues of public concern.

== Projects ==

Sense about Science publishes guides to different areas of science in partnership with experts.

Sense About Science hosts an annual lecture.

Since its founding, Sense about Science has contributed to UK public debates about such subjects as [[alternative medicine]], [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|"detoxification" products]] and [[detox diet]]s, [[genetically modified food]], [[avian influenza]], [[chemicals]] and health, "[[electrosmog]]", [[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccination]], weather and [[Climate change|climate]], [[nuclear power]], and the use and utility of [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/health-and-medicine.html |title=Health &amp; Medicine |publisher=Sense About Science |accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense about Science encourages scientists to explain to the public the value of peer review in determining which reports should be taken seriously. Director Tracey Brown describes such critical thinking as crucial to preventing public [[Alarmism|health scares]] based on unpublished information.&lt;ref name=Butler2004&gt;{{Cite journal |

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The John Maddox Prize for standing up for science rewards an individual who has promoted sound science and evidence on a matter of public interest. Its emphasis is on those who have faced difficulty or hostility in doing so. Nominations of active researchers who have yet to receive recognition for their public-interest work are particularly welcomed. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Past winners are: 
* 2012 [[Simon Wessely]] and [[Fang Zhouzi]] 
* 2013 [[David Nutt]] 
* 2014 [[Emily Willingham]] and [[David Robert Grimes]] 
* 2015 [[Edzard Ernst]] and [[Susan Jebb]] 
* 2016 [[Elizabeth Loftus]]
* 2017 [[Riko Muranaka]]

[[File:AskForEvidence-Logo resize.jpg|thumb|Sense About Science launched the Ask for Evidence campaign in 2011 to help people request for themselves the evidence behind news stories, marketing claims and policies.&lt;ref name="Ask for Evidence"&gt;{{cite web|title = Ask for Evidence|url = http://askforevidence.org/about|website = Ask for Evidence|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== AllTrials ===
{{main article|AllTrials}}
The [[AllTrials]] campaign calls for all past and present clinical trials to be registered and their full methods and summary results reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What does all trials registered and reported mean?|url = http://www.alltrials.net/find-out-more/all-trials/|website = AllTrials|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AllTrials campaign. 2017. Alltrials Roadmap http://www.alltrials.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AllTrials-Roadmap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

AllTrials is an international initiative of [[Bad Science (book)|Bad Science]], ''[[The BMJ|BMJ]]'', [[Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine|Centre for Evidence-based Medicine]], [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Collaboration]], James Lind Initiative, ''[[PLOS]]'' and Sense About Science and is being led in the US by Sense About Science USA, Dartmouth’s [[Geisel School of Medicine]] and the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice.&lt;ref name="alltrials.net"&gt;{{cite web|title = All Trials Registered. All Results Reported|url = http://www.alltrials.net/|website = AllTrials|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2018, the AllTrials petition has been signed by 91,989 people and 737 organisations.&lt;ref name="alltrials.net"/&gt;

=== Ask for Evidence ===
Ask for Evidence was launched by Sense About Science in 2011. It is a campaign that helps people request for themselves the evidence behind news stories, marketing claims and policies.&lt;ref name="Ask for Evidence"/&gt; When challenged in this way, organisations may withdraw their claims or send evidence to support them.  The campaign is supported by more than 6000 volunteer scientists who are available to review the evidence provided and determine whether it supports the original claim or story.&lt;ref name="ESP20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode #020, feat. Chris Peters|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-721155342/theesp-ep-020-chris-peters#t=00:00|website=The [[European Skeptics Podcast]]|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has received funding from The [[Wellcome Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Empowering people to 'Ask for Evidence'|url = http://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2015/10/13/empowering-people-to-ask-for-evidence/|website = Wellcome Trust Blog|accessdate = 2015-11-17|first = Kate Arkless|last = Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is endorsed by figures such as [[Dara Ó Briain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ask for Evidence {{!}} Dara Ó Briain, performer|url = http://askforevidence.org/articles/dara-o-briain-performer|website = Ask for Evidence|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Derren Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ask for Evidence {{!}} Derren Brown, illusionist|url = http://askforevidence.org/articles/derren-brown-illusionist|website = Ask for Evidence|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Peters, Scientific Affairs Manager at Sense About Science, has said, 'If you ask people for evidence then they expect to be asked for evidence in the future'.&lt;ref name="ESP20"/&gt;  This can lead to a cultural shift in the organisation; they make sure they have the evidence from the start and are more evidence-based.

=== Keep Libel Laws Out of Science ===
Sense About Science  launched the Keep Libel Laws out of Science campaign in June 2009&lt;ref name="SAScience"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/keep-libel-laws-out-of-science.html Sign up now to keep the libel laws out of science!] ''Sense About Science''&lt;/ref&gt; in defence of a member of its board of trustees,&lt;ref name="SAS_Board"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/board-of-trustees.html Board of Trustees,] ''Sense About Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; author and journalist [[Simon Singh]], who has been sued for [[libel]] by the [[British Chiropractic Association]]. They issued a statement entitled "The law has no place in scientific disputes",&lt;ref name="Statement"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/the-world-conference-of-science-journalists.html "The law has no place in scientific disputes"], ''Sense about Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed by many people representing science, medicine, journalism, publishing, arts, humanities, entertainment, sceptics, campaign groups and law. In April 2010, the BCA lost this case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63018820100401 | work=Reuters | title=Science writer wins "fair comment" libel appeal | first=Michael | last=Holden | date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the court accepting that criticism of the BCA concerning its promotion of bogus treatments was [[fair comment]].

In December 2009, Sense About Science, [[Index on Censorship]] and [[English PEN]] launched the Libel Reform Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Launch of the Libel Reform Campaign ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/launch-of-the-libel-reform-campaign.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defamation Act 2013]] received Royal Assent on 25 April 2013 and came into force on 1 January 2014.

The Trust actively campaigns in support of various causes. It has issued a statement signed by over 35 scientists&lt;ref name="Letter to WHO"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/docs/VOYSlettertoWHO.doc Letter to WHO, signed by at least 35 scientists], ''Sense About Science''&lt;/ref&gt; asking the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] to condemn [[homeopathy]] for diseases such as HIV.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;Sample, Ian (1 June 2009).[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/01/world-health-organisation-homeopathy-hiv "British scientists ask WHO to condemn homeopathy for diseases such as HIV"].

&lt;!--(No good references available for this piece)-Sense About Science organised a  climate change conference,&lt;ref name=climate/&gt; which resulted in stories warning against the exaggeration and 'Hollywoodisation' of climate change, and the publication of a report "Making Sense of Climate Change". The authors of this report said they firmly believe global warming is happening and man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are a significant cause. But warned that exaggeration of the problems confused the public and made it easier to argue that the scientists were wrong.

Homeopath [[Peter Fisher (physician)|Peter Fisher]] criticised Sense About Science, who have been working closely with [[NHS primary care trust]]s on the issue of funding for homeopathy, for being funded by the pharmaceutical industry; SAS responded in a statement to [[Channel 4 News]] that "Peter Fisher's desperate comments show about as much grasp of reality as the homeopathic medicine he sells."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

== Funding ==

Sense about Science's principal funding is through grants and donations in respect of its core aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Charity overview|url = http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1146170&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its funding policy it states: "Donations do not entitle any individual or organisation to decision-making authority. External funding will not divert Sense About Science from its agreed aims and values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Our funding policy ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/our-funding-policy.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the trust has been increasing. Some is derived from industrial organizations engaged in scientific dispute, clinical trials and research for which SAS is supportive (e.g. genetically modified crops) as well as major publishing houses. For example, for the fiscal year ending 5 April 2008, the trust received £145,902 in donations. Disclosed corporate donations comprised £88,000 with pharmaceutical company [[Astra Zeneca]] donating £35,000.&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements"&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1101114&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 "Sense About Science Financial Statements"], Charity Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous donations included other [[pharmaceutical lobby|pharmaceutical]] industries such as [[Pfizer]].&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements" /&gt; This dependency has now been diminished since for the fiscal year ending April 2010, the trust received £183,971 in donations of which £17,500 was derived from the pharmaceutical industry (Unilever and G E Healthcare). In 2011 the amount diminished further to less than 6% funding derived from industry sources (the trust received £268,184 in donations with £15,000 from industry)  with the rest derived from Science Bodies and individuals.&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010-2011 fiscal statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Statements 2011|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1101114&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sense about Science discloses the names of its funders and the purpose of each donation received in its annual reports. Its largest donor during 2015-16 was the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]], which donated between £40,001-50,000 to support the [[AllTrials]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Sense about Science, Annual Review 2015/16, http://senseaboutscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Annual-Report-2015-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A showroom is a large space used to display products for sale, such as [[automotive showroom|automobiles]], [[furniture]], [[Home appliance|appliances]], [[carpet]] or [[apparel]]. It is a [[retail store]] of a company in which products are on sale in a space created by their brand or company. A showroom can also be a space for wholesale buyers to view fashion merchandise for sale in their retail stores.

The world's most famous locations for a showroom, generally in the form of a [[business cluster|cluster]], are the [[Champs Elysees]] in Paris or [[Merchandise Mart]] in Chicago,{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

One of the world's largest showrooms is the {{convert|35000|m2}} BMW showroom in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;Horatiu Boeriu, ''[http://www.bmwblog.com/2012/02/21/bmw-opens-largest-showroom-worldwide-in-abu-dhabi/ BMW opens largest showroom worldwide in Abu Dhabi]'', BMW blog, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carscoops, ''[http://www.carscoops.com/2012/02/world-largest-bmw-showroom-opens-in-abu.html World's Largest BMW Showroom Opens in Abu Dhabi, Best Selling Model in the M.E. is the 7-Series]'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest collection of showrooms is a {{convert|216000|m2|sing=on}} car showroom in [[Istanbul]] called [[Autopia Europia]].&lt;ref&gt;World Buildings Directory, ''[http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=3023 Autopia Europia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012922/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=3023 |date=2014-04-19 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibz.com, [http://www.mibz.com/tag/worlds-biggest-showroom Autopia Europia, The World’s Biggest Car Dealership, Will Have A Circuit On The Roof] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419025632/http://www.mibz.com/tag/worlds-biggest-showroom |date=2014-04-19 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment venue==
A showroom is a permanent enclosed space used to present a [[performance]].  Sometimes it is customized for a particular show; for example, the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] showroom used for the [[rock opera]] ''[[Starlight Express]]'' was customized by pouring [[concrete]] ramps onto its stage area and in the seating area.

Some showrooms are used daily, while others are only used when a performer is booked to perform. In some cases, a showroom is [[lease]]d to a performer, who then retains all income rather than being paid by the showroom owner.

== Temporary showroom ==
In fashion capitals such as [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Milan]] or [[London]] one can find temporary showrooms. 
These places can be rented on a daily or weekly basis. Some temporary showrooms are managed with the help of [[event management]] agencies. Temporary showrooms can also be [[Pop-up retail|pop-up stores]], which are short-term sales spaces.

==Augmented reality showroom==
Automobile manufacturer [[Ferrari]] has recently introduced [[augmented reality]] technology into their showrooms, to provide customers with a more hands-on approach when purchasing a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/15/ferrari-augmented-reality-showroom-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Network Science}}
A '''social network ''' is a [[social structure]] made up of a set of [[social]] actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] ties, and other [[Social relation|social interaction]]s between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.&lt;ref name="WF94CH1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wasserman |first1=Stanley | author-link1= Stanley Wasserman|last2=Faust |first2=Katherine |year=1994 |title=Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications |isbn=9780521387071 |chapter=Social Network Analysis in the Social and Behavioral Sciences |pages=1–27 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of these structures uses [[social network analysis]] to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.

Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field which emerged from [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], [[statistics]], and [[graph theory]]. [[Georg Simmel]] authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of group affiliations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott |first1=W.

Together with other [[complex network]]s, it forms part of the nascent field of [[network science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=323 |number=5916 |pages=892–895 |doi=10.1126/science.1165821 |pmid=19213908 |title=Network Analysis in the Social Sciences |first1=Stephen P. |last1=Borgatti |first2=Ajay |last2=Mehra |first3=Daniel J. |last3=Brass |first4=Giuseppe |last4=Labianca|bibcode=2009Sci...323..892B |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.5568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EK"&gt;{{cite book|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World |first1=David |last1=Easley |first2=Jon |last2=Kleinberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |chapter=Overview |pages=1–20 |isbn=978-0-521-19533-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Barabasi Albert model.gif|thumb|left|Evolution graph of a social network: [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási model]].]]

The social network is a [[Scientific theory|theoretical]] [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] useful in the [[social sciences]] to study relationships between individuals, [[social groups|groups]], [[formal organizations|organizations]], or even entire [[society|societies]] ([[social unit]]s, see [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]]). The term is used to describe a [[social structure]] determined by such [[social interactions|interactions]]. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational.  An [[axiom]] of the social network approach to understanding [[social interaction]] is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that [[Agency (sociology)|individual agency]] is often ignored&lt;ref name="jscott"&gt;Scott, John P. (2000). ''Social Network Analysis: A Handbook'' (2nd edition). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may not be the case in practice (see [[agent-based model]]ing). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, [[Network science|network analytics]] are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[information science]], [[organizational studies]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[sociolinguistics]].

==History==
In the late 1890s, both [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of [[social group]]s. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag. (Translated, 1957 by Charles Price Loomis as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile (1893). ''De la division du travail social: étude sur l'organisation des sociétés supérieures'', Paris: F. Alcan. (Translated, 1964, by Lewis A. Coser as ''The Division of Labor in Society'', New York: Free Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]], writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg (1908). ''Soziologie'', Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently.&lt;ref name=jscott /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a historical overview of the development of social network analysis, see: {{cite book|authors=Carrington, Peter J. &amp; Scott, John|chapter=Introduction|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis| publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|page=1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the diagram in {{cite book|author=Scott, John|title=Social Network Analysis: A Handbook|publisher=Sage|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7619-6339-4|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww3_bKcz6kgC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], in the 1930s, [[Jacob L. Moreno]] began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see [[sociometry]]). In [[anthropology]], the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] work of [[Bronislaw Malinowski]],&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw (1913).

F. Nadel]] codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, S. F. 1957. ''The Theory of Social Structure''. London: Cohen and West.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], the early (1930s) work of [[Talcott Parsons]] set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott ([1937] 1949). ''The Structure of Social Action: A Study in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of European Writers''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott (1951). ''The Social System''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist [[Peter Blau]] provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on [[social exchange theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1956). ''Bureaucracy in Modern Society''. New York: Random House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1960). "A Theory of Social Integration". ''The American Journal of Sociology'', (65)6: 545–556, (May).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1964). ''Exchange and Power in Social Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist [[Harrison White]] and his students at the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Harvard University Department of Social Relations]]. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were [[Charles Tilly]], who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and [[Stanley Milgram]], who developed the "six degrees of separation" thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix14/sem-14-05.html |title=The Networked Individual: A Profile of Barry Wellman |author=Bernie Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Granovetter]]&lt;ref name="Introduction for the French Reader"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = Introduction for the French Reader | url = | journal = Sociologica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry Wellman]]&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (1988).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as [[Duncan J. Watts]], [[Albert-László Barabási]], [[Peter Bearman]], [[Nicholas A. Christakis]], [[James H. Fowler]], and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as "digital traces" regarding face-to-face networks.

[[File:Social Network Diagram (large).svg|right|thumb|Centrality]]
In general, social networks are [[self-organization|self-organizing]], [[emergence|emergent]], and [[social complexity|complex]], such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Mark, Albert-László Barabási and Duncan J. Watts (2006). ''The Structure and Dynamics of Networks'' (Princeton Studies in Complexity). Oxford: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = Barry | year = 2008 | title = Review: The development of social network analysis: A study in the sociology of science | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 221–222 | doi=10.1177/009430610803700308}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faust|first=Stanley Wasserman; Katherine|title=Social network analysis : methods and applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521382694|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of, for example, all [[interpersonal relationships]] in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much [[Information theory|information]] as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"&gt;Kadushin, C. (2012). ''Understanding social networks: Theories, concepts, and findings''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Granovetter, M.|title= Network sampling: Some first steps| year=1976 |pages=1287–1303 |volume=81| issue=6 |journal= American Journal of Sociology | doi=10.1086/226224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although [[level of analysis|levels of analysis]] are not necessarily [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], there are three general levels into which networks may fall: [[Microsociology|micro-level]], [[wikt:meso-|meso-level]], and [[Macrosociology|macro-level]].

===Micro level===
At the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, [[Snowball sampling|snowballing]] as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.

'''Dyadic level''': A [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on [[Structural functionalism|structure]] of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), [[social equality]], and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].

'''Triadic level''': Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a [[Triadic relation|triad]]. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as [[Independence number|balance]] and [[Vertex-transitive graph|transitivity]], as well as [[social equality]] and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt; In the [[balance theory]] of [[Fritz Heider]] the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous [[love triangle]] is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of [[signed graph]]s.

'''Actor level''': The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an "actor" or "ego". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, [[centrality]], [[wikt:prestige|prestige]] and roles such as [[isolates|isolates, liaisons]], and [[Bridge (interpersonal)|bridges]].&lt;ref name="Jone11"/&gt; Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of [[psychology]] or [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], [[ethnographic]] [[kinship]] analysis or other [[genealogy|genealogical]] studies of relationships between individuals.

'''Subset level''': [[Subset]] levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on [[Distance (graph theory)|distance]] and reachability, [[cliques]], [[Cohesion (social policy)|cohesive]] subgroups, or other [[Group action (sociology)|group actions]] or [[Group behaviour|behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title="Graph Theoretical Approaches to Social Network Analysis". in Computational Complexity: Theory, Techniques, and Applications (Robert A. Meyers, ed.) | publisher=Springer | author=de Nooy, Wouter |year=2012 | pages=2864–2877 | isbn=978-1-4614-1800-9|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-1800-9_176| chapter=Social Network Analysis, Graph Theoretical Approaches to }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meso level===
In general, meso-level theories begin with a [[Sample population|population]] size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro-level networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedström | first1 = Peter | last2 = Sandell | first2 = Rickard | last3 = Stern | first3 = Charlotta | year = 2000 | title = Mesolevel Networks and the Diffusion of Social Movements: The Case of the Swedish Social Democratic Party | url = http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/hedstrom/ajs3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 145–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Social Red.jpg|thumb|right|Social network diagram, meso-level]]

'''Organizations''': Formal [[organizations]] are [[social group]]s that distribute tasks for a collective [[goal]].&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riketta | first1 = M. | last2 = Nienber | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Multiple identities and work motivation: The role of perceived compatibility between nested organizational units | url = | journal = British Journal of Management | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = S61–77 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8551.2007.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[Informal organization|informal]] relationships. Intra-organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi-autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a workgroup level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures.&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"/&gt;  Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirado|first=Hirokazu|last2=Christakis|first2=Nicholas A|title=Locally noisy autonomous agents improve global human coordination in network experiments|journal=Nature|volume=545|issue=7654|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/nature22332|pmid=28516927|pmc=5912653|bibcode=2017Natur.545..370S|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randomly distributed networks''': [[Exponential random graph models]] of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]]-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] and [[Transitive set|transitivity]], and at the node-level, [[homophily]] and [[Attribute-value system|attribute]]-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about [[Dependency graph|dependencies]] among network ties. [[Parameter]]s are given in terms of the prevalence of small [[Induced subgraph|subgraph]] configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro-networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cranmer | first1 = Skyler J. | last2 = Desmarais | first2 = Bruce A. | year = 2011 | title = Inferential Network Analysis with Exponential Random Graph Models | url = | journal = Political Analysis | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi=10.1093/pan/mpq037| citeseerx = 10.1.1.623.751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scale-free network sample.png|thumb|right|Examples of a random network and a scale-free network. Each graph has 32 nodes and 32 links. Note the "hubs" (shaded) in the scale-free diagram (on the right).]]

'''Scale-free networks''': A [[scale-free network]] is a [[complex network|network]] whose [[degree distribution]] follows a [[power law]], at least [[asymptotic]]ally. In [[network theory]] a scale-free ideal network is a [[random network]] with a [[degree distribution]] that unravels the size distribution of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moreira, André A., Demétrius R.

Andrade, Jr. |title=Competitive cluster growth in complex networks |year=2006 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.73.065101 |pmid=16906890 |journal=Physical Review E |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=065101 |arxiv=cond-mat/0603272 |bibcode=2006PhRvE..73f5101M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale-free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] with a [[Maximum degree|degree]] that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called "hubs", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the [[clustering coefficient]] distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a [[power law]].&lt;ref&gt;Barabási, Albert-László (2003). ''Linked: how everything is connected to everything else and what it means for business, science, and everyday life''. New York: Plum.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási]] model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale-free network.

===Macro level===
Rather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as [[economic]] or other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfer]] interactions over a large [[Sample population|population]].

[[File:Diagram of a social network.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram: section of a large-scale social network]]

'''Large-scale networks''': [[Large-scale macroeconometric model|Large-scale network]] is a term somewhat synonymous with "macro-level" as used, primarily, in [[social science|social]] and [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] sciences, in [[economics]]. Originally, the term was used extensively in the [[computer sciences]] (see [[Network mapping#Large-scale mapping project|large-scale network mapping]]).

'''Complex networks''': Most larger social networks display features of [[social complexity]], which involves substantial non-trivial features of [[network topology]], with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, [[complexity science]], [[dynamical system]] and [[chaos theory]]), as do [[biological]], and [[Computer network|technological networks]]. Such [[complex network]] features include a heavy tail in the [[degree distribution]], a high [[clustering coefficient]], [[assortativity]] or disassortativity among vertices, [[community structure]] (see [[stochastic block model]]), and [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]]. In the case of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency-directed]] networks these features also include [[Reciprocity in network|reciprocity]], triad significance profile (TSP, see [[network motif]]), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as [[lattice graph|lattices]] and [[random graph]]s, do not show these features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strogatz, Steven H.|year=2001|title=Exploring complex networks|journal=Nature|volume=410|pages=268–276|doi=10.1038/35065725|pmid=11258382|issue=6825|bibcode=2001Natur.410..268S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical links==

===Imported theories===
Various theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are [[Graph theory]], [[Balance theory]], [[Social comparison theory]], and more recently, the [[Social identity approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Kilduff, M., Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous theories===
Few complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are [[role theory|Structural Role Theory]] and Heterophily Theory.

The basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called "the strength of weak ties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural holes==
In the context of networks, [[social capital]] exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes and Good Ideas|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2004|doi=10.1086/421787|volume=110|issue=2|pages=349–399|citeseerx=10.1.1.388.2251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; Thus, a network that bridges [[structural holes]] will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt;

Networks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer [[Information theory|information]] benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; For example, in [[Business networking|business network]]s, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of [[Interpersonal ties|weak ties]], which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment.

==Research clusters==

===Communication===
[[Communication Studies]] are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[information science]], [[biology]], [[political science]], and [[economics]] as well as [[rhetoric]], [[literary studies]], and [[semiotics]]. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network.

===Community===
In J.A. Barnes' day, a "[[community]]" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended "online" communities developed through [[telecommunications]] devices and [[social network services]]. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using [[network science]] methods. [[Community development]] studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods.

===Complex networks===
[[Complex networks]] require methods specific to modelling and interpreting [[social complexity]] and [[complex adaptive system]]s, including techniques of [[dynamic network analysis]].
Mechanisms such as [[Dual-phase evolution#social networks|Dual-phase evolution]] explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks.

===Criminal networks===
In [[criminology]] and [[urban sociology]], much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, Andrew Papachristos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papachristos |first=Andrew |year=2009 |title=Murder by Structure: Dominance Relations and the Social Structure of Gang Homicide |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=74–128 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.855304 |url=http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094725/http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has studied gang murders as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength.

===Diffusion of innovations===
[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of ideas and innovations]] studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one [[culture]] and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become "early adopters" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation.

===Demography===
In [[demography]], the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents.

===Economic sociology===
The field of [[sociology]] focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, [[economic sociology]] considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through [[social capital]] and social "markets". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark (2005). "The Impact of Social Structure on Economic Outcomes". ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4134991 19(1): 33–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Analysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into [[health care analytics]], not only in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies but also in models of [[Health Communication|patient communication]] and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and [[health care systems|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Judith and Bernice Pescosolido (2002). ''Social Networks and Health''. Boston, MA: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human ecology===
[[Human ecology]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], and natural [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Crona, Beatrice and Klaus Hubacek (eds.) (2010). [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/view.php?sf=48 "Special Issue: Social network analysis in natural resource governance"]. ''Ecology and Society'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernstson, Henrich (2010). "Reading list: Using social network analysis (SNA) in social-ecological studies". [http://rs.resalliance.org/2010/11/03/reading-list-using-social-network-analysis-sna-in-social-ecological-studies/ ''Resilience Science'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and linguistics===
Studies of [[language]] and [[linguistics]], particularly [[evolutionary linguistics]], focus on the development of [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic forms]] and transfer of changes, [[Phonology|sounds]] or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in [[language shift]], as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire.

===Literary networks===
In the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H. K. | last2 = Romo | first2 = F. P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 305–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senekal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Senekal | first1 = B. A. | year = 2012 | title = Die Afrikaanse literêre sisteem: ŉ Eksperimentele benadering met behulp van Sosiale-netwerk-analise (SNA) | url = | journal = LitNet Akademies | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of [[Even-Zohar]], can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using [[Computer graphics (computer science)|visualization]] from SNA.

===Organizational studies===
Research studies of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[informal organization]] [[Social relation|relationships]], [[organizational communication]], [[economics]], [[economic sociology]], and other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfers]]. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many [[Interlocking directorate|informal connections]] that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Podolny | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Baron | first2 = J. N. | year = 1997 | title = Resources and relationships: Social networks and mobility in the workplace | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 62 | issue = 5| pages = 673–693 | doi=10.2307/2657354| jstor = 2657354 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.114.6822 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intra-organizational networks have been found to affect [[organizational commitment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = J. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S. | year = 2011 | title = Exploring the role of social networks in affective organizational commitment: Network centrality, strength of ties, and structural holes | url = | journal = The American Review of Public Administration | volume = 41 | issue = 2| pages = 205–223 | doi=10.1177/0275074010373803}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[organizational identification]],&lt;ref name="Jone11"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = C. | last2 = Volpe | first2 = E.H. | year = 2011 | title = Organizational identification: Extending our understanding of social identities through social networks | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 413–434 | doi=10.1002/job.694}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organizational citizenship behavior|interpersonal citizenship behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowler | first1 = W.

===Social capital===
[[Social capital]] is a form of [[Capital (economics)|economic]] and [[cultural capital]] in which social networks are central, [[Stock and flow|transactions]] are marked by [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[cooperation]], and [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Agent (economics)|agents]] produce [[goods and services]] not mainly for themselves, but for a [[common good]].

Social capital is a sociological concept about the value of [[social relation]]s and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebastián|first=Valenzuela|author2=Namsu Park |author3=Kerk F. Kee |title=Is There Social Capital in a Social Network Site? Facebook Use and College Students' Life Satisfaction, Trust, and Participation|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2009|volume=14|issue=4|pages=875–901|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Connectivity in America: Changes in Adult Friendship Network Size from 2002 to 2007 |author1=Wang, Hua  |author2=Barry Wellman  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=American Behavioral Scientist | year=2010 | volume=53 | issue=8 | pages=1148–1169 | doi=10.1177/0002764209356247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a dynamic framework, higher activity in a network feeds into higher social capital which itself encourages more activity.&lt;ref name="GaudeulGiannetti2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaudeul|first1=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The role of reciprocation in social network formation, with an application to LiveJournal|journal=Social Networks|volume=35|issue=3|year=2013|pages=317–330|issn=03788733|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2013.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network position and benefits===
In many [[Formal organizations|organizations]], members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a "broker" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist [[John Stuart Mill]], writes, "it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves.... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John|title=Principles of Political Economy|year=1909|publisher=William J Ashley|location=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement.

A social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Heidi|author2=Eccles, Robert |title=Eden McCallum: A Network Based Consulting Firm|journal=Harvard Business School Review|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts.

There has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are "dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values" of such organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao, Zhixing; Tsui, Anne (2007). "When Brokers May Not Work: The Cultural Contingency of [http://iniciarsesionentrar.com/facebook/ Social] Capital in Chinese High-tech Firms". ''Administrative Science Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.

===Social media===
{{main article|Social media}}
[[Computer network]]s combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Effects|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118783764|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0170}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A relationship over a computerized [[social networking service]] can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a [[computer mediated communication]] context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of [[electronic commerce]], information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the "real" world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Studying Online Social Networks | author=Garton, Laura, [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], and [[Barry Wellman]] | journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |date=23 June 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 |pages = 0| doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social network analysis]] methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication.

In addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of [[social media]] has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Wei | last2 = Joseph | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Liu | first3 = Huan | last4 = Carley | first4 = Kathleen M. | year = 2016 | title = Exploring Characteristics of Suspended Users and Network Stability on Twitter | url = | journal = Social Network Analysis and Mining | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tonti diagram''',&lt;ref&gt;Tonti, E.: The Mathematical Structure of Classical and Relativistic Physics, Birkhäuser (Springer) (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; created by the Italian physicist and mathematician Enzo Tonti, is a diagram that classifies variables and equations of physical theories of classical and relativistic physics. The theories involved are: ''particle dynamics, analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, gravitation, heat conduction,'' and ''irreversible thermodynamics''. The classification stems from the observation that each physical variable has a well-defined association with a space and a time element, as shown in Fig. 1, which can be grasped from the corresponding global variable and from its measuring process.

== Historical note ==
The starting point of this classification stems from a remark by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. Speaking about analogies in different physical theories, Maxwell wrote in 1871:&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: Remarks on the Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities. Proc.
London Math. Soc. 3 (34), 258-266 (1871) Reprinted by Niven, W.D.: The Scientific Papers of J.C. Maxwell. Dover, New York (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the factors which compose it [energy], one is referred to unit of length, and the other to unit of area. This gives what I regard as a very important distinction among vector quantities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This remark leads us to a distinction between vectors referred to lines and vectors referred to surfaces. This is not customarily considered in vector calculus or in physics. In electromagnetism, hence, vectors '''E''' and '''H''' are associated with lines, and vectors '''D''' and '''B''' are associated with surfaces. This distinction leads to a classification of physical variables based on their ''association'' with space elements. 
Maxwell continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only through the progress of science in recent times that we have become acquainted with so large a number of physical quantities that a classification of them is desirable. [...] But the classification which I now refer to is founded on the mathematical or formal analogy of the different quantities, and not on the matter to which they belong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The classification diagram arises from an analysis of the ''association'' of physical variables in different physical theories, whatever their mathematical nature, i.e. scalars, vectors, tensors, etc., with space and time elements.

== The three kinds of physical quantities ==
Physics, compared to other natural sciences, has the great privilege of considering the [[quantity|quantitative]] attributes of physical systems and from these originate the [[physical quantity|physical quantities]], which can be [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, [[tensor]]s, etc. Physical quantities can be divided into three main categories: '''physical variables''', '''physical parameters''' and [[physical constant|'''fundamental constants''']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tonti|first1=Enzo|title=The Reason for Analogies in Physics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEtOy8xKN-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global variables in space and field variables ==
The term '''space-global variables''' refers to all physical variables that are not densities of other variables. Distinguishing  between global variables and corresponding densities is essential. Mass density is given by the ratio of mass to volume, mass being the ''global'' variable. Pressure is the ratio of the normal force on an element of plane surface to the surface area, therefore the normal force is the ''global'' variable and the pressure is its surface density. The strain of a bar is the ratio of the elongation to its original length, elongation being the ''global'' variable and strain the line density.
The very fact that we create volume, surface or line densities highlights that the corresponding global variables are ''associated'' with volumes, surfaces and lines.
Every density is obtained by dividing a global variable by the extension of the ''associated'' space element. The mathematical treatment of physics also customarily considers the limit of this ratio to obtain a pointwise density, i.e. a '''field variable'''. Generally, field variables are preferred to global variables, to the extent that we express the global variables as integrals of the respective field variables, and call them '''integral variables'''.
Integral variables are global variables, but there are also global variables which are ''associated'' with points, and which, therefore, cannot be considered integral variables. Hence, global variables form a broader class compared to integral variables; for which reason, in view of the classification, the use of the term “global variables” is preferred to that of "integral variables".

== Global variables in time and rates ==
The term '''time-global variables''' is used to indicate variables that are not rates of other variables. Displacement, impulse, momentum and position vector are therefore global variables. Displacement and impulse are associated with time intervals, while momentum and position vector are associated with instants. This is evident if we think that we can perform the rates of the first two variables obtaining velocity and force respectively, while we cannot perform the rates of the last two variables.

== The three kinds of physical variables ==
The physical variables, both global variables and densities, in turn, can be divided into three classes: those characterising the ''configuration'' of a system or a field, those describing the ''source'' of a phenomenon or a field, and finally ''energy'' variables. Every physical system, even a field, has its own “configuration”, and the variables describing this configuration are called '''configuration variables'''. Each field has its sources (for example, electric charges are the source of electric fields, heat generators are the source of thermal fields and forces are the source of motion and deformation): variables describing sources are called '''source variables'''. The third category, that of '''energy variables''', is created by multiplying a configuration variable by a source variable.
The '''fundamental problem''' of a field is finding the configuration of the field at every time instant, given the spatial distribution and the intensity of its sources (which is to say: given the causes, determine the effects).

== Space and time elements ==
By the term "space elements" we intend '''points''', '''lines''', '''surfaces''' and '''volumes''', which are denoted '''P''','''L''','''S''' and '''V''' respectively.
By the term "time elements" we intend '''time instants''' and '''time intervals''', which are denoted '''I''' and '''T''' respectively.
Space elements are naturally classified according to their dimension, from the smallest to the biggest, i.e. points, lines, surfaces and volumes. The same classification applies to time elements, i.e. instants and intervals.

== Association with space elements ==
[[File:Schermata49.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''.The figure shows a number of physical variables with the space and time elements they are ''associated'' with.]]

[[File:Margheritaq.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. Every space element can be endowed with one of the two possible orientations: inner and outer.]]

All fluxes (e.g. magnetic flux, electric flux, vortex flux)  make reference to a surface ('''S'''), all variables expressed by a line integral (e.g. electromotive force, velocity circulation, magnetomotive force) make reference to a line ('''L''') and all contents (e.g. of energy, mass, entropy, etc.) make reference to a volume ('''V'''). Lastly all potentials (e.g. electric potential, velocity potential, temperature) make reference to a point ('''P''').

== Association with time elements ==
A similar association exists between time-global variables and time elements. Therefore, a displacement is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''), whereas a position vector is ''associated'' with a time instant ('''I'''). In this association the measuring process must be taken into account, because temperature is ''referred'' to an instant but its measurement involves a time interval - the one needed to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature is said to be ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''). Similarly, the measurement of a force requires a [[mechanical equilibrium]] to be reached, hence it is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T''').

[[File:Ritaaa.png|thumb|'''Figure 3'''. ''Left'') A two-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Inherited association of field variables ==
Since in each field of physics the global variables are ''associated'' with a space and a time element, the association of the corresponding densities and the rates with the space and time element of the corresponding global variable is spontaneous. The densities and the rates are said to ''inherit'' the association from their corresponding global variables. The same inherited association remains once we have  performed the limit to obtain the field variables.

== Orientation of space elements ==
In this classification, the orientation of the space elements has a fundamental role. There are two kinds of orientation: '''inner''' and '''outer orientation''',&lt;ref&gt;Schouten, J.A.: Tensor Calculus for Physicists. 2nd ed., Dover, New York (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Fig. 2.

There is a surprising correspondence between the role that a physical variable plays in a theory and the type of orientation of the corresponding space element: a detailed analysis of physical variables shows that ''the configuration variables are associated with the space elements endowed with inner orientation while the source and the energy variables are associated with the outer orientation.''

[[File:Greta copia.png|thumb|'''Figure 4'''. ''Left'') A three-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Cell complexes ==
To highlight the four space elements, it is expedient to divide a region of space into many cells, thus creating a '''cell complex'''. The vertices represent points, the edges lines, the faces surfaces and the cells themselves volumes.
Each of these elements can be given an inner orientation. Since we also need space elements with outer orientation, it is expedient to consider the '''dual complex''', obtained by joining the centroids of the cells belonging to the '''primal complex'''. Doing so, we see that the inner orientation of each element of the primal complex induces an outer orientation on the corresponding element of the dual complex.

Figures 3 and 4 show how the space elements of the primal complex, which are endowed with inner orientation, induce an outer orientation on the elements of the dual complex. Moreover, the space elements of the two complexes can be arranged in a diagram such as the one shown on the right-hand side of the figures.

A cell complex and its dual constitute a valid framework to describe the association of physical variables with the oriented space elements. To be precise, the configuration variables, which are associated with space elements with inner orientation, may be associated with the elements of the primal complex, while the source variables, which are associated with the space elements with an outer orientation, can be associated with the elements of the dual complex.

== Orientation of time elements ==

[[File:Tempo nuovo 2.png|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Time elements. I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time instants; T&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time intervals; '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = position vector; '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = displacement.]]

At first glance, the notions of inner and outer orientation of a time element may appear strange, certainly unusual. Let us consider a subdivision of the time axis into many adjacent time intervals. Doing so, we have constructed a one-dimensional cell complex in time. 
Considering now the middle instants of each time interval we have a second cell complex in time. The first complex is called ''primal'' and the second ''dual''.
 
'''Primal complex, inner orientation''': the fact that the time axis is oriented implies that each time interval is oriented: this is the inner orientation of the primal time intervals.
Since the variation of a time function φ (t) is defined as Δφ = + φ (t + h)-φ (t),  in order to conceive the "+" and "-" signs of this formula as incidence numbers between a time interval and its bounding instants, these should be considered as "sinks".

'''Dual complex, outer orientation''': the middle instant of each time interval is called ''dual time instant'' and we can give it the same orientation of the primal time interval. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time instant. In turn, the time intervals connecting two adjacent dual time instants are called ''dual time intervals''. Once more we can assign them the orientation induced by the primal time instants, as shown in Fig. 5. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time intervals.

==The birth of the classification diagram &lt;ref&gt;Diagrams of the various physical theories can be downloaded from the website http://www.discretephysics.org/&lt;/ref&gt; ==

[[File:Ele1.png|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. Classification diagram for electrostatics.]]

The fact that physical variables are associated with space and time elements endowed with inner or outer orientation and that space and time elements of a primal and a dual cell complex can be classified as shown on the right-hand side of Figs. 3 and 4, suggests a corresponding classification of physical variables. 
Let us consider, as an example, the classification diagram of electrostatics, shown in Fig. 6. The left column includes those physical variables associated with the primal cell complex, whose elements are endowed with inner orientation: these are the ''configuration'' variables. The right column includes those physical variables associated with the dual cell complex, whose elements are endowed with outer orientation: these are the ''source'' variables.

The equations linking the variables are contained in the rectangular boxes. The equations in each vertical column are ''balance'' equations, ''circuital'' equations and ''gradient-forming'' equations. They have a topological structure and are called '''topological equations'''. Those that link configuration variables to source variables—contained in the horizontal links—are ''material'' or ''constitutive'' equations, and belong to the category of '''phenomenological equations'''.

==The time diagram==
[[File:Par1.png|thumb|'''Figure 7'''. Classification diagram for particle dynamics.]]
Particle dynamics, analytical mechanics and electric networks make use of space-global variables that depend only on the time variable. Referring here to particle dynamics, we see that configuration variables are geometrical and kinematic variables, while source variables are static and dynamic variables. In Fig. 7 we see that kinematic variables lie in the left column while dynamic variables lie in the right one. The diagram shows three phenomenological equations: those connecting two variables on the same level describe a reversible relation (i.e. a non-dissipative relation), while those linking force with velocity describe an irreversible relation (i.e. a dissipative relation). The dissipative nature is shown by the fact that one variable, velocity, changes sign under reversal of motion, while the other, force, does not.

==The space-time diagram==
[[File:E Tonti Classification diagrams mechanical and field theories.png|thumb|'''Figure 8'''. The two classification diagrams of space-time elements.]] 
Since every global physical variable is associated with both a time and a space element, it appears useful to have a classification diagram combining space and time elements.   
When the four space elements '''P''', '''L''', '''S''' and '''V''' are coupled with the two time elements  '''I''' and '''T''' we obtain eight possible combinations. Furthermore, if one considers that each space element and each time element can be endowed with two orientations, inner and outer, we must combine the 4x2 oriented space elements with the 2x2 oriented time elements, thus obtaining 32 possible space-time combinations. Fig. 8 shows the two possible classification diagrams of the space-time elements.
The first version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with inner orientation and vice versa: it is the case of mechanics in all its manifestations, such as particle and analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids and fluid mechanics. The second version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with outer orientation and vice versa. It is the case of field theories such as electromagnetism, gravitation, thermal conduction and irreversible thermodynamics.

The space-time diagrams show clearly which phenomenological equations describe irreversible phenomena: they are the ones that link variables that are on the same level but connect a box on the front-left side with a box on the back-right side.

'''''Too Big to Know: Rethinking Knowledge Now That the Facts Aren't the Facts, Experts Are Everywhere, and the Smartest Person in the Room Is the Room''''' is a non-fiction book by the American technology writer [[David Weinberger]] published in 2012 by [[Basic Books]].

==Overview==
It describes the [[World Wide Web]]-enabled shift in the production, transmission, reception, and storage of [[knowledge]] in the early 21st century.

A '''tragic hero''' is the [[protagonist]] of a [[tragedy]] in [[dramas]].  In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] records the descriptions of the tragic hero to the playwright and strictly defines the place that the tragic hero must play and the kind of man he must be. Aristotle based his observations on previous dramas.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, On Poetics, Ingram Bywater&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the most famous instances of tragic heroes appear in [[Greek literature]], most notably the works of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. Others, like the contemporary tragedy of J.P. Carney, happen in the ordinary confinements of our own world, bespeaking to the hubris of the modern man in the age of technology and leg day.

==Aristotle's tragic hero==

In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle suggests that the hero of a tragedy must evoke a sense of pity or fear within the audience, stating that “the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher, The Poetic of Aristotle (1902), pp. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the focus of the hero should not be the loss of his [[prosperity]]. He establishes the concept that [[pity]] is an emotion that must be elicited when, through his actions, the character receives undeserved misfortune, while the emotion of [[fear]] must be felt by the audience when they contemplate that such misfortune could possibly befall themselves in similar situations. Aristotle explains such change of fortune "should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.” Such misfortune is visited upon the tragic hero "not through vice or depravity but by some error of judgment." This error, or [[hamartia]], refers to a flaw in the character of the hero, or a mistake made by the character.

An example of a mistake made by a tragic hero can be found in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''. In the story, the character of Oedipus is given a prophecy that he will murder his own father and marry his own mother. Although he goes to great lengths to avoid fulfilling the prophecy, Oedipus learns that the life of a man he took, Laius, was actually that of his own father, and that the woman to which he is married, Jocasta, is actually his own mother.

[[Creon]] of Sophocles' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' is another notable example of a tragic hero. Polyneices and his brother, Eteocles, were kings, and the former wanted more power, so he left and assembled an army from a neighboring city. They attacked and the two brothers killed each other. Through Creon's law forbidding the burial of [[Polyneices]], Creon dooms his own family. Other examples provided by Aristotle include [[Thyestes]].

Therefore, the Aristotelian hero is characterized as virtuous but not "eminently good," which suggests a noble or important personage who is upstanding and morally inclined while nonetheless subject to [[human error]]. Aristotle's tragic heroes are flawed individuals who commit, without evil intent, great wrongs or injuries that ultimately lead to their misfortune, often followed by tragic realization of the true nature of events that led to this destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Reeves, The Aristotelian Concept of The Tragic Hero, Vol. 73, No. 2 (1952), Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/291812 pp. 172-188&lt;/ref&gt; This means the hero still must be – to some degree – morally grounded. The usual [[irony]] in Greek tragedy is that the hero is both extraordinarily capable and highly moral (in the Greek [[honor]]-culture sense of being duty-bound to moral expectations), and it is these exact, highly-admirable qualities that lead the hero into tragic circumstances.  The tragic hero is snared by his or her own greatness: extraordinary competence, a righteous passion for duty, and (often) the arrogance associated with greatness ([[hubris]]).

==In other media==
The influence of the Aristotelian hero extends past [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] [[literary criticism]]. Greek theater had a direct and profound influence on Roman theater and formed the basis of Western theater that continues into the modern era, deeply influencing a wide variety of arts throughout the world, in diverse mediums such as literature, music, film, television and even video games. Many iconic characters featured in these genres follow the archetype of the tragic hero. Examples of such characters include [[Anakin Skywalker]] from George Lucas'  ''[[Star_Wars#Prequel_trilogy|Star Wars]]'' films, Okonkwo from Nigerian author Chinua Achebe's novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', Arthas Menethil from the video game franchise ''[[Warcraft]]'', and [[Stannis Baratheon]] from [[George R. R. Martin]]'s novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and the HBO television series adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Some film historians regard [[Michael Corleone]] of ''[[The Godfather (film series)|The Godfather]]'' a tragic hero, although using traditional literary conventions, the character would more closely fit the role of [[villain]], not tragic hero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023071414/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
School of Aviation Mechanical Technicians was founded in [[Kiev]], on May 24, 1919. The aircraft repair shops and pilot school were used as the school base. From Kiev, the school had been evacuated to [[Moscow]] and in 1921 it was relocated to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and renamed as Advanced Training Courses for Engineering Staff.

In 1938–39, a status of this educational establishment has been changed due to the prevailing number of students and listeners raising the level of their skills. In May 1938 the courses were given a new name of First Aircraft Maintenance School. The school was renamed yet again in 1939. In 1946 it was reorganized as the First Leningrad Higher Military Aviation Engineering School.

=== Relocation to Latvia ===
In June 1945 the school was relocated to Riga. In Riga, also the Second Leningrad Higher Military Aviation Engineering School was functioning that had been reorganized from the technical school with similar name. Both schools had two faculties. The first - engineering and special electrical equipment, the second - radio engineering and air armaments. In 1949 both schools were joined together to form Riga Higher Military Aviation Engineering School. In June 1960 the School was broken up and on its base the civil higher school was found - the Riga Civil Air Fleet Engineers Institute. In 1967 in connection with the reorganization of the Main Directorate of Civil Air Fleet into the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the higher school was named as the Riga Civil Aviation Engineers Institute (RIIGA). On 25 February 1992, the RIIGA passed under the jurisdiction of the Latvian Republic and changed its name to the Riga Aviation Institute. By its 80th anniversary the RAU was the largest higher school in Latvia holding a third place in the rating of the educational establishments in the country.

=== Founding of the current institute ===
At the end of the 1990s the higher school faced a number of internal and external problems, and in August 1999 the Cabinet of Latvia made a decision about the liquidation of the RAU as the governmental higher school. Such wording encouraged its employees to reorganize this educational establishment by now into a non-governmental institution. On 6 September 1999, the joint stock company ''"Riga Aviation University"'' had been registered and from October of the same year it was renamed into the ''Transport and Telecommunication Institute''. TTI has been included into the Training Directory of the International Civil Aviation Organization ([[ICAO]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1022">A '''violation of law''' is any act (or, less commonly, failure to act) that fails to abide by existing [[law]]. Violations generally may include both [[crime]]s and [[civil wrong]]s. Some acts, such as [[fraud]], can violate both civil and criminal laws.

Examples of violations of law include:
* [[Moving violation]], any violation of law committed by a driver while the vehicle is in motion
* [[Parking violation]], parking a motor vehicle in a restricted place or an unauthorized manner
* [[Willful violation]], in U.S. law an act with intentional disregard for a regulation, statute and policy
* [[Infraction]], in United States law, minor or petty offenses that do not require jury trial
* [[Infringement (disambiguation)|Infringement]], various violations of laws or rights, usually used in the context of intellectual property
