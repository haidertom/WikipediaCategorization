The '''AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme''' is a five-year strategic research initiative funded by two UK research councils: the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. running 2007-2012. It has funded 75 projects across UK universities investigating various aspects of the complex relationships between religion and society, both historical and contemporary.

Research supported includes the website "British Religion in Numbers",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brin.ac.uk/ British Religion in Numbers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029143012/http://www.brin.ac.uk/ |date=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a one-stop shop for statistics on religion in Britain led by Professor [[David Voas]] at [[Manchester University]], Professor Kim Knott at [[Leeds University]]'s restudy of British media coverage of religion and spirituality, and an investigation of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh shrine practices across the Punjab led by Dr Tej Purewal, also at Manchester. Phase 2 of the Programme has focused on Youth and Religion specifically, supporting projects like Dr Basia Spalek at [[Birmingham University]]'s research into police partnerships with young Muslims.

The Religion and Society Programme is hosted at [[Lancaster University]], and directed by Professor [[Linda Woodhead]] helped by Dr Rebecca Catto (Research Associate) and Peta Ainsworth (Administrator). The Programme also helps to organize various relevant and topical events such as a day at the British Library asking ‘where next for religion in the public sphere’ in July 2010 and a closed seminar asking ‘Child abuse in the Catholic Church – what can be learned?’ at [[Heythrop College]] London in November 2010.

== Sociology of Religion ==
Sociologist have studied religion right from the beginning of the discipline, in the 19th century. It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Durkheim]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's ''[[the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004). Sociologist are interested in studying religion for three main reason. The first, is that religion is simply very important in the lives of many people around the world. Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can’t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation. Finally, the third reason for religious study in sociology is the fact that religion changes over time in response to different social conditions. The prime objective for this effect, is to understand why (Kaelber, 2002).

== Religion in America ==
Religion in America has had a relationship since the very beginning of the nation. This relationship has changed over time and has shaped the culture. It started with the Native Americans and their worship of the Great Spirits. They believed that their ancestors watched over them and that the spirits in nature blessed them. When colonist came to America, they brought Christianity along with them. They tried to integrate the religion into the lives of the Native people. Christianity branched out and separated into Protestant and Catholic (Trundle, 2012). There were many forms of Protestant like [[Methodist]], Lutheran, and Quakers. There are other forms of Catholic as well, including the [[Roman Catholic]] and eastern Orthodox. Later other religions were introduced to America through immigration. Religions like [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]], and many others. These began to influence the culture. America was known as the melting pot of different cultures and religions. It was seen as a safe haven for those seeking religious freedom. Religion has effected America in many ways over the years. It was the reason the colonist came to America, and was used as an excuse for dominating over the Native Americans (Trundle, 2012). It was also used as a foundation for the civil rights movement as Martin Luther King Jr. presented his speech through his own personal belief system. More recent was September 11 when the twin towers were destroyed through religious beliefs. The bombers claimed that it was for religious purposes on why they did what they did. In effect, all religions joined together in America to rebuild and grow stronger. Religion has brought people together in times of need, throughout history. It has also caused negative effects in society as explained with 9/11.

== What happens after Religion ==
Fewer and fewer people believe nowadays. It's possible that in a generation, there simply won’t be religion across [[Europe]] and large sections of [[North America]], [[Australia]], and [[Asia]]. That's not necessarily a problem. However, it is worth thinking about why people made up religion in the first place, and what we’re doing with the needs and longings that led them to do so. At one level, religions are about asking us to believe in something. When people say, they can’t believe, they tend to stop right there with the whole religion business. They often then point out all the horrid things that religions have undoubtly done and continue to do. In this sense, belief is almost the least important and defiantly the least interesting side of religion. What's fascinating is all the other stuff religions get up to. For example, the way they regularly gather people around, and tell them to be nice to one another. Also, the way they create a sense of community, teaching others to see everyone else as human beings (Gruber, 2008). Religions use rituals to point stuff out to us and lodge it in our fickle minds. For example, that the seasons are changing or that it's the time to remember our ancestors. Religions know were not just intellectual creatures, so they carefully appeal to us via art and beauty. We think of beauty in one category, a frivolous and superficial thing, and truth and depth in another. Religions join them together. They build temples, cathedrals, and mosques that use beauty to lend depth to important ideas. They use the resources of art to remind us of what matters. Its directed at making us feel things, calm, pity, awe.

We may no longer believe, but the needs and longings that make up these stories go on. We long for beauty, wisdom, and purpose. We want to live for something more than just ourselves. Society tells us to direct our hopes in two areas. These are romantic love, and professional success, and it distracts us with news, movies, and consumption. It's not enough, as we know. We need reminders to be good, places to reawaken awe, and something to awaken our kinder, less selfish impulses. Universal things which need tending like delicate flowers and rituals that bring us together. The choice isn’t between religion and a secular world as it is now. The challenge is to learn from religions, so we can fill the secular world with replacements for the things we long ago made up religion to provide (Giovanni, 2003).

'''Anastasius Sinaïta''' ('''Anastasius of Sinai''', died after 700), also called '''Anastasios of Sinai''', was a prolific and important seventh century [[Greeks|Greek]] [[ecclesiastical]] writer, priest, monk, and abbot of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at [[Mount Sinai]].

==Life==
The little that is known about the life of Anastasius of Sinai is gathered from his own works.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Munitiz, "Foreword," in Kuehn-Baggarly 2007, IX.&lt;/ref&gt; In Antiquity, he was often confused with the bishop and writer [[Anastasius I of Antioch]] (559 – 598),&lt;ref&gt;Weiss 1965, XX.&lt;/ref&gt; and the authorship of various works attributed to Anastasius of Sinai is still vigorously disputed. A canon has been tentatively accepted by modern scholars, but even among these Anastasian works there are spurious sections.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn-Baggarly 2007, XIII-XXIII.&lt;/ref&gt; His writings concern questions and answers about issues of Christian dogma, ritual, and lifestyle (catechism); sermons; and [[exegesis]]. He was fond of tracing the [[etymologies]] of key Christian terms; he was erudite in the [[Bible]] and early [[Patristic]] literature; and he had a pervasive interest in the nature of God and man, especially in the [[Person of Christ]] ([[Christology]]).&lt;ref&gt;Uthemann 2006, 326-330.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not reluctant to develop and express his own theories about key ecclesiastical issues, which led to later commentaries, emendations, and perhaps even [[censorship]] of parts of his works.&lt;ref&gt;J. Munitiz, "Foreword," in Kuehn-Baggarly 2007, IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
The principal works transmitted under Anastasius' name include the ''Viae Dux'', ''Quaestiones et Responsiones'',  ''Hexaemeron'', ''Homilia i, ii, iii de creatione hominis'', and the ''Narrationes''. The ''Viae Dux'' - also called the ''Hodegos'' (Greek transliteration) and "Guide Along the Right Path" (English translation) - was written in defense of the [[Chalcedonian Creed]]. A collection of works by Anastasius, the ''Viae Dux'' served to support the true faith and to counter the attacks of heretics, in particular [[Monophysites]].&lt;ref&gt;Uthemann 2006, 313-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Quaestiones et Responsiones'' ("Questions and Responses") was a popular genre&lt;ref&gt;Haldon 1992, 116-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and falls under the category of pastoral theology. It offers advice, largely to the lay community, on spiritual and sacramental matters, charitable donations, marriage, and other subjects. Here Anastasius reveals a distinctly personal tone and offers a window into the day-to-day existence of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;Richard-Munitiz 2006, LI; Haldon 1992, 124-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially significant because it is an eyewitness account of the expansion of Islam into Sinai and Egypt, which were predominantly Christian, and of the effect that Moslem domination had on Christian life and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Haldon 1992, 115-6, 130-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anastasius was probably the author of the ''Hexaemeron'', a commentary in 12 books about the [[Genesis creation narrative]]. (''Hexaemeron'', sometimes spelled [[Hexameron]], means “six-days”.) In the ''Hexaemeron'' Anastasius argues that Moses on Mount Sinai was inspired by the Holy Spirit to write not only the creation narrative, but also in the same text to prophesize the New Creation through Christ. Thus Adam represents Christ and Eve represents the Church. Anastasius' extensive exegesis of the beginning of Genesis draws upon commentaries written by many Fathers of the Church, including [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]. One reason for some doubts about Anastasius’ authorship is the lack of any surviving manuscript copied before the end of the fifteenth century. The lack of earlier manuscripts, however, could be the result of [[censorship]]. The [[allegorical interpretations of Genesis]] in the ''Hexaemeron'' by Anastasius are in many ways a counterpoint to the more literal ''Hexaemeron'' written by [[Basil the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn-Baggarly 2007, XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Angel]]s''' have appeared in works of [[art]] since early Christian art, and they have been a popular subject for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Europe]]an paintings and sculpture.

Angels are usually intended, in both Christian and Islamic art, to be beautiful, though several depictions go for more awesome/frightening attributes, notably in the depiction of the [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]] (which have beastial characteristics), [[ophanim]] (which are unanthropomorphic wheels) and [[cherubim]] (which have mosaic features);&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Alice. Of Wing and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim. pp. 2–4. {{ISBN|978-3-11-020528-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of theology, they are spiritual beings who do not eat or excrete and are genderless. Many angels in art may appear to the modern eye to be gendered as either male or female by their dress or actions, but until the 19th century, even the most female looking will normally lack breasts, and the figures should normally be considered as genderless.&lt;ref&gt;"Because angels are purely spiritual creatures without bodies, there is no sexual difference between them. There are no male or female angels; they are not distinguished by gender.", p. 10, "Catholic Questions, Wise Answers", Ed. Michael J. Daley, St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0867163984}}, 9780867163988. See also [https://www.catholic.com/qa/can-angels-be-male-or-female Catholic Answers], which gives the standard, unchanged, Catholic position.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 19th-century art, especially [[funerary art]], this traditional convention is sometimes abandoned.

===In the Early Church===
Specific ideas regarding how to portray angels began to develop in the early Church. Since angels are defined as pure spirits,

The earliest known Christian image of an angel, in the ''Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione'' in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], which is dated to the middle of the third century, is a depiction of the Annunciation in which Gabriel is portrayed without wings. Representations of angels on [[sarcophagi]] and on objects such as lamps and [[reliquaries]] of that period also show them without wings,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 81-89; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt; as for example the angel in the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' scene in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]].

In a third-century fresco of the Hebrew children in the furnace, in the cemetery of St. Priscilla, a dove takes the place of the angel, while a fourth-century representation of the same subject, in the coemeterium majus, substitutes the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for the heavenly messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01485a.htm Hassett, Maurice. "Early Christian Representations of Angels." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 Dec. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the Prince's Sarcophagus, discovered at Sarigüzel, near [[Istanbul]], in the 1930s, and attributed to the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Flying winged angels, very often in pairs flanking a central figure or subject, are derivations in visual terms from pairs of [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victories]] in classical art.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

In this same period, Saint [[John Chrysostom]] explained the significance of angels' wings: "They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature."&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on Christian art generally represented angels with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-440).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 90-95; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multi-winged angels, often with only their face and wings showing, drawn from the higher grades of angels, especially [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]], are derived from Persian art, and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the [[pendentive]]s of [[dome]]s or [[semi-dome]]s of churches.

===Byzantine art===
[[File:Erzengel Michael und Gabriel.jpg|thumb|12th century [[icon]] of the Archangels [[Michael (angel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] wearing the ''[[loros]]'' of the Imperial guards.]]

Angels appear in Byzantine art in mosaics and icons. Artists found some of their inspiration from winged Greek figures such as "Victory". They also drew from imperial iconography. Court eunuchs could rise to positions of authority in the Empire. They performed ceremonial functions and served as trusted messengers. Amelia R. Brown points out that legislation under Justinian indicates that many of them came from the Caucasus, having light eyes, hair, and skin, as well as the "comely features and fine bodies" desired by slave traders.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;  Those "castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards,...." As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that  "Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch".&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1053017/Painting_the_Bodiless_Angels_and_Eunuchs_in_Byzantine_Art_and_Culture Brown, Amelia R., "Painting the Bodiless: Angels and Eunuchs in Byzantine Art and Culture", University of Queensland (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel 10: 5-6 describes an angel as clothed in linen and girt with gold.&lt;ref name=longhurst/&gt; Angels, especially the archangel Michael, who were depicted as military-style agents of God, came to be shown wearing [[Late Antique]] military uniform.  This could be either the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, armour breastplate and [[pteruges]], but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], with a long tunic and the ''[[loros]]'', a long gold and jewelled  [[pallium]] restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards, and in icons to archangels.  The basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the [[Baroque]] period and beyond in the West, and up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes.

===Medieval art===
Medieval depictions of angels borrow from the Byzantine. In the French ''Hours of Anne of Brittany'', Gabriel wears a dalmatic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9QQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54 Andre, J. Lewis. "The Icons and Emblems of the Holy Angels", ''The Belfry: Quarterly Papers on Art, History and Archaeology'', No. III, Burns &amp; Oates, London, October 1876,]&lt;/ref&gt; In the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a [[deacon]], a [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]], especially [[Gabriel]] in [[Annunciation]] scenes - for example ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]]. This indicated that, for all their powers, they could not perform the [[Eucharist]], and were in this respect outranked by every priest, reinforcing the prestige of the clergy.  In [[Early Christian art]] white robes were almost invariably adopted, sometimes bound with the "golden girdle" of Revelation. During the mediæval period senior angels were often clad in every brilliant colour,&lt;ref name=vinycomb&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lcr/fsca/fsca08.htm Vinycomb, John. ''Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Art'', p.30, Chapman and Hall, London(1909)]&lt;/ref&gt; while junior ranks wore white. Early Renaissance painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Fra Angelico]] painted angels with multi-colored wings.  Depictions of angels came to combine medieval notions of beauty with feminine ideals of grace and beauty, as in da Panicale's 1435 ''Baptism of Christ''.&lt;ref name=gorgievski/&gt;

===Renaissance art===
[[File:ANGELICO, Fra Annunciation, 1437-46 (2236990916).jpg|thumb|left|Fra Angelico, The Annunciation, 1437-46]]
The classical ''[[erotes]]'' or ''[[putto]]'' re-appeared in art during the [[Italian Renaissance]] in both religious and mythological art, and is often known in English as a [[cherub]], the singular of cherubim, actually one of the higher ranks in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy]].  They normally appear in groups and are generally given wings in religious art, and are sometimes represented as just a winged head.  They generally are just in attendance, except that they may be amusing Christ or [[John the Baptist]] as infants in scenes of the [[Holy Family]].

===Victorian art===
In the late 19th century artists' model [[Jane Morris|Jane Burden Morris]] came to embody an ideal of beauty for [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters. With the use of her long dark hair and features made somewhat more androgynous, they created a prototype Victorian angel which would appear in paintings and stained glass windows. Roger Homan notes that [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and others used her image often and in different ways, creating a new type of angel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000614.php Homan, Roger. "Jane Burden: How a Pre-Raphaelite model changed our image of angels", ''The Social Affairs Unit'', 14 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic art ==
According to Islamic teaching, angels are made of light, are beautiful, and have wings; although the shape and form of the wings are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php Islamic Resource &amp; Information Service (IRIS), New Zealand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410081112/http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php |date=10 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islamic art]] angels mainly appear mainly in narrative scenes in miniature painting, in the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman miniature|Ottoman]] traditions.  They are especially common in illustrations of the Prophet's [[Mi'raj]], one of the occasions where their presence is mentioned in the [[Quran]].  Their appearance generally draws more from the [[iconography]] of pre-Islamic Persia, and [[Buddhist art]], than from angels in Christian art. Some of the earliest [[Ilkhanid]] examples are exceptions to this.  They have wings, often multi-coloured,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/angels-fly-on-high-multicolored-wings.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=27524&amp;NewsCatID=438 Gamm, Niki. Angels fly on high multicolored wings", ''Hurriyit Daily News'' Istanbul, Turkey, 11 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and very often floating scarves drawing from Chinese Buddhist art. They are not very common however; many appear in illustrations to biographical accounts of the life of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], which are themselves rare.  There are a few studies of angels by themselves, especially from [[Safavid]] Persia.

In Islamic holy book, God rejects the depictions of angel as female in several verses of [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''The Holy Qur'an''. [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/37. Those Ranging in Ranks|chapter 37:149-150]].&lt;/ref&gt; and He will question those who make the depiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''The Holy Qur'an''.  [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/43. Gold|chapter 43:19-20]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''axial line''' is the line between two adjacent [[dermatomes]] that are not represented by immediately adjacent spinal levels. Although dermatomes are shown to be discrete segments on dermatomal maps (like in the image opposite), they are in fact not; adjacent dermatomes overlap with one another. This is one of the reasons for the variety of different dermatomal maps proposed. However, at axial lines, adjacent [[dermatomes]] do not overlap. An example of an axial line would be the line between the S2 and L4 dermatomes on the calf.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inkling.com/read/clinically-oriented-anatomy-moore-agur-dalley-7th/chapter-5/fascia-veins-lymphatics&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bosscha Observatory''' is the oldest modern [[observatory]] in [[Indonesia]], and one of the oldest in Asia. The observatory is located in [[Lembang]], [[West Java]], approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Bandung]]. It is situated on a hilly six hectares of land and is {{convert|1310|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]] plateau. The IAU observatory code for Bosscha is 299.

==History==
During the first meeting of the ''Nederlandsch-Indische Sterrekundige Vereeniging'' (Dutch-Indies Astronomical Society) in the 1920s, it was agreed that an [[observatory]] was needed to study [[astronomy]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Of all locations in the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesia archipelago]], a [[tea|tea plantation]] in Malabar, a few kilometers north of [[Bandung]] in [[West Java]] was selected. It is on the hilly north side of the city with a non-obstructed view of the sky and with close access to the city that was planned to become the new capital of the Dutch colony, replacing Batavia (present-day [[Jakarta]]). The observatory is named after the tea plantation owner [[Karel Albert Rudolf Bosscha]], son of the physicist [[Johannes Bosscha]] and a major force in the development of science and technology in the Dutch East Indies, who granted six hectares of his property for the new observatory.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hastings, ''The Road to Lembang: A Retrospect, 1938-1966'', p. 34. Griffith University, Division of Asian and International Studies, Centre for the Study of Australia-Asia Relations, 1990. {{ISBN|9780868573564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the observatory began in 1923 and was completed in 1928. Since then a continuous observation of the sky was made. The first international publication from Bosscha was published in 1922. Observations from Bosscha were halted during [[World War II]] and after the war a major reconstruction was necessary. On 17 October 1951, the Dutch-Indies Astronomical Society handed over operation of the observatory to the [[government of Indonesia]]. In 1959 the observatory's operation was given to the [[Institut Teknologi Bandung]] and has been an integral part of the research and formal education of astronomy in Indonesia.

==Facilities==

Five large [[telescope]]s were installed in Bosscha:

# The Zeiss double refractor
#:This telescope is mainly used to observe visual [[binary star]]s, conduct [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric studies]] on [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]], image [[lunar crater]]s, observe planets ([[Mars]], [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]]) and to observe [[comet]] details and other heavy bodies. The telescope has two [[objective lens]]es with a diameter of {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} each and a [[focal length]] of {{convert|10.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.
# The Schmidt telescope (nicknamed: ''Bima Sakti'' telescope)
#: This telescope is used to study [[galaxy|galactic structure]], [[stellar spectra]], [[asteroid]] studies, [[supernova]]e, and to photograph heavy bodies. The main lens diameter is {{convert|71.12|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the correcting bi-concave and convex lens is {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} with a focal length of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is also equipped with a [[spectrum|spectral]] [[prism (optics)|prism]] with a prime angle of 6.10 degrees for stellar spectra, a wedge sensitometer and a [[film recorder]].
# The Bamberg refractor
#: This telescope is used to determine [[stellar magnitude]], [[stellar distance]], and photometric studies of eclipsing stars, [[sun|solar imaging]], and others. It is equipped with a photoelectric [[photometer]] a {{convert|37|cm|in|abbr=on}} lens diameter and a {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} meter focal length.
# The Cassegrain GOTO
#: This was a gift from the [[government of Japan|Japanese government]]. This computer controlled telescope can automatically view objects from a database and this was the first digital telescope at Bosscha. The telescope is also equipped with a [[photometer]] and [[Spectrometer|spectrometer-spectrograph]].
# The Unitron refractor
#: This telescope is used for observing [[hilal (crescent moon)|hilal]], [[lunar eclipse]], [[solar eclipse]] and [[sunspot]] photography, and also other objects. Lens diameter is {{convert|10.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a focal length of {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

A '''Butterworth cover''' (also '''Butterworth hatch''' and '''Butterworth plate''') is a [[Trapdoor|hatch]] on the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] of a [[cargo vessel]] that is used to seal a small opening that admits to the space below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~cdaley/5003/ship_terms.pdf |author= Daley, C. G. |title=Ship Terms and Definitions|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ekenes, Rolf N.|year=2009|title=Southern Marine Engineering Desk Reference|publisher=Xlibris for Southern Marine Technical Services, LLC |page=79|isbn=978-1-4415-2022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[oil tanker]]s and other marine vessels used for transporting fluid products, there are small service openings though the deck into each tank to allow access for miscellaneous reasons such as sampling, inspection, gauging and cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eyres, David J.|year=2006|title=Ship Construction|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Burlington, Massachusetts|page=258|isbn=978-0-08-046823-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the service opening is not in use, it is sealed by a removable cover plate, commonly referred to as a Butterworth cover.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Jr., John P "Cover plate having adjustable latch means" http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4059202.html&lt;/ref&gt; Butterworth hatches are not the main access hatches, but are the servicing hatches, and are generally closed with a metal cover plate with a gasket that is fastened to the deck by a number of bolts which stick up from the deck. Holes on the edges of the plate fit over these bolts and the cover is fastened down with nuts or dogs.

Vapor accidents can occur when pressure builds up in the tank below and the Butterworth cover is carelessly removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wang, Y.

'''Cephalization''' is an [[evolution]]ary trend in which, over many generations, the mouth, [[sense organ]]s, and nerve ganglia become concentrated at the front end of an [[animal]], producing a [[head]] region. This is associated with [[animal locomotion|movement]] and [[bilateral symmetry (biology)|bilateral symmetry]], such that the animal has a definite head end. This led to the formation of a [[brain]] in three groups of animals, namely the [[arthropod]]s, [[cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]s, and [[vertebrate]]s. Since the molluscs ([[protostome]]s) and the vertebrates ([[deuterostome]]s) are widely separated on the phylogenetic tree of animals, and have differently organized bodies and brains, cephalization [[convergent evolution|evolved independently]] in these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trends in evolution|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_54|publisher=UCMP Berkeley|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Cephalization in Zoology?|url=http://education.seattlepi.com/cephalization-zoology-4354.html|publisher=Hearst Seattle Media|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals without bilateral symmetry==

[[Cnidaria]] such as the radially symmetrical [[Hydrozoa]], show some degree of cephalization. The [[Anthomedusae]] have a head end with their mouth, photoreceptive cells, and a concentration of neural cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Satterlie |first1=Richard |title=Cnidarian Neurobiology |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190456757.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190456757-e-7?mediaType=Article |publisher=Oxford |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190456757.013.7 |date=February 2017 |quote=Ocelli located at the base of the many tentacles represent one input to the B system, whereas the neurons of the O system are directly photosensitive. Many hydromedusae have ocelli of different levels of complexity (Singla, 1974). In addition, other marginal sensory structures associated with the outer nerve ring include statocysts (Singla, 1975), and mechanoreceptors, such as the tactile combs of Aglantha, which are located at the tentacle bases, and can activate the escape swimming circuitry (Arkett &amp; Mackie, 1988; Mackie, 2004b).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilateria==
[[File:Bilaterian body plan.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Idealised [[bilateria]]n [[body plan]]. With a cylindrical body and a direction of forward [[animal locomotion|movement]] the animal has head and tail ends, favouring cephalization by [[natural selection]]. Sense organs and mouth form the basis of the head.]]
{{further|Bilateria}}

Cephalization is a characteristic feature of the [[Bilateria]], a large group containing the majority of animal phyla. These have the ability to move, using muscles, and a [[body plan]] with a front end that encounters stimuli first as the animal moves forwards, and accordingly has evolved to contain many of the body's sense organs, able to detect light, chemicals, and often sound. There is often also a collection of nerve cells able to process the information from these sense organs, forming a brain in several phyla and one or more ganglia in others.&lt;ref name=Brusca2016&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sinauer.com/media/wysiwyg/samples/Brusca3e_Chapter_9.pdf |title=Introduction to the Bilateria and the Phylum Xenacoelomorpha {{!}} Triploblasty and Bilateral Symmetry Provide New Avenues for Animal Radiation |work=Invertebrates |last=Brusca |first=Richard C. |date=2016 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=345–372 |isbn=978-1605353753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoela===
The [[Acoela]] are basal bilaterians, part of the [[Xenacoelomorpha]]. They are small and simple animals, and have very slightly more nerve cells at the head end than elsewhere, not forming a distinct and compact brain. This represents an early stage in cephalization.&lt;ref name="Cabej2013"&gt;{{cite book | last=Çabej | first=Nelson | title=Rise of the Animal Kingdom and Epigenetic Mechanisms of Evolution|work=Building the most complex structure on Earth : an epigenetic narrative of development and evolution of animals | publisher=Elsevier | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-12-401667-5 | pages=239–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flatworms===
[[File:Yellow papillae flatworm (Thysanozoon nigropapillosum) (cropped).jpg|thumb|The yellow papillae flatworm, ''[[Thysanozoon nigropapillosum]]'', is somewhat cephalized, with a distinct head end (at right) which has pseudotentacles and an eyespot.]]

The [[Platyhelminthes]] (flatworms) have a more complex nervous system than the Acoela, and are lightly cephalized, for instance having an eyespot above the brain, near the front end.&lt;ref name="Cabej2013"/&gt;

===Complex active bodies===
The philosopher Michael Trestman noted that three bilaterian phyla, namely the arthropods, the molluscs in the shape of the cephalopods, and the chordates, were distinctive in having "complex active bodies", something that the acoels and flatworms did not have. Any such animal, whether predator or prey, has to be aware of its environment—to catch its prey, or to evade its predators. These groups are exactly those that are most highly cephalized.&lt;ref name="Trestman2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Trestman | first=Michael | title=The Cambrian Explosion and the Origins of Embodied Cognition | journal=Biological Theory | volume=8 | issue=1 | date=April 2013 | doi=10.1007/s13752-013-0102-6 | pages=80–92 |url=https://michaeltrestman.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/trestman-cambrian-pub.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Godfrey-Smith |first=Peter |title=Other Minds: The Octopus and the Evolution of Intelligent Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GeEZDQAAQBAJ  |year=2017 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-00-822628-2 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups, however, are not closely related: in fact, they represent widely separated branches of the Bilateria, as shown on the [[phylogenetic tree]]; their lineages split hundreds of  millions of years ago. Other (less cephalized) phyla are not shown, for clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Kevin J. |last2=Cotton |first2=James A. |last3=Gehling |first3=James G. |last4=Pisani |first4=Davide |date=27 April 2008 |title=The Ediacaran emergence of bilaterians: congruence between the genetic and the geological fossil records |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/363/1496/1435 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences  |volume=363 |issue=1496 |pages=1435–1443 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2233 |pmid=18192191 |pmc=2614224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parfrey |first=Laura Wegener |last2=Lahr |first2=Daniel J.

====Arthropods====
{{further|Arthropod head problem}}

In [[arthropod]]s, cephalization progressed with increasing incorporation of trunk segments into the head region. This was advantageous because it allowed for the evolution of more effective mouth-parts for capturing and processing food. [[Insect]]s are strongly cephalized, their brain made of three fused [[ganglia]] attached to the ventral nerve cord, which in turn has a pair of ganglia in each segment of the thorax and abdomen. The insect head is an elaborate structure made of several segments fused rigidly together, and equipped with both simple and [[compound eye]]s, and multiple appendages including sensory [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and complex [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] (maxillae and mandibles).&lt;ref name="Cabej2013"/&gt;

[[Cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]s including [[octopus]], [[squid]], [[cuttlefish]] and [[nautilus]] are the most intelligent and highly cephalized invertebrates, with well-developed senses, including [[cephalopod eye|advanced 'camera' eyes]] and large brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tricarico |first1=E. |last2=Amodio |first2=P. |last3=Ponte |first3=G. |last4=Fiorito |first4=G. |year=2014 |chapter=Cognition and recognition in the cephalopod mollusc ''Octopus vulgaris'': coordinating interaction with environment and conspecifics |editor-last=Witzany|editor-first=G. |title=Biocommunication of Animals |publisher=Springer |pages=337–349 |isbn=978-94-007-7413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solomon |first1=Eldra|last2=Berg |first2=Linda |last3=Martin |first3=Diana W. |title=Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdQ8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA884 |year=2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=1-133-17032-3 |page=884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vertebrates====
{{further|Head}}
[[File:Vertebrate-brain-regions small.png|thumb|upright|[[Brain]]s of [[shark]] and [[human]] illustrate accelerating cephalization, as the parts enlarge and change shape.]]

Cephalization in [[vertebrate]]s, the group that includes [[mammals]], [[birds]], and [[fishes]], has been studied extensively.&lt;ref name="Cabej2013"/&gt; The heads of vertebrates are complex structures, with distinct sense organs; a large, multi-lobed brain; jaws, often with teeth; and a tongue. [[Cephalochordate]]s like ''[[Branchiostoma]]'' (the lancelet, a small fishlike animal with very little cephalization), are closely related to vertebrates but do not have these structures. In the 1980s, the [[new head hypothesis]] proposed that the vertebrate head is an evolutionary novelty resulting from the emergence of [[neural crest]] and cranial [[placode]]s (thickened areas of [[ectoderm]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gans, C. &amp; Northcutt, R. G. Neural crest and the origin of vertebrates: a new head. ''Science'' 220, 268–273 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diogo, R., et al. (2015). A new heart for a new head in vertebrate cardiopharyngeal evolution. ''Nature'', 520(7548), 466.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, a transient [[larva]] tissue of the lancelet was found to be virtually indistinguishable from the [[neural crest]]-derived [[cartilage]] which forms the vertebrate [[skull]], suggesting that persistence of this tissue and expansion into the entire head space could be a viable evolutionary route to formation of the vertebrate head.&lt;ref name="jandzik2014"&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1038/nature14000| title= Evolution of the new vertebrate head by co-option of an ancient chordate skeletal tissue| journal= Nature| date= 26 February 2015| last1= Jandzik | first1= D. | last2= Garnett | first2= A.

'''Comparative criminal justice''' is a subfield of the study of [[Criminal Justice]] that compares [[justice]] systems worldwide. Such study can take a descriptive, historical, or political approach.&lt;ref name="PLR"&gt;Philip L. Reichel. (2005). ''Comparative Criminal Justice Systems'' (4th Ed.). Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson. {{ISBN|0-13-113159-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It studies the similarities and differences in structure, goals, [[punishment]] and emphasis on rights as well as the history and political stature of different systems. It is common to broadly categorize the functions of a criminal justice system into policing, adjudication (i.e.: courts), and corrections, although other categorization schemes exist. Comparativists study the four different types of [[societies]], their methods of enforcement and their different types of punishment such as capital punishment, and imprisonment. Within these societies they study different types of legal tradition and analyze the issues they solve and create. They use their information in order to learn effective ways of enforcing laws, and to identify and solve problems that may arise within a system due to its methods.

==Societies==
[[File:Supreme Court.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Supreme Court]]
Comparativists in criminal justice study four different kinds of societies: Folk-communal, Urban-commercial, Urban-industrial, and bureaucratic.&lt;ref name="apsu"&gt;O'Connor, T. August 16, 2010 '''Comparative Criminal Justice''' ''Megalinks in Criminal Justice'' retrieved from http://www.drtomoconnor.com/3040/3040lect01a.htm accessed on July 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Folk-communal societies are often seen as primitive and barbaric, they have little specialization among [[law]] enforcers, and let many problems go unpunished to avoid over-criminalization however, once tempers “boil over” and the situation becomes a larger issue, harsh and unusual punishment may be administered. Examples are African or Middle Eastern Tribes, or early [[puritan]] settlements of America. Urban-commercial societies have few written laws and some specialized enforcement for religious or king’s law enforcement. Punishments are inconsistent and usually harsh. Urban-industrial societies enforce laws that prescribe good behavior and give incentives and disincentives for behavior and police are specialized in property crimes such as theft. Finally, bureaucratic societies are today’s modern society. They feature fully developed laws, lawyers, and police forces trained for multiple types of crime. Different “side effects” of these societies include over-criminalization, overcrowding, and even juvenile delinquency due to the extended age of adolescence these societies bring on.&lt;ref name="apsu" /&gt;

==Legal Traditions==
[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|left|thumb|A Map of the Legal systems of the World.]]
Legal traditions play an important role in the development of [[international law]] and justice. Comparativists for criminal justice study these traditions with the intent of finding a way to combine the views of different traditions towards a single view that allows for the successful development of international law.&lt;ref name="zar"&gt;Zartner Falstrom, Dana. "The Role of Legal Tradition in the Development of International Law: Conflict or Compromise" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Political Science Association, Hotel Intercontinental, New Orleans, LA, Jan 09, 2008 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-10-27 http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p212496_index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many comparativists believe that the more states with similar legal views the more likely it is to be able to create international laws that please all.
Reichel (2005) identifies four major legal traditions that each have their own respective body of laws:
*[[Common law]] is found particularly in countries that are current or former members of the [[British Empire]].
*[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] countries include most of continental Europe and various states in South America and Africa.
*[[Socialist law]] is essentially civil law with major modifications from [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. It is currently only used in China and a few other contemporary [[Communism|Communist]] states, but has had enormous influence on [[Russia]] and the former [[USSR]].
*[[Sharia|Islamic law]] is religiously-inspired law used in [[Islam|Muslim]] countries.

==Punishment==
[[File:Death Penalty World Map.svg|right|thumb|Map of death penalty]]

People who study comparative criminal justice study different forms and use of punishment across societies, including [[capital punishment]]. Fifty-nine countries retain the death penalty as reported in 2007.&lt;ref name="over"&gt;Overview of the Death Penalty Worldwide as of 2008. http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt; Comparativists study the different ways in which execution is carried out across the world including hanging, shooting, beheading, injection, electrocution, and even stoning.&lt;ref name="over" /&gt; Comparativists find that in many developing countries such as Iran, Indonesia, Belarus, and many others, that violent methods of execution such as hanging beheading, shooting, and stoning are much more common ways of carrying out the death penalty, and in many cases the only ways. However in western culture as well as developed countries such as the United States less brutal execution such as lethal injection is utilized.&lt;ref name="over" /&gt; Even prison sentences can come harshly.  In many countries such as Burma a person can be sentenced to prison for merely disagreeing with the government.&lt;ref name="top"&gt;Top 10 Longest Prison Sentences in the World. Avery, L. May 2008. accessed on 28 October 2009 at {{cite web |url=http://www.listsergeant.com/site/index.php/content/article/top_10_longest_prison_sentences_in_the_world/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105161325/http://www.listsergeant.com/site/index.php/content/article/top_10_longest_prison_sentences_in_the_world |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably ridiculous sentences such as multiple life sentences or sentences of hundreds, even thousands of years are meant to prohibit the chance of parole in the future.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt; Although it may seem preposterous, western cultures carry out the same type of sentencing.
Even though similar sentences are used across the globe leniency is varied widely between societies. Many governments such as the one mentioned above in Burma provide swift and heavy punishment to assert their roles of power.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt;

'''Computation''' is any type of [[calculation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computation Computation] from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computation: Definition and Synonyms from Answers.com|url=http://www.answers.com:80/topic/computation|website=Answers.com|accessdate=26 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222005439/http://www.answers.com/topic/computation|archivedate=22 February 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and follows a well-defined [[Model (abstract)|model]], for example an [[algorithm]].

The study of computation is paramount to the discipline of [[computer science]].

== Physical phenomenon ==
A computation can be seen as a purely physical phenomenon occurring inside a closed [[physical system]] called a [[computer]].
Examples of such physical systems include [[digital computer]]s, [[mechanical computer]]s, [[quantum computer]]s, [[DNA computer]]s, [[molecular computer]]s, microfluidics-based computers, [[analog computer]]s, or [[wetware computer]]s.
This point of view has been adopted by the [[physics of computation]], a branch of theoretical physics, as well as the field of [[natural computing]].

An even more radical point of view, [[pancomputationalism]], is the postulate of [[digital physics]] that argues that the evolution of the universe is itself a computation.

=== The mapping account ===
The classic account of computation is found throughout the works of [[Hilary Putnam]] and others.  [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] has dubbed this the "simple mapping account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Godfrey-Smith | first = P. |  year = 2009| title = Triviality Arguments against Functionalism | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 145 | issue = 2 | pages = 273–95 | doi=10.1007/s11098-008-9231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gualtiero Piccinini | Gualtiero Piccinini's]] summary of this account states that a physical system can be said to perform a specific computation when there is a mapping between the state of that system to the computation such that the “microphysical states [of the system] mirror the state transitions between the computational states.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 17 | isbn = 9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The semantic account ===
Philosophers such as [[Jerry Fodor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fodor | first = J. A. | year = 1981 | title = The Mind-Body Problem | journal = Scientific American | volume = 244 | issue = January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested various accounts of computation with the restriction that [[semantics |semantic]] content be a necessary condition for computation (that is, what differentiates an arbitrary physical system from a computing system is that the operands of the computation represent something).  This notion attempts to prevent the logical abstraction of the mapping account of [[digital physics#Pancomputationalism_or_the_computational_universe_theory|pancomputationalism]], the idea that everything can be said to be computing everything.

=== The mechanistic account ===
[[Gualtiero Piccinini]] proposes an account of computation based in [[mechanical philosophy]].  It states that physical computing systems are types of mechanisms that, by design, perform physical computation, or “the manipulation (by a functional mechanism) of a medium-independent vehicle according to a rule.”  Medium-independence requires that the property is able to be instantiated by multiple realizers and multiple mechanisms and that the inputs and outputs of the mechanism also be [[Multiple realizability| multiply realizable]].  In short, medium-independence allows for the use of physical variables with traits other than voltage (as in typical digital computers); this is imperative in considering other types of computation, such as that occurs in the [[brain]] or in a [[quantum computer]].  A rule, in this sense, provides a mapping among inputs, outputs, and internal states of the physical computing system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 10 | isbn = 9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical models ==
In the [[theory of computation]], a diversity of mathematical models of computers has been developed.
Typical mathematical [[Model of computation|models of computers]] are the following:
* State models including [[Turing machine]], [[pushdown automaton]], [[finite state automaton]], and [[Parallel random access machine|PRAM]]
* Functional models including [[lambda calculus]]
* Logical models including [[logic programming]]
* Concurrent models including [[actor model]] and [[process calculi]]
Giunti calls the models studied by computation theory ''computational systems,'' and he argues that all of them are mathematical [[dynamical system]]s with discrete time and discrete state space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Giunti | first = Marco | title = Computation, Dynamics, and Cognition | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-19-509009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch.1}} He maintains that a computational system is a complex object which consists  of  three  parts.  First,  a  mathematical dynamical systems &lt;math&gt;DS&lt;/math&gt; with discrete time and discrete state space; second, a computational setup &lt;math&gt;H = \left(F, B_F\right)&lt;/math&gt;, which is made up of a theoretical part &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and a real part &lt;math&gt;B_F&lt;/math&gt;; third, an  interpretation &lt;math&gt;I_{DS,H}&lt;/math&gt;, which  links  the dynamical system &lt;math&gt;DS&lt;/math&gt; with the setup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Giunti | first = Marco |  year = 2017 | title = What is a Physical Realization of a Computational System? | journal = Isonomia -- Epistemologica  | volume = 9 | pages = 177-92 | ISSN = 2037-4348 | URL = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319631506_What_is_a_Physical_Realization_of_a_Computational_System}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.179–80}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">'''Cutan''' is one of two [[biopolymer]]s which occur in the [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] of some plants. The other and better-known polymer is [[cutin]]. Cutan is believed to be a [[hydrocarbon]] polymer, whereas cutin is a [[polyester]], but the structure and synthesis of cutan are not yet fully understood. Cutan is not present in as many plants as once thought; for instance it is absent in ''[[Ginkgo]]''.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999&gt;{{Cite journal

Cutan was first detected as a non-[[saponification|saponifiable]] component, resistant to de-[[esterification]] by [[alkaline hydrolysis]], that increases in amount in cuticles of some species such as ''[[Clivia miniata]]'' as they reach maturity, apparently replacing the cutin secreted in the early stages of cuticle development (Schmidt and Schönherr, 1982). Evidence that cutan is a hydrocarbon polymer comes from the fact that its flash [[pyrolysis]] products are a characteristic [[homologous series]] of paired [[alkane]]s and [[alkene]]s (Nip ''et al.'' 1986)

Its preservation potential is much greater than that of cutin.&lt;ref name="Briggs1999"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16846">[[File:Blooddraw.jpg|thumb|'''Cytometers''' are the instruments which count the blood cells in the common blood test.]]

'''Cytometry''' is the [[measurement]] of the characteristics of [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Variables that can be measured by cytometric methods include [[cell size]], [[cell counting|cell count]], cell morphology (shape and structure), [[cell cycle]] phase, [[DNA]] content, and the existence or absence of specific [[protein]]s on the cell surface or in the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://isac-net.org/ISAC-Cytometry/What-is-Cytometry.aspx | title=International Society for Advancement of Cytometry | accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cytometry is used to characterize and count [[blood cell]]s in common [[blood test]]s such as the [[complete blood count]]. In a similar fashion, cytometry is also used in cell biology research and in medical diagnostics to characterize cells in a wide range of applications associated with diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]].

==Cytometric devices==

===Image cytometers===
Image cytometry is the oldest form of cytometry. Image cytometers operate by statically imaging a large number of
cells using [[optical microscopy]]. Prior to analysis, cells are commonly stained to enhance contrast or 
to detect specific molecules by labeling these with [[fluorochrome]]s. Traditionally,
cells are viewed within a [[hemocytometer]] to aid manual counting.

Since the introduction of the [[digital camera]], in the mid-1990s, the automation level of
image cytometers has steadily increased. This has led to the commercial availability of automated image cytometers, ranging from simple cell counters to sophisticated [[high-content screening]] systems.

===Flow cytometers===
{{main|Flow cytometry}}
Due to the early difficulties of automating microscopy, the [[flow cytometry|flow cytometer]] has since
the mid-1950s been the dominating cytometric device.&lt;ref name="crosland"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| doi = 10.1038/171037b0 
| last1 = Crosland-Taylor | first1 = P. J. 
| title = A device for counting small particles suspended in a fluid through a tube 
| journal = Nature 
| volume = 171 
| issue = 4340 
| pages = 37–38 
| year = 1953 
| pmid = 13025472
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flow cytometers operate by aligning single cells using flow techniques. The cells are characterized
optically or by the use of an [[electrical impedance]] method called the [[Coulter principle]].
To detect specific molecules when optically characterized, cells are in most cases stained with the same
type of fluorochromes that are used by image cytometers. Flow cytometers generally provide
less data than image cytometers, but have a significantly higher throughput.

===Cell sorters===
{{main|Flow cytometry}}
Cell sorters are flow cytometers capable of sorting cells according to their characteristics.
The sorting is achieved by using technology similar to what is used in [[inkjet printing|inkjet printers]].
The fluid stream is broken up into droplets by a mechanical vibration.
The droplets are then electrically charged according to the characteristics of the cell contained
within the droplet. Depending on their charge, the droplets are finally deflected by an electric field into
different containers.

===Time-lapse cytometers===
[[File:HoloMonitor M4 in Cell Incubator.jpg|thumb| The [http://www.phiab.se/products/holomonitor HoloMonitor M4 '''time-lapse cytometer''']
from [http://www.phiab.se Phase Holographic Imaging] shown inside a cell culture incubator.]]

Conventional flow and image cytometers have the disadvantage of not being able to
observe cells over time.&lt;ref name="shapiro"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Shapiro H. | title=The Evolution of Cytometers | journal=Cytometry Part A| volume=58A | issue=1 | pages=13–20 | year=2004 | doi=10.1002/cyto.a.10111| pmid=14994215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid decrease in the cost of
digitally storing and processing video information has led to the development of
image cytometers which monitor cultured cells using [[time-lapse microscopy|time-lapse]] video recordings.

A key characteristic of time-lapse cytometers is their use of non heat-generating light sources such as [[light-emitting diode]]s.
This allows a time-lapse cytometer to be placed inside a conventional [[cell incubator|cell culture incubator]]
to facilitate continuous observation of cellular processes without heat building up inside the incubator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.phiab.se/products/holomonitor | title=Time-lapse Imaging Cytometers &amp; Cell Incubator Microscopes| publisher=Phase Holographic Imaging AB | accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Hemocytometer with gloved hand.JPG|thumb|left|A '''hemocytometer''']]

===Hemocytometer===
{{main|hemocytometer}}
The early history of cytometry is closely associated with the development of the blood cell counting.
Through the work of [[Karl von Vierordt]], [[Louis-Charles Malassez]], [[Karl Bürker]] and others blood cell
concentration could by the late 19th century be accurately measured using a blood cell counting chamber,
the [[hemocytometer]], and an [[optical microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Verso | first=M. L. | title=The Evolution of Blood-Counting Techniques| journal=Med. Hist. | volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=149–158 | year=1964 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300029392 | pmid=14139094 | pmc=1033366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Verso | first=M. L. | title=Some nineteenth-century pioneers of haematology |

Until the 1950s the hemocytometer was the standard method to count blood cells.&lt;ref name="Coulter"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/wsr/research-and-discovery/products-and-services/flow-cytometry/history-of-flow-cytometry/index.htm| title=The History of Flow Cytometry | publisher=Beckman-Coulter Inc. | accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In blood cell counting applications the hemocytometer has now been replaced by [[electronic cell counters]].
However, the hemocytometer is still being used to count cells in cell culture laboratories.
Successively the manual task of counting, using a microscope, is taken over by small automated image cytometers.

===Fluorescence microscope===
{{main|fluorescence microscope}}
In 1904, [[Moritz von Rohr]] and [[August Köhler]] at [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]] in Jena constructed the first ultraviolet microscope.
The intent of the microscope was to obtain higher optical resolution by using illumination with a shorter wavelength than visual light.
However, they experienced difficulties with [[autofluorescence]] when observing biological material. Fortunately,
Köhler saw the potential of fluorescence.
A filtering technique for fluorescence excitation light was developed by
[[Heinrich Lehmann]] at Zeiss in 1910, based on work by
[[Robert W. Wood|Robert Wood]]. However, the "Lumineszenzmikroskop" he developed was only second on the market, after the one independently developed by [[Oskar Heimstädt]] who worked at C Reichert, Optische Werke AG in Vienna, which today is a part of [[Leica Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rusk | first=N.| url=http://www.nature.com/milestones/milelight/full/milelight04.html | title=The fluorescence microscope| work=Milestones in Light Microscopy | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Heimstädt O.|title=Das Fluoreszenzmikroskop | journal=Z. Wiss. Mikrosk.| volume=28 | pages=330–337 | year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Rost| first=F. W. D.| title=Fluorescent microscopy, volume II | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1995 | pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cytophotometry===
By the early 1930s various firms manufactured ultraviolet fluorescent microscopes. The stage was
set for cytometry to now go beyond the now established hemocytometer. At this time, [[Torbjörn Caspersson]],
working at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, developed a series of progressively more sophisticated
instruments called ''cytophotometers''. These instruments combined a fluorescent microscope with a [[spectrophotometer]]
to quantify cellular nucleic acids and their relation to cell growth and function. Caspersson’s early
apparatus now seems hopelessly primitive. But, even this primitive apparatus got results, and attracted
the attention of other researchers. Many of the advances in analytical cytology from the 1940s and on-wards
were made by people who made the pilgrimage to Stockholm.&lt;ref name="shapiro" /&gt;

===Pulse cytophotometry===
[[File:Model A COULTER COUNTER from Advertisement.jpg|thumb|'''Model A [[Coulter counter|Coulter Counter]]''' &amp;mdash; The first commercial flow cytometer]]

The first attempts to automate cell counting were made around World War II.
Gucker et al. builds a device to detect bacteria in aerosols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gucker | first1=F. T. | last2=O’Konski | first2= C. T. | last3=Pickard | first3=H.

in aligning cells to be individually counted using microscopy, as Moldavan had proposed in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Joseph and [[Wallace H. Coulter|Wallace Coulter]] circumnavigates these difficulties by inventing the principle
of using electrical impedance to count and size microscopic particles suspended in a fluid.&lt;ref name="Coulter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| inventor=Coulter W. H. | title=Means for Counting Particles Suspended in a Fluid. | country=U.S.| number=2656508 | status=patent | fdate=1949-08-27 | gdate=1953-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is today
known as the [[Coulter principle]] and was used in the automated blood cell counter released by [[Beckman Coulter|Coulter Electronics]]
in 1954. The “[[Coulter counter]]” was the first commercial flow cytometer.

During the 1960s Dittrich, Göhde and Kamentsky improves the design pioneered by Caspersson 30 years earlier.
Dittrich and Göhde’s ''pulse cytophotometer'' was built around a Zeiss fluorescent microscope and commercialized
as the ICP&amp;nbsp;11 by [http://www.partec.com Partec GmbH] in 1968.
Kamentsky’s device was commercialized by Bio/Physics Systems Inc. as the Cytograph in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These devices were able to count cells, like the earlier Coulter counter. But more importantly, they were also capable of measuring cellular characteristics.
However, these early cytophotometers where microscopy-based.&lt;ref name="Kamentsky"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Flow cytometry ===
{{Main|Flow cytometry}}In 1953 Crosland-Taylor published an unsuccessful attempt to count red blood cells using microscopy in which he solved the problem of aligning cells by using [[sheath fluid]] to [[Hydrodynamic focusing|hydrodynamically focus]] the cells.&lt;ref name="crosland" /&gt; In the late 1960s, Van Dilla at Los Alamos National Laboratory built the first non microscopy-based cytophotometer.

In 1978, at the Conference of the American Engineering Foundation in Pensacola, Florida, the name ''pulse cytophotometry''
was changed to ''flow cytometry'', a term which quickly became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.partec.com/company/flow-museum.html | title=Partec Flow Museum| publisher=Partec GmbH | accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point pulse cytophotometry had evolved
into the modern form of flow cytometry, pioneered by Van Dilla ten years earlier.

The '''Dextroscope''' is a [[Virtual Reality]] (VR) environment designed to provide medical professionals with deeper understanding of a patient's complex 3D anatomical relationships and pathology. Although its main intended purpose is to enable surgeons to plan a surgical procedure (in particular, neurosurgery&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;), it has also proven useful in research in cardiology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jcmr-online.com/content/12/S1/O14|title = MRI and CT Tracking of Mesenchymal Stem Cells with Novel Perfluorinated Alginate Microcapsules|last = Fu|first = Yingli|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance|doi = 10.1186/1532-429X-12-S1-O14|pmid = |access-date =|volume=12|pages=O14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of immersing the whole user into a virtual reality, it just immersed the hands of the neurosurgeon into the patient data. The Dextroscope started as a research project in the mid-90s with the name The Virtual Workbench&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  and started commercialization in 2000 with the incorporation of the company [[Volume Interactions Pte Ltd]]. 

The Dextroscope allows its user to interact intuitively with a [[Virtual Patient]]. The Virtual Patient is composed of computer-generated 3D multi-modal images obtained from any [[DICOM]] tomographic data including [[Computer to|CT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MRA]], [[Magnetic resonance venography|MRV]], functional MRI and [[Computer Tomography angiography|CTA]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography|SPECT]] and [[Tractography]]. It can work with any multi-modality combination, supporting polygonal meshes as well.

The user sits at the Dextroscope 3D interaction console and manipulates the Virtual Patient using both hands in a similar manner to how one would manipulate a real object. Using stereoscopic visualisations displayed via a mirror, the Dextroscope user sees the Virtual Patient floating behind the mirror but within easy reach of the hands and uses flexible 3D hand movements to rotate and manipulate the object of interest. The Dextroscope allows virtual segmentation of organs and structures, making accurate 3D measurements, etc.
[[File:Dextroscope MK10.jpg|thumb|The Dextroscope.]]
In one hand the user holds an ergonomically shaped handle with a switch that, when pressed, allows the 3D image to be moved freely as if it were an object held in real space. The other hand holds a pencil shaped stylus that is used to select tools from a virtual control panel and perform detailed manipulations and operations on the 3D image. The user does not see the stylus, handle or his/her hands directly, as they are hidden behind the surface of the mirror. Instead he/she sees a virtual handle and stylus calibrated to appear in exactly the same position as the real handle and stylus. The business end of the virtual handle can be selected to be anything that the software can create - drill tool, measurement tool, cutter, etc. Experience has shown that it is unnecessary to model the user's hands, provided that he/she can see and feel the real tools and that these perceptions match the virtual scene. This is highly advantageous since the hands would otherwise clutter the workspace and obscure the view of the object of interest.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Poston, T., Serra, L., 1996. ''Dextrous Virtual Work. Commun. ACM'' 39, 37–45. doi:10.1145/229459.229464
&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the uses of the Dextroscope is to allow surgeons to interact with and manipulate the Virtual Patient and plan the ideal surgical trajectory - for example, by simulating inter-operative viewpoints or the removal of bone and soft tissue. Apart from being much faster to work this way than using a mouse and keyboard, this approach also provides the medical professional, typically a surgeon, with a greater degree of control over the 3D image - with the hands literally being able to reach inside to manipulate the image interior.

== Manipulating the Virtual Patient – Virtual Reality Toolsets ==

The Dextroscope provides an extensive set of virtual tools that can be used to manipulate the 3D image. For example, there are dedicated tools to perform data segmentation to extract surgically relevant structures like the cortex or a tumor
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chia | first1 = W.K. | last2 = Serra | first2 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Contouring in 2D while viewing stereoscopic 3D volumes | url = | journal = Stud Health Technol Inform | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 93–95 | pmid = 16404022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extract blood vessels,&lt;ref&gt;Serra, L., Hern, N., Choon, C.B., Poston, T., 1997. Interactive vessel tracing in volume data, in: Proceedings of the 1997 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics, I3D ’97. ACM, New York, NY, USA, p. 131–ff. {{DOI|10.1145/253284.253320}}&lt;/ref&gt; adjust the color and transparency of displayed structures to see deep inside the patient and even simulate some surgical procedures – such as the removal of bone using a simulated skull drilling tool.

Typical structures that can be segmented are tumors, blood vessels, aneurysms, parts of the skull base, and organs. Segmentation is done either automatically (when the structures are demarcated clearly by their outstanding image intensity - such as the cortex) or through user interaction (using for example an outlining tool to define the extent of the structure manually). A virtual ‘pick’ tool allows the user to pick a segmented object and uncouple it from its surroundings for closer inspection. A measurement tool provides accurate measurement of straight and curving 3D structures such as the scalp, and measure angles, such as those between vessels or bony structures (for example, when planning the insertion of a screw into the spine).

== Dextroscope and Diagnostic Imaging ==

Dextroscope is not just for surgeons - radiologists can benefit from it too. The rapid growth in multi-modal diagnostic imaging data routinely available has increased their workload tremendously. Using the Dextroscope, radiologists can reconstruct multimodal models from high volumes of 2D slices – hence facilitating a better understanding of the 3D anatomical structures and helping with the diagnosis.

Furthermore, the Dextroscope virtual reality environment helps bridge the gap between radiology and surgery - by allowing the radiologist to easily demonstrate to surgeons important 3D structures in a way that surgeons are familiar with.&lt;br /&gt; This demonstration capability makes it also useful as a base for medical educators in which to convey 3D information to students.&lt;ref&gt;Haase, J., 2010.

'''Economics of the arts and literature'''  or '''cultural economics''' (used below for convenience) is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation, distribution, and the consumption of [[work of art|works of art]], literature and similar creative and/or cultural products.   For a long time, the concept of the "arts" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of [[cultural industry]] (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings).  The field is coded as [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|JEL: Z11]] in the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|classification system]] used for article searches.&lt;ref&gt;In the JEL system, '[[Cultural economics|Cultural Economics]]' is a [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|broader category]] than used in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Alejandro Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Painter Alejandro Plaza at work on a canvas. Once this painting is complete, it will be a unique good, for which there is no exact substitute]]
Cultural economics is concerned with the arts in a broad sense. The goods considered have creative content, but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good. Designer goods such as clothes and drapes are not considered usually to be works of art or culture. Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics. (For further considerations, see also [[Cultural Institutions Studies]]). Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia, including pollution, corruption and education.

Works of art and culture have a specific quality, which is their uniqueness. While other economic goods, such as [[crude oil]] or [[wheat]] are generic, interchangeable commodities (given a specific grade of the product), there is only one example of a famous painting such as the [[Mona Lisa]], and only one example of Rodin's well-known sculpture "[[The Thinker]]". While copies or reproductions can be made of these works of art, and while many inexpensive posters of the Mona Lisa and small factory-made replicas of "The Thinker" are sold, neither full-size copies nor inexpensive reproductions are viewed as substitutes for the real artworks, in the way that a consumer views a pound of Grade A sugar from Cuba as a fully equivalent substitute for a pound of Grade A sugar from United States or Dominican Republic.  As there is no equivalent item or substitute for these famous works of art, classical economist [[Adam Smith]] held it was impossible to value them. [[Alfred Marshall]] noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption: The more you have listened to a particular kind of music, the more you appreciate. In his economic framework, these goods do not have the usual decreasing [[marginal utility]].

Key academic works in cultural economics include those of [[William Baumol|Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen|Bowen]] (Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma, 1966), of [[Gary Becker]] on addictive goods, and of [[Alan Peacock]] (public choice). This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts, on the market of individual pieces of art, the art market in cultural industries, the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector.

== Performing arts: Baumol and cultural economics ==
[[File:Lux Video Theatre rehearsal 1951.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture shows actors rehearsing for a play in 1951. Despite the numerous technological advances in between 1951 and the 2010s, in the 2010s, it would still require the same number of actors to perform this play. For this reason, scholars argue that some cultural industries are not getting more efficient the way other industries, such as accounting and banking, are; these latter two industries require far fewer workers in the 2010s due to the development of computer programs.]]
The seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term [[Baumol's cost disease|cost disease]] for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the [[Molière]] play "[[Tartuffe]]" in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger. In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger. In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in [[human capital]] (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.

There are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts:

*The first concentrates on the existence of productivity growth in some areas of production, thus contradicting the relevance of cost disease. Staying with the "Tartuffe" example, the same performance can be viewed by an ever-larger audience by improvements in the design of theatres, and by the introduction of microphones, television and recording.
*The second is concerned with the allocation of subsidies to the cultural sector. While these should be in the general public interest, they may have an income distribution effect, e.g. if they reduce cost to the relatively well-off part of society. This is the case when the well-off are overrepresented in the audiences of subsidized plays, or when subsidies go to a small elitist group of artists.

== Market for artworks ==
Two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished: works of art that are familiar and have a history, and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries. Both markets, however, are [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]], i.e., there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers ([[oligopsony]]). Two central questions on the working of the markets are: How are prices determined, and what is the [[rate of return|return]] on artworks, compared to the return on financial assets?

=== Price determination ===
Components of a work of art, like raw stone, tubes of paint or unpainted canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an "artistic capital". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the oligopolistic market structure).
Three kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.

=== Art market and investment ===
[[File:Asrlar Sadosi2012b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fine art such as paintings are typically sold at [[auction]]s.]]
Some major financial institutions, banks and insurance companies, have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s. These rates have not slowed down at the same time as the rates on [[stock exchange]]s, in the early 90's. This may indicate a [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] opportunity. Apart from this evidence of successful investment, the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market. Many works are sold on [[auction]]s. These transactions are thus very transparent. This has made it possible to establish price databases, with prices of some items going back to 1652. Empirical studies have shown that, on average, the [[rate of return|return]] on works of art has been lower than that on [[stock|equity]], with a [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] that is at least as high. An [[intangible asset|intangible]] gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly. However, before interpreting the figures, it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes. In 1986, Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0.55 percent for works of art, against a rate of return of 2.5 percent for financial assets, over a 20-year period.

== Cultural industries ==
Some famous artworks such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' painting are not reproducible (at least in the sense of creating another copy that would be seen as equivalent in value), but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on a single, individual copy. Books, recordings, movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original. These are the products of major cultural industries, which are the book industry, the music industry and the film industry. These markets are characterized by:
* '''Uncertainty of value'''. The demand for a good (market success) is hard to predict. For example, with movies, even if a film's plot, themes and selection of actors has been extensively tested using focus groups and polls, and even if the movie uses popular [[A-list]] actors, this film may still be a [[box office bomb]] (e.g., ''[[Gigli]]'', a 2003 American romantic comedy starring [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]). On the other hand, a low-budget film by an unknown director and an unknown cast, such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' can surprise the industry by being a major hit. This uncertainty is a characteristic of an [[experience good]] such as films, TV shows, musical theatre shows and music concerts.
* '''Infinite variety'''. You can differentiate between regular consumer products, e.g. cars, on basis of its characteristics. For example, a hatchback can be purchased from a number of manufacturers with a set list of options (e.g., automatic transmission, standard transmission, convertible, etc.), with the different options requiring different charges. Many general products allow classification on a relatively small number of such characteristics. Cultural goods, however, have a very high number of characteristics, which, on top of that, often are subjective. For example, an early 1990s band with loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] could be considered to be [[grunge]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music]] or [[alternative rock]] by different [[music critic]]s.  This makes cultural products hard to compare.
* '''High concentration in the products which are traded or sold'''. A major part of sales of cultural goods is in a very small number of [[bestseller]]s (e.g., with books), [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s (movies) or hit [[Single (music)|single]]s (pop music).
* '''Short [[product life cycle management|life cycle]]'''. Most cultural items are sold/traded shortly after their introduction or production. Some cultural goods, such as broadcast news, have little or no market value shortly after the broadcast. Of course, some cultural products may retain saleability for years or even decades, as with the small number of films that become [[cult movie]]s (e.g., ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'') or certain classic novels or albums that have enduring appeal (the "[[back catalogue]]" of a record label).
* '''High [[fixed cost]]s'''. There is high cost before introduction of a new artwork or cultural product. Making a movie can cost millions of dollars; however the marginal cost of making an additional copy of the DVD may cost less than a dollar.

=== Market structure ===
The important cultural industries tend to have an [[oligopolistic]] [[market structure]]. The market is dominated by a few major companies, with the rest of the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as "gatekeepers" for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from [[synergy]] and [[market power]] have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.

== Economics of cultural heritage ==
[[Cultural heritage]] is reflected in goods and real estate. Management and [[regulatory economics|regulation]] of museums has come under study in this area.

=== Museums ===
[[File:The Otsuka Museum of Art20s3200.jpg|thumb|right200px|The [[Otsuka Museum of Art]] in Japan.]]
Museums, which have a conservatory role, and provide exhibitions to the general public, can be commercial, or on a non-profit base. In the second case, as they provide a [[public good]], they pose the problems related to these goods: should they be self-financing, or be subsidized ? One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums, and their budgets. Also, they are often located in places (city centres) where the cost of land is high, which limits their expansion possibilities. American museums exhibit only about half of their collection. Some museums in Europe, like the Pompidou Centre in France, show less than 5 percent of their collection. Apart from providing exhibitions, museums get proceeds from derived products, like catalogues and reproductions. They also produce at a more intangible level: They make collections. Out of so many pieces in the public domain, they make a selection based on their expertise, thus adding value to the mere existence of the items.

The dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice. On the one hand the museum has, for conservation reasons, an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible, and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience, to promote knowledge and research. On the other hand, the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures, to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience. When a government has made a choice about this, application of economic [[contract theory]] will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers (on the financial, conservatory side) to obtain the required result.

=== Real estate and buildings  ===
[[File:Wr Neustaedter Dom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In many countries, historic buildings such as cathedrals are considered to be "heritage buildings" and as such they are protected against demolition or substantial modifications.]]
Many countries have systems that protect historically significant buildings and structures. These are buildings or other structures that are deemed to have cultural importance or which are deemed to have heritage value. Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration, in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access. Buildings that are often classified as heritage buildings include former or current Parliament buildings, cathedrals, courthouses, houses built in a recognized historical style, and even fairly regular houses, if the house was formerly the home of a famous [[politician]], [[artist]] or inventor. Buildings with heritage status cannot typically be demolished. Depending on the nature of the heritage restrictions, the current owner may or may not be allowed to modify the outside or inside of the building. Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do. There has been little study of this issue.

== Artists' labour market ==
The [[labour market]] for artists is characterized by:
* There is an '''extremely unequal [[income distribution]]''' within the market segment. A very small group of artists earn a high proportion of the total income, while the average income is low.
* There is a '''structural excess supply of labour'''. There are always more people who would like to earn their income as an artist than there is demand for artists and artworks. For example, there are far more young [[indie rock]] bands aspiring to careers in music than there are available paid contracts in the recording industry. Due to this excess supply of labour, a [[nightclub]] owner has so many local young bands requesting to play at her venue that she can offer them little or no payment for their performance.
* There are '''intangible returns to labour''', also called "nonpecuniary benefits" (this means non-financial, non-wage benefits). For example, a musician is able to spend her days creating beautiful music and working with other creative people, which is very satisfying. Due to these intangible returns, artists are often willing to accept lower wages than their qualifications would earn in a different market. For example, working with a famous musician may provide such great intangible benefits (e.g., it is exciting to meet and work with such a well-known performer) that a [[record producer]] may be able to ask musicians to record with the start musician for little or no payment.
* '''Non-separation of artist and work'''. While some workers in the cultural industries do not make a strong connection between their work tasks and their self-identity, for some types of artists, such as painters, sculptors and filmmakers, the image their artwork or creative output gives them is important to artists' sense of self. Whether this phenomenon occurs depends on a number of factors, such as the type of artistic job and individuals' perceptions. In the 2010s, many famous [[film director]]s view the movies they direct as directly identified with their artistic vision. However, an assistant director leading scenes in [[action film]]s may see him or herself as a worker in a cultural industry, and he/she may not feel artistically identified with the film's he/she works on.

=== Star system ===
[[File:Evan Rachel Wood (April 2009) 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sherwin Rosen]] states that top stars have such high earnings because their movies sell more copies.]]
The term [[superstar (celebrity)|"star system"]], coined by [[Sherwin Rosen]], is used to explain why a very small number of the artists and creators in the market, such as the celebrity [[A-list]] actors and top [[pop singer]]s, earn most of the total earnings in a sector. Rosen's 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.” Rosen argues that in superstar markets, "small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue." Rosen points out that "...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices".

In cultural industries, the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a key role in this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting tables. A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling [[DJ]] spends most of her time onstage on [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]]s, which for some people is a desirable outcome.

=== Production structure ===
[[File:Set design by Philippe Chaperon for Act4 sc2 of Aida by Verdi 1880 Paris.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A painter who does canvases that hang in major museums and a professional set painter for opera or theatre are both skilled painters who do painting for a living. However, the former is more likely to view her/his paintings as part of her artistic expression and identity, whereas the latter is more likely to view her/himself as a craftsperson.]]

A case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods . (See [[Cultural Institutions Studies]].) An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself, while the ordinary craftsperson is only concerned with his product, as far as it affects his/her pay or salary. For example, a painter who creates artworks that are displayed in museums may view her paintings as her artistic expression. On the other hand, a scene painter for a music theatre company may see herself as a craftsperson who is paid by the hour for doing painting. The artist may thus want restrict the use of his or her product, and he/she may object if a museum uses a reproduction of his/her painting to help sell cars or liquor. On the other hand, the scene painter may not object to commercial re-uses of her set painting, as she/he may see it just as a regular job.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17006">An '''Explainable AI''' ('''XAI''') or '''Transparent AI''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) whose actions can be easily understood by humans. It contrasts with the concept of the "[[black box]]" in machine learning, meaning the "interpretability" of the workings of complex algorithms, where even their designers cannot explain why the AI arrived at a specific decision.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=Computer says no: why making AIs fair, accountable and transparent is crucial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/05/computer-says-no-why-making-ais-fair-accountable-and-transparent-is-crucial|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=the Guardian |date=5 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; XAI can be used to implement a social [[right to explanation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=2017|title=Slave to the Algorithm?

The technical challenge of explaining AI decisions is sometimes known as the '''interpretability problem'''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite news|title=How AI detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=5 July 2017|language=en}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another consideration is ''info-besity'' (overload of information), thus, ''full transparency'' may not be always possible or even required. The amount of information presented should vary based on the stakeholder interacting with the intelligent system &lt;ref name="ConnectionScience"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theodorou|first=Andreas|last2=Wortham|first2=Robert R.|last3=Bryson|first3=Joanna J.|date=2017|title=Designing and implementing transparency for real time inspection of autonomous robots|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540091.2017.1310182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically-specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command, "maximize accuracy of [[sentiment analysis|assessing how positive]] film reviews are in the test dataset". The AI may learn useful general rules from the testset, such as "reviews containing the word 'horrible'" are likely to be negative". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as "reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the test set, or if people consider the rule to be "cheating" or "unfair". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

== Goals ==
AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks that do an optimal job of satisfying explicit pre-programmed goals on the training data, but that do not reflect the complicated implicit desires of the human system designers. For example, a 2017 system tasked with image recognition learned to "cheat" by looking for a copyright tag that happened to be associated with horse pictures, rather than learning how to tell if a horse was actually pictured.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In another 2017 system, a [[supervised learning]] AI tasked with grasping items in a virtual world learned to cheat by placing its manipulator between the object and the viewer in a way such that it falsely appeared to be grasping the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DeepMind Has Simple Tests That Might Prevent Elon Musk’s AI Apocalypse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=11 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Learning from Human Preferences|url=https://blog.openai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=OpenAI Blog|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One transparency project, the [[DARPA]] XAI program, aims to produce "glass box" models that are explainable to a "human-in-the-loop", without greatly sacrificing AI performance. Human users should be able to understand the AI's cognition (both in real-time and after the fact), and should be able to determine when to trust the AI and when the AI should be distrusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence|website=DARPA|publisher=DARPA|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Holzinger|first=Andreas|last2=Plass|first2=Markus|last3=Holzinger|first3=Katharina|last4=Crisan|first4=Gloria Cerasela|last5=Pintea|first5=Camelia-M.|last6=Palade|first6=Vasile|date=2017-08-03|title=A glass-box interactive machine learning approach for solving NP-hard problems with the human-in-the-loop|eprint=1708.01104|class=cs.AI}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History and methods ==
[[Mycin]], a research prototype that could explain which of its hand-coded rules contributed to a diagnosis in a specific case, was developed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Lent, M., Fisher, W., &amp; Mancuso, M. (2004, July). An explainable artificial intelligence system for small-unit tactical behavior. In Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (pp. 900-907). Menlo Park, CA; Cambridge, MA; London; AAAI Press; MIT Press; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, L. M., Shortliffe, E. H., &amp; Buchanan, B. G. (1980). Computer-based medical decision making: from MYCIN to VM. Automedica, 3(2), 97-108.&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1990s researchers also began studying whether it is possible to meaningfully extract the non-hand-coded rules being generated by opaque trained neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tickle|first=A. B.|last2=Andrews|first2=R.|last3=Golea|first3=M.|last4=Diederich|first4=J.|date=November 1998|title=The truth will come to light: directions and challenges in extracting the knowledge embedded within trained artificial neural networks|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/728352/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1057–1068|doi=10.1109/72.728352|issn=1045-9227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in clinical expert systems creating neural network-powered decision support for clinicians have sought to develop dynamic explanations that allow these technologies to be more trusted and trustworthy in practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The "deep learning" methods powering cutting-edge AI in the 2010s are naturally opaque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Siddhartha|title=A.I.

In contrast, decision trees and Bayesian networks are more transparent to inspection.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, N., &amp; Yudkowsky, E. (2014). The ethics of artificial intelligence. The Cambridge handbook of artificial intelligence, 316-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Layerwise relevance propagation (LRP), first described in 2015, is a technique for determining which features in a particular input vector contribute most strongly to a neural network's output.&lt;ref name="Shiebler 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shiebler | first=Dan | title=Understanding Neural Networks with Layerwise Relevance Propagation and Deep Taylor Series | website=Dan Shiebler | date=2017-04-16 | url=https://dshieble.github.io/2017-04-16-deep-taylor-lrp/ | access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bach Binder Montavon Klauschen p=e0130140"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bach | first=Sebastian | last2=Binder | first2=Alexander | last3=Montavon | first3=Grégoire | last4=Klauschen | first4=Frederick | last5=Müller | first5=Klaus-Robert | last6=Samek | first6=Wojciech | editor-last=Suarez | editor-first=Oscar Deniz | title=On Pixel-Wise Explanations for Non-Linear Classifier Decisions by Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation | journal=PLOS One | publisher=Public Library of Science (PLoS) | volume=10 | issue=7 | date=2015-07-10 | issn=1932-6203 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0130140 | page=e0130140| bibcode=2015PLoSO..1030140B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sample |first1=Ian |title=Computer says no: why making AIs fair, accountable and transparent is crucial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/05/computer-says-no-why-making-ais-fair-accountable-and-transparent-is-crucial |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=5 November 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s public concerns about racial and other bias in the use of AI for criminal sentencing decisions and findings of creditworthiness may have led to increased demand for transparent artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

Some organizations, such as [[Accenture]], offer tools to businesses to help detect bias in their systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Accenture Unveils Tool to Help Companies Insure Their AI Is Fair|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-13/accenture-unveils-tool-to-help-companies-insure-their-ai-is-fair |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=Bloomberg.com |date=June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 an interdisciplinary conference called FAT* (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency) was established to study transparency and explainability in the context of socio-technical systems, many of which include artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="FAT* conference"&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://fatconference.org/ | title=FAT* Conference }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer programs recognise white men better than black women |url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/02/15/computer-programs-recognise-white-men-better-than-black-women |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=The Economist |date=2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==

As regulators, official bodies and general users come to depend on AI-based dynamic systems, clearer accountability will be required for decision making processes to ensure trust and transparency. Evidence of this requirement gaining more momentum can be seen with the launch of the first global conference exclusively dedicated to this emerging discipline, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IJCAI 2017 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~dwaha/research/meetings/ijcai17-xai/|website=Earthlink|publisher=IJCAI |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[audio engineering]], a '''fade''' is a gradual increase or decrease in the level of an [[audio signal]].&lt;ref name="Nisbett"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Nisbett
  | first = Alec
  | title = The Technique of the sound studio
  | publisher = Focal Press
  | year = 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also be used for film cinematography or theatre lighting in much the same way (see [[fade (filmmaking)]] and [[fade (lighting)]]).

A [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] [[song]] may be gradually reduced to silence at its end ('''fade-out'''), or may gradually increase from silence at the beginning ('''fade-in'''). Fading-out can serve as a recording solution for pieces of music that contain no obvious ending. Both fades and cross-fades are very valuable since they allow the engineer to quickly and easily make sure that the beginning and the end of any audio is smooth, without any prominent glitches.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"&gt;Langford, S. 2014. Digital Audio Editing. Burlington: Focal Press. pp. 47-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is necessary that there is a clear section of silence prior to the audio.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Fade-ins and out can also be used to change the characteristics of a sound, for example a fade-in is used to soften the attack, especially in vocals where very plosive (‘b’, ‘d’, and ‘p’) sounds can occur.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; It can also be used to soften up the attack of the drum and/or percussion instruments.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A cross-fade can be manipulated through its rates and coefficients in order to create different styles of fading.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F. 1992. pp. 241, 282"&gt;Rumsey, F. &amp; McCormick, T. 1992. Sound and Recording. Burlington: Focal Press. pp. 241, 282-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every fade is different; this means that the fade parameters must be adjusted according to the individual needs of the mix.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"&gt;Nisbett, A. 1962. The Technique of the Sound Studio. London &amp; New York: Focal Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Turntablism|Professional turntablists]] and [[DJ]]s in [[hip hop music]] use faders on a [[DJ mixer]], notably the horizontal [[#Crossfader|crossfader]], in a rapid, virtuoso fashion while simultaneously manipulating two or more [[phonograph|record players]] (or other sound sources) to create "[[scratching]]" and develop beats. Club DJs in [[house music]] and [[techno]] use [[DJ mixer]]s, two or more sound sources (two record players, two iPods, etc.) along with a skill called [[beatmatching]] (aligning the beats and tempos of two records) to make seamless dance mixes for dancers at [[rave]]s, [[nightclub]]s and dance parties.

Though relatively rare, songs can fade out then fade back in. Some examples of this are "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]" and "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" by [[The Beatles]],&lt;ref name=Everett&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p0p6jL-u3T4C&amp;pg=PT171 |page=171 |title=The Foundations of Rock: From "Blue Suede Shoes" to "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" |last=Everett |first=Walter |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |isbn=0-19-531023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Suspicious Minds]]" by [[Elvis Presley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvisinfonet.com/spotlight_suspicious_minds.html|title='Suspicious Minds': Elvis' Greatest Single?|last=Patterson|first=Nigel|author2=Piers Beagley|work=Elvis Information Network|accessdate=September 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Shine On Brightly]]" by [[Procol Harum]], "Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others" by [[The Smiths]],&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Simon (2009).

==History==

=== Origins and early examples ===
Possibly the earliest example of a fade-out ending can be heard in [[Joseph Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 45]], nicknamed the "Farewell" Symphony on account of the fade-out ending. The symphony which was written in 1772 used this device as a way of courteously asking Haydn's patron Prince [[Nikolaus Esterházy]], to whom the symphony was dedicated, to allow the musicians to return home after a longer than expected stay. This was expressed by the players extinguishing their stand candles and leaving the stage one by one during the final adagio movement of the symphony, leaving only two muted violins playing. Esterhazy appears to have understood the message, allowing the musicians to leave.&lt;ref&gt;[[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustav Holst]]'s "Neptune, the mystic", part of the orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'' written between 1914 and 1916, is another early example of music to have a fade-out ending during performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyI_Cb8olkMC&amp;pg=PA318|page=318 |title=Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation |last=Huron |first=David |publisher=MIT Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-262-08345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holst stipulates that the women's choruses are "to be placed in an adjoining room, the door of which is to be left open until the last bar of the piece, when it is to be slowly and silently closed", and that the final bar (scored for choruses alone) is "to be repeated until the sound is lost in the distance".&lt;ref name=FullScore&gt;"The Planets" (full orchestral score): Goodwin &amp; Tabb, Ltd., London, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; Although commonplace today, the effect bewitched audiences in the era before widespread recorded sound—after the initial 1918 run-through, Holst's daughter [[Imogen Holst|Imogen]] (in addition to watching the charwomen dancing in the aisles during "Jupiter") remarked that the ending was "unforgettable, with its hidden chorus of women's voices growing fainter and fainter&amp;nbsp;... until the imagination knew no difference between sound and silence".&lt;ref name=Imogen&gt;"The Great Composers and Their Music", Vol. 50, Marshall Cavendish Ltd., London, 1985. I.H. as quoted on p1218&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of ending a spoken or musical recording by fading out the sound goes back to the earliest days of recording. In the era of mechanical (pre-electrical) recording, this could only be achieved by either moving the sound source away from the recording horn, or by gradually reducing the volume at which the performer/s were singing, playing or speaking. With the advent of electrical recording, smooth and controllable fadeout effects could be easily achieved by simply reducing the input volume from the microphones using the fader on the mixing desk.The first experimental study on the effect of a fade-out showed that a version of a musical piece with fade-out in comparison to the same piece with a cold end prolonged the perceived duration by 2.4 seconds. This is called the “Pulse Continuity Phenomenon" and was measured by a tapping-along task to measure participants’ perception of pulsation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kopiez|first1=Reinhard|last2=Platz|first2=Friedrich|last3=Müller|first3=Silvia|last4=Wolf|first4=Anna|title=When the pulse of the song goes on: Fade-out in popular music and the pulse continuity phenomenon|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=43|issue=3|pages=359–374|doi=10.1177/0305735613511505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1894 78&amp;nbsp;rpm record called "The Spirit of '76", a narrated musical vignette with martial fife-and-drum that gets louder as it 'nears' the listener and quieter as it 'moves away'. There are early examples that appear to bear no obvious relationship to movement. One is "Barkin' Dog" (1919) by the [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]] Jazz Band. Another contender is "America" (1918), a patriotic piece by the chorus of evangelist [[Billy Sunday]]. By the early 1930s longer songs were being put on both sides of records, with the piece fading out at the end of Side One and fading back in at the beginning of Side Two. Records at the time held only about two to five minutes of music per side. The segue allowed for longer songs (such as [[Count Basie]]'s "Miss Thing"), symphonies and live concert recordings.

However, shorter songs continued to use the fade-out for unclear reasons—for example, [[Fred Astaire]]'s movie theme "Flying Down to Rio" (1933). Even using fade-out as a segue device doesn't seem obvious, though we certainly take it for granted today. It is possible that movies were an influence here. Fade-ins and fade-outs are often used as cinematic devices that begin and end scenes; film language that developed at the same time as these early recordings. The term 'fade-out' itself is of cinematic origin, appearing in print around 1918. And jazz, a favorite of early records, was a popular subject of early movies too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.stupidquestion.net/sq91503fadeout.html Stupid Question Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The same could be said for radio productions. Within a single programme of a radio production, many different types of fade can be applied. When mixing from speech to music, there are a few ways that fade can be used. Here are three examples.
===Types===
*''Straight'': the introduction has become a musical link between the music/speech that follows, additionally the first notes of the intro can be emphasized to make it ‘pop’ out more.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt;
*''Cutting the introduction'': Since the first word of the vocals have to follow promptly after the cue light, it could be used to move the recording onward.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt;
*''Introduction under speech'': The music is placed at the specified time on the cue, the level must be low in order for the vocals to be audible.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; Here the fade-up generally occurs just before the final words in order for the cue to be given.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; In stage productions the closing music is played from a predetermined time and fades up at the closing words in order to fit in exactly with the remaining program time.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt;

===Contemporary===
No modern recording can be reliably identified as "the first" to use the technique. In 2003, on the (now-defunct) website [http://archives.stupidquestion.net/sq91503fadeout.html ''Stupid Question''], John Ruch listed the following recordings as possible contenders:

{{quote|[[Bill Haley]]'s cover version of "[[Rocket 88]]" (1951) fades out to indicate the titular car driving away. There are claims that [[The Beatles]]' "[[Eight Days a Week]]" (recorded 1964) was the first song to use the reverse effect—a fade-in. In fact, The Supremes had used this effect on their single "[[Come See About Me]]", issued a little over a month before "[[Eight Days a Week]]".}}

More recently: "At the meta-song level, the prevalence of pre-taped sequences (for shops, pubs, parties, concert intervals, aircraft headsets) emphasizes the importance of ''flow''. The effect on radio pop programme form [is] a stress on continuity achieved through the use of fades, voice-over links, twin-turntable mixing and connecting jingles."&lt;ref name="Middleton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Middleton|first=Richard|title=Studying popular music|year=1990|publisher=Open University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-335-15275-9|pages=95–96|edition=Reprint}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fade ==
A fade can be constructed so that the motion of the control (linear or rotary) from its start to end points affects the level of the signal in a different manner at different points in its travel. If there are no overlapping regions on the same track, regular fade (Pre-fade / Post-fade) should be used.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A smooth fade is one that changes according to the logarithmic scale, as faders are logarithmic over much of their working range of 30-40&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; If the engineer requires one region to gradually fade into another on the same track, a cross-fade would be more suitable.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; If however the two regions are on different tracks, fade-ins and fade-outs will be applied.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A fade-out can be accomplished without letting the sound’s distance increase,&lt;ref name="Moylan, W 2002"&gt;Moylan, W. 2002. The Art of Recording. United States of America: Focal Press.&lt;/ref&gt; however this is also something it can do.  The perceived distance increase can be attributed to a diminishing level of timbral detail, not the result of a decreasing dynamic level.&lt;ref name="Moylan, W 2002"/&gt; A listener’s interest can be withdrawn from a sound that is faded at the lower end since the ear accepts a more prompt rounding off.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; The fade-in can be used as a device that separates the listener from the scene.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt;
An example of a mini fade out, of about a second or two, is a sustained bass note left to die down.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2011. pp. 54-55"&gt;Langford, S. 2011. The Remix Manual. Burlington: Focal Press. pp. 54-55, 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shapes ===
The shape of a regular fade and a cross-fade can be shaped by an audio engineer.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Shape implies that you can change the rate at which the level change occurs over the length of the fade.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Different types of preset fades shapes include linear, logarithmic, exponential and S-curve.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt;

==== Linear ====

The simplest of fade curves is the linear curve and it is normally the default fade. It takes a straight line and introduces a curve.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This curve represents an equal degree by which the gain increases or decreases during the length of the fade.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A linear fade-in curve makes it sound as though the volume increases sharply at the beginning, and more gradually towards the end. The same principle applies on a fade-out where a gradual drop in volume can be perceived in the beginning, and the fade gets more abrupt towards the end. If in your audio there is a natural ambience or reverb present that one would like to reduce, the linear shape would be ideal because of the initial drop in perceived volume.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; When applied it shortens the ambience. Also if the music requires an accelerating effect, this linear curve can also be applied.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This type of fade is not very natural sounding.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; The principle of a linear cross-fade is: at the beginning of the fade the perceived volume drops more quickly, one can see at the halfway point (in the middle of the crossfade) that the perceived volume drops below 50%.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This is a very noticeable drop in volume. Also if the control can move from position 0 to 100, and the percentage of the signal that is allowed to pass equals the position of the control (i.e. 25% of the signal is allowed to pass when the control is 25% of the physical distance from the 0 point to the 100 point). At the midpoint of the fade the effect of a linear cross-fade is that both the sounds are below half of their maximum perceived volume; and as a result the sum of the two fades will be below the maximum level of either.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This is not applicable when the two sounds are on different levels and the cross-fade time is long enough.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; In turn if the crossfade is short (for example on a single note) the dip of the volume in the middle of the cross-fade can be quite noticeable.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt;

==== Logarithmic ====

Another type of curve is called the logarithmic ratio (also known as "[[audio taper]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://techchannel.radioshack.com/difference-audio-linear-potentiometers-2409.html&lt;/ref&gt; or an inverse-logarithmic ratio.&lt;ref&gt;http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/101191/why-should-i-use-a-logarithmic-pot-for-audio-applications&lt;/ref&gt;  the log/audio-taper more closely matches human hearing, with finer control at lower levels, increasing dramatically past the 50% point. Here it is important to remember that the perceived volume of a sound has a logarithmic relationship with its level in decibels.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A fade that works on a logarithmic scale would thus counteract the curve of a linear fade.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; In fade-ins the shape of the perceived volume curve looks like the level in decibels pulled towards the middle part of the line to the bottom right corner.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; The fade-out in turn looks like it has been pulled toward the bottom-left corner.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A logarithmic fade takes a line that has already been curved and straightens it out [15]. The logarithmic fade sounds consistent and smooth since the perceived volume is increased over the whole duration of the fade.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This makes this curve very handy for fading standard pieces of music. It is best used on a long fade-out since the fade has a perceived linear nature.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Also a fade-out sounds very neutral when incorporated to parts of music with natural ambience.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; In cross-fades this type of curve sounds very natural. When this curve is applied the perceived volume of the fade’s midpoint is at about 50% of the maximum – when the two sections are summed the output volume is fairly constant.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt;

==== Exponential ====

The exponential curve shape is in many ways the precise opposite of the logarithmic curves.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; The fade-in works as follows: it increases in volume slowly and then it shoots up very quickly at the end of the fade.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; The fade-out drops very quickly (from the maximum volume) and then declines slowly again over the duration of the fade.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Simply stated a linear fade could thus be seen as an exaggerated version of an exponential fade in terms of the apparent volume.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Thus the impression that would be gathered from an exponential curve’s fade would sound as though the sound was rapidly accelerating towards the listener.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Natural ambience can also be repressed by using an exponential fade-out.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A cross-fade, in the exponential shape, will have a perceivable dip in the middle, which is very undesirable in music and vocals.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This depends largely on the length of the cross-fade, a long cross-fade on ambient sounds can sound perfectly satisfactory (the dip can add a little breath to the music).&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Exponential crossfades (or a curve with a similar shape) have a smaller drop in the middle of the fade.

==== S-curve ====

The S-curve shape is interesting since it has qualities that correlate with the previously mentioned curves.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; The level of the sound is 50% at the midpoint, but before and after the midpoint the shape is not linear. There are also two types of S-curves. Traditional S-curve fade-in has attributes of the exponential curve can be seen at the beginning; at the midpoint to the end it is more logarithmic in nature.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A traditional S-curve fade-out: is logarithmic from the beginning up to the midpoint, then its attributes are based on the exponential curve from the midpoint to the end.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This is true for the situation in reverse as well (for both fade-in and fade-out).&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Cross-fading S-curves works as follows; it diminishes the amount of time that both sounds are playing simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This ensures that the edits sound like a direct cut when the two edits meet - this adds an extra smoothness to the edited regions.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; 

The second type of S-curve is more apt for longer cross-fades, since they are smooth and have the ability to have both of the crossfades in the overall level; so that they are audible for as long as possible.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; There is a short period at the start of each of the cross-fades where the outgoing sound drops toward 50% quickly (with the incoming sound rising just as fast to 50%).&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This acceleration of sound slows and both sounds will appear as if they are at the same level for most of the cross-fade (in the middle) before the changeover happens.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; 
DAW’s gives one the ability to change the shape of logarithmic, exponential, and S-curve fades and cross-fades. Changing the shape of a logarithmic fade will change how soon the sound will rise above 50%, and then how long it takes for the end of the fade-out to drop below 50% once again.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; With exponential fades the shape change will affect the shape in reverse, to the shape of the logarithmic fade.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; In the S-curve’s traditional form the shape determines how quickly the change can occur and in the type 2 curve the change can determine the time it takes for both the sounds to get to a nearly equal level.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt;

=== Fade times ===
It is also possible to apply different fade times to the out and in portions; which a standard cross-fade would not allow you to apply.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Appropriate fade-in time for a linear fade can be around 500ms; for the fade-out 500ms would also be affective.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; By having this longer fade it makes sure that everything is gentle&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; as it gives the fade time to blend in and be less abrupt. To clear up plosive sounds created through vocals a fade-in can be used, but now it has to have a very short time of around 10ms.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; The fade time can always be adjusted by the engineer in order to locate the best time. It is important that the fade does not change the intelligibility or character of the sound too much.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; When the crossfade is longer than 10ms the standard linear fades are not always the best choice for music editing.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt;

== Crossfading ==
A '''crossfader''' on a [[DJ mixer]] essentially functions like two faders connected side-by-side, but in opposite directions. A crossfader is typically mounted horizontally, so that the [[DJ]] can slide the fader from the extreme left (this provides 100% of sound source A) to the extreme right (this provides 100% of sound source B), move the fader to the middle (this is a 50/50 mix of sources A and B), or adjust the fader to any point in between. It allows a [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] to fade one source out while fading another source in at the same time.&lt;ref name=x-fade /&gt; This is extremely useful when [[beatmatching]] two sources of audio (or more, where channels can be mapped to one of the two sides of the crossfader individually) such as [[phonograph]] records, [[compact discs]] or digital sources. The technique of '''cross-fading''' is also used in audio engineering as a mixing technique, particularly with instrumental [[solo (music)|solos]]. A mix engineer will often record two or more [[take]]s of a vocal or instrumental part and create a final version which is a composite of the best passages of these takes by cross-fading between each track. In the perfect case, the cross-fade would keep a constant output level, an important quality for a club DJ who is creating a seamless mix of dance tracks for dancers or a radio DJ seeking to avoid "dead air" (silence) between songs, an error that can cause listeners to change channels. However, there's no standard on how this should be achieved.&lt;ref name=x-fade&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffs|first=Rick|title=Evolution of the DJ crossfader|url=http://www.rane.com/note146.html|work=RaneNote 146|publisher=Rane Corp|accessdate=6 July 2013|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many [[software]] applications that feature virtual cross-fades, for instance, [[Optical disc authoring|burning]]-software for the recording of audio-[[Compact Discs|CDs]]. Also many DAW’s (Pro Tools, Logic exc.) have this function. Cross-fade is normally found on samplers and usually based on velocity.&lt;ref name="Pressing, J 1992. pp. 61, 69"&gt;Pressing, J. 1992. Synthesizer Performance and Real-Time Techniques. United States of America: Oxford University Press.  pp. 61, 69, 246-249, 386.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a cross-fade it to utilize a smooth changeover between two cut pieces of audio.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; Velocity cross-fading can be incorporated through a [[MIDI]]  transformation device and where more than one note can be assigned to a given pad (note) on the MIDI keyboard; velocity cross-fading may be available.&lt;ref name="Pressing, J 1992. pp. 61, 69"/&gt;

These types of cross-fades (those that are based on note velocity) allow two (even more) samples to be assigned to one note or range of notes.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F 1994"&gt;Rumsey, F. 1994. MIDI Systems &amp; Control. Oxford: Focal Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This requires both a loud and soft sample; the reason for this is [[Timbre]]  change.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F 1994"/&gt; This type of cross-fade is quite subtle depending on the proportion of the received note velocity value of the loud and soft sample.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F 1994"/&gt;

Cross-fading usually involves the sounding of a combination of one or two sounds at the same time.&lt;ref name="Pressing, J 1992. pp. 61, 69"/&gt; While cross-fading one does not want the second part of the fade to start playing before the first part is finished; one wants the overlapping parts to be as short as possible. If edit regions aren’t trimmed to a zero-crossing point one will get unwelcome pops in the middle.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; A sound at the lowest velocity can fade into a sound of a higher velocity, in the order of: first the first sound then the second.&lt;ref name="Pressing, J 1992. pp. 61, 69"/&gt; All possible without fading out the sounds that are already present.&lt;ref name="Pressing, J 1992. pp. 61, 69"/&gt; This in turn is a form of [[Layering]]  that can be used in the mix.&lt;ref name="Pressing, J 1992. pp. 61, 69"/&gt; The same effect (as was created with velocity) can be applied to a controller.&lt;ref name="Pressing, J 1992. pp. 61, 69"/&gt; This allows continued monitored control; the cross-fading function can also be controlled on some instruments by the keyboard position.&lt;ref name="Pressing, J 1992. pp. 61, 69"/&gt; These sounds on the MIDI keyboard can be programmed.

A cross-over can either be used between two unrelated pieces of music or between two sounds that are similar; in both of these cases, one would like the sound to be one continuous sound&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; without any bumps. When applying a cross-fade between two very different pieces of music (relating to both tone and pitch), one could simply use a cross-fade between the two pieces, make a few minor adjustments.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This is because the two sounds are different from one another. In the case of a cross-fade between two sounds, that are similar, phase-cancellation can become an issue.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; The two sounds that are cross-faded should be brought into comparison with one another. If both sounds are moving upward they will have a cumulative effect  - when added together, this is what one wants.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; What is not desirable is when both sounds are moving in a different direction, since this can lead to cancelations.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This leads to no sound on areas where the amplitudes cancel out one another; there will thus be silence in the middle of the cross-fade. This occurrence is rare though since the parameters have to be the same. Commonly a cross-fade will result in a gradual reduction in the amount of the sample whose pitch is lower, and an increase will be found on the pitch that is higher.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F 1994"/&gt; The longer a cross-fade, the more likely a problem will occur. One also does not want the effect of the cross-fade to be very prominent in the middle of the notes, since if different notes are between the edit point there will be a time when both of the sounds can be heard simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2014. pp. 47-57"/&gt; This overlapping is not expected from a normal singing voice, no reference to [[Overtone singing]].

Cross-fades can either be applied to a piece of music in real time, or it can be pre-calculated.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F. 1992. pp. 241, 282"/&gt; 
[[Grandmaster Flash]] has been credited with the invention of the first cross-fade by sourcing parts from a junkyard in the Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tsbmag.com/2012/08/14/awesome-men-throughout-history-grandmaster-flash/&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially an on/off toggle switch from an old microphone that he transformed into a left/right switch which allowed him to switch from one turntable to another, thereby avoiding a break in the music. However the earliest commercial documented example was designed by Richard Wadman, one of the founders of the British company Citronic. It was called the model SMP101, made about 1977, and had a crossfader that doubled as a L/R balance control or a crossfade between two inputs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rane.com/note146.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fader ==
[[File:Siemens RC 826 - Fader potentiometer-1727.jpg|thumb|3 faders used as graphic equalizer in a personal cassette player]]
A '''fader''' is any device used for fading, especially when it is a knob or button that ''slides'' along a track or slot. It is principally a variable resistance or potentiometer also called a ‘pot’.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; A contact can move from one end to another. As this movement takes place the resistance of the circuit can either increase or decrease.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; At one end the resistance of the scale is at 0 and at the other side it is infinite.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; A. Nisbett explains the fader law as follows in his book called The Sound studio:"The ‘law’ of the fader is near-logarithmic over much of its range, which means that a scale of decibels can be made linear (or close to it) over a working range of perhaps 60&amp;nbsp;dB. If the resistance were to increase according to the same law beyond this, it would be twice as long before reaching a point where the signal is negligible. But the range below -50&amp;nbsp;dB is of little practical use, so here the rate of fade increases rapidly to the final cut-off".

A knob which ''rotates'' is usually not considered a fader, although it is electrically and functionally equivalent. Some small mixers use knobs rather than faders, as do a small number of [[DJ mixer]]s designed for club DJs who are creating seamless mixes of songs. A fader can be either [[analog signal|analogue]], directly controlling the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] to the source (e.g. a [[potentiometer]]); or [[Digital data|digital]], numerically controlling a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP). Analogue faders are found on mixing consoles. A fader can also be used as a control for a [[Variable-gain amplifier|voltage controlled amplifier]], which has the same effect on the sound as any other fader, but the audio signal does not pass through the fader itself.
=== Digital ===
[[Digital data|Digital]] faders are also referred to as ''virtual'' faders, since they can be viewed on the screen of a [[digital audio workstation]]. Modern high end digital mixers often feature "flying faders", faders with [[Piezo-electric#Actuators|piezo-electric]] actuators attached; such faders can be multi-use and will jump to the correct position for a selected function or saved setting. Flying faders can be automated, so that when a [[timecode]] is presented to the equipment, the fader will move according to a previously performed path. Also called an automated fader, as it recalls the movement of the channel faders in time.&lt;ref name="Roads, A 1996. pp. 378-379"&gt;Roads, A. 1996. The Computer Music Tutorial. United States of America: Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data. pp. 378-379.&lt;/ref&gt; A full-function automation system will continuously scan the console, many times per second, in order to incorporate new settings.&lt;ref name="Roads, A 1996. pp. 378-379"/&gt; While this scan is in progress, the stored representation of the previous scan will be compared to that of the fader’s current position.&lt;ref name="Roads, A 1996. pp. 378-379"/&gt; If the fader’s position has changed, the new position will be identified, thus resulting in a spurt of data.&lt;ref name="Roads, A 1996. pp. 378-379"/&gt; 

The console’s computer will update the console’s controls on playback.&lt;ref name="Roads, A 1996. pp. 378-379"/&gt; This will be done from memory at the same speed.&lt;ref name="Roads, A 1996. pp. 378-379"/&gt; The advantage of working with mix automation is that only one engineer can perform the job with minimal effort;&lt;ref name="Roads, A 1996. pp. 378-379"/&gt; it can be set up or recorded beforehand to make it even simpler.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2011. pp. 54-55"/&gt; An example of this is when Ken Hamman installed linear faders that made it possible for him to alter several channels with one hand while mixing, thus he assumed an interactive role in the process of recording.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, H. J. Music and Technology in the Twentieth Century. London: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of fader level adjustment is also called ‘riding’ the fader.&lt;ref name="Langford, S 2011. pp. 54-55"/&gt;
===Types===
Many DJ equipment manufacturers offer different mixers for different purposes, with different fader styles, e.g., "[[scratching]]", beatmixing, and cut mixing. High-priced mixers often have crossfade curve switches allowing the DJ to select the type of crossfade necessary. Experienced DJs are also able to crossfade between tracks using the channel faders.

== Pre-fader, post-fader ==

On a mixer with auxiliary send mixes, the send mixes are configured '''pre'''-fader or '''post'''-fader.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F. 1992. pp. 241, 282"/&gt; If a send mix is configured '''pre'''-fader, then changes to the main channel strip fader does not affect the send mix.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F. 1992. pp. 241, 282"/&gt;  In live sound reinforcement, this is useful for stage monitor mixes where changes in the [[Front of House]] channel levels would distract the musicians.  In recording and post production, configuring a send to be '''pre'''-fader allows the amount of audio sent to the aux bus to remain unaffected by the individual track fader, thus not disturbing the stability of the feed that is being sent to the musicians.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F. 1992. pp. 241, 282"/&gt; If a send mix is configured '''post'''-fader, then the level sent to the send mix follows changes to the main channel strip fader.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F. 1992. pp. 241, 282"/&gt;  This is useful for [[Reverberation#Creating reverberation effects|reverberation]] and other [[signal processor]] effects. An example of this is when an engineer would like to add some delay to the vocals – the fader can thus be used to adjust the amount of delay added.&lt;ref name="Rumsey, F. 1992. pp. 241, 282"/&gt;

== Pre-fader listen (PFL), after-fader listen (AFL) ==
These functions will be found on a primary monitor function.&lt;ref name="Talbot-Smith, M 1994"&gt;Talbot-Smith, M. 1994. Audio Engineer’s Reference Book. Oxford: Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This pre-fade listen is valuable since it allows one to listen through headphones in order to hear what the pre-faded part sounds like, while the studio loudspeaker is being used to monitor the rest of the program.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt;

Pre-fade listen can also be used for talkback as well as to listen to channels before they have been faded.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; After-fade listen only gets its information later.&lt;ref name="Nisbett, A 1962"/&gt; The choice of listen or level will depend on the user’s interest: either with the quality and/or content of the signal or with the signal’s level. PFL takes place just before the fader and has a joint channel and monitoring function.&lt;ref name="Talbot-Smith, M 1994"/&gt; PFL sends the channel’s signal path to the pre-fade bus.&lt;ref name="Talbot-Smith, M 1994"/&gt; The bus is picked up in the monitor module and made accessible as a substitute signal that is sent to the mixer output.&lt;ref name="Talbot-Smith, M 1994"/&gt; Automatic PFL has been made available, almost universally, and no longer needs to be selected beforehand.&lt;ref name="Talbot-Smith, M 1994"/&gt;

Pre-fade listen can also be incorporated in radio stations and serves as a vital tool. This function allows the radio presenter to listen to the source before it is faded on air; allowing the presenter to check the source’s incoming level and make sure it is accurate.&lt;ref name="Talbot-Smith, M 1994"/&gt; It is also valuable since live radio broadcasts can fall apart without it as they will not be able to monitor the sound. After-fader listen is not as useful in live programs.&lt;ref name="Talbot-Smith, M 1994"/&gt;

'''Fitts's law''' (often cited as '''Fitts' law''') is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in [[human–computer interaction]] and [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]]. This [[scientific law]] predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.&lt;ref name=Fitts1954&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitts |first=Paul M. |title=The information capacity of the human motor system in controlling the amplitude of movement |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=47 |number=6 |date=June 1954 |pages=381–391 |doi=10.1037/h0055392 |pmid=13174710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitts's law is used to [[Conceptual model|model]] the act of ''pointing'', either by physically touching an object with a hand or finger, or virtually, by pointing to an object on a [[computer monitor]] using a [[pointing device]].

== Original model formulation ==
The original 1954 paper by [[Paul Fitts|Paul Morris Fitts]] proposed a metric to quantify the difficulty of a target selection task.
The metric was based on 
an information analogy, where the distance to the center of the target (''D'') is like a signal and the tolerance or width of the target (''W'') is like noise.
The metric is Fitts's ''index of difficulty'' (''ID'', in bits):

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{2D} {W}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

Fitts also proposed an ''index of performance'' (''IP'', in bits per second) as a measure of human performance.  The metric
combines a task's index of difficulty (''ID'') with the movement time (''MT'', in seconds) in selecting the target.  In Fitts's words, 
"The average rate of information generated by a series of movements is the average information per movement divided by the time per movement" (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;390).  Thus,

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{IP} = \Bigg(\frac{\text{ID}} {\text{MT}}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

Today, ''IP'' is more commonly called ''throughput'' (''TP'').  It is also common to include an adjustment for accuracy in the calculation.

Researchers after Fitts began the practice of building linear regression equations and examining the 
correlation (''r'') for goodness of fit.  The equation expresses the relationship between
''MT'' and the ''D'' and ''W'' task parameters:

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{MT} = a + b \cdot \text{ID} = a + b \cdot \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{2D}{W}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*	''MT'' is the average time to complete the movement.
*	''a'' and ''b'' are constants that depend on the choice of input device and are usually determined empirically by [[regression analysis]].
*	''ID'' is the index of difficulty.
*	''D''	is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target. 
*	''W'' is the width of the target measured along the axis of motion.	''W'' can also be thought of as the allowed error tolerance in the final position, since the final point of the motion must fall within ±{{frac|''W''|2}}	of the target's center.

Since shorter movement times are desirable for a given task, the value of the ''b'' parameter can be used as a metric when comparing computer pointing devices against one another. The first [[Human-Computer Interface]] application of Fitts's law was by Card, English, and Burr (1978), who used the index of performance (''IP''), interpreted as {{frac|1|''b''}}, to compare performance of different [[input device]]s, with the [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] coming out on top compared to the joystick or directional movement keys.&lt;ref name=Card1978&gt;{{cite journal |last=Card |first=Stuart K. |first2=William K. |last2=English |first3=Betty J. |last3=Burr |date=1978 |title=Evaluation of mouse, rate-controlled isometric joystick, step keys, and text keys for text selection on a CRT |journal=Ergonomics |volume=21 |number=8 |pages=601–613 |doi=10.1080/00140137808931762|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/SSL-77-1_Evaluation_of_Mouse_Rate-Controlled_Isometric_Joystick_Step_Keys_and_Text_Keys_for_Text_Selection_on_a_CRT.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This early work, according to [[Stuart Card]]'s biography, "was a major factor leading to the mouse's commercial introduction by [[Xerox]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/people/stuart/stuart.htm |title=Stuart Card |website=[[PARC (company)|PARC]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711210730/http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/people/stuart/stuart.htm |archivedate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experiments testing Fitts's law apply the model to a dataset in which either distance or width, but not both, are varied. The model's predictive power deteriorates when both are varied over a significant range.&lt;ref name=Graham1996&gt;{{cite thesis	|last=Graham	|first=Evan	|title=Pointing on a Computer Display	|type=Ph.D.	|publisher=Simon Fraser University	|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notice that because the ''ID'' term depends only on the ''ratio'' of distance to width, the model implies that a target distance and width combination can be re-scaled arbitrarily without affecting movement time, which is impossible. 
Despite its flaws, this form of the model does possess remarkable predictive power across a range of computer interface modalities and motor tasks, and has provided many insights into user interface design principles.

== Bits per second: model innovations driven by information theory ==
The formulation of Fitts's index of difficulty most frequently used in the [[Human-Computer Interaction]] community is called the Shannon formulation:

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D}{W}+1\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;	

This form was proposed by Scott MacKenzie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack|title=Scott MacKenzie's home page|first=I. Scott|last=MacKenzie|website=www.yorku.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor at [[York University]], and named for its resemblance to the [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]].&lt;ref name=MacKenzie1992&gt;{{cite journal	|last=MacKenzie	|first=I. Scott	|date=1992 |title=Fitts' law as a research and design tool in human–computer interaction |journal=Human–Computer Interaction |volume=7 |pages=91–139 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/hci1992.pdf |format=pdf|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0701_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this form of the model, the difficulty of a pointing task was equated to a quantity of information transmitted (in units of bits) by performing the task. This was justified by the assertion that pointing reduces to an information processing task. Although no formal mathematical connection was established between Fitts's law and the Shannon-Hartley theorem it was inspired by, the Shannon form of the law has been used extensively, likely due to the appeal of quantifying motor actions using information theory. In 2002 the [[ISO 9241]] was published, providing standards for human-computer interface testing, including the use of the Shannon form of Fitts's law. It has been shown that the information transmitted via serial keystrokes on a keyboard and the information implied by the ''ID'' for such a task are not consistent.&lt;ref name=Soukoreff2011&gt;{{cite journal	|last1=Soukoreff |first1=R. William	|last2=Zhao |first2=Jian |last3=Ren |first3=Xiangshi |title=The Entropy of a Rapid Aimed Movement: Fitts' Index of Difficulty versus Shannon's Entropy	|year=2011 |journal=Human Computer Interaction |pages=222–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adjustment for accuracy: Use of the effective target width ==

An important improvement to Fitts's law was proposed by Crossman in 1956 (see Welford, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–148)&lt;ref name=Welford&gt;{{cite book |last=Welford |first=A. T. |date=1968 |title=Fundamentals of Skill |publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used by Fitts
in his 1964 paper with Peterson.&lt;ref name=Fitts1964&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitts |first=Paul M. |last2=Peterson |first2=J. R. 
|title=Information capacity of discrete motor responses |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=67 |date=1964 |pages=103–112 |doi=10.1037/h0045689}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the adjustment, target width (''W'') is replaced by an effective target width (''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;).
''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is computed from the standard deviation in the selection coordinates gathered over a sequence of trials for a particular ''D-W'' condition.  If the selections are logged as ''x'' coordinates along the axis of approach to the target, then

:	&lt;math&gt;W_e = 4.133 \times SD_x&lt;/math&gt;

This yields

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{ID}_e = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D}{W_e}+1\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

and hence

:	&lt;math&gt;\text{IP} = \Bigg(\frac{ID_e} {MT}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

If the selection coordinates are normally distributed, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; spans 96% of the 
distribution.  If the observed error rate was 4% in the sequence of trials, then ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = ''W''.  If the error rate was greater than 4%, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''W'', and if the error rate was less than 4%, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''W''.  By using ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, a Fitts' law model more closely
reflects what users actually did, rather than what they were asked to do.

The main advantage in computing ''IP'' as above is that spatial variability, or accuracy, is included in the measurement.  
With the adjustment for accuracy, Fitts's law
more truly encompasses the speed-accuracy tradeoff.  The equations above appear in ISO 9241-9 as the recommended method of
computing ''throughput''.

== Welford's model: innovations driven by predictive power ==
Not long after the original model was proposed, a 2-factor variation was proposed under the intuition that target distance and width have separate effects on movement time. Welford's model, proposed in 1968, separated the influence of target distance and width into separate terms, and provided improved predictive power:&lt;ref name="Welford"/&gt;

:	&lt;math&gt;T = a + b_1 \log_2 (D) + b_2 \log_2 (W)&lt;/math&gt;

This model has an additional parameter, so its predictive accuracy cannot be directly compared with 1-factor forms of Fitts's law. However, a variation on Welford's model inspired by the Shannon formulation,

:	&lt;math&gt;T = a + b_1 \log_2 (D+W) + b_2 \log_2 (W) = a + b\log_2 \left(\frac{D+W}{W^k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

reduces to the Shannon form when ''k = 1''. Therefore, this model ''can'' be directly compared against the Shannon form of Fitts's law using the [[F-test]] of nested models.&lt;ref name=Shoemaker_2012&gt;{{cite journal	|last=Shoemaker	|first=Garth	|last2=Tsukitani	|first2=Takayuki	|last3=Kitamura	|first3=Yoshifumi	|last4=Booth	|first4=Kellogg	|title=Two-Part Models Capture the Impact of Gain on Pointing Performance	|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction	|date=December 2012	|volume=19|issue=4|pages=1–34|doi=10.1145/2395131.2395135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison reveals that not only does the Shannon form of Welford's model better predict movement times, but it is also more robust when control-display gain (the ratio between e.g. hand movement and cursor movement) is varied. Consequently, although the Shannon model is slightly more complex and less intuitive, it is empirically the best model to use for virtual pointing tasks.

== Extending the model from 1D to 2D and other nuances ==

=== Extensions to two or more dimensions ===
In its original form, Fitts's law is meant to apply only to one-dimensional tasks. However, the original experiments required subjects to move a stylus (in three dimensions) between two metal plates on a table, termed the reciprocal tapping task. The target width perpendicular to the direction of movement was very wide to avoid it having a significant influence on performance. A major application for Fitts's law is 2D virtual pointing tasks on computer screens, in which targets have bounded sizes in both dimensions.

Fitts's law has been extended to two-dimensional tasks in two different ways. For navigating e.g. hierarchical pull-down menus, the user must generate a trajectory with the pointing device that is constrained by the menu geometry; for this application the [[Accot-Zhai steering law]] was derived.

For simply pointing to targets in a two-dimensional space, the model generally holds as-is but requires adjustments to capture target geometry and quantify targeting errors in a logically consistent way.&lt;ref name=Wobbrock2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wobbrock |first=J. |last2=Shinohara |first2=K |date=2011 |title=The effects of task dimensionality, endpoint deviation, throughput calculation, and experiment design on pointing measures and models. |journal=Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |pages=1639–1648 |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1979181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacKenzie1992-2D&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacKenzie |first=I. Scott |first2=William A. S. |last2=Buxton |date=1992 |title=Extending Fitts' law to two-dimensional tasks |journal=Proceedings of the ACM CHI 1992 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |pages=219–226 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/CHI92.html |doi=10.1145/142750.142794 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characterizing performance ===
Since the ''a'' and ''b'' parameters should capture movement times over a potentially wide range of task geometries, they can serve as a performance metric for a given interface. In doing so, it is necessary to separate variation between users from variation between interfaces. 
The ''a'' parameter is typically positive and close to zero, and sometimes ignored in characterizing average performance. Multiple methods exist for identifying parameters from experimental data, and the choice of method is the subject of heated debate, since method variation can result in parameter differences that overwhelm underlying performance differences.&lt;ref name=Soukoreff2004&gt;{{cite journal |title=Towards a standard for pointing device evaluation, perspectives on 27 years of Fitts' law research in HCI |first1=R. William |last1=Soukoreff |first2=I. Scott |last2=MacKenzie |journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies |year=2004 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=751–789 |url=http://www.yorku.ca/mack/ijhcs2004.html |doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2004.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhai2002&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Zhai |first=Shumin |date=2002 |title=On the Validity of Throughput as a Characteristic of Computer Input |number=RJ 10253 |institution=Almaden Research Center |location=San Jose, California |url=http://www.m.shuminzhai.com/papers/ZhaiIBMReporRJ10253.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional issue in characterizing performance is incorporating success rate: an aggressive user can achieve shorter movement times at the cost of experimental trials in which the target is missed. If the latter are not incorporated into the model, then average movement times can be artificially decreased.

== Temporal targets ==
Fitts's law deals only with targets defined in space. However, a target can be defined purely on the time axis, which is called a temporal target. A blinking target or a target moving toward a selection area are examples of temporal targets. Similar to space, the distance to the target (i.e., temporal distance D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) and the width of the target (i.e., temporal width W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) can be defined for temporal targets as well. The temporal distance is the amount of time a person must wait for a target to appear. The temporal width is a short duration from the moment the target appears until it disappears. For example, for a blinking target, D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as the period of blinking and W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; as the duration of the blinking. As with targets in space, the larger the D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; or the smaller the W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, the more difficult it becomes to select the target.

The task of selecting the temporal target is called temporal pointing. The model for temporal pointing was first presented to [[Human–computer interaction|Human-computer Interaction]] field in 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Byungjoo|last2=Oulasvirta|first2=Antti|date=2016|title=Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2858036.2858143|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1857–1868|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858143|isbn=9781450333627}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The model predicts the error rate, the human performance in temporal pointing, as a function of temporal index of difficulty (ID&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;):

&lt;math&gt;\text{ID}_{t} = \log_2 \Bigg(\frac{D_{t}}{W_{t}}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

In [[religious studies]] and [[folkloristics]], '''folk religion''', '''popular religion''', or '''vernacular religion''' comprises various forms and expressions of [[religion]] that are distinct from the official doctrines and practices of [[organized religion]]. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed '''popular belief''', it consists of [[ethnic]] or regional [[religion|religious]] customs under the umbrella of a [[religion]], but outside official [[doctrine]] and practices.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowman | first=Marion |editor-first=Steven| editor-last=Sutcliffe |title=Religion: empirical studies |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2004 |pages=3–4 |chapter=Chapter 1: Phenomenology, Fieldwork, and Folk Religion |isbn=0-7546-4158-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BU2BSj4dcHMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22folk+religion%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "folk religion" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects.  The first is the religious dimension of [[folk culture]], or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of [[syncretism]]s between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and [[Roman Catholicism]] that led to the development of [[Vodun]] and [[Santería]], and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures.

[[Chinese folk religion]], folk Christianity, folk Hinduism, and folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the [[clergy]] of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious [[worship]], do not belong to a [[church body|church]] or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of [[faith]] in a particular [[creed]], to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children [[baptism|baptised]].&lt;ref name="Bowman"/&gt;

==Definition==
In ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] characterized "folk religion" as either "religion which occurs in small, local communities which does not adhere to the norms of large systems" or "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."{{sfn|Bowker|2003}}

[[Don Yoder]] argued that there were five separate ways of defining folk religion.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The first was a perspective rooted in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework which understood folk religion as representing the survivals of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute "the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the survivals of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the survivals of Medieval Catholicism.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of [[indigenous American]] and [[indigenous African|African]] communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}

Yoder's third definition was that often employed within folkloristics, which held that folk religion was "the interaction of belief, ritual, custom, and mythology in traditional societies", representing that which was often pejoratively characterised as [[superstition]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=13}} The fourth definition provided by Yoder stated that folk religion represented the "folk interpretation and expression of religion". Noting that this definition would not encompass beliefs that were largely unconnected from organised religion, such as in [[witchcraft]], he therefore altered this definition by including the concept of "folk [[religiosity]]", thereby defining folk religion as "the deposit in culture of folk religiosity, the full range of folk attitudes to religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}} His fifth and final definition represented a "practical working definition" that combined elements from these various other definitions. Thus, he summarized folk religion as "the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=14}}

Yoder described "folk religion" as existing "in a complex society in relation to and in tension with the organized religion(s) of that society. Its relatively unorganized character differentiates it from organized religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=11}}

Alternately, the sociologist of religion [[Matthias Zic Varul]] defined "folk religion" as "the relatively un-reflected aspect of ordinary practices and beliefs that are oriented towards, or productive of, something beyond the immediate here-and-now: everyday transcendence".{{sfn|Varul|2015|p=449}}

===Historical development===

In Europe the study of "folk religion" emerged from the study of ''religiöse Volkskund'', a German term which was used in reference to "the religious dimension of folk-culture, or the folk-cultural dimension of religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=2}} This term was first employed by a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] preacher, [[Paul Drews]], in a 1901 article that he published which was titled "''Religiöse Volkskunde, eine Aufgabe der praktischen Theologie''". This article was designed to be read by young Lutheran preachers leaving the seminary, to equip them for the popular variants of Lutheranism that they would encounter among their congregations and which would differ from the official, doctrinal Lutheranism that they had been accustomed to.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=2&amp;ndash;3}} Although developing within a religious environment, the term came to be adopted by German academics in the field of [[folkloristics]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} During the 1920s and 1930s, theoretical studies of ''religiöse Volkskund'' had been produced by the folklorists [[Josef Weigert]], [[Werner Boette]], and [[Max Rumpf]], all of whom had focused on religiosity within German peasant communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} Over the coming decades, [[Georg Schreiber]] established an Institut für religiöse Volkskund in [[Munich]] while a similar department was established in [[Salzburg]] by [[Hanns Koren]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Other prominent academics involved in the study of the phenomenon were [[Heinrich Schauert]] and [[Rudolf Kriss]], the latter of whom collected one of the largest collections of folk-religious art and material culture in Europe, later housed in Munich's [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Throughout the 20th century, many studies were made of folk religion in Europe, paying particular attention to such subjects as [[pilgrimage]] and the use of [[shrines]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}}

In the Americas, the study of folk religion developed among [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] studying the syncretistic cultures of the Caribbean and Latin America.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The pioneer in this field was Redfield, whose 1930 book ''Tepoztlán: A Mexican Village'' contrasted and examined the relationship between "folk religion" and "official religion" in a peasant community.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Yoder later noted that although the earliest known usage of the term "folk religion" in the English language was unknown, it probably developed as a translation of the German ''Volksreligion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} One of the earliest prominent usages of the term was in the title of [[Joshua Trachtenberg]]'s 1939 work ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The term also gained increasing usage within the academic field of [[comparative religion]], appearing in the titles of [[Ichiro Hori]]'s ''Folk Religion in Japan'', [[Martin Nilsson]]'s ''Greek Folk Religion'', and [[Charles Miller Leslie|Charles Leslie]]'s reader, the ''Anthropology of Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Courses on the study of folk religion came to be taught at various universities in the United States, such as [[John Messenger]]'s at [[Indiana University]] and [[Don Yoder]]'s at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}}
Although the subject of folk religion fell within the remit of scholars operating in both folkloristics and religious studies, by 1974 Yoder noted that U.S.-based academics in the latter continued to largely ignore it, instead focusing on the study of [[theology]] and institutionalised religion; he contrasted this with the situation in Europe, where historians of religion had devoted much time to studying folk religiosity.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=6}} He also lamented that many U.S.-based folklorists also neglected the subject of religion because it did not fit within the standard genre-based system for cataloguing folklore.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=9}}

The term "folk religion" came to be increasingly rejected in the 1990s and 2000s by scholars seeking more precise terminology.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=4}}

===Problems and critique===

Yoder noted that one problem with the use of the term "folk religion" was that it did not fit into the work of those scholars who used the term "religion" in reference solely to [[organized religion]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} He highlighted the example of the prominent sociologist of religion [[Émile Durkheim]], who insisted that "religion" was organized in order to contrast it with "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} Yoder noted that scholars adopting these perspectives often preferred the term "folk belief" over "folk religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}}

A second problem with the use of "folk religion" that Yoder highlighted was that some scholars, particularly those operating in the [[sociology of religion]], used the term as a synonym for [[ethnic religion]] (which is alternately known as national religion or tribal religion), meaning a religion closely tied to a particular ethnic or national group and is thus contrasted with a "universal religion" which cuts across ethnic and national boundaries.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}} Among the scholars to have adopted this use of terminology are E. Wilbur Bock.{{sfn|Bock|1966|p=204}}

The folklorist Leonard Norman Primiano argued that the use of "folk religion", as well as related terms like "popular religion" and "unofficial religion", by scholars, does "an extreme disservice" to the forms of religiosity that scholarship is examining, because &amp;ndash; in his opinion &amp;ndash; such terms are "residualistic, [and] derogatory".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=38}} He argued that using such terminology implies that there is "a pure element" to religion "which is in some way transformed, even contaminated, by its exposure to human communities".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=39}} As a corrective, he suggested that scholars use "vernacular religion" as an alternative.{{sfn|Primiano|1995|pp=41&amp;ndash;42}} Defining this term, Primiano stated that "vernacular religion" is, "by definition, religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Since religion inherently involves interpretation, it is impossible for the religion of an individual not to be vernacular".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=44}}

Kapaló was critical of this approach, deeming it "mistaken" and arguing that switching from "folk religion" to "vernacular religion" results in the scholar "picking up a different selection of things from the world".{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=9}} He cautioned that both terms were "ideological and semantic load[ed]" and warned scholars to pay attention to the associations that each word had.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|pp=15&amp;ndash;16}}

[[Chinese folk religion]] or Shenism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GBdX2ELnkXQC&amp;pg=PA21 |title= Reinventing Chinese Syncretic Religion: Shenism |publisher= Google |date = 2007-02-23 |accessdate= 2011-11-20|isbn= 9789812308658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen | title = How we came to ‘pai shen’ | publisher = Straits times | date = 2009-09-07 | accessdate = 2011-11-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111207225051/http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen/ | archivedate = 2011-12-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9MmNaNebFD8C&amp;pg=PA198 |title = Religious Diversity in Singapore |publisher = Google |date = 2001-09-11 | accessdate =2011-11-20|isbn = 9789812307545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are labels used to describe the collection of [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] traditions which have historically comprised the predominant belief system in [[China]] and among [[Han Chinese]] ethnic groups up to the present day. Shenism describes [[Chinese mythology]] and includes the worship of ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' ([[spirit]], [[Deity|god]], [[awareness]], [[consciousness]]) which can be [[nature god|nature deities]], [[Taizu (disambiguation)|Taizu]] or clan deities, [[city god]]s, [[national god|national deities]], [[culture hero]]es and [[demigod]]s, [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] and [[veneration of the dead|ancestors]]. "Shenism" as a term was first published by AJA Elliot in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = High beam | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-126163460.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with [[Taoism]], since over the centuries institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administrate local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a branch of Shenism, since it sprang out of folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous.

==Folk Islam==
{{further |Islamic mythology|Druze|Alevi|Alawi|Kebatinan|Abangan|Adat}}
Folk Islam is an [[umbrella term]] used to collectively describe forms of [[Islam]] that incorporate native folk beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook|first= Chris|title = Spirituality and Psychiatry| publisher= [[RCPsych]] Publications | year = 2009 | page = 242 | isbn = 978-1-904671-71-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Folk Islam has been described as the Islam of the "urban poor, country people, and tribes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ridgeon | first = Lloyd | title =Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present | publisher =[[Routledge]]|year=2003|page=280|isbn = 978-0-415-29796-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or "High" Islam (Gellner, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Sinisa Malesevic | last= Malešević| first = Siniša | title = Ernest Gellner and Contemporary Social Thought|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|page=189|isbn = 978-0-521-70941-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufism]] and Sufi concepts are often integrated into Folk Islam.

Various practices and beliefs have been identified with the concept of "folk Islam". They include the following:
* belief in traditional magic systems and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] rituals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Masud| first= Muhammad Khalid |title = Islam and Modernity: Key Issues and Debates| publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year= 2009 | page = 138 | isbn = 978-0-7486-3793-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Makris | first =JP |title= Islam in the Middle East: A Living Tradition |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=2006|page=49|isbn = 978-1-4051-1603-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk Judaism==
In one of the first major academic works on the subject, titled ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg provided a definition of Jewish folk religion as consisting of ideas and practices that whilst not meeting with the approval of religious leaders enjoyed wide popularity such that they must be included in what he termed the field of religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg, 1939, Forgotten Books, Preface, pg xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; This included unorthodox beliefs about demons and angels, and magical practices.

Later studies have emphasized the significance of the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] to the many Jewish folk customs linked to mourning and in particular to the belief in ''hibbut ha-qever''  (torture of the grave) a belief that the dead are tortured in their grave for three days after burial by demons until they remember their names. This idea began with early eschatalogical [[aggadah]] and was then further developed by the kabbalists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', Edited by Adele Berlin,  Oxford University Press, 2011, pg 344,&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Raphael Patai has been acknowledged as one of the first to utilize anthropology to study Jewish folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'',
by Victor D. Sanua, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he has drawn attention to the important role of the female divine element,&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 27&lt;/ref&gt; which he sees in the goddess [[Asherah]], the [[Shekhinah]], the [[Matronit]], and [[Lilith]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Writer Stephen Sharot has stated that Jewish popular religion in common with other forms of folk religion, has a focus on the [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]], or [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]], i.e. it is used to assist in protecting the individual from sickness, and misfortune.  He emphasizes that while Rabbinical Judaism dealt with orthodox Jewish ritual, and [[halakah]], magicians claimed to use unorthodox magical rituals to help people in everyday life.  He points to the example of a relatively professionalised type of magician being the [[Baal Shem|ba'al shem]] of Poland, who beginning in the 16th century thrived with the popularity of practical kabbalah in the 18th century.  These ba'al shem promised to use their knowledge of the names of god, and the angels, along with exorcism, chiromancy, and [[herbal medicine]] to bring harm to enemies, and  success in areas of social life such as marriage, and childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Liebman]] has written that the essence of the folk religion of American Jews is their social ties to one another, illustrated by the finding  that religious practices that would prevent social integration -such as a strict interpretation of  dietary laws and the Sabbath- have been abandoned, whilst the practices that are followed -such as the [[Passover seder]], social rites of passage, and the High Holy Days- are ones that strengthen Jewish family and community integration.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 152&lt;/ref&gt; Liebman described the rituals and beliefs of contemporary Jewish folk religion in his works, ''The Ambivalent American Jew'' (1973) and ''American Jewry: Identity and Affiliation''.

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], folk religion is often contrasted with [[elite religion]]. Folk religion is defined as the beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols originating from sources other than the religion's leadership. Folk religion in many instances is tolerated by the religion's leadership, although they may consider it an error.&lt;ref&gt;Leibman, Charles. "The Religion of the American Jew". ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept is [[lived religion]], the study of religion as practiced by believers.

[[File:Logo circular.jpg|thumb|GalileoMobile logo]]

'''GalileoMobile''' is a non-profit, itinerant, science education initiative that brings modern astronomy closer to young people around the world, with emphasis in regions that have little or no access to other outreach actions. The initiative was created in late 2008 inspired by the [[International Year of Astronomy|2009 International Year of Astronomy]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/specialprojects/mobile/ IYA2009 Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently run by a group of astronomers, educators, and science communicators.

The team organises workshops for teachers and hands-on astronomy-related activities for students in schools and villages to foster a will of learning and critical thinking through the exciting wonders of our Universe, and to inspire a sense of global citizenship "under the same sky" by promoting a cultural exchange. To encourage follow-up activities GalileoMobile also donates to each school visited a [[Galileoscope]] or [http://kimigali.jp/index-e.html You are Galileo!] telescope, a copy of our [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-resources/galileomobile-handbooks Handbook of activities], a [[Universe Awareness|UNAWE]] Earthball, and other educational material.

In GalileoMobile's first project the team travelled across the high plateau of the Andes in the north of [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-chibolpe2009 Chile, Bolivia, and Peru] during October and November 2009. Since then, GalileoMobile has been to [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-bolivia2012 Bolivia (2012)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-india2012 India (2012)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-uganda2013 Uganda (2013)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-brabo2014 Bolivia and Brazil (2014)], and [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-colombia2014 Colombia (2014)]. Inspired by our expeditions, some of our team members have also carried out activities in Portugal, Nepal, United States, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Guatemala.

In 2015, GalileoMobile embarked on yet another astronomical adventure called [http://www.constellationproject.org Constellation]. This project brings together schools from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru to create a South American network of schools committed to bringing the exciting world of astronomy closer to their students. The students were able to explore the wonders of the Universe by taking part in “Space Exploration”, a series of astronomical outreach activities created especially for this project. Through the network, they will be able to share their passion for the sky with peers from all across South America. Their schools will also benefit from the long-term support of GalileoMobile when independently organising astronomical outreach activities in the years to come. The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] has decided to officially endorse Constellation as a Major Cosmic Light programme of the [[International Year of Light|International Year of Light 2015]] and the [http://www.astro4dev.org Office for Astronomical Development] has decided to officially sponsor about 30% of the entire project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro4dev.org/blog/2015/03/11/overview-of-the-project-52/|title=Overview of the project {{!}} IAU Office of Astronomy for Development|website=www.astro4dev.org|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31818">The phrase "'''greed versus grievance'''" or "'''greed and grievance'''" refer to the two baseline arguments put forward by scholars of [[armed conflict]] on the causes of [[civil war]], though the argument has been extended to other forms of [[war]], such as violent conflict in general, rebellion and insurgency for example.

"Greed" is shorthand for the argument that combatants in armed conflicts are motivated by a desire to better their situation, and perform an informal [[cost-benefit analysis]] in examining if the rewards of joining a [[rebellion]] are greater than not joining. "[[Grievance]]" stands for the argument that people rebel over issues of identity, e.g. [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social class]], etc., rather than over [[economics]]. In practice, even proponents of strong versions of these arguments admit that the opposing argument has some influence in the development of a conflict.

Whether the cause of war is attributed to 'greed' or 'grievance' the common factor is the perception of a certain deprivation. If it is an economic deprivation, the inequality will be a '[[vertical inequality]]' and the cause of war will be 'greed'. If the deprivation is caused by ethnicity, age, religion or gender, it will be a '[[horizontal inequality]]' and the cause of war will be due to the 'grievances'. 

== Cornerstones ==
The "greed versus grievance" theory provides opposing arguments on the cause of civil war. Proponents of the greed argument posit that armed conflicts are caused by a combatant's desire for self-enrichment. These motivations are manifested in multiple ways, including economic gain through control of goods and resources or by increased power within a given state. Conflicts started through greed are often seen in states with negative economic growth and/or systemic poverty, as this implies limited state capacity to provide opposition groups with economic concessions as well as the likelihood of the absence of an effective military or police apparatus to contend with those seeking power or resources.

Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler wrote one of the seminal pieces defending greed over grievance. They found that factors that increase the military or financial viability of rebellion correlated with more instances of conflict than factors leading to grievances. They argue that certain natural resources such as oil are tied to increased likelihood of conflict onset, and other natural resources such as diamonds are tied to increases in conflict duration. This is because natural resources may lower the startup cost of war, and provide rebels with an easy way of financing prolonged conflicts. Natural resources may also make the state a more lucrative prize for capture, further decreasing the opportunity cost of insurgency. For the same reason, Collier and Hoeffler also conclude that states with low per capita GDP are more likely to experience civil war, because low average income makes wage earning through conflict a more lucrative prospect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collier and Hoeffler also make an important distinction between preferences and constraints in terms of circumstances that favor rebellions. Societies can be more prone to conflict because preferences for rebellion are unusually strong or because constraints on rebellion are unusually weak – the former being aligned with grievance and the latter with greed. Measures such as democracy or political repression are hard to draw conclusions from because they may increase grievances among some groups, but empower other groups to repress potential insurgents. While most states harbor some level of grievance with the sitting regime, few states experience civil war. This is because although not everyone is content with the established order, rebellion only occurs when conflict is a viable option for dissatisfied parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Collier and Hoeffler conclude that on their own most variables that seek to explain civil war onset through measurements of grievance alone prove insufficient. Instead Collier and Hoeffler advocate using the looking at greed, that is to say the opportunity cost of initiating and sustaining conflict. [[James Fearon|Fearon]] and Laitin (2003) offer a contrasting view. They see opportunity structures created by weakness state capacity to be a cause of civil war onset. They find evidence in favor of the technology of insurgency as a mechanism. Further, they find that ethnicity, religion or any cultural or demography characteristic do not seems to have a positive relationship with civil war onset.&lt;ref&gt;'''Fearon, James D. and Laitin, David D'''. "Ethnicity, Insurgency and Civil War." ''American Political Science Review'', 2003, 97(1), pp 75-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing combatants is crucial to the success of any rebellion. Extortion and donations from diasporas are two possible financial sources used by rebellion groups. The extortion of primary commodity resources is especially suited to the operations of rebel groups, as they are often made up of unskilled labor and given whatever weapons are available. As rebel organizations need to be fairly large to have a significant impact and incite a civil war, the looting of primary commodity resources is the best way for them to maintain financial viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include diamonds in Sierra Leone and Angola, timber in Cambodia, coca in Colombia, and poppy in Afghanistan. Another factor that relates to lower constraints on rebellion is that primary resources are often found in rural locales. Thus, they often require an army to defend a large area, something that is much less likely in weak states that cannot sustain a military apparatus.&lt;ref name="Collier_7"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diaspora populations are also likely funding sources for rebel groups, as was the case with the Tamil population in North America funding the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka. Diaspora populations, who are usually wealthier than their native counterparts, are able to mobilize for collective action, and do not directly suffer the consequences of a conflict. While the potential for diasporas to be financial backers of rebel groups was noted, Collier and Hoeffler found that diasporas themselves do not increase the risk of conflict.&lt;ref name="Collier_8"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Overall, Collier and Hoeffler's study drew multiple conclusions in support of the greed model. Faster economic growth reduces risk, likely because it raises the opportunity costs of joining a rebellion. The higher a state's dependence on primary commodities, the greater the risk of conflict; this is due to the resources being a main financial component of rebel groups and a weak governmental structure. However, they observed that if there is a particularly high dependence on primary commodity resources, conflict risk declines as states find ways to protect their resources and deter looting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
David Keen elaborates on the economic incentives for warfare and argues that there is more to war than simply "winning." In some instances, it could be more beneficial for certain parties to prolong war, so long as they are in control of economic resources or power positions. This can become common in states with weak rule of law where violence becomes privatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elite groups within weak states attempt to harness economic agendas and resources within a given civil society and are motivated to create private profit by mobilizing violent means. Keen continues by citing various possible economic functions of violence.
 
His first example of violent means to promote economic gain is pillaging, whether to gain resources or to supplement or supply wages of soldiers. Another function is extortion of protection money from people who can afford it so they can be spared violence inflicted upon them. A third economic function is the monopolistic control of trade. When state control breaks down, trade that was previously prohibited is more easily facilitated and has the potential to generate substantial amounts of profit for those involved. Primary examples of this are weapons and drugs. A fourth function of conflict is the possible exploitation of labor. The threat of violence can be used to coerce cheap or free labor, with extreme cases resulting in forms of slavery. A fifth short-term function is the ability to stake a claim to land and its resources. Similar to Collier and Hoeffler's argument that weak states cannot easily maintain control over their natural resources due to their rural location and potentially wide dispersion, it is economically beneficial to assert control over minimally defended, resource-rich areas. Extracting benefits from aid that is sent to a conflict area is also beneficial for rebel groups as there are often possibilities to raid resources sent from abroad. Appropriation of aid becomes difficult in a weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Unlike Collier, Keen does not attribute conflict to be driven more by greed than by grievance; he stresses how the two forces interact so that greed generates grievances and rebellion, which in turn legitimizes further greed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keen uses the conflict perpetuated by Milosevic in Serbia as an example of how an extended, endless conflict is preferable to one with a definitive end and a clear winner. Milosevic controlled the media to create grievances among the Serbian population, rally them together, and create a common enemy following NATO bombing. The small group of elites surrounding Milosevic perpetuated conditions that warranted international sanctions in order to better control trade and loot resources. Milosevic realized sanctions were necessary to facilitate the profitable black market transactions that were being made by those closest to him. Had he demobilized or embraced a more peaceful policy, the sanctions would have been lifted and his economic advantage would have disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is what Keen was referring to in his argument that greed and grievance are often tied together and interact with one another. In this way, Milosevic's initial desire for power spurred him to create grievances amongst the Serbs that created the popular support for his sanction-warranting policies to further his economic and political power – the use of grievances to produce further greed.

The strong case for the "greed" argument was made by [[Paul Collier]] and Anke Hoeffler in a study they performed for the [[World Bank]] at the turn of the millennium. Since then, the Collier-Hoeffler Model has been the focus of much of the greed-grievance debate.

One of the leading critics on the 'greed' argument is [[Frances Stewart (economist)|Frances Stewart]]. In her article 'Horizontal Inequalities: A neglected Dimension of Development' she stresses the need to focus on the grievances of the populations since too much focus on inequality between individuals is dangerous for successful development. By using nine case studies she proves how horizontal inequalities have led to violent conflict. 

=== Case study: Afghanistan ===
In south central Asia, along the lawless Afghani-Pakistani border a group called the Taliban have been engaging in what could best be described as a greed based insurgency since 2001. The Taliban's insurgency is in opposition to the NATO and United States supported Afghan transitional government of Hamid Karzai. This brief case study will provide concrete examples of the factors that compose the Greed Model. 
	
One of the primary characteristics of a Greed-based conflict as listed above is the ability to derive income or revenue from natural resource predation.&lt;ref name="Collier_7"/&gt; This requires the presence of a "lootable" resource. In the case of the Taliban insurgency, this resource is the opium poppy. Afghanistan supplies the majority of the world's opium, the market share being as high as 90% in the years directly following the NATO invasion.&lt;ref&gt;BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS AND LAW ENFORC. "2012 INCSR: Country Reports - Afghanistan through Costa Rica."&lt;/ref&gt; The high volume, high revenue nature of the Afghan opium market allows the Taliban to "loot" the resource at every stage of development, from cultivation to heroin sale. Benefits from opium production begin for the Taliban with imposing a 10% tax on farmers growing opium (a protection fee), followed by control over heroin labs and heroin sales to smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|2009|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban, like FARC before them also blur the line between membership to the Taliban and membership to the transnational group of opium smugglers, therefore allowing the insurgency to reap financial rewards from the price bump that comes when the smuggler crosses an international border. In these ways the Taliban are able to fund their insurgency and begin to fall under the characterization of a group of actors in pursuit of greed based conflict.

A second component of the Greed Model is the presence of a large diaspora funding the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we use the traditional definition of a diaspora, the Taliban do not have one. However, they have two extraterritorial means of support based on ethnic affiliation. One comes from funding from wealthy Arabs in the Middle East. This revenue source has been relatively under-researched as the funds are coming from individuals rather than an ethnic bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Walsh. "Taliban raked in $400 million from diverse sources-UN." Reuters, September 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting the diffuse nature of the Arab funding, the Taliban receive considerable support from their Pakistani Pashtun brethren. Pashtun influence has a large impact on the Afghan insurgency. Pakistan's role encompasses a number of characteristics important to the greed model; ethnic homogeneity, a supply of unskilled labor, and lawless borderlands. Collier and Hoeffler discuss the idea that diversity makes conflict more difficult as it is harder to mobilize a heterogeneous ethnic base into rebellion.&lt;ref name="Collier_11"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pashtun ethnic group that straddles the Afghani-Pakistani border is anything but diverse. This allows the Taliban to rapidly acquire recruits. In addition, many Pashtuns in the region are uneducated and poor. This provides the Taliban with another requirement for greed based rebellion; unskilled workers who can fill out security and infantry requirements. The insecurity and lack of formal state governance over the Afghan south-east and the Pakistani west also makes a significant contribution to the robustness of a greed based argument here. The mountainous region between the two states is an ideal hiding place for insurgents and also provides many circuitous avenues for smuggling heroin.

Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan extends beyond the simple trans-border ethnic affiliation. Gretchen Peters cites a strained relationship with its Pakistani neighbors as a problem limiting the success of the Karzai government. Pakistan's government is hostile towards the Afghan transitional government because the transitional government is backed and heavily influenced by international entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|2009|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Inter-Service Intelligence Agency (ISI) of Pakistan has been known to directly support the Taliban with funding, tip offs, and the corruption of government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Waldman. "The sun in the sky: the relationship between Pakistan's ISI and Afghan insurgents", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This constitutes the greed model factor of extraterritorial governmental support for an insurgency laid out by Collier.&lt;ref name="Collier_8"/&gt;

The final explanatory feature important to the Taliban's insurgency as a greed-based rebellion is the influence of a previous rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of the CIA and ISI the young Taliban in the 1990s were pitted against the Soviet Union in proxy war. This enabled the Taliban to do a number of things. They became involved in opium trade, were provided with weapons, and began to construct the organizational aptitude that allows for their continued success today.&lt;ref&gt;Namit Arora. "America, the Cold War, and the Taliban."&lt;/ref&gt; The previous involvement of the Taliban in an armed insurgency allows one of the issues with a greed-based insurgency to be dismissed. Collier and Hoeffler assert that the government has an innate advantage in greed-based conflicts as the government is more organized.&lt;ref name="Collier_11"/&gt; However, in the case of the Afghan conflict this is not true. The transitional government is more fractionalized, less cooperative, and more ethnically divided than the Taliban. Therefore, using the greed-model we should actually expect the Taliban to defeat the transitional government after NATO's withdrawal, as the government possesses few advantages.

This case shows the explanatory power of the greed model, enabling a better understanding of what the variables look like in the real world. In the Afghan case there haven't been many successes in peace building. As the following section will illustrate, the greed model is not without holes or needed additions, but the Taliban insurgency can definitively be characterized as an actor motivated primarily by the conditions that foster the greed model.

Probably the most coherent rebuttal of Collier's work comes from [[David Keen]], articulated in his book ''Complex Emergencies''.


=== Case study 2: Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka is an island country in South Asia that suffered from a violent civil war for more than 25 years. The fighting took place between the majority of the Buddhist Sinhalese population and the minority Hindu Tamils. This brief case study will demonstrate how the civil war was caused by horizontal inequalities and how it therefore supports the 'grievance' argument. 

Injustices can be seen across different ethnic groups. When the people from a certain ethnic group perceive that they are being given less opportunities by the government simply because they belong to that ethnic group, in terms of education and economy for example, it creates grievances. These grievances, which are called horizontal inequalities, lead to violent conflict. The war that took place in Sri Lanka was due to the perceived grievances that the Tamil population experienced during Sinhalese rule. 

Sri Lanka -then called Ceylon- was under British colonial rule from 1815 to 1948&lt;ref name=thoughtco&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Sri Lankan Civil War|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-sri-lankan-civil-war-195086|website=ThoughtCo|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even though the majority of the population was Buddhist Sinhalese, with over three million people, the British people favored the Hindu Tamils, which accounted to 300,000 people. The Tamil population therefore enjoyed privileged access to education and to government employment&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Frances|title=Working Paper Number 81 Horizontal Inequalities: A Neglected Dimension of Development|date=February 2002|volume=Working Paper number 81|issue=QEH Working Paper Series – QEHWPS81|pages=40|url=http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/qehwp/qehwps81.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They held around 40% of University places in science and engineering, medicine and agriculture and veterinary science&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. The appointment of Tamils to bureaucratic positions angered the Sinhalese population and when Great Britain granted Ceylon independence in 1948, the Sinhalese majority aimed at correcting these horizontal inequalities perceived as disadvantageous to them. They made Sinhalese the official language, which drove the Tamils out of the civil service and incorporated educational quotas. The result was an increase on the Sinhalese incomes and a drop in those of the Tamil, which eliminated the previous differential between the two groups&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. However, by the end of the 1970s, Sinhalese were gaining more places at University and because civil service recruitment policies, such as the use of Sinhalese in examinations favored the Sinhalese, their recruitment in relation to population was four times more favorable than that of the Tamils&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. 

While the initial aim was to correct the horizontal inequalities perceived by the Sinhalese population, the result was that instead of just correcting them, they introduced them in their favor. This meant that the Tamil population now felt economically and politically excluded and threatened. As seen, these horizontal inequalities translated into grievances and it was these grievances that allowed extremist leaders to exploit the growing resentment to gain support and start a violent conflict. 

After years of ethnic tensions, the violence was initiated by an insurgent group called the Tamil Tigers, who declared the ‘First Eelam War (1983-87) with the aim of creating a separate Tamil state in northern Sri Lanka&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. The peacekeepers sent by India in 1987 did little to stop the violence and they were forced to retire in 1990. It was then that the Tamil Tigers initiated what they called the second Eelam War, which was even bloodier than the first. Horrible atrocities were committed by both sides, including the use of child suicide bombers and child soldiers and it was not until 2009 that the Sri Lankan government declared victory over the Tamil Tigers&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. It is estimated that at least 100,000 died during the conflict&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. 

As seen, the Tamil Tigers did not start violent conflict due to greed. It was grievances such as a perceived disadvantage over education possibilities, work opportunities, language use and economic prospects that increased the ethnic tensions between the two groups and drove the Tamil Tigers to start a war. 

While there is no doubt that war causes poverty and that once war has broken out it feeds on economic deprivation and underdevelopment, one cannot declare the ‘greed’ argument as a sole explanation of violent conflict. Poverty does not cause war directly, so the greed argument is not strong enough. It is the grievances perceived by a group within a society that drives violent conflict. These grievances do include economic deprivation but also ethnic discrimination, age and gender. As seen with Sri Lanka, these factors are more likely to drive conflict since they also provide a specific environment where charismatic leaders can pick on the grievances and create a sense of group membership that facilitates the outbreak of war.

=== Critiques===
There are many works that rebut the idea of greed vs. grievance. Authors set up alternative ideas that need to be introduced and explored. Even the staunchest proponents of the Greed vs. Grievance theory believe that other outside forces (beyond the greed and/or grievance) can have an effect on conflict, which makes the critiques all the more vital in understanding the theory itself. One of the most prevalent authors in rebutting greed vs. grievance is author David Keen, in his book ''Complex Emergencies''.
	
David Keen, a professor at the Development Studies Institute at the London School of Economics, has several innovative and new ideas regarding the ideas of war.&lt;ref&gt;T. Allen. "Complex emergencies and humanitarian responses." University of London: International Issues (2012): 2-17.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is considered by many to be one of the leading arguments against greed vs. grievance theory. His ideas look into the specifics of complex emergencies, which is a term officially defined by the InterAgency Standing Committee (IASC) as:
"A multifaceted humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is a total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires a multi-sectoral, international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing UN country program. Such emergencies have, in particular, a devastating effect on children and women and call for a complex range of responses."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (2008). OCHA Glossary of Humanitarian Terms 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Keen discusses how a conflict can never be simply a greed scenario. His definition of a "complex emergency" demonstrates this broader term and all of its various implications. 
	
In his book, Keen goes into several different conflict scenarios, such as 'war', 'famine', and 'information', and then sets up an argument against the idea of greed. He believes that although a conflict, whether it be the 'War on Terror' or the conflict in Sierra Leone, may be centered around some concept of greed or grievance, this can never solely explain a conflict. Although seemingly obvious, Keen looks to demonstrate that, "the aims in a war are complex".&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;David Keen. "Complex Emergencies: David Keen Responds" African Arguments: Royal African Society.&lt;/ref&gt; He does not believe that greed and grievance can be examined separately, but rather that they are partner terms that must be implemented in a complementary way. For example, when Keen discusses the conflict in Sudan, he says, " the grievances of northern pastoralists were useful for a government trying to get its hands on oil in areas that famine and militia attacks helped to depopulate; meanwhile, the 'greed' of the Arab militias themselves (for labour, cattle and land) was itself intimately linked to their grievances".&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt; He makes it clear that it is necessary to first spend ample time defining the type of conflict at hand because the differences between genocide and a civil war are substantial, so it is necessary to diagnose the incentives and solutions for the conflict with a mix of multiple theories. 
	
Keen specifically critiques Paul Collier, a leading expert in greed vs. grievance theory, by claiming that Collier became too comfortable with "numbers", and needed to rely more on the actual opinions of people involved in conflicts. He spoke of Collier's work and said, "This is where econometrics tips over into arrogance and starts closing down the possibility of a genuine understanding of conflicts or, by extension, of a political settlement that addresses underlying grievances".&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt; He doesn't believe that it can be dismissed so easily. He was documented saying, "It also annoys me that a lot of the 'scientific air' of the Collier work is quite bogus as the selection of proxies is so arbitrary", which demonstrated a distinct attack on Collier's work, which emphasizes quantitative data.&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt;

David Keen is one of the major critics of greed vs. grievance theory, defined primarily by Paul Collier, and argues the point that a conflict, although he cannot define it, cannot be pinpointed to simply one motive. He believes that conflicts are much more complex and thus should not be analyzed through simplified methods. He disagrees with the quantitative research methods of Collier and believes a stronger emphasis should be put on personal data and human perspective of the people in conflict. This isn't necessarily a complete dismissal of the greed vs. grievance theory, but rather a critique on its polarity and methods of data collection. 
	
Beyond Keen, several other authors have introduced works that either disprove greed vs. grievance theory with empirical data, or dismiss its ultimate conclusion. Authors such as Cristina Bodea and Ibrahim Elbadawi, who co-wrote the entry, "Riots, coups and civil war: Revisiting the greed and grievance debate", argue that empirical data can disprove many of the proponents of greed theory and make the idea "irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bodea. "Riots, coups and civil war : revisiting the greed and grievance debate."

{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}

'''Healing''' is the process of the restoration of [[health]] from an unbalanced, diseased or damaged organism. The result of healing can be a cure to a health challenge, but one can heal without being cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samueliinstitute.org/File%20Library/About%20Us/Samueli-Institute-Strategic-Plan.pdf|title=Building the Science of Healing|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession of nursing has been traditionally concerned with matters of healing, whereas historically the profession of medicine has been concerned with curing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McElligott|first=D|date=2010|title=Healing: The journey from concept to nursing practice|journal=Journal of Holistic Nursing|volume=28 | issue = 4 |pages=251–9|via=|pmid=20660908|doi=10.1177/0898010110376321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and the [[biological system]] as a whole and resumption of normal functioning. It is the process by which the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[Human body|body]] regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or [[necrosis|necrotic]] area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by ''regeneration'' in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form similar tissue as was originally there; or by ''repair'' in which injured tissue is replaced with [[scar|scar tissue]]. Most [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms.

It is also referred to in the context of the grieving process.

In [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]], healing is the process by which [[neuroses]] and [[psychoses]] are resolved to the degree that the client is able to lead a normal or fulfilling existence without being overwhelmed by [[Psychopathology|psychopathological]] phenomena. This process may involve [[psychotherapy]], [[pharmaceutical]] treatment or [[alternative medicine|alternative]] approaches such as [[Holistic health|traditional spiritual healing]].

==Regeneration==
In order for an [[injury]] to be healed by regeneration, the cell type that was destroyed must be able to replicate. Cells also need a [[collagen]] framework along which to grow. Alongside most cells there is either a [[basement membrane]] or a [[extracellular matrix|collagenous network]] made by [[fibroblast]]s that will guide the cells' growth.  Since [[ischaemia]] and most [[toxin]]s do not destroy collagen, it will continue to exist even when the cells around it are dead.

===Example===
[[Acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) in the [[kidney]] is a case in which cells heal completely by regeneration. ATN occurs when the [[epithelial cell]]s that line the kidney are destroyed by either a lack of [[oxygen]] (such as in [[hypovolemic shock]], when blood supply to the kidneys is dramatically reduced), or by toxins (such as some [[antibiotic]]s, [[heavy metals]] or [[carbon tetrachloride]]).

Although many of these epithelial cells are dead, there is typically patchy necrosis, meaning that there are patches of epithelial cells still alive. In addition, the collagen framework of the tubules remains completely intact.

The existing epithelial cells can replicate, and, using the basement membrane as a guide, eventually bring the kidney back to normal. After regeneration is complete, the damage is undetectable, even [[Microscope|microscopically]].

Healing must happen by repair in the case of injury to cells that are unable to regenerate (e.g. neurons). Also, damage to the collagen network (e.g. by [[enzyme]]s or physical destruction), or its total collapse (as can happen in an [[infarct]]) cause healing to take place by repair.

==Genetics==
Many genes play a role in healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=21719 | pmid=9751744 | volume=95 | title=Genetic analysis of a mammalian wound-healing trait | author=McBrearty BA, Clark LD, Zhang XM, Blankenhorn EP, Heber-Katz E | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=11792–7 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.20.11792}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in wound healing, P21 has been found to allow mammals to heal spontaneously. It even allows some mammals (like mice) to heal wounds without scars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/mar/15/mice-genetics-p21-heal-no-scar Genetic discovery promises healing without scars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/107/13/5845.abstract Lack of p21 expression links cell cycle control and appendage regeneration in mice]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LIN28]] gene also plays a role in wound healing. It is dormant in most mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-limb-regeneration-ins/ New Limb Regeneration Insight Surprises Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the proteins [[MG53]] and [[TGF beta 1]] play important roles in wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302135149.htm Gene identified that helps wound healing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wound healing==
{{main | Wound healing}}

In response to an incision or wound, a [[Wound healing|wound healing cascade]] is unleashed.  This cascade takes place in four phases: clot formation, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation.

===Clotting phase===
Healing of a wound begins with [[clot]] formation to stop bleeding and to reduce infection by bacteria, [[virus]]es and [[fungi]]. Clotting is followed by [[neutrophil]] invasion three to 24 hours after the wound has been incurred, with [[mitosis|mitoses]] beginning in [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells after 24 to 48 hours .{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Inflammation phase===
In the inflammatory phase, [[macrophage]]s and other [[phagocytosis|phagocytic]] cells kill bacteria, debride damaged tissue and release chemical factors such as [[growth hormone]]s that encourage fibroblasts, [[epithelial cell]]s and endothelial cells which make new [[capillary|capillaries]] to migrate to the area and divide.

===Proliferative phase===
In the proliferative phase, immature [[granulation tissue]] containing plump, active fibroblasts forms. Fibroblasts quickly produce abundant type III [[collagen]], which fills the defect left by an open wound. Granulation tissue moves, as a wave, from the border of the injury towards the center.

As granulation tissue matures, the fibroblasts produce less collagen and become more spindly in appearance. They begin to produce the much stronger type I collagen. Some of the fibroblasts mature into myofibroblasts which contain the same type of [[actin]] found in [[smooth muscle]], which enables them to contract and reduce the size of the wound.

===Maturation phase===
During the maturation phase of wound healing, unnecessary vessels formed in granulation tissue are removed by [[apoptosis]], and type III collagen is largely replaced by type I. Collagen which was originally disorganized is cross-linked and aligned along tension lines. This phase can last a year or longer. Ultimately a scar made of collagen, containing a small number of fibroblasts is left.

== Tissue damaged by inflammation ==
After inflammation has damaged tissue (when combatting bacterial infection for example) and pro-inflammatory [[eicosanoid]]s have completed their function, healing proceeds in 4 phases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Anti-Inflammation Zone'', Barry Sears, pages 230-233, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall phase===
In the recall phase the [[adrenal gland]]s increase production of [[cortisol]] which shuts down eicosanoid production and inflammation.

===Resolution phase===
In the Resolution phase, pathogens and damaged tissue are removed by [[macrophage]]s (white blood cells). Red blood cells are also removed from the damaged tissue by macrophages. Failure to remove all of the damaged cells and pathogens may retrigger inflammation. The two subsets of macrophage M1 &amp; M2 plays a crucial role in this phase, M1 macrophage being a pro inflammatory while as M2 is a regenerative and the plasticity between the two subsets determine the tissue inflammation or repair.

===Regeneration phase===
In the Regeneration phase, blood vessels are repaired and new cells form in the damaged site similar to the cells that were damaged and removed.  Some cells such as neurons and muscle cells (especially in the heart) are slow to recover.

===Repair phase===
In the Repair phase, new tissue is generated which requires a balance of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids.  Anti-inflammatory eicosanoids include [[lipoxin]]s, [[epi-lipoxin]]s, and [[resolvin]]s, which cause release of growth hormones.

A '''hickey''', '''hickie''' or '''love bite''' in [[British English]], is a [[bruise]] or bruise-like mark caused by the [[kissing]] or sucking of the [[skin]], usually on the [[neck]] or [[arm]]. While biting might be part of giving a hickey, sucking is sufficient to burst small superficial [[blood vessels]] under the skin. 

The origin of the word is from its earlier meaning of "pimple, skin lesion" (c. 1915); perhaps a sense extension and spelling variation from the earlier word meaning "small gadget, device; any unspecified object" which has an unknown origin (1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/hickie|title=hickie - Origin and meaning of hickie by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickeys typically last from 5 to 12 days and may be treated in the same way as other bruises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ownarticles.com/how-long-do-hickeys-last |title=How Long Do Hickeys Last |date=April 15, 2016|website=ownarticles.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520071039/http://ownarticles.com/how-long-do-hickeys-last |archivedate=2016-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ways to reduce the appearance of hickeys include icing recent hickeys to reduce swelling, rubbing them with a chilled spoon to remove the bruise, and applying a [[warm compress]] to older hickeys to dilate vessels and promote blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/relationships/man-woman/Ouch-Thats-a-lovebite/articleshow/4680691.cms|title=Ouch!

Alternatively, articles of clothing such as [[scarf|scarves]], [[snood (headgear)|snoods]], [[polo neck|turtle necks]], or [[sleeve]]s may be used to conceal hickeys.

The '''history of X-ray astronomy''' begins in the 1920s, with interest in [[short wave|short wave communications]] for the [[U.S. Navy]].  This was soon followed by extensive study of the earth's [[ionosphere]]. By 1927, interest in the detection of X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) radiation at high altitudes inspired researchers to launch [[Robert Goddard|Goddard's rockets]] into the upper atmosphere to support theoretical studies and data gathering. The first successful rocket flight equipped with instrumentation able to detect [[ultraviolet|solar ultraviolet radiation]] occurred in 1946. [[X-ray solar studies]] began in 1949. By 1973 a solar instrument package orbited on [[Skylab]] providing significant solar data.&lt;ref name=nrspcr&gt;

In 1965 the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] program in [[X-ray astronomy]] was initiated with a series of balloon-borne experiments. In the 1970s this was followed by high altitude [[sounding rocket]] experiments, and that was followed by orbiting (satellite) observatories.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;

The first rocket flight to successfully detect a cosmic source of [[Astronomical object|X-ray emission]] was launched in 1962 by a group at [[American Science and Engineering]] (AS&amp;E).&lt;ref name=imagine/&gt;

X-ray wavelengths reveal information about the bodies (sources) that emit them.&lt;ref name=Keller/&gt;

==1920s to the 1940s==
The [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) opened in 1923.  After [[E.O. Hulburt]] (1890-1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |date=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58664.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrived there in 1924 he studied [[physical optics]]. The NRL was conducting research on the properties of the [[ionosphere]] (''Earth's reflecting layer'') because of interest in [[short wave radio]] communications. Hubert (Hulburt ?) produced a series of [[mathematical physics|mathematical description]]s of the ionosphere during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1927, at the [[Carnegie Institution]] of Washington,  Hulburt, [[Gregory Breit]] and [[Merle Tuve]] explored the possibility of equipping [[Robert Goddard]]'s rockets to explore the upper atmosphere. In 1929 Hulburt proposed an experimental program in which a rocket might be instrumented to explore the upper atmosphere. This proposal included detection of [[ultraviolet]] radiation and [[X rays]] at high altitudes.&lt;ref name=nrspcr/&gt;

[[Herbert Friedman]] began X-ray solar studies in 1949 and soon reported that the energy of "the solar X-ray spectrum ... is adequate to account for all of [[E-layer]] ionization." Thus one of Hulburt's original questions, the source and behavior of the radio-reflecting layer, began to find its answer in [[space science|space research]].&lt;ref name=nrspcr/&gt;

At the end of the 1930s other studies included the inference of an X-ray corona by optical methods and, in 1949, more direct evidence by detecting X-ray photons.&lt;ref name=Gudel&gt;

Because the [[Earth's atmosphere]] blocks X-rays at ground level, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]'s discovery had no effect on observational astronomy for the first 50 years. [[X-ray astronomy]] became possible only with the capability to use rockets that far exceeded the altitudes of balloons. In 1948 U.S. researchers used a German-made V-2 rocket to gather the first records of solar x-rays.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;

The NRL has placed instruments in rockets, satellites, Skylab, and Spacelab 2&lt;ref name=nrspcr/&gt;

Through the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the sensitivity of detectors increased greatly during the 60 years of X-ray astronomy. In addition, the ability to focus X-rays has developed enormously—allowing the production of high-quality images. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==1960s==
The study of [[astronomical objects]] at the highest energies of [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]] began in the early 1960s. Before then, scientists knew only that the Sun was an intense source in these [[EM spectrum|wavebands]]. Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays and gamma rays, so rocket flights that could lift scientific payloads above Earth's atmosphere were needed. The first rocket flight to successfully detect a cosmic source of [[X-ray emission]] was launched in 1962 by a group at American Science and Engineering (AS&amp;E). The team of scientists on this project included [[Riccardo Giacconi]], [[Herbert Gursky]], Frank Paolini, and [[Bruno Rossi]]. This rocket flight used a small [[X-ray detector]], which found a very bright source they named [[Scorpius X-1]], because it was the first [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray source]] found in the constellation [[Scorpius]].&lt;ref name=imagine/&gt;

==1970s==
In the 1970s, dedicated [[X-ray astronomy satellite]]s, such as [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]], [[Ariel 5]], [[SAS-3]], [[OSO-8]] and [[HEAO-1]], developed this field of science at an astounding pace. Scientists hypothesized that X-rays from stellar sources in our galaxy were primarily from a [[neutron star]] in a [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] with a [[normal star]]. In these "X-ray binaries," the X-rays originate from material traveling from the normal star to the neutron star in a process called [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]. The binary nature of the system allowed astronomers to measure the mass of the neutron star. For other systems, the inferred mass of the X-ray emitting object supported the idea of the existence of [[black holes]], as they were too massive to be neutron stars. Other systems displayed a characteristic [[X-ray pulse]], just as [[pulsars]] had been found to do in the radio regime, which allowed a determination of the spin rate of the [[neutron star]].

Finally, some of these [[galactic X-ray sources]] were found to be highly variable. In fact, some sources would appear in the sky, remain bright for a few weeks, and then fade again from view. Such sources are called [[X-ray transient]]s. The inner regions of some galaxies were also found to emit X-rays. The X-ray emission from these active galactic nuclei is believed to originate from ultra-relativistic gas near a very massive black hole at the galaxy's center. Lastly, a diffuse X-ray emission was found to exist all over the sky.&lt;ref name=imagine/&gt;

==1980s to the present==
The study of X-ray astronomy continued to be carried out using data from a host of satellites that were active from the 1980s to the early 2000s: the [[HEAO Program]], [[EXOSAT]], [[Ginga (satellite)|Ginga]], [[RXTE]], [[ROSAT]], [[Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics|ASCA]], as well as [[BeppoSAX]], which detected the first afterglow of a [[gamma-ray burst]] (GRB).  Data from these satellites continues to aid our further understanding of the nature of these sources and the mechanisms by which the X-rays and gamma rays are emitted. Understanding these mechanisms can in turn shed light on the fundamental [[physics]] of our universe. By looking at the sky with X-ray and gamma-ray instruments, we collect important information in our attempt to address questions such as how the universe began and how it evolves, and gain some insight into its eventual fate.&lt;ref name=imagine&gt;

==Goddard Space Flight Center==

===Balloons===
In 1965, at the suggestion of Frank McDonald, Elihu Boldt initiated Goddard's program in X-ray astronomy with a series of balloon-borne experiments. At an early stage he was joined by Peter Serlemitsos, who had just completed his PhD space physics thesis on magnetospheric electrons, and by Guenter Riegler, a University of Maryland physics graduate student interested in doing his dissertation research in astrophysics.

From 1965 to 1972 there were over a dozen balloon-borne experiments (mostly from New Mexico), including the first such to take place from Australia (1966), one in which hard X-ray emission was discovered (albeit with crude angular resolution) from a region towards the [[Galactic Center]] whose centroid is located among subsequently identified sources GX1+4, GX3+1, and GX5-1. A balloon-borne experiment in 1968 was based on the multi-anode multi-layer xenon gas proportional chamber that had recently been developed in our lab and represented the first use of such a high performance instrument for X-ray astronomy.

Due to the attenuation of soft X-rays by the residual atmosphere at balloon altitudes these early experiments were restricted to energies above ~20 keV. Observations down to lower energies were begun with a series of high altitude sounding rocket experiments; by this stage Steve Holt had already joined the program. A 1972 rocket-borne observation of Cas A, the youngest supernova remnant in our galaxy, yielded the first detection of an X-ray spectral line, iron K-line emission at ~7 keV.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;

===Rockets===
[[File:Rocket graph.gif|thumb|200px|right|Graph]]
The figure to the right shows 15-second samples of the raw counts (per 20.48ms) observed in a 1973 sounding-rocket-borne exposure to three of the X-ray brightest binary sources in our galaxy: Her X-1 (1.7 days), Cyg X-3 (0.2 day), and Cyg X-1 (5.6 days). The 1.24 second pulsar period associated with Her X-1 is immediately evident from the data, while the rate profile for Cyg X-3 is completely consistent with the statistical fluctuations in counts expected for a source that is constant, at least for the 15s duration of the exposure shown; the Cyg X-1 data, on the other hand, clearly exhibit the chaotic "shot noise" behavior characteristic of this black-hole candidate and also provided preliminary evidence for the additional feature of millisecond "burst" sub-structure, noted for the first time in this observation. The sharp cut-off at ~24 keV in the flat spectrum observed for Her X-1 in this exposure provided the first reported evidence for radiative transfer effects to be associated with a highly magnetized plasma near the surface of a neutron star. The black-body spectral component observed for Cyg X-3 during this experiment gave strong evidence that this emission is from the immediate vicinity of a compact object the size of a neutron star.

An observation of Cyg X-3 a year later with the same instrument yielded an optically thin thermal spectrum for this source and provided the first evidence for strong spectral iron K-line emission from an X-ray binary.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;

===Orbiting observatories===
[[File:Rxte.jpg|thumb|200px|The '''[[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]]''' ('''RXTE''') is a satellite that observes the time structure of astronomical X-ray sources.  The RXTE has three instruments—the Proportional Counter Array, the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE), and one instrument called the All Sky Monitor.  The RXTE observes X-rays from [[black holes]], [[neutron stars]], [[X-ray pulsars]] and [[x-ray bursts]].]]

Our large area PCA (Proportional Counter Array) on the current RXTE ([[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]]) mission genuinely reflects the heritage of our sounding rocket program. RXTE continues to provide very valuable data as it enters the second decade of successful operation. 
Goddard's ASM (All-Sky Monitor) pin-hole X-ray camera on Ariel-5 (1974-1980) was the first X-ray astronomy experiment to use imaging proportional counters (albeit one-dimensional); it provided information on transient sources and the long-term behavior of several bright objects. Jean Swank joined the program in time for the beginning of our OSO-8 experiment (1975-1978), the first broadband (2-40 keV) orbiting observatory based on multi-anode multi-layer proportional chambers, one that showed the power of X-ray spectroscopy; for example, it established that iron K-line emission is a ubiquitous feature of clusters of galaxies.&lt;ref name=goddard/&gt;

The HEAO-1 A2 full-sky cosmic X-ray experiment (1977-1979) provided the most comprehensive data (still the most definitive) on the cosmic X-ray background broadband spectrum and large-scale structure, and a much used complete sample of the brightest extragalactic sources;  it posed the challenging "spectral paradox" just now being unraveled with new results on evolution (from deep surveys) and on individual source spectra extending into the gamma-ray band. The SSS (Solid State Spectrometer) at the focus of the HEAO-2 Einstein Observatory (1978-1981) grazing incidence telescope was the first high spectral resolution non-dispersive spectrometer to be used for X-ray astronomy, here for energies up to ~3 [[Electronvolt|keV]], limited by the telescope optics.

By the use of conical foil optics, developed in our lab, the response of a grazing incidence X-ray telescope was extended to 12 keV, amply covering the crucial iron K-band of emission. A cooled Si(Li) solid state detector was used at the focus of such a telescope for the BBXRT (Broad Band X-Ray Telescope) on the Astro-1 shuttle mission (STS-35)  on Columbia in December 1990, the first broadband (0.3-12keV) X-ray observatory to use focusing optics.

In collaboration with X-ray astronomers in Japan, Goddard supplied conical foil X-ray optics have been used for the joint Japanese and American [[ASCA mission]] (1993-2000). It was the first broadband imaging observatory using CCD non-dispersive spectrometers.

Substantial improvement in the capability of solid-state non-dispersive spectrometers has been achieved in our lab (in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin) by the successful development of quantum calorimeters with resolution better than 10 eV (FWHM). Such spectrometers have been used in a sounding-rocket-borne experiment to study spectral lines from the hot interstellar medium of our galaxy and will soon play a major role in the joint Japanese/American Suzaku orbiting X-ray observatory launched in July 2005.

The critical early stages of this program benefited from highly dedicated technical support by Dale Arbogast, Frank Birsa, Ciro Cancro, Upendra Desai, Henry Doong, Charles Glasser, Sid Jones, and Frank Shaffer. More than 20 graduate students (mostly from the University of Maryland at College Park) have successfully carried out their PhD dissertation research within our X-ray astronomy program. Almost all of these former students have remained actively involved with astrophysics.&lt;ref name=goddard&gt;

This is V-2 number 54, launched January 18, 1951 (photo by Dr. Richard Tousey, NRL).]]
The beginning of the search for X-ray sources from above the Earth's atmosphere was on [[Spaceflight before 1951|August 5, 1948 12:07]] GMT. A US Army [[V-2]] as part of [[Hermes project|Project Hermes]] was launched from [[White Sands Proving Grounds]] Launch Complex (LC) 33. In addition to carrying experiments of the US [[Naval Research Laboratory]]&lt;ref name=USArmy0&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 3 1948 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19483.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for cosmic and solar radiation, temperature, pressure, ionosphere, and photography, there was on board a solar X-ray test detector, which functioned properly. The missile reached an apogee of 166&amp;nbsp;km.

As part of a collaboration between the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratory (SCEL) of the University of Michigan, another V-2 (V-2 42 configuration) was launched from White Sands LC33 on December 9, 1948 at 16:08 GMT (09:08 local time).&lt;ref name=NRLUMich&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 4 1948 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19484.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missile reached an apogee of 108.7&amp;nbsp;km and carried aeronomy (winds, pressure, temperature), solar X-ray and radiation, and biology experiments.

On January 28, 1949, an NRL X-ray detector (Blossom) was placed in the nose cone of a [[V-2]] rocket and launched at [[White Sands Missile Range]] in New Mexico. X-rays from the Sun were detected.&lt;ref name="rockooni"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 1 1949 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19491.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408082333/http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19491.htm |archivedate=2010-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apogee: 60&amp;nbsp;km.

A second collaborative effort (NRL/SCEL) using a V-2 UM-3 configuration launched on April 11, 1949 at 22:05 GMT. Experiments included solar X-ray detection, apogee: 87.4&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=nrl2&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 2 1949 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19492.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using V-2 53 configuration a solar X-ray experiment was launched on February 17, 1950 from White Sands LC 33 at 18:01 GMT reaching an apogee of 148&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=nrl4&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 1 1950 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19501.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last V-2 launch number TF2/TF3 came on August 22, 1952 07:33 GMT from White Sands reaching an apogee of 78.2&amp;nbsp;km and carried experiments
*solar X-ray for NRL,
*cosmic radiation for the National Institute of Health (NIH), and
*sky brightness for the Air Research and Development Command.&lt;ref name=nrl6&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 3 1952 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19523.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerobee period===
[[Image:AerobeeHi.jpg|thumb|200px|Aerobee Hi Missile, White Sands Missile Range Museum.]]
The first successful launch of an [[Aerobee]] occurred on May 5, 1952 13:44 GMT from [[White Sands Proving Grounds]] launch complex LC35.&lt;ref name=nrl5&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 2 1952 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19522.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an Aerobee RTV-N-10 configuration reaching an apogee of 127&amp;nbsp;km with NRL experiments for solar X-ray and ultraviolet detection.

On April 19, 1960, an [[Office of Naval Research]] Aerobee Hi made a series of X-ray photographs of the Sun from an altitude of 208&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Emme&gt;{{cite web |author=Emme EM |title=U.S. Navy in Space Chronology, 1945 - 1981 |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq124-1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstay of the US IGY rocket stable was the Aerobee Hi, which was modified and improved to create the Aerobee 150.

An [[Aerobee]] 150 rocket launched on June 12, 1962 detected the first X-rays from other celestial sources (Scorpius X-1).

===USSR V-2 derivative launches===
Starting on June 21, 1959 from Kapustin Yar, with a modified [[V-2]] designated the R-5V,&lt;ref name=Kapustin&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 2 1959 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19592.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the USSR launched a series of four vehicles to detect solar X-rays: a R-2A on July 21, 1959 and two R-11A at 02:00 GMT and 14:00 GMT.&lt;ref name=Kapustin1&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 3 1959 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19593.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skylark===
The British [[Skylark (rocket)|Skylark]] was probably the most successful of the many sounding rocket programs. The first launched in 1957 from [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]], Australia and its 441st and final launch took place from [[Esrange]], Sweden on 2 May 2005. Launches were carried out from sites in Australia, Europe, and South America, with use by [[NASA]], the European Space Research Organisation ([[ESRO]]), and [[German Aerospace Center|German]] and [[Swedish Space Corporation|Swedish]] space organizations.&lt;ref name=Godwin&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew Godwin |title=The Skylark Rocket: British Space Science and the European Space Research Organisation, 1957–1972 |publisher=Beauchesne Editeur |location=Paris|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skylark was used to obtain the first good-quality X-ray images of the solar corona.&lt;ref name=Pounds&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Pounds K |title=Forty years on from Aerobee 150: a personal perspective |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | date=2002 |volume=360 |issue=1798 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2002.1044 |pmid=12804236|bibcode = 2002RSPTA.360.1905P |pages=1905–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first X-ray surveys of the sky in the Southern Hemisphere were provided by Skylark launches.&lt;ref name=Pounds/&gt; It was also used with high precision in September and October 1972 in an effort to locate the optical counterpart of X-ray source GX3+1 by lunar occultation.&lt;ref name=Pounds/&gt;

===Véronique===
The French [[Véronique (rocket)|Véronique]] was successfully launched on April 14, 1964&lt;ref name=France&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 2 1964 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19642.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Hammaguir]]a, LC Blandine carrying experiments to measure UV and X-ray intensities and the FU110 to measure UV intensity from the [[Hydrogen spectral series|atomic H]] (Lyman-α) line, and again on November 4, 1964.&lt;ref name=France1&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology - Quarter 4 1964 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19644.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early satellites===
[[Image:Galactic Radiation and Background satellite 1.jpg|thumb|200px|This is a display model of a [[Galactic Radiation and Background|GRAB]] satellite at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]]. The satellites carried two sets of instruments: an unclassified experiment (called Solrad) and a then-classified payload to collect electronic intelligence ([[Signals intelligence|ELINT]]) (called Tattletale).]]
[[Image:Thor Delta-1A small.gif|thumb|200px|The satellites launched with the Thor-Delta rocket system became known as the TD satellites. TD-1A was successfully launched on March 11, 1972 from Vandenberg Air Force Base (March 12 in Europe).]]
The SOLar RADiation satellite program (SOLRAD) was conceived in the late 1950s to study the Sun's effects on Earth, particularly during periods of heightened solar activity.&lt;ref name=Calderwood&gt;{{cite web |author=Calderwood TD |title=Highlights of NRL's First 75 Years |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/NewsRoom/images/75highlights.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SOLRAD I|Solrad 1]] was launched on June 22, 1960 aboard a [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor Able]] from [[Cape Canaveral]] at 1:54&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT.&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite web |author=Dick SJ |title=June 2005 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/chronologies/jun%202005.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the world's first orbiting astronomical observatory, [[SOLRAD I]] determined that radio fade-outs were caused by solar X-ray emissions.&lt;ref name=Calderwood/&gt;

The first in a series of 8 successfully launched [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|Orbiting Solar Observatories]] ([[OSO 1]], launched on March 7, 1963) had as its primary mission to measure solar electromagnetic radiation in the UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regions.

The first USA satellite which detected cosmic X-rays was the Third Orbiting Solar Observatory, or [[OSO-3]], launched on March 8, 1967. It was intended primarily to observe the Sun, which it did very well during its 2-year lifetime, but it also detected a flaring episode from the source Sco X-1 and measured the [[Diffuse X-ray background|diffuse cosmic X-ray background]].

[[OSO 5]] was launched on January 22, 1969, and lasted until July 1975. It was the 5th satellite put into orbit as part of the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] program. This program was intended to launch a series of nearly identical satellites to cover an entire 11-year solar cycle. The circular orbit had an altitude of 555&amp;nbsp;km and an inclination of 33°. The spin rate of the satellite was 1.8 s. The data produced a spectrum of the diffuse background over the energy range 14-200 keV.

[[OSO 6]] was launched on August 9, 1969.&lt;ref name=Hoff&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoff HA |title=Exosat - the new extrasolar X-ray observatory |journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc. |date=Aug 1983 |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=363–7 |bibcode=1983JBIS...36..363H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its orbital period was ~95 min.&lt;ref name=LochnerGibb&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sixth Orbit Solar Observatory (OSO-6) |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sats_n_data/missions/oso6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft had a spin rate of 0.5 rps. On board was a hard X-ray detector (27-189 keV) with a 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; NaI(Tl) scintillator, collimated to 17° × 23° FWHM. The system had 4 energy channels (separated 27-49-75-118-189 keV). The detector spun with the spacecraft on a plane containing the Sun direction within ± 3.5°. Data were read with alternate 70 ms and 30 ms integrations for 5 intervals every 320 ms.&lt;ref name=LochnerGibb/&gt;

[[TD-1A]] was put in a nearly circular polar sun-synchronous orbit, with apogee 545&amp;nbsp;km, perigee 533&amp;nbsp;km, and inclination 97.6°. It was ESRO's first 3-axis stabilized satellite, with one axis pointing to the Sun to within ±5°. The optical axis was maintained perpendicular to the solar pointing axis and to the orbital plane. It scanned the entire celestial sphere every 6 months, with a great circle being scanned every satellite revolution. After about 2 months of operation, both of the satellite's tape recorders failed. A network of ground stations was put together so that real-time telemetry from the satellite was recorded for about 60% of the time. After 6 months in orbit, the satellite entered a period of regular eclipses as the satellite passed behind the Earth—cutting off sunlight to the solar panels. The satellite was put into hibernation for 4 months, until the eclipse period passed, after which systems were turned back on and another 6 months of observations were made. [[TD-1A]] was primarily a UV mission however it carried both a cosmic X-ray and a gamma-ray detector. TD-1A reentered on January 9, 1980.

==Surveying and cataloging X-ray sources==
[[OSO 7]] was primarily a solar observatory designed to point a battery of UV and X-ray telescopes at the Sun from a platform mounted on a cylindrical wheel. The detectors for observing cosmic X-ray sources were X-ray proportional counters. The hard X-ray telescope operated over the energy range 7 - 550 keV. OSO 7 performed an X-ray All-sky survey and discovered the 9-day periodicity in [[Vela X-1]] which led to its optical identification as a HMXRB. OSO 7 was launched on September 29, 1971 and operated until May 18, 1973.

[[Skylab]], a science and engineering laboratory, was launched into Earth orbit by a Saturn V rocket on May 14, 1973. Detailed X-ray studies of the Sun were performed. The S150 experiment performed a faint X-ray source survey. The S150 was mounted atop the SIV-B upper stage of the Saturn 1B rocket which orbited briefly behind and below Skylab on July 28, 1973. The entire SIV-B stage underwent a series of preprogrammed maneuvers, scanning about 1° every 15 seconds, to allow the instrument to sweep across selected regions of the sky. The pointing direction was determined during data processing, using the inertial guidance system of the SIV-B stage combined with information from two visible star sensors which formed part of the experiment. Galactic X-ray sources were observed with the S150 experiment. The experiment was designed to detect 4.0-10.0&amp;nbsp;nm photons. It consisted of a single large (~1500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) proportional counter, electrically divided by fine wire ground planes into separate signal-collecting areas and looking through collimator vanes. The collimators defined 3 intersecting fields of view (~2 × 20°) on the sky, which allowed source positions to be determined to ~ 30'. The front window of the instrument consisted of a 2&amp;nbsp;µm thick plastic sheet. The counter gas was a mixture of argon and methane. Analysis of the data from the S150 experiment provided strong evidence that the soft X-ray background cannot be explained as the cumulative effect of many unresolved point sources.

Skylab's solar studies: UV and X-ray solar photography for highly ionized atoms, X-ray spectrography of solar flares and active regions, and X-ray emissions of lower solar corona.

[[Salyut 4]] space station was launched on December 26, 1974. It was in an orbit of 355 × 343&amp;nbsp;km, with an orbital period of 91.3 minutes, inclined at 51.6°. The X-ray telescope began observations on January 15, 1975.

Orbiting Solar Observatory ([[OSO 8]]) was launched on June 21, 1975. While OSO 8's primary objective was to observe the Sun, four instruments were dedicated to observations of other celestial X-ray sources brighter than a few milliCrab. A sensitivity of 0.001 of the Crab nebula source (= 1 "mCrab"). [[OSO 8]] ceased operations on October 1, 1978.

==X-ray source variability==
[[Image:P78-1-Solarwind sat.gif|thumb|200px|right|The P78-1 or Solwind satellite]]
Although several earlier X-ray observatories initiated the endeavor to study X-ray source variability, once the catalogs of X-ray sources were firmly established, more extensive studies could commence.

[[Prognoz 6]] carried two NaI(Tl) scintillators (2-511 keV, 2.2-98 keV), and a [[proportional counter]] (2.2-7 keV) to study solar X-rays.

The Space Test Program spacecraft [[P78-1]] or Solwind was launched on February 24, 1979 and continued operating until September 13, 1985, when it was shot down in orbit during an [[US Air Force|Air Force]] [[ASM-135 ASAT]] test. The platform was of the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) type, with a solar-oriented sail and a rotating wheel section. P78-1 was in a noon-midnight, Sun-synchronous orbit at 600&amp;nbsp;km altitude. The orbital inclination of 96° implied that a substantial fraction of the orbit was spent at high latitude, where the particle background prevented detector operation. In-flight experience showed that good data were obtained between 35° N and 35° S geomagnetic latitude outside the South Atlantic Anomaly. This yields an instrument duty cycle of 25-30%. Telemetry data were obtained for about 40-50% of the orbits, yielding a net data return of 10-15%. Though this data rate appears low, it means that about 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; seconds of good data reside in the XMON data base.

Data from the P78-1 X-Ray Monitor experiment offered source monitoring with a sensitivity comparable to that of instruments flown on [[SAS-3]], [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|OSO-8]], or [[Hakucho]], and the advantages of longer observing times and unique temporal coverage. Five fields of inquiry were particularly well suited for investigation with P78-1 data:
*study of pulsational, eclipse, precession, and intrinsic source variability on time scales of tens of seconds to months in galactic X-ray sources.
*pulse timing studies of neutron stars.
*identification and study of new transient sources.

Launched on February 21, 1981, the [[Hinotori (satellite)|Hinotori]] satellite observations of the 1980s pioneered hard X-ray imaging of solar flares.&lt;ref name=Hudson&gt;{{cite web |author=Hudson H |author2=Sato J |author3=Takasaki H |title=Coronal hard X-rays and millimeter waves |date=2002 |url=http://solar.physics.montana.edu/nuggets/2002/020329/020329.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenma]] was the second Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite launched on February 20, 1983. Tenma carried [[Goddard Space Flight Center|GSFC]] detectors which had an improved energy resolution (by a factor of 2) compared to proportional counters and performed the first sensitive measurements of the iron spectral region for many astronomical objects. Energy range: 0.1-60 keV; gas scintillator proportional counter: 10 units of 80&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; each, FOV ~ 3° (FWHM), 2-60 keV; transient source monitor: 2-10 keV.

The Soviet [[Astron (spacecraft)|Astron orbital station]] was designed primarily for UV and X-ray astrophysical observations. It was injected into orbit on March 23, 1983. The satellite was put into a highly elliptical orbit, ~200,000 × 2,000&amp;nbsp;km. The orbit kept the craft far away from the Earth for 3.5 out of every 4 days. It was outside of the Earth's shadow and radiation belts for 90% of the time. The second major experiment, SKR-02M, aboard Astron was an X-ray spectrometer, which consisted of a proportional counter sensitive to 2-25 keV X-rays, with an effective area of 0.17 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The FOV was 3° × 3° (FWHM). Data could be telemetered in 10 energy channels. The instrument began taking data on April 3, 1983.

[[Spacelab]] 1 was the first Spacelab mission in orbit in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle (STS-9) between November 28 and December 8, 1983. An X-ray spectrometer, measuring 2-30 keV photons (although 2-80 keV was possible), was on the pallet. The primary science objective was to study detailed spectral features in cosmic sources and their temporal changes. The instrument was a gas scintillation proportional counter (GSPC) with ~ 180&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area and energy resolution of 9% at 7 keV. The detector was collimated to a 4.5° (FWHM) FOV. There were 512 energy channels.

Spartan 1 was deployed from the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-51G) on June 20, 1985 and retrieved 45.5 hours later. The X-ray detectors aboard the Spartan platform were sensitive to the energy range 1-12 keV. The instrument scanned its target with narrowly collimated (5' × 3°) GSPCs. There were 2 identical sets of counters, each having ~ 660&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; effective area. Counts were accumulated for 0.812 s into 128 energy channels. The energy resolution was 16% at 6 keV. During its 2 days of flight, Spartan-1 observed the Perseus cluster of galaxies and the Galactic Center region.

[[Ginga (satellite)|Ginga]] was launched on February 5, 1987. The primary instrument for observations was the Large Area Proportional Counter (LAC).

The [[European Retrievable Carrier]] (EURECA) was launched July 31, 1992 by the Space Shuttle Atlantis, and put into an orbit at an altitude of 508&amp;nbsp;km. It began its scientific mission on August 7, 1992. EURECA was retrieved on July 1, 1993 by the Space Shuttle Endeavour and returned to Earth. On board was the [[Granat#WATCH|WATCH]] or Wide Angle Telescope for Cosmic Hard X-rays instrument. The WATCH instrument was sensitive to 6-150 keV photons. The total field of view covered 1/4 of the celestial sphere. During its 11-month lifetime, EURECA tracked the Sun and WATCH gradually scanned across the entire sky. Some 2 dozen known X-ray sources were monitored—some for more than 100 days—and a number of new [[X-ray transient]]s were discovered.

The Diffuse X-ray Spectrometer (DXS) [[STS-54]] package was flown as an attached payload in January, 1993 to obtain spectra of the diffuse soft X-ray background. DXS obtained the first-ever high resolution spectra of the diffuse soft X-ray background in the energy band from 0.15 to 0.28 keV (4.3-8.4&amp;nbsp;nm).

[[Image:187900main colorpress1 lg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[XMM-Newton]] spectrum from superheated iron atoms at the inner edge of the accretion disk orbiting the neutron star in Serpens X-1. The line is usually a symmetrical peak, but it exhibits the classic features of distortion due to relativistic effects. The extremely fast motion of the iron-rich gas causes the line to spread out. The entire line has been shifted to longer wavelengths (left, red) because of the neutron star's powerful gravity. The line is brighter toward shorter wavelengths (right, blue) because Einstein's special theory of relativity predicts that a high-speed source beamed toward Earth will appear brighter than the same source moving away from Earth.

As all-sky surveys are performed and analyzed or once the first extrasolar X-ray source in each constellation is confirmed, it is designated [[X-1 X-ray Source|X-1]], e.g., [[Scorpius X-1]] or Sco X-1. There are 88 [[Constellation#Official constellations|official constellations]]. Often the first X-ray source is a transient.

As X-ray sources have been better located, many of them have been isolated to extragalactic regions such as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). When there are often many individually discernible sources, the first one identified is usually designated as the extragalactic source X-1, e.g., Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) X-1, a HMXRB, at 01&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;15&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;14&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; -73&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;42&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;22&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.

These early X-ray sources still are studied and often produce significant results. For example, Serpens X-1.

As of August 27, 2007 discoveries concerning asymmetric iron line broadening and their implications for relativity have been a topic of much excitement. With respect to the asymmetric iron line broadening, Edward Cackett of the [[University of Michigan]] commented, "We're seeing the gas whipping around just outside the neutron star's surface,". "And since the inner part of the disk obviously can't orbit any closer than the neutron star's surface, these measurements give us a maximum size of the neutron star's diameter. The neutron stars can be no larger than 18 to 20.5 miles across, results that agree with other types of measurements."&lt;ref name=Cackett&gt;{{ cite web |author=Gibb M |display-authors=4 |author2=Bhattacharyya S |author3=Strohmayer T|author4=Cackett E |author5=Miller J |title=Astronomers Pioneer New Method for Probing Exotic Matter |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/news/27aug07.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We've seen these asymmetric lines from many black holes, but this is the first confirmation that neutron stars can produce them as well. It shows that the way neutron stars accrete matter is not very different from that of black holes, and it gives us a new tool to probe Einstein's theory", says Tod Strohmayer of [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name=Cackett/&gt;

"This is fundamental physics", says Sudip Bhattacharyya also of NASA's in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]] and the [[University of Maryland]]. "There could be exotic kinds of particles or states of matter, such as quark matter, in the centers of neutron stars, but it's impossible to create them in the lab. The only way to find out is to understand neutron stars."&lt;ref name=Cackett/&gt;

Using [[XMM-Newton]], Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer observed Serpens X-1, which contains a neutron star and a stellar companion. Cackett and Jon Miller of the [[University of Michigan]], along with Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer, used [[Suzaku (satellite)|Suzaku]]'s superb spectral capabilities to survey Serpens X-1. The Suzaku data confirmed the XMM-Newton result regarding the iron line in Serpens X-1.&lt;ref name=Cackett/&gt;

==X-ray source catalogs==
Catalogs of X-ray sources have been put together for a variety of purposes including chronology of discovery, confirmation by X-ray flux measurement, initial detection, and X-ray source type.

===Sounding rocket X-ray source catalogs===
One of the first catalogs of X-ray sources published&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.156.3773.374 |author=Friedman H |author2=Byram ET |author3=Chubb TA |title=Distribution and variability of cosmic x-ray sources |journal=Science |volume=156 |issue=3773 |pages=374–8 |date=1967 |pmid=17812381 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..374F }}&lt;/ref&gt; came from workers at the [[US Naval Research Laboratory]] in 1966 and contained 35 X-ray sources.

===Early X-ray observatory satellite catalogs===
Each of the major observatory satellites had its own catalog of detected and observed X-ray sources. These catalogs were often the result of large area sky surveys. Many of the X-ray sources have names that come from a combination of a catalog abbreviation and the [[Right Ascension]] (RA) and [[Declination]] (Dec) of the object. For example, 4U 0115+63, 4th [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] catalog, RA=01 hr 15 min, Dec=+63°; 3S 1820-30 is the [[SAS-3]] catalog; EXO 0748-676 is an [[Exosat]] catalog entry; [[HEAO 1]] uses H; Ariel 5 is 3A; [[Ginga (satellite)|Ginga]] sources are in GS; general X-ray sources are in the X catalog.&lt;ref name=Lochner&gt;{{cite web |author=The Imagine Team |title=X-ray Astronomy Information: Source names - Introduction |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/xray_names.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the early satellites, the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] series X-ray sources have been cataloged.&lt;ref name=Strong&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1086/181415 |author=Strong IB |author2=Klebesadel RW |author3=Olson RA |title=A Preliminary Catalog of Transient Cosmic Gamma-Ray Sources Observed by the VELA Satellites |journal=Astrophys.

The [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] X-ray satellite made extensive observations and produced at least 4 catalogs wherein previous catalog designations were improved and relisted: 1ASE or 2ASE 1615+38 would appear successively as 2U 1615+38, 3U 1615+38, and 4U 1615+3802, for example.&lt;ref name=Giacconi72/&gt; After over a year of initial operation the first catalog (2U) was produced.&lt;ref name=Giacconi72&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giacconi R |display-authors=4 |author2=Murray S |author3=Gursky H|author4=Kellogg E |author5=Schreier E|author6=Tananbaum T |title=The ''UHURU'' catalog of X-ray sources |journal=Astrophys.

===Specialty and all-sky survey X-ray source catalogs===
The Catalog of High-Mass X-ray Binaries in the Galaxy (4th Ed.) contains source name(s), coordinates, finding charts, X-ray luminosities, system parameters, and stellar parameters of the components and other characteristic properties for 114 HMXBs, together with a comprehensive selection of the relevant literature.&lt;ref name=SmaleAP&gt;{{cite web |author=Browse Software Development Team |title=HMXBCAT - Catalog of High-Mass X-ray Binaries in the Galaxy (4th Ed.) |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/star-catalog/hmxbcat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 60% of the high-mass X-ray binary candidates are known or suspected [[Be X-ray binaries|Be/X-ray binaries]], while 32% are supergiant/X-ray binaries (SGXB).&lt;ref name=SmaleAP/&gt;

'''Intimacy''' is the degree to which a person can share feelings with another in a [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]. Intimacy is occasionally linked with [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] but it can also occur in a [[Platonic love|nonsexual]] or unromantic relationship. The [[dialectic]]s of connection-autonomy and openness-closedness manipulate the communication of intimacy between partners.

'''James Marvin Herndon''' (born 1944) is an [[United States|American]] interdisciplinary scientist, who earned his BA degree in [[physics]] in 1970 from the [[University of California, San Diego]] and his Ph.D. degree in [[nuclear chemistry]] in 1974 from [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Current Biography 64: 45-49, 2003, https://web.archive.org/web/20050205193822/http://nuclearplanet.com/profile.htm, similar link: [http://www.nuclearplanet.com/JMH%20Biography.html J.

== Theories on Earth ==
Herndon suggested that the composition of the [[inner core]] of Earth is nickel [[silicide]]; the conventional view is that it is iron–nickel alloy&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, J. M. (1979) The nickel silicide inner core of the Earth. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A368, 495-500.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, he has suggested "[[georeactor]]" planetocentric [[nuclear fission reactor]]s as energy sources for the [[gas giant]] [[outer planets]].&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, J. M. (1992) ''Nuclear fission reactors as energy sources for the giant outer planets'', [[Naturwissenschaften]] 79, 7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 
as the energy source and production mechanism for the geomagnetic field &lt;ref&gt;Herndon, J. M. (2007) Nuclear georeactor generation of Earth’s geomagnetic field. Current Science, V. 93, No. 11, 1485-1487.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[stellar ignition]] by [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, J. M. (1994) Planetary and protostellar nuclear fission: Implications for planetary change, stellar ignition and dark matter. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond., A455, 453-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Herndon postulated what he calls [[Expanding Earth|whole-earth decompression dynamics]], which he describes as a unified theory combining elements of [[plate tectonics]] and [[Expanding Earth|Earth expansion]]. He suggests that Earth formed from a [[Jupiter]]-sized [[gas giant]] by catastrophic loss of its gaseous atmosphere with subsequent decompression and expansion of the rocky remnant planet resulting in ''decompression cracks'' at continental margins which are filled in by basalts from mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref name=Herndon&gt;J. Marvin Herndon, ''Whole-earth decompression dynamics,'' Current Science, V. 89, No. 11, 10 Dec. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.downloadtheuniverse.com/dtu/2012/07/ebooks-and-the-democratization-of-crackpottery.html |title= eBooks and the democratization of crackpottery |author=  John Timmer |author-link=  John Timmer |publisher= [[Download the Universe]] |date= 9 July 2012 |accessdate= 3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://boingboing.net/2012/07/10/crackpots-geniuses-and-how-t.html |title= Crackpots, geniuses, and how to tell the difference |publisher= [[Boing Boing]] |author= |date= 10 July 2012 |accessdate= 3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent measuments of "[[geoneutrino]]" fluxes in the KamLAND and Borexino experiments have placed stringent upper limits on Herndon's "[[georeactor]]" hypothesis on the presence of an active nuclear fission reactor in the Earth's inner core, so that such reactor would produce less than 3 TW.&lt;ref name="Borexino2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Borexino Collaboration|title=Observation of geo-neutrinos|journal=Phys.

== Chemtrail theory proponent ==

More recently, Herndon has become a proponent of the [[chemtrail conspiracy theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herndon|first1=Marvin J|title=January 16, 2015 Email to San Diego Mayor, Copies to City Council Members|url=http://www.nuclearplanet.com/mayor1.pdf|website=Nuclearplanet.com|accessdate=20 February 2017|quote=Almost every day jet airliners are spraying innumerable so-called “chemtrails”  and they persist after release behind the jets to gradually form clouds.

'''John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd Orr of Brechin Mearns''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CH|DSO|MC|FRS|FRSE}}{{sfn|Kay|1972|pp=43–81}} (23 September 1880 – 25 June 1971), styled '''Sir John Boyd Orr''' from 1935 to 1949, was a Scottish teacher, medical doctor, [[biologist]] and politician who was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his scientific research into [[nutrition]] and his work as the first Director-General of the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO). He was the co-founder and the first President (1960–1971) of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]] (WAAS).{{sfn|Cuthbertson|2007|pp=1–5}}{{sfn|ODNB|2004}}&lt;ref name="npg"&gt;{{NPG name|id=08505|name=John Boyd Orr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and family background ==
[[File:Boydorrshouse.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The birthplace of John Boyd Orr: Holland Green, Fenwick Road, Kilmaurs.]]
John Boyd Orr was born at [[Kilmaurs]], near [[Kilmarnock]], [[East Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]], the middle child in a family of seven children. His father, Robert Clark Orr, was a quarry owner, and a man of deep religious convictions, being a member of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. His mother, Annie Boyd, was the daughter of another quarry master, wealthier than Robert Orr, and grandmaster of a [[Masonic Lodge|Freemason's Lodge]].

The family home was well supplied with books, and his father was widely read in political, sociological and metaphysical subjects, as well as religion. As he grew older, John would regularly discuss these subjects with his father, brothers, and visiting friends.{{efn|Kay is silent on whether his mother and sisters were also involved in these discussions}} There was also family worship each evening.

When John was five years old, the family suffered a setback when a ship owned by Robert Orr was lost at sea. They had to sell their home in Kilmaurs, and moved to [[West Kilbride]], a village on the [[North Ayrshire]] coast. According to Kay, the new house and environment were a great improvement on Kilmaurs, despite the family's reduced means. The major part of his upbringing took place in and around West Kilbride. He attended the village school until he was thirteen. Religion was then an important part of junior education in Scotland, and the school gave him a good knowledge of the [[Bible]], which stayed with him for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}}

At the age of thirteen, John won a bursary to [[Kilmarnock Academy]], a significant achievement as such bursaries were then rare. The new school was some {{convert|20|mi|km}} from his home in West Kilbride, but his father owned a quarry about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) from the Academy, and John was provided with accommodation nearby. His family cut short his education at the Academy because he was spending too much time in the company of the quarry workers (where he picked up a "wonderful vocabulary of swear words"),{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}} and after four months he returned to the village school in West Kilbride where he continued his education until he was seventeen under the inspirational tutelage of Headmaster John G. Lyons. There he became a pupil teacher at a salary of £10 for the first year, and £20 for the second. This was a particularly demanding time for the young Boyd Orr, as in addition to his teaching duties, and studying at home for his university and teacher-training qualifications, he also had to work every day in his father's business.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}}

After four years as a pupil teacher, at the age of 19 he won a Queen's Scholarship to study at a teacher training college in [[Glasgow]], plus a bursary which paid for his lodgings there. At the same time he entered a three-year degree course in [[theology]]{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2007}}{{efn|but theology may or may not have been the subject in which he received his M.A. degree}} at the [[University of Glasgow|University]], for which the fees were also covered.

== First encounters with poverty ==
As an undergraduate in Glasgow, he explored the interior of the city, usually at weekends. He was shocked by what he found in the poverty-stricken slums and tenements, which then made up a large part of the city. [[Rickets]] was obvious among the children, malnutrition (in some cases, associated with drunkenness) was shown by many of the adults, and many of the aged were destitute. In his first teaching job after graduating [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|M.A.]] in 1902, he was posted to a school in the slums. His first class was overcrowded, and the children ill-fed or actually hungry, inadequately clothed, visibly lousy and physically wretched. He resigned after a few days, realising that he could not teach children in such a condition, and that there was nothing he could do to relieve their misery.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=46}}

After working for a few months in his father's business, he taught for three years at Kyleshill School in [[Saltcoats]], also a poor area, but less squalid than the slums of [[Glasgow]].

== Return to university ==
Boyd Orr needed to augment his teacher's salary, and decided to do so by instructing an evening class in book-keeping and accountancy. After intensive study he passed the necessary examinations, and duly instructed his class. The knowledge and skills he learned by studying for, and teaching, this class were to prove very useful in his later career.

However his heart was not in teaching, and after fulfilling his teaching obligations under the terms of his Queen's Scholarship, he returned to the University to study [[biology]], a subject he had always been interested in since childhood. As a precaution, he entered simultaneously for a degree in [[medicine]].

He found the university to be a very stimulating environment. [[Diarmid Noel Paton]] (son of the artist [[Joseph Noel Paton]]) was Regius Professor of Physiology, and [[Edward Provan Cathcart]] head of [[Physiological chemistry|Physiological Chemistry]], both men of outstanding scientific ability. He was impressed by Samuel Gemmill, Professor of Clinical Medicine, a philosopher whose deep thinking on social affairs also influenced Boyd Orr's approach to such questions.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=46}}

Half-way through his medical studies, his savings ran out. Reluctant to ask his family for support, he bought a block of tenanted flats on mortgage, with the help of a bank overdraft, and used the rents to pay for the rest of his studies. On graduating, he sold the property for a small profit.

He graduated [[B.Sc.]] in 1910, and [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|M.B. Ch.B.]] in 1912, at the age of 32, placing sixth in a year of 200 students. Two years later, in 1914, he graduated [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|M.D.]] with honours, receiving the Bellahouston Gold Medal for the most distinguished thesis of the year.

== Research career ==
On leaving the university, he took a position as a ship's surgeon on a ship trading between Scotland and West Africa, choosing this job because it offered the possibility of paying off his bank overdraft faster than any other. He resigned after four months, when he had repaid the debt. He then tried general practice, working as a ''[[locum]]'' in the practice of his family doctor in [[Saltcoats]], and was offered a partnership there. Realising that a career in medicine was not for him, he instead accepted the offer of a two-year Carnegie research scholarship, to work in [[Edward Provan Cathcart|E.P. Cathcart]]'s laboratory. The work he began there covered [[malnutrition]], [[protein]]{{sfn|Cathcart|Orr|1914|pp=113–127}} and [[creatine]]{{sfn|Cathcart|Boyd Orr|1914|pp=xxi–xxii}}{{sfn|Boyd Orr|1914}} [[metabolism]], the effect of water intake on [[nitrogenous]] metabolism in humans,{{sfn|Boyd Orr|Burns|1914}}{{sfn|Orr|1914|pp=530–540}} and the energy expenditure of military recruits in training.{{sfn|Boyd Orr|Cathcart|1919}}

=== The beginnings of the Rowett Research Institute ===
On 1 April 1914, Boyd Orr took charge of a new research institute in [[Aberdeen]], a project of a joint committee for research into animal nutrition of the [[Scottish Agricultural College|North of Scotland College of Agriculture]] and [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]]. He had been offered the post on the recommendation of E.P. Cathcart, who had originally been offered the job, but had turned it down in favour of a chair in [[physiology]] in [[University of London|London]].

The joint committee had allocated a budget of £5,000 for capital expenditure and £1,500 for annual running costs. Boyd Orr recognised immediately that these sums were inadequate. Using his experience in his father's business of drawing up plans and estimating costs, he submitted a budget of £50,000 for capital expenditure and £5,000 for annual running costs. Meanwhile, with the £5,000 he had already been allocated he specified a building, not of wood as had been envisaged by the committee, but of granite and designed so that it could serve as a wing of his proposed £50,000 Institute. He accepted the lowest tender of £5,030, and told the contractors to begin work immediately. The committee were not pleased, but had to accept the ''[[fait accompli]]''. When war broke out the contractors were told to finish the walls and roof, but to do no more for the time being.

=== War service ===
On the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] he was given leave to join the [[British Army]], and asked his former colleague Cathcart to help him obtain a medical commission in an infantry unit overseas. Cathcart thought he would be more useful at home, and his first commission was in a special civilian section of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps|R.A.M.C.]] dealing with sanitation. Several divisions of non-conscripted recruits were in training in emergency camps at home, some of them in very poor sanitary conditions. Boyd Orr was able to push through schemes for improvement in hygiene, preventing much sickness.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=49}}

After 18 months he was posted as [[Medical officer|Medical Officer]] to an infantry unit, the [[The Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)|1st Sherwood Foresters]]. He spent much of his time in shell holes, patching up the many wounded. His courage under fire and devotion to duty were recognised by the award of a [[Military Cross]] after the [[Battle of the Somme]], and of the [[Distinguished Service Order]] after [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]. He also made arrangements for the battalion's diet to be supplemented by vegetables collected from local deserted gardens and fields. As a result, unlike other units, he did not need to send any of the men in his medical charge to hospital. He also prevented his men getting [[trench foot]] by personally ensuring they were fitted with boots a size larger than usual.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=49}}

Worried that he was losing touch with medical and nutritional advances, he asked to be transferred to the [[Royal Navy|navy]], where he thought he would have more time available for reading and research. The army was reluctant to let him go, but agreed, since he was still a civilian surgeon. He spent a busy three months in the naval hospital at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]], studying hard while practicing medicine in the wards, before being posted to [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']]. On board ship his medical duties were light, enabling him to do a great deal of reading. He was later recalled to work studying food requirements of the army.

=== Post-war expansion of the Rowett Research Institute ===
When Boyd Orr returned to Aberdeen in early 1919, his plan for a larger Institute had still not been accepted. Indeed, even his plans for the annual maintenance grant had to be approved by the Professor of Agriculture in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Thomas Barlow Wood. Despite gaining the latter's support, his expansion plans were at first rebuffed, although he succeeded in having the annual grant increased to £4,000. In 1920 he was introduced to [[John Quiller Rowett]], a businessman who seemed to have qualms of conscience{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=51}} over the large profits he had made during the war. Shortly afterwards, the government agreed to finance half the cost of Boyd Orr's plan, provided he could raise the other half elsewhere. Rowett agreed to provide £10,000 for the first year, £10,000 for the second year, and gave an additional £2,000 for the purchase of a farm, provided that, "if any work done at the Institute on animal nutrition was found to have a bearing on human nutrition, the Institute would be allowed to follow up this work",{{sfn|RRI|2005}} a condition the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] was willing to accept. By September 1922 the buildings were nearly completed, and the renamed [[Rowett Research Institute]] was opened shortly thereafter by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=52}}

Boyd Orr proved to be an effective fund-raiser from both government and private sources,{{sfn|Smith|1998|pp=47–63}} expanding the experimental farm to around {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}, building a well-endowed library, and expanding the buildings. He also built a centre for accommodating students and scientists attracted by the Institute's growing reputation, a reputation enhanced by Boyd Orr's many publications.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=54}} His research output suffered from the time and energy he had to devote to fund-raising, and in later life he said, "I still look with bitter resentment at having to spend half my time in the humiliating job of hunting for money for the Institute."{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=52}}

Through the 1920s, his own research was devoted mainly to animal nutrition, his focus changed to human nutrition both as a researcher and an active lobbyist and propagandist for improving people's diets. In 1927, he proved the value of milk being supplied to school children, which led to free school milk provision in the UK. His 1936 report "Food, Health and Income" showed that at least one third of the UK population were so poor that they could not afford to buy sufficient food to provide a healthy diet and revealed that there was a link between low-income, malnutrition and under-achievement in schools.{{sfn|UoG}}

From 1929 to 1944, Boyd Orr was Consultant Director to the Imperial Bureau of Animal Nutrition, later the Commonwealth Bureau of Nutrition (part of the [[CAB International|Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux]]), which was based at the Rowett Research Institute. During the Second World War he was a member of Churchill's Scientific Committee on Food Policy and helped to formulate food rationing{{sfn|UoG}}

== International and political work ==
In October 1945, Orr was elected [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]] after standing as an Independent Progressive candidate.{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 22 Oct|1945|p=4}} He was elected as an independent [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Combined Scottish Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined Scottish Universities]] in a [[Combined Scottish Universities by-election, 1945|by-election in April 1945]],{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 14 Apr|1945|p=10}} and kept his seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|general election]] shortly after. He [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned]] in 1946.{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 4 Oct|1946|p=4}}

After the [[Second World War]], Boyd Orr resigned from the Rowett Institute, and took several posts, most notably as Director-General of the United Nations' new Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 28 Oct|1945|p=3}}{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 1 Dec|1945|p=2}} Although his tenure in this position was short (1945–1948), he worked not only to alleviate the immediate postwar food shortage through the International Emergency Food Committee (IEFC) but also to propose comprehensive plans for improving food production and its equitable distribution—his proposal to create a World Food Board.  Although the board failed to get the support of Britain and the US, Boyd Orr laid a firm foundation for the new U.N. specialized agency.{{sfn|Staples|2006|pp=78–96}}{{sfn|Staples|2003|pp=495–523}}

He then resigned from the FAO and became director of a number of companies and proved a canny investor in the stock market, making a considerable personal fortune.  When he received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1949,{{efn|The [[American Friends Service Committee]] was one of his nominators for the Nobel Prize.{{sfn|AFSC Nobel Nominations}}}} he donated the entire financial award to organizations devoted to world peace and a united world government.
He was elevated to the peerage in 1949 as '''Baron Boyd Orr''', of Brechin Mearns in the County of Angus.{{sfn|Kay|1972|pp=43–81}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38558 |date=11 March 1949 |page=1264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Boyd Orr was elected the first president of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]], which was set up by eminent scientists of the day concerned about the potential misuse of scientific discoveries, most especially nuclear weapons.

The [[University of Glasgow]] has a [[Boyd Orr Building]] and the Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health{{sfn|Boyd Orr Centre}} named after him, and the University's [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] holds his Nobel medal. There is a street named after Boyd Orr in his home town of Kilmaurs in Ayrshire, as well as in [[Brechin]], Angus, [[Penicuik]], Midlothian, and in [[Saltcoats]], Ayrshire.

{{italic title}}In England and Wales, the '''''Manual for Streets''''', published in March 2007, provides guidance for practitioners involved in the planning, design, provision and approval of new [[street]]s, and modifications to existing ones. It aims to increase the quality of life through good design which creates more people-oriented streets.  Although the detailed guidance in the document applies mainly to residential streets, the overall design principles apply to all streets within urban areas.

A ''street'' is defined as "a highway with important public realm functions beyond the movement of motor traffic" – i.e. by its function rather than some arbitrary traffic flow limit.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Overview ==
The [[UK]] [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) and the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] (DCLG), with support from the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]] (CABE), commissioned [[WSP Group]], [[Transport Research Laboratory]] (TRL), [[Llewelyn Davies Yeang]] and [[Phil Jones Associates]] to develop ''Manual for Streets'' to give guidance to a range of practitioners on effective street design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manualforstreets.org.uk/ Manual for Streets website]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Manual for Streets'' was published on 29 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Communities and Local Government: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/manualforstreets/ Manual for Streets]&lt;/ref&gt;  It superseded ''[[Design Bulletin 32 – Residential Roads and Footpaths – Layout Considerations]]'' (DB32) and the companion guide ''[[Places, Streets and Movement]]'', which have now been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Research Laboratory: [http://www.trl.co.uk/store/report_detail.asp?srid=6197 The Manual for Streets: evidence and research]&lt;/ref&gt;  A copy of the manual as well a summary and supporting research can be [http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/manforstreets/ downloaded] from the Department for Transport.

''Manual for Streets'' has updated geometric guidelines for low trafficked residential streets, examines the effect of the environment on road user behaviour, and draws on practice in other countries. Research undertaken by TRL provides the evidence base upon which the revised geometric guidelines in the ''Manual for Streets'' are based, including link widths, forward visibility, visibility splays and junction spacing.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Transport: Policy, guidance and research – Sustainable travel – [http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/manforstreets/ Manual for Streets]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Manual for Streets'' applies in England and Wales and is national guidance, not a policy document.

The Scottish Government commissioned WSP Group, Phil Jones Associates and [[Edaw]] to produce ''[[Designing Streets]]'', a version of ''Manual for Streets'' for application in Scotland and was published in 2010. Unlike ''Manual for Streets'', it is published as a "policy statement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designing Streets: A Policy Statement for Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/03/22120652/0|work=The Scottish Government|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MfS 2==
'''Manual for Streets 2:  Wider Application of the Principles''' was launched on 29 September 2010 in London. It is designed to be read alongside the original ''Manual'' rather than to supersede it. It is available to buy for £40 in paper form from its publisher, the Chartered Institution of Highways &amp; Transportation (CIHT), as well as the usual retail outlets.  CIHT staff reported at the launch that it will not be available to download for up to a year.

== Criticisms ==

''Manual for Streets'' has been criticised for its approach to [[permeability (spatial and transport planning)|permeability]] of street networks. Critics argue that, by encouraging permeability of street networks for motor vehicles, ''MfS'' undermines its declared intention to reduce the domination of streets by motor traffic. [[Sustrans]], the sustainable transport charity, while giving a cautious welcome to the ''Manual'', argues that the guidance should limit permeability for motor vehicles and provide full permeability for walking and cycling.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sustrans]]: [http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/liveable-neighbourhoods/innovative-urban-design/manual-for-streets-sustrans-response Manual for Streets: comments on final draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101070949/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/liveable-neighbourhoods/innovative-urban-design/manual-for-streets-sustrans-response |date=2011-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melia (2008) went further, arguing:

:"By multiplying opportunities for ‘rat-running' [the approach in ''Manual for Streets'' will] increase the capacity of a road network to carry traffic – and, course (''sic'') to emit CO2.  In other words, it is a cheaper variation on the 'build our way out of congestion' theme."&lt;ref&gt;Melia, Steve: [http://www.stevemelia.co.uk/ltt.htm "Neighbourhoods Should be Made Permeable for Walking and Cycling But Not for Cars"], ''Local Transport Today'' 23 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">'''Muntanya Assolada''' is a [[Bronze Age]] settlement located on the right bank of the [[Xúquer]] river, in Spain, built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, dominating the river plain from a height of {{convert|227|m}} above sea level. It is located in the municipality of [[Alzira, Valencia]], Spain.

Excavation campaigns began in 1978, under the direction of [[Bernat Martí Oliver]], and continued until 1996, and work on the site was resumed in 2004. From the 1990s [[Rosa Enguix Alemany]] and [[María Jesús de Pedro]] joined the direction of the site. At present the excavated area covers {{convert|700|m2}} and includes different structures, like a central street and rectangular departments on both sides; a wall of two meters wide that preserves almost three meters of height ({{cvt|2|xx|3|m|ft|disp=out}}); occupancy soils and abandonment episodes; livestock stabling; and terracing of the slopes to expand its surface.

At present the site is property of the Alzira City council, and the new beginning of the excavations by the [[Servei d'Investigació Prehistòrica]] has as objective the consolidation of the exhumed structures and its signposting for visitor access.

A nearby [[burial cave]] indicates the continuity in the use of natural caves as necropolis, and an individual burial has been found in a pit in the interior of the area too. On the other hand, the recovered remains show a wide chronological sequence between the [[Early Bronze Age|Early Bronze]] and the [[Late Bronze Age|Late Bronze]].
[[File:Assolada_localización.jpg|thumb|Location of the Muntanya Assolada]]

== Location ==
On the right bank of the [[Xúquer]] river is located the Muntanya Assolada Bronze Age village of Alzira. The settlement was built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, west of Tallat Roig, between the Murta and the Aixavegó ravine, dominating the plain of the river from a height of 227 metres above sea level. The toponym "Muntanya Desolada" refers to the partial collapse of the summit that occurred in autumn of 1783, the night of 24–25 October. Until then the place was known as Muntanya de la Font del Baladre.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_muro.jpg|thumb|Wall area]]

== Archaeological interventions ==
The excavations carried out by the [[Servei d'Investigació Prehistòrica]] began in 1978 and continued until 1996, resuming again from 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/4497|title=Repositorio Institucional de la Universidad de Alicante |accessdate=9 March 2017 |author=|authorlink= |date= |language= |website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area currently excavated covers more than {{cvt|700|m2}} and corresponds to different room structures with anthropic deposits and evidences of the different activities developed there, such as occupation soils and abandonment episodes in which fire was detected, perhaps due to the combustion of materials accumulated by livestock stabling, and terracing of the slopes to gradually expand the surface of the village. In its upper part, can be seen a central street and departments on both sides. In one of them it has been documented a domestic oven for cooking bread or toasting cereals. And in the other, the entrance has stone steps.

The site is surrounded by a wall that is almost two meters wide and stands three meters high ({{cvt|2|xx|3|m|ft|disp=out}}). It was built on a summit that has been terraced by solid stone and clay buildings arranged in slope, thus prolonging the settlement on the slope. The existence of different levels of occupation, documented by stratigraphy and remains, is corroborated by the remodeling of the structures, some of them quickly and intentionally filled to give way to new construction lines. However, it seems to indicate that it was inhabited continuously throughout the Bronze Age.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_cerámica.jpg |thumb|Ceramic pottery]]
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_Puntas_Metall_.jpg|thumb|Metallic tips]]

== Archaeological remains ==
The remains are deposited in the [[Prehistory Museum of Valencia|Museu de Prehistòria de València]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.museuprehistoriavalencia.es/web_mupreva/sala/?q=fr&amp;id=119 |title=La Muntanya Assolada (Alzira, Valencia) |accessdate=9 March 2017 |last=Render |website= www.museuprehistoriavalencia.es }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery shows a variety of shapes, such as cups and bowls, pots and storage urns, fairing and geminated vessels, or spoons; and decorative motifs such as incisions, dots, typed strings, or burnished decoration. Among the metallic objects are gravers, arrowheads, a dagger of rivets, and a chisel, as well as other elements linked to the metallurgical activity, such as slags, a stone hammer and a ceramic crucible. The lithic industry has a good representation of sickle and flint arrowheads, polished stone tool and numerous remains of the lithic reductions. The bone industry is represented by gravers, spatulas and chisels, and by a ring and different ivory buttons. The fauna remains show the results of an agricultural village with sheep and goats predominating, the ox being used as an animal of draft and strength, and as a producer of meat and milk. Also the pig was raised, and there are remains of horse and dog. The hunt of the deer, beyond the necessary protection of the crops against herbivores, indicates the existence of a remarkable vegetation cover. The dating of a set of fauna from the lower layer of a space existing between the upper wall and a thickened structure, that is attached to it, has provided a date of 3470 ± 70 BP, between 1890&amp;nbsp;BC and 1690&amp;nbsp;BC.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_Enterrament_2.jpg |thumb|Human burial]]

== Human burials ==
The presence of human burials in the site is attested by the excavation of a small sepulchral cave immediately near the village, in the escarpment of its south-east side, which provided remains of a minimum of four individuals, animal bones and part of the grave goods that are with the buried. On the other side, in its westernmost southern slope, in the space delimited by a wide wall and by different stone courses that follow along the outer slope, a circular grave was excavated that contained another human burial, under a sedimentation of more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} of depth. The buried was in fetal position, right lateral decubitus, with the legs folded and the feet crossed. The right arm was elongated behind the back and the hand crushed by a block. The left arm was flexed in front of the body and the hand stretched below the face, missing most of the skull and upper maxilla. The absolute dating of this individual by C-14 has provided a date of 3760 ± 40 BP, between 2210&amp;nbsp;BC and 2130&amp;nbsp;BC.

== Relevance in its context ==
The Muntanya Assolada has been considered as a typical village of the Valencian Bronze Age, according to some decorative motifs of the pottery, globular and tall carena, the archaism of the lithic industry, the copper metallurgy, or the sepulchral cave found next to the village. The end of its habitation is related to the Late Bronze, attending to the fairing vessels with flared profile and with a pronounced angle of inflection, the flat bases or the presence of authentic bronze in the metallic objects. In fact, the typology of the vessels of Muntanya Assolada corresponds to what is usual in the villages of the Valencian Bronze Age. However, in their highest levels, such shapes as the mentioned fairing vessels are accompanied by the geminados, bowls and outgoing edge pots, considered more-evolved. The two absolute dates are shown in accordance with a sequence from the Early to the Late Bronze Age. La Muntanya Assolada and other nearby sites represent the continuity of a settlement that spans from the Bronze Age to the [[Iberian Culture]], in a permanently occupied territory such as the Ribera del [[Xúquer]].

The site was abandoned in the final period of the [[Middle Bronze Age]] or Late Bronze, to give way to a settlement located on the plain, first on Cases de Montcada, during the Late Bronze Age on Escoles Pies and during the [[Iron Age]] on the L'Alteret de la Vintihuitena of Albalat, to occupy later the slope of the highest hills with the arrival of the [[Iberian Culture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4312">The '''Oddy test''' is a procedure created at the [[British Museum]] by conservation scientist [[William Andrew Oddy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/spring_2003/oddy.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123123422/http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/objects_conservation/spring_2003/oddy.asp |archivedate=November 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;W.A.Oddy, "An unsuspected danger in display", Museum Journal 73, 1973, p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; in order to test materials for safety in and around art objects.
Often, materials for construction are evaluated for safety. However, though materials may be safe for building purposes, they may emit trace amounts of chemicals that can harm art objects over time. [[Acid]]s, [[formaldehyde]], and other fumes can damage and even destroy delicate artifacts if placed too close.

==Procedure==
This test calls for a sample of the material in question to be placed in an airtight container with three [[Coupon (materials science)|coupons]] of different metals—[[silver]], [[lead]], and [[copper]]—that are not touching each other or the sample of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Schiro,Mara "Oddy Test Protocols" http://www.conservation-wiki.com/index.php?title=Oddy_Test_Protocols&amp;oldid=4830 Accessed February 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The container is sealed with a small amount of de-ionized water to maintain a high [[humidity]], then heated at 60 degrees [[Celsius]] for 28 days. An identical container with three metal coupons acts as a [[Scientific control|control]]. If the metal coupons show no signs of [[corrosion]], then the material is deemed suitable to be placed in and around art objects. The Oddy test is not a contact test, but is for testing [[outgassing|off-gassing]].
[[File:Oddy-test-color.jpg|thumb|A basic layout of a three-in-one Oddy Test]]
Each metal detects a different set of [[corrosive substance|corrosive agents]]. The silver is for detecting reduced sulfur compounds and [[carbonyl sulfide]]s. The lead is for detecting organic acids, [[aldehyde]], and acidic gases. The copper is for detecting [[chloride]], oxide, and sulfur compounds.

There are many types of [[materials testing]] for other purposes, including [[chemical test]]ing and [[physical test]]ing.

==Development==
The Oddy test has gone through many changes and refinements over time. Whereas Andrew Oddy proposed to place each metal coupon in a separate glass container with the material to be tested, Bamberger et al.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Conservation, Vol. 44, No. 2 (1999), pp. 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a "three-in-one" test, where all three metal coupons shared one container, simplifying the procedure. Robinett and Thickett (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Conservation, Vol. 48, No. 4 (2003), pp. 263-268.&lt;/ref&gt; refined the "three-in-one" test by stabilizing the metal coupons.

One of the main issues with the Oddy test is that there is some subjectivity to the interpretation of the results,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-43/standard-materials-for-corrosiveness-testing/&lt;/ref&gt; since it is primarily a visual determination.
[[File:Oddy-tests 0823b.jpg|thumb|Oddy-tests 0823b]]

Institutions that use the Oddy test in their research are mainly art museums such as The [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art|The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

Organizational ecology utilizes insights from [[biology]], [[economics]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Douma, Sytse]] and [[Hein Schreuder]], 2013. "Economic Approaches to Organizations". 5th edition.

&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology]], and employs statistical analysis to try to understand the conditions under which organizations emerge, grow, and die.

The ecology of organizations is divided into three levels, the community, the population, and the organization. The community level is the functionally integrated system of interacting populations. The population level is the set of organizations engaged in similar activities. The organization level focuses on the individual organizations (some research further divides organizations into individual member and sub-unit levels&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hannan, M., &amp; Freeman, J. (1977). The population ecology of organizations. ''American Journal of Sociology 82''(5), 929-964.&lt;/ref&gt;).

What is generally referred to as organizational ecology in research is more accurately population ecology, focusing on the second level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Baum, J., &amp; Shipilov, A. (2006). Ecological approaches to organizations. In S. Clegg, C. Hardy, T. Lawrence, &amp; W. Nord (Eds.) ''The Sage handbook of organization studies'' (pp. 55-110.) London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development  ==

Wharton School researcher William Evan called the population level the ''organization-set'', and focused on the interrelations of individual organizations within the population as early as 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Evan, W. (1966). "The organization-set" in J. Thompson (ed.) ''Approaches to Organizational Design''. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to the mid-1970s, the majority of organizational studies research focused on adaptive change in organizations (See also [[adaptive management]] and [[adaptive performance]]). The ecological approach moved focus to the environmental selection processes that affect organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1976, Eric Trist defined population ecology as "the study of the organizational field created by a number of organizations whose interrelations compose a system at the level of the whole field". He also advocated for organizational studies research to focus on populations and individual organizations as part of open rather than closed systems that have both bureaucratic (internal) regulation and ecological (community environment) regulation (see also [[Open and closed systems in social science]]).&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E. (1977). A Concept of Organizational Ecology. ''Australian Journal of Management 2''(2),  161-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first explicit formulation of a theory of population ecology, by [[Michael T. Hannan]] and the late [[John H. Freeman]] in their 1977 ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' piece "The population ecology of organizations" and later refined in their 1989 book ''[[Organizational Ecology]]'', examines the environment in which organizations compete and how a process like [[natural selection]] occurs.  This theory looks at the death of organizations (firm mortality), the birth of new organizations (organizational founding), as well as organizational growth and change.

Organizational ecology has over the years become one of the central fields in [[organizational studies]], and is known for its empirical, quantitative character. Ecological studies usually have a large-scale, longitudinal focus (datasets often span several decades, sometimes even centuries). The books ''The Demography of Corporations and Industries'' by Glenn Carroll and Michael Hannan (2000) and ''Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies'' by Michael Hannan, Laszlo Polos, and Glenn Carroll (2007), provide the most comprehensive overview of the various theories and methods in organizational ecology.

== Key concerns ==
Organizational ecology focuses on how social (community) forces affect:
* rates of creation of new organizational forms
* rates of demise of organizations and organizational forms
* the rates of change in organizational forms.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, J., &amp; Lumsden, C. (1990). Theory and research in organizational ecology. ''Annual Review of Sociology 16''(1), 161-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational mortality ===
Organizational ecology is concerned with the capacity of the environment to support organizations and the rate of growth and decline of organizations within the environment. Each of these forces is a part of what is called ''Organizational Mortality''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Inertia and change ====
This factor holds that organizations that are reliable and accountable are those that can survive (favored by selection). A negative by-product, however, of the need for reliability and accountability is a high degree of inertia and a resistance to change. A key prediction of organizational ecology is that the process of change itself is so disruptive that it will result in an elevated rate of mortality.

Theories about inertia and change are fundamental to the research program of organizational ecology, which seeks a better understanding of the broader changes in the organizational landscape. Given the limits on firm-level adaptation, most of these broader changes thus come from the entry and selective replacement of organizations. Hence organizational ecology has spent considerable effort on understanding the founding and mortality rates of organizations.

Hannan and Freeman define organizational inertia in terms of internal and external restraints. Internal restraints include investment and sunk costs; availability of information for decision makers; political restraints such as organizational culture; and organization history. External restraints include legal and fiscal barriers to market entry and exit; availability of information about the environment; external legitimacy; and collective rationality and strategy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (See also [[Bounded rationality]]).

==== Niche theory ====

Niche width distinguishes broadly between two types of organizations: generalists and specialists. Specialist organizations maximize their exploitation of the environment and accept the risk of experiencing a change in that environment. On the other hand, generalist organizations accept a lower level of exploitation in return for greater security.

Niche theory shows that specialization is generally favored in stable or certain environments. However, the main contribution of the niche theory is probably the finding that "generalism is not always optimal in uncertain environments". The exception is produced by environments which "place very different demands on the organization, and the duration of environmental states is short relative to the life of the organization".

Thus, the niche theory explains variations in industrial structure in different industries. The theory shows how different structures in different industries (generalist vs specialist organizations) are shaped by relevant environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Density dependence ====

Organizational ecology also predicts that the rates of founding and mortality are dependent on the number of organizations (density) in the market. The two central mechanisms here are legitimization (the recognition or taken-for-grantedness of that group of organizations) and [[competition]]. Legitimization generally increases (at a decreasing rate) with the number of organizations, but so does competition (at an increasing rate). The result is that legitimization processes will prevail at low numbers of organizations, while competition will at high numbers.

The founding rate will therefore first increase with the number of organizations (due to an increase in legitimization) but will decrease at high numbers of organizations (due to competition). The reverse holds for mortality rates. Thus, the relationship of density to founding rates has an inverted U shape and the relationship of density to mortality rates follows a U-shaped pattern.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, G. (1984). Organizational ecology. ''Annual Review of Sociology 10''(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age dependence ====

How an organization's risk of mortality relates to the age of that organization has also been extensively examined. Here, organizational ecologists have found a number of patterns:

* '''Liability of newness'''. Here, the risk of failure is high initially but declines as the organization ages.
* '''Liability of adolescence'''. The risk of mortality will be low at first as the organization is buffered from failure due to support by external constituents and initial endowments. But when these initial resources become depleted, the mortality hazard shoots up and then declines following the liability of newness pattern.
* '''Liabilities of aging'''. Here, the risk of failure increases with organizational age. This could be due to a ''liability of senescence'' (internal inefficiencies arising from the aging of the organization) or a ''liability of obsolescence'' (a growing external mismatch with the environment).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evolutionary approaches to organizations ==
Organizational ecology can be usefully compared with evolutionary theories in economics (e.g. Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hannan and Freeman also note the influences of biological ecology and economic evolution on their population ecology model (specifically Elton, 1927; Durkheim, 1947; Hawley, 1950; and Hutchison, 1959).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Main similarities between these strands of literature are: (1) the emphasis on organizational routines and the limits to organizational adaptability, (2) the population or system level of analysis and (3) the importance of environmental selection. Organizational ecology's perspective is more Darwinistic (see Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1989, pp 20–22), while Nelson &amp; Winter (1982, p.&amp;nbsp;11) provide a more Lamarckian perspective.  Another important difference concerns the question: What is selected by the environment-- 'organizational forms', as in organizational ecology, or 'routines' as in the evolutionary economics literature? Authors like Joel Baum and Arjen van Witteloostuijn have argued for the potential of cross-fertilization between these two research strands.

A social networks perspective on the evolution of large scale interfirm organizational networks was presented by Braha et al.&lt;ref&gt;Braha, Dan, Blake Stacey, and Yaneer Bar-Yam, 2011. [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/Journal_Version_SON_Braha.pdf “Corporate competition: A self-organized network”,] ''Social Networks'' 33 (3): 219–230.&lt;/ref&gt; who propose micro-dynamic models that reproduce actual large-scale interfirm perceived competition networks. Several evolutionary mechanisms of organizational networks are identified: spatial locations of firms are positively correlated with the population density; interfirm competition is governed by cumulative advantage rules and geographic distance; and competition network formation and firm size dynamics are closely intertwined.

The study of '''pathogenomics''' attempts to utilize [[genomic]] and [[metagenomics]] data gathered from high through-put technologies (e.g. [[sequencing]] or [[DNA microarrays]]), to understand microbe diversity and interaction as well as host-microbe interactions involved in disease states.  The bulk of pathogenomics research concerns itself with pathogens that affect human health; however, studies also exist for plant and animal infecting microbes.

==History==
In the early investigation of microbial [[genomics]], it was difficult and costly to obtain sequence information for any pathogen. In 1995, the first pathogen genome, that of [[Haemophilus influenza]], was sequenced by traditional Sanger methods.  Sanger methods, however, were slow and costly.&lt;ref name="Fleischmann"&gt;{{Cite journal

With the sequences of many organisms available for analysis, scientists, through their investigations, began to challenge some of the earlier tenets of bacterial genome structure. Older paradigms of microbial genomics believed that only a few strains were sufficient to represent a specific bacterial species.&lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Raskin"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became evident that sequencing multiple strains for a species, rather than a few selectively chosen ones, was necessary to understand the diversity in a microbial species [[gene pool]]. It was also increasingly important to understand how to account for these differences in genomic content across a species strains and how it may contribute to pathogenic behaviour or prevent the  formation of pathogens.&lt;ref name="Liggett" /&gt;
{{news release|date=December 2011}}
More recently,{{When|date=November 2015}} the sequenced genomic data have been catalogued in databases and made publicly available online (there also exist non-publicly available databases in the [[private sector]]).  The availability and influx of this information presses upon those who conduct pathogenomics research to come up with a way of drawing meaningful conclusions from these data. In addition, the availability of such data on the Internet encourages global collaboration of labs.

==Microbe analysis==
[[Pathogens]] may be prokaryotic (archaea or bacteria), single-celled Eukarya or viruses. Prokaryotic genomes have typically been easier to sequence due to smaller genome size compared to Eukarya.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt; Due to this, there is a bias in reporting [[pathogenic bacteria]]l behaviour.  More recently{{When|date=November 2015}} there have been increased efforts to sequence Eukarya genomes and more will be underway in the future.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt; Regardless of this bias in reporting, many of the dynamic genomic events are similar across all the types of pathogen organisms.

Pathogenomics does not focus exclusively on understanding [[Host–pathogen interaction|pathogen-host interactions]]. Insight of individual or cooperative pathogen behaviour provides knowledge into the development or inheritance of pathogen virulence factors.&lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt; Through a deeper understanding of the small subunits that cause infection, it may be able possible to develop novel therapeutics that are efficient and cost effective.

===Analyzing individual microbes===
Dynamic [[genomes]]  with high plasticity are necessary to allow pathogens, especially bacteria, to survive in changing environments.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt;  With the assistance of high throughput sequencing methods and [[in silico]] technologies, it is possible to detect, compare and catalogue many of these dynamic genomic events. Particular interest is in understanding how genomic events lead to pathogen development and how these events may be interrupted to prevent it.

====Causes of genomic diversity====
Three forces act in shaping the pathogen genome: gene gain, gene loss, and genome rearrangement.&lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt; The knowledge and detection of these genomic dynamic events are necessary in the construction of useful therapeutic tools to combat pathogens.

=====Bacterial genome evolutionary dynamics=====

======Gene loss and genome decay======
Gene loss or genome decay occurs when a gene is no longer used by the microbe or when a microbe attempts to adapt to a new ecological niche.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-10-54| pmid = 19175920| title = Evidence for niche adaptation in the genome of the bovine pathogen Streptococcus uberis| journal = BMC Genomics| volume = 10| pages = 54| year = 2009| last1 = Ward | first1 = P.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inactivation of genes is typically associated with a change in the lifestyle of an organism, which can involve adapting to a new niche. The presence of extensive pseudogenes is contrary to another orthodox belief that all the genes in a bacterial genome are functional for some purpose&lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt;

It is possible to detect the presence of pseudogenes and the marks of genome decay through whole-genome sequencing in combination with [[comparative genomics]] &lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt; Comparative genomics has helped to reveal that pathogens may favour losing genes in order to live in a host-associated niche and become endosymbionts. Sometimes the shedding of certain genes also renders a pathogen microbe harmless. The analysis of [[Listeria]] strains, for example, has shown that a reduced genome size has led to the generation of a non-pathogenic [[Listeria]] strain from a pathogenic precursor.&lt;ref name="Hain"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have been shown to exhibit genome-wide rearrangements due to [[insertion sequences]]  and repetitive DNA segments.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt;  At this time, no studies demonstrate genome-wide rearrangement events directly giving rise to pathogenic behaviour in a microbe. This does not mean it is not possible.  Genome-wide rearrangements do, however, contribute to the plasticity of bacterial genome, which may prime the conditions for other factors to introduce, or lose, virulence factors.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt;

======Single-nucleotide polymorphism======
[[Single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) are also a genomic variable that adds to the diversity of pathogen strains. Current{{When|date=November 2015}} efforts attempt to catalogue the various SNPs in pathogen strains.&lt;ref name = "Europe" /&gt;

====Analysis of genomic diversity====
There is a need to analyze more than a single genome sequence of a pathogen species to understand pathogen mechanisms. [[Comparative genomics]] is a methodology that has gained more applicability with the recent{{When|date=November 2015}} increased amount of sequence information.  There are several examples of successful comparative genomics studies, among them the analysis of Listeria.&lt;ref name="Hain" /&gt;  and Escherichia coli.&lt;ref name="Perna" /&gt; The most important topic comparative genomics, in a pathogenomic context, attempts to address the difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes.  This inquiry, though, proves to be very difficult to analyze, since a single bacterial species can have many strains and the genomic content of each of these strains can vary.&lt;ref name="Perna" /&gt;

=====Pan-genomes and core genomes=====

Caution may need to be exercised when extending the definition of a pan-genome or a core-genome to the other pathogen organisms; this is because there is no formal evidence of the properties of these pan-genomes. Here, it will be assumed that the definitions may extend, since all pathogen organisms share in the same dynamic genomic events and rely upon variability within strains as a mechanism of survival and virulence.

A core genome is the set of genes found across all strains of a pathogen species.&lt;ref name= " Tettelin " /&gt; A pan-genome is the entire gene pool for that pathogen species, and includes genes that are not shared by all strains.&lt;ref name= " Tettelin " /&gt; Pan-genomes may be open or closed depending on whether  comparative analysis of multiple strains reveals no new genes (closed) or many new genes (open) compared to the core genome for that pathogen species.&lt;ref name= " Pallen " /&gt; In the open pan-genome, genes may be further characterized as dispensable or strain specific.   Dispensable genes are those found in more than one strain, but not in all strains, of a pathogen species.&lt;ref name= " Medini " /&gt; Strain specific genes are those found only in one strain of a pathogen species.&lt;ref name= " Medini " /&gt; The differences in pan-genomes are reflections of the life style of the organism.

===Eco-evo perspective===
The "eco-evo" perspective on pathogen-host interactions emphasizes the influences ecology and the environment on pathogen evolution.&lt;ref name= "Pallen " /&gt; The dynamic genomic factors such as gene loss, gene gain and genome rearrangement are all strongly influenced by changes in the ecological niche that a particular microbial strain resides in. Microbes may switch from being pathogenic and non-pathogenic due to changing environments.&lt;ref name= " Hain" /&gt; Studies of the plague, [[Yersinia pestis]], are prominent demonstration of how over time a microbe, in this case Yersinia pestis, evolves from a gastrointestinal pathogen to a very highly pathogenic microbe through dynamic genomic events.&lt;ref name= " Achtman"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These flips between being pathogenic and non-pathogenic status and how they occurred with respect to ecological or environmental changes are important in novel therapeutic development to combat microbial infections.&lt;ref name= "Pallen " /&gt;

==Applications==
Many of the future challenges of pathogenomics begin with handling and making sense of the large influx of data that now is available to the research community. Mining the data for useful information proves to be applicable to many facets of [[epidemiology]]. [[bioinformatics]] approaches are providing much of the power for rapidly mining, organising, analyzing, visualizing and annotating the data catalogued in databases.

Note that pathogenomics research could shed light for  extensions of pathogens, or non-pathogens, that are not related to human, plant or animal health; using microbes for bioremediation is one example. There is some but very little dialogue, however, concerning these extensions to pathogens and their relation to pathogenomics. It would be more suitable{{When|date=November 2015}} to categorize [[pathogen]]/non-pathogen applications that are unrelated to infection under the more general category of microbe genomics. Some general reviews speak extensively both about pathogen related and non-related applications in the same article.&lt;ref name= "Liggett " /&gt;

In the advent of new technology, it is easy{{When|date=November 2015}} to forget some of the basic things that prevent pathogen infections from starting and spreading. While there exist more deadly and difficult-to-handle pathogen infections, there also exist less dangerous ones. Historically, human health greatly improved with more emphasis on healthy life styles including better [[hygiene]] practices and access to clean recourses of water and nutrition.

===Reverse vaccinology===
The variability of genomes can make the developed of a vaccine very difficult, and [[antigen]] variation cannot match pathogen variation. [[Reverse vaccinology]] is a novel approach that may develop vaccines to combat pathogens  more effectively.&lt;ref name= "Serruto"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Countering bioterrorism===

'''Personalization''', broadly known as '''customization''', consists of tailoring a service or a product to accommodate specific individuals, sometimes tied to groups or segments of individuals.  A wide variety of organizations use personalization to improve [[customer satisfaction]], digital sales conversion, marketing results, branding, and improved website metrics as well as for [[advertising]]. Personalization is a key element in [[social media]] and [[recommender system]]s.

==Digital media and internet==
Another aspect of personalization is the increasing prevalence of [[open data]] on the Web. Many companies make their data available on the Web via [[API]]s, web services, and [[open data]] standards. One such example is Ordnance Survey Open Data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/02/ordnance-survey-open-data | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Chris | last1=Thorpe | first2=Simon | last2=Rogers | title=Ordnance Survey opendata maps: what does it actually include? | date=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data made available in this way is structured to allow it to be inter-connected and re-used by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/372363/Google_Opens_Up_Data_Center_For_Third_Party_Web_Applications |title=Google Opens Up Data Centre for Third Party Web Applications |publisher=Cio.com |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data available from a user's personal [[social graph]] can be accessed by third-party [[application software]] to be suited to fit the personalized [[web page]] or [[information appliance]].

Current [[open data]] standards on the Web include:
# Attention Profiling Mark-up Language (APML)
# DataPortability
# [[OpenID]]
# [[OpenSocial]]

===Web pages===
[[Web page]]s can be personalized based on the characteristics (interests, social category, context, etc.), actions (click on button, open a link, etc.), intent (make a purchase, check status of an entity), or any other parameter that can be identified and associated with an individual, therefore providing them with a tailored user experience.  Note that the experience is rarely simply accommodation of the user but a relationship between the user and the desires of the site designers in driving specific actions to achieve objectives (e.g. Increase sales conversion on a page).  The term ''customization'' is often used when the site only uses explicit data such as product ratings or user preferences.

Technically, web personalization can be achieved by associating a visitor segment with a predefined action. Customizing the user experience based on behavioural, contextual and technical data is proven to have a positive impact on conversion rate optimization efforts. Associated actions can range from changing the content of a webpage, presenting a modal display, presenting interstitials, triggering a personalized email or even automating a phone call to the user.

According to a 2014 study from research firm Econsultancy, less than 30% of [[e-commerce]] websites have invested in the field of web personalization. However, many companies now offer services for web personalization as well as web and email recommendation systems that are based on personalization or anonymously-collected user behaviours.&lt;ref name=behaviours&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703294904575385532109190198 ''Wall Street Journal'', "On the Web's Cutting Edge, Anonymity in Name Only"], August 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many categories of web personalization including
# Behavioral
# Contextual
# Technical
# Historic data
# Collaboratively filtered

There are several camps in defining and executing web personalization.  A few broad methods for web personalization may include:
# Implicit
# Explicit
# Hybrid

With implicit personalization, the web personalization is performed based on the different categories mentioned above. It can also be learned from direct interactions with the user based on implicit data, such as items purchased or pages viewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Lawrence|title=5 Things To Know About Siri And Google Now's Growing Intelligence|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/07/08/5-things-to-know-about-siri-and-google-nows-growing-intelligence/|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; With explicit personalization, the web page (or information system) is changed by the user using the features provided by the system. Hybrid personalization combines the above two approaches to leverage the ''best of both worlds''.

Web personalization is can be linked to the notion of [[Adaptive hypermedia]] (AH). The main difference is that the former would usually work on what is considered an "open corpus hypermedia," whilst the latter would traditionally work on "closed corpus hypermedia." However, recent research directions in the AH domain take both closed and open corpus into account. Thus, the two fields are closely inter-related.

Personalization is also being considered for use in less overtly commercial applications to improve the user experience online.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Bowen|Bowen, J.P.]] and Filippini-Fantoni, S., [http://www.archimuse.com/mw2004/papers/bowen/bowen.html Personalization and the Web from a Museum Perspective]. In [[David Bearman]] and Jennifer Trant (eds.), ''[[Museums and the Web]] 2004: Selected Papers from an International Conference'', Arlington, Virginia, USA, 31 March – 3 April 2004. Archives &amp; Museum Informatics, pages 63–78, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Internet activist [[Eli Pariser]] has documented that search engines like [[Google]] and [[Yahoo! News]] give different results to different people (even when logged out). He also points out social media site [[Facebook]] changes user's friend feeds based on what it thinks they want to see. Pariser warns that these algorithms can create a "[[filter bubble]]" that prevents people from encountering a diversity of viewpoints beyond their own, or which only presents facts which confirm their existing views.

On an [[intranet]] or [[B2E]] [[Web portal#Enterprise Web portals|Enterprise Web portals]], personalization is often based on user attributes such as department, functional area, or role. The term "customization" in this context refers to the ability of users to modify the page layout or specify what content should be displayed.

=== Map personalization ===
{{Expand section|date=September 2015}}Digital [[Web mapping|web maps]] are also being personalized. [[Google Maps]] change the content of the map based on previous searches and other profile information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Next Frontier For Google Maps Is Personalization|url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/01/the-next-frontier-for-google-maps-is-personalization/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 2015-09-13|first = Frederic|last = Lardinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology writer [[Evgeny Morozov]] has criticized map personalization as a threat to [[public space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = My Map or Yours?|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/05/google_maps_personalization_will_hurt_public_space_and_engagement.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2013-05-28|access-date = 2015-09-13|issn = 1091-2339|language = en|first = Evgeny|last = Morozov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile phones ===

Over time mobile phones have seen an increased emphasis placed on user personalization. Far from the black and white screens and monophonic ringtones of the past, phones now offer interactive wallpapers and MP3 [[truetone]]s. In the UK and Asia, [[WeeMee]]s have become popular. WeeMees are three-dimensional characters that are used as wallpaper and respond to the tendencies of the user. [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) picture quality allows people to change their background with ease without sacrificing quality. All of these services are downloaded through the provider with the goal to make the user feel [[Mobile phone overuse|connected]] to the phone.&lt;ref&gt;May, Harvey, and Greg Hearn. "The Mobile Phone as Media." International Journal of Cultural Studies 8.2 (2005): 195-211. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Print media and merchandise ==
{{main|Mail merge}}

In print media, ranging from [[magazine]]s to [[admail|promotional publication]]s, personalization uses databases of individual recipients' information. Not only does the written document address itself by name to the reader, but the advertising is targeted to the recipient's demographics or interests using fields within the database, such as "first name", "last name", "company", etc.

The term "personalization" should not be confused with variable data, which is a much more granular method of marketing that leverages both images and text with the medium, not just fields within a database. Although personalized children's books are created by companies who are using and leveraging all the strengths of [[variable data printing|variable data printing (VDP)]]. This allows for full image and text variability within a printed book.
With the advent of online 3D printing services such as Shapeways and Ponoko we are seeing personalization enter into the realms of product design.

=== Promotional merchandise ===
Promotional items ([[mug]]s, [[T-shirt]]s, [[keychain]]s, [[ball]]s etc.) are regularly personalized. Personalized children's storybooks—wherein the child becomes the [[protagonist]], with the name and image of the child personalized—are also popular. Personalized CDs for children also exist. With the advent of [[digital printing]], personalized calendars that start in any month, birthday cards, cards, e-cards, posters and photo books can also be obtained.

=== 3D printing ===
[[3D printing]] is a production method that allows to create unique and personalized items on a global scale. Personalized apparel and accessories, such as jewellery, are increasing in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewellermagazine.com/Article.aspx?id=2167&amp;h=New-jewellery-website-targets-|title=New jewellery website targets 'customisers'|last=Weinman|first=Aaron|date=21 February 2012|publisher=Jeweller Magazine|language=|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of customization is also relevant in other areas like [[consumer electronics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160121-philips-launches-worlds-first-personalized-3d-printed-face-shaver-for-limited-edition-run.html|title=Philips launches the world's first personalized, 3D printed face shaver for limited edition run|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[retail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://twikblog.twikit.com/belgian-3d-company-twikit-brings-3d-customization-french-retail/|title=Twikit brings 3D customization to French retail.|website=Twikit Blog {{!}} 3D Customization, 3D Printing|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining 3D printing with complex software a product can easily be customized by an end-user.

==Role of customers==

=== Mass personalization ===

{{tone|section|date=January 2011}}

Mass personalization is defined as custom tailoring by a company in accordance with its end users tastes and preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/personalization&amp;r=67 |title=personalize: Definition, Synonyms from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; From collaborative engineering perspective, mass customization can be viewed as collaborative efforts between customers and manufacturers, who have different sets of priorities and need to jointly search for solutions that best match customers' individual specific needs with manufacturers' customization capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, S., Y. Wang and M. M. Tseng. 2009. Mass Customization as a Collaborative Engineering Effort. International Journal of Collaborative Engineering, 1(2): 152-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Sengottuvelan, R. Lokeshkumar, T. Gopalakrishnan, "An Improved Session Identification Approach in Web Log Mining for Web Personalization," Journal of Internet Technology, vol. 18, no. 4 , pp. 723-730, Jul. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between mass customization and mass personalization is that customization is the ability for a company to give its customers an opportunity to create and choose product to certain specifications, but does have limits.&lt;ref&gt;Haag et al., ''Management Information Systems for the Information Age'', 3rd edition, 2006, page 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of mass personalization: 
A website knowing a user's location and buying habits will offer suggestions tailored to that user's demographics. Each user is classified by some relevant trait (location, age, and so forth) and then given personalization aimed at that group. This means that the personalization is not individual to that singular user, it only pinpoints a specific trait that matches them up with a larger group of people. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9808015/How-supermarkets-prop-up-our-class-system.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=How supermarkets prop up our class system | date=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Behavioral targeting]] represents a concept that is similar to mass personalization.

=== Predictive personalization ===

Predictive personalization is defined as the ability to predict customer behavior, needs or wants - and tailor offers and communications very precisely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/jwtintelligence/jwt-10-trends-for-2013-executive-summary|title=10 Trends for 2013 Executive Summary: Definition, Projected Trends |publisher=JWTIntelligence.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social data is one source of providing this predictive analysis, particularly social data that is structured.  Predictive personalization is a much more recent means of personalization and can be used well to augment current personalization offerings.

'''Phylogeography''' is the study of the historical processes that may be responsible for the contemporary geographic distributions of individuals.  This is accomplished by considering the geographic distribution of individuals in light of [[genetics]], particularly [[population genetics]].&lt;ref name="Avise00"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Avise  | first = J.  | title = Phylogeography: The History and Formation of Species  | publisher = [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]]  | year = 2000  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=lA7YWH4M8FUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=phylogeography&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=  | isbn = 0-674-66638-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term was introduced to describe geographically structured genetic signals within and among [[species]]. An explicit focus on a species' [[biogeography]]/biogeographical past sets phylogeography apart from classical [[population genetics]] and [[phylogenetics]].&lt;ref name="K&amp;M02"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knowles, L. L. and [[W. P. Maddison]] |year=2002 |title=Statistical phylogeography |journal=[[Molecular Ecology]] |volume=11 |pages=2623–2635 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2002.01637.x |pmid=12453245 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past events that can be inferred include population expansion, [[population bottlenecks]], [[vicariance]] and [[human migration|migration]]. Recently developed approaches integrating [[coalescent theory]] or the genealogical history of [[alleles]]  and distributional information can more accurately address the relative roles of these different historical forces in shaping current patterns.&lt;ref name="C&amp;T00"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cruzan, M. B |author2=A. R. Templeton  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000 |title=Paleoecology and coalescence: phylogeographic analysis of hypotheses from the fossil record |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=15 |pages=491–496 | doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01998-4 |pmid=11114435 |issue=12}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The term phylogeography was first used by [[John Avise]] in his 1987 work ''Intraspecific Phylogeography: The Mitochondrial DNA Bridge Between Population Genetics and Systematics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avise|first=J.C.|author2=J Arnold |author3=R M Ball |author4=E Bermingham |author5=T Lamb |author6=J E Neigel |author7=C A Reeb |author8=N C Saunders |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=1987|volume=18 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.18.110187.002421 |title=Intraspecific Phylogeography: The Mitochondrial DNA Bridge Between Population Genetics and Systematics |pages=489–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical biogeography addresses how historical geological, climatic and ecological conditions influenced the current distribution of species. As part of historical biogeography, researchers had been evaluating the geographical and evolutionary relationships of organisms years before. Two developments during the 1960s and 1970s were particularly important in laying the groundwork for modern phylogeography; the first was the spread of [[cladistic]] thought, and the second was the development of [[plate tectonics|plate tectonics theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=De Queiroz, A. |year=2005 |title=The resurrection of oceanic dispersal in historical biogeography |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=20 |pages=68–73 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.11.006 |pmid=16701345 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting school of thought was vicariance biogeography, which explained the origin of new lineages through geological events like the drifting apart of continents or the formation of rivers. When a continuous population (or species) is divided by a new river or a new mountain range (i.e., a vicariance event), two populations (or species) are created. [[Paleogeography]], [[geology]] and [[paleoecology]] are all important fields that supply information that is integrated into phylogeographic analyses.

Phylogeography takes a [[population genetic]]s and [[phylogenetic]] perspective on [[biogeography]]. In the mid-1970s, population genetic analyses turned to mitochondrial markers.&lt;ref name="Avise98"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Avise, J. C. |year=1998 |title=The history and purview of phylogeography: a personal reflection |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=7 |pages=371–379 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00391.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the process where millions of copies of a [[DNA]] segment can be replicated, was crucial in the development of phylogeography.

Thanks to this breakthrough, the information contained in mitochondrial DNA sequences was much more accessible. Advances in both laboratory methods (e.g. [[capillary]] [[DNA sequencing]] technology) that allowed easier sequencing DNA and computational methods that make better use of the data (e.g. employing [[coalescent theory]]) have helped improve phylogeographic inference.&lt;ref name="Avise98" /&gt;

Early phylogeographic work has recently been criticized for its narrative nature and lack of [[statistical]] rigor ([[i.e.]] it did not statistically test alternative hypotheses). The only real method was [[Alan Templeton]]'s Nested Clade Analysis, which made use of an inference key to determine the validity of a given process in explaining the concordance between geographic distance and genetic relatedness. Recent approaches have taken a stronger statistical approach to phylogeography than was done initially.&lt;ref name="K&amp;M02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton, A. R., E. Routman, and C. A.

'''Example'''

Climate change, such as the glaciation cycles of the past 2.4 million years, has periodically restricted some species into disjunct refugia. These restricted ranges may result in [[population bottlenecks]] that reduce genetic variation. Once a reversal in climate change allows for rapid migration out of refugial areas, these species spread rapidly into newly available habitat. A number of empirical studies find genetic signatures of both animal and plant species that support this scenario of refugia and postglacial expansion.&lt;ref name="C&amp;T00" /&gt; This has occurred both in the tropics (where the main effect of glaciation is increasing [[arid]]ity, i.e. the expansion of savanna and retraction of [[tropical rainforest]])&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schneider, C.

Fumagalli, A.-G. Wust-Saucy, and J.-F. Cossons |year=1998 |title=Comparative phylogeography and postglacial colonization routes in Europe |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=7 |pages=453–464 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00289.x |pmid=9628000 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phylogeography and conservation==
Phylogeography can help in the prioritization of areas of high value for conservation. Phylogeographic analyses have also played an important role in defining [[evolutionary significant unit]]s (ESU), a unit of conservation below the species level that is often defined on unique geographic distribution and mitochondrial genetic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moritz, C. |year=1994 |title=Defining "evolutionary significant units" for conservation |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=9 |pages=373–375 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(94)90057-4 |issue=10 |pmid=21236896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study on imperiled cave [[crayfish]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of eastern North America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Buhay, J. E.  |author2=K. A. Crandall  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=Subterranean phylogeography of freshwater crayfishes shows extensive gene flow and surprisingly large population sizes |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=14 | pages=4259–4273 |pmid=16313591 |issue=14 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02755.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates how phylogenetic analyses along with geographic distribution can aid in recognizing conservation priorities. Using phylogeographical approaches, the authors found that hidden within what was thought to be a single, widely distributed species, an ancient and previously undetected species was also present. Conservation decisions can now be made to ensure that both lineages received protection. Results like this are not an uncommon outcome from phylogeographic studies.

An analysis of [[salamanders]] of the genus ''[[Eurycea]]'', also in the Appalachians, found that the current taxonomy of the group greatly underestimated species level diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kozak, K. H., A. B. Russell and A. Larson |year=2006 |title=Gene lineages and eastern North American paleodrainage basins: phylogeography and speciation in salamanders of the ''Eurycea bislineata'' species complex |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=15 |pages=191–207 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02757.x |pmid=16367840 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study also found that patterns of phylogeographic diversity were more associated with historical (rather than modern) drainage connections, indicating that major shifts in the drainage patterns of the region played an important role in the generation of diversity of these salamanders. A thorough understanding of phylogeographic structure will thus allow informed choices in prioritizing areas for conservation.

==Comparative phylogeography==
[[File:Phylogeography poisonfrogs.jpg|thumb|450px|These figures map out the phylogeographic history of [[Poison dart frog|poison frogs]] in South America.]]

The field of comparative phylogeography seeks to explain the mechanisms responsible for the phylogenetic relationships and distribution of ''different'' species. For example, comparisons across multiple taxa can clarify the histories of biogeographical regions.&lt;ref name="Riginos"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riginos, C. |year=2005 |title=Cryptic vicariance in Gulf of California fishes parallels vicariant patterns found in Baja California mammals and reptiles |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=59 | pages=2678–2690 |doi=10.1554/05-257.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, phylogeographic analyses of terrestrial vertebrates on the [[Baja California]] peninsula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riddle, B. R., D. J. Hafner, L. F. Alexander, and J. R. Jaeger |year=2000 |title=Cryptic vicariance in the historical assembly of a Baja California Peninsular Desert biota |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=97 |pages=14438–14443 |doi=10.1073/pnas.250413397 |pmid=11095731 |issue=26 |pmc=18937}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marine fish on both the Pacific and gulf sides of the peninsula&lt;ref name="Riginos" /&gt; display genetic signatures that suggest a vicariance event affected multiple taxa during the [[Pleistocene]] or [[Pliocene]].

Phylogeography also gives an important historical perspective on community composition. History is relevant to regional and local diversity in two ways.&lt;ref name="Schneider" /&gt; One, the size and makeup of the regional [[species pool]] results from the balance of [[speciation]] and [[extinction]]. Two, at a local level community composition is influenced by the interaction between local extinction of species’ populations and recolonization.&lt;ref name="Schneider" /&gt; A comparative phylogenetic approach in the Australian Wet Tropics indicates that regional patterns of species distribution and diversity are largely determined by local extinctions and subsequent recolonizations corresponding to climatic cycles.

Phylogeography integrates biogeography and genetics to study in greater detail the lineal history of a species in context of the geoclimatic history of the planet. An example study of poison frogs living in the South American [[neotropics]] (illustrated to the left) is used to demonstrate how phylogeographers combine [[genetics]] and [[paleogeography]] to piece together the ecological history of organisms in their environments. Several major geoclimatic events have greatly influenced the biogeographic distribution of organisms in this area, including [[Great American Interchange|the isolation and reconnection of South America]], the uplift of the Andes, an extensive [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian]] floodbasin system during the Miocene, the formation of [[Orinoco]] and [[Amazon River#Drainage area|Amazon drainages]], and dry−wet climate cycles throughout the [[Pliocene]] to [[Pleistocene]] epochs.&lt;ref name="Santos09"/&gt;

Using this contextual paleogeographic information (paleogeographic time series is shown in panels A-D) the authors of this study&lt;ref name="Santos09"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Santos  | first = J. C.  | last2 = Coloma  | first2 = L. A.  | last3 = Summers | first3 = K.  | last4 = Caldwell  | first4 = J. P.  | last5 = Ree  | first5 = R.  | title = Amazonian Amphibian Diversity Is Primarily Derived from Late Miocene Andean Lineages  | journal = PLoS Biol  | volume = 7  | issue = 3 | pages = e1000056  | year = 2009  | url = http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000056  | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000056  | pmid = 19278298  | first6 = DC  | pmc = 2653552  | last7 = Moritz  | first7 = Craig  | editor1-last = Moritz  | editor1-first = Craig|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a null-hypothesis that assumes no spatial structure and two alternative hypothesis involving dispersal and other biogeographic constraints (hypothesis are shown in panels E-G, listed as SMO, SM1, and SM2). The phylogeographers visited the ranges of each frog species to obtain tissue samples for genetic analysis; researchers can also obtain tissue samples from museum collections.

The evolutionary history and relations among different poison frog species is reconstructed using [[phylogenetic tree]]s derived from molecular data. The molecular trees are mapped in relation to paleogeographic history of the region for a complete phylogeographic study. The tree shown in the center of the figure has its branch lengths calibrated to a [[molecular clock]], with the geological time bar shown at the bottom. The same phylogenetic tree is duplicated four more times to show where each lineage is distributed and is found (illustrated in the inset maps below, including Amazon basin, Andes, Guiana-Venezuela, Central America-Chocó).&lt;ref name="Santos09"/&gt;

The combination of techniques used in this study exemplifies more generally how phylogeographic studies proceed and test for patterns of common influence. Paleogeographic data establishes geological time records for historical events that explain the branching patterns in the molecular trees. This study rejected the null model and found that the origin for all extant Amazonian poison frog species primarily stem from fourteen lineages that dispersed into their respective areas after the Miocene floodbasin receded.&lt;ref name="Santos09" /&gt; Regionally based phylogeographic studies of this type are repeated for different species as a means of independent testing. Phylogeographers find broadly concordant and repeated patterns among species in most regions of the planet that is due to a common influence of [[paleoclimatic]] history.&lt;ref name="Avise00"/&gt;

==Human phylogeography==
{{main|Recent single-origin hypothesis|Multiregional hypothesis}}
Phylogeography has also proven to be useful in understanding the origin and dispersal patterns of our own species, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Based primarily on observations of skeletal remains of ancient human remains and estimations of their age, anthropologists proposed two competing hypotheses about human origins.

The first hypothesis is referred to as the '''[[Recent single-origin hypothesis|Out-of-Africa with replacement]]''' model, which contends that the last expansion out of [[Africa]] around 100,000 years ago resulted in the modern humans displacing all previous ''Homo'' spp. populations in [[Eurasia]] that were the result of an earlier wave of emigration out of Africa. The '''[[Multiregional hypothesis|multiregional]]''' scenario claims that individuals from the recent expansion out of Africa intermingled genetically with those human populations of more ancient African emigrations. 
A phylogeographic study that uncovered a '''[[Mitochondrial Eve]]''' that lived in Africa 150,000 years ago provided early support for the Out-of-Africa model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cann, R.L., Stoneking, M., and A. C. Wilson |year=1987 |title=Mitochondrial DNA and human evolution |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=325 |pages=31–36 |doi=10.1038/325031a0 |pmid=3025745 |issue=6099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this study had its shortcomings, it received significant attention both within scientific circles and a wider audience. A more thorough phylogeographic analysis that used ten different genes instead of a single mitochondrial marker indicates that at least two major expansions out of Africa after the initial range extension of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' played an important role shaping the modern human gene pool and that recurrent genetic exchange is pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton, A. R. |year=2002|url=http://www.bioguider.com/ebook/biology/pdf/Templeton_n2002.pdf |title=Out of Africa again and again |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=416 |pages=45–51 |doi=10.1038/416045a |issue=6876}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings strongly demonstrated Africa's central role in the [[evolution]] of modern humans, but also indicated that the multiregional model had some validity. These studies have largely been supplanted by population genomic studies that use orders of magnitude more data.

In light of these recent data from the 1000 genomes project, genomic-scale SNP databases sampling thousands of individuals globally and samples taken from two non-Homo sapiens hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans), the picture of human evolutionary has become more resolved and complex involving possible Neanderthal and Denisovan admixture, admixture with archaic African hominins, and Eurasian expansion into the Australasian region that predates the standard out of African expansion.

==Phylogeography of viruses==
Viruses are informative in understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change due to their rapid mutation rate and fast generation time.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holmes, E. C. |year=2004 |title=The phylogeography of human viruses |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=13 |pages=745–756 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.02051.x |pmid=15012753 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylogeography is a useful tool in understanding the origins and distributions of different viral strains. A phylogeographic approach has been taken for many diseases that threaten human health, including [[dengue fever]], [[rabies]], [[influenza]] and [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="Holmes" /&gt; Similarly, a phylogeographic approach will likely play a key role in understanding the vectors and spread of [[avian influenza]] ([[HPAI H5N1]]), demonstrating the relevance of phylogeography to the general public.

==Phylogeography of languages==
Phylogeographic analysis of ancient and modern languages has been used to test whether [[Indo-European languages]] originated in [[Anatolia]] or in the [[steppe]]s of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mapping the Origins and Expansion of the Indo-European Language Family | journal = Science | date = 24 Aug 2012 | first = Remco | last = Bouckaert |author2=Philippe Lemey |author3=Michael Dunn |author4=Simon J. Greenhill |author5=Alexander V. Alekseyenko |author6=Alexei J. Drummond |author7=Russell D. Gray |author8=Marc A. Suchard |author9=Quentin D. Atkinson   | volume = 337 | issue = 6097 | pages = 957–960 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6097/957.abstract | accessdate = 2012-09-04 | doi=10.1126/science.1219669 | pmid=22923579 | pmc=4112997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language evolution was modeled in terms of the gain and loss of cognate words in each language over time, to produce a [[cladogram]] of related languages. Combining those data with known geographic ranges of each language produced strong support for an Anatolian origin approximately 8000–9500 years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6736">'''Pressure reference system (PRS)''' is an enhancement of the [[inertial reference system]] and [[attitude and heading reference system]] designed to provide [[aircraft principal axes|position angles]] measurements which are stable in time and do not suffer from long term [[inertial navigation system|drift]] caused by the sensor imperfections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=King |first=A. D. |title=Inertial Navigation – Forty Years of Evolution |journal=GEC Review (General Electric Company plc) |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=140–149 |url=http://www.imar-navigation.de/downloads/papers/inertial_navigation_introduction.pdf |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement system uses behavior of the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] where [[atmospheric pressure]] descends with increasing [[altitude]] and two pairs of measurement units. Each pair measures pressure at two different positions that are mechanically connected with known distance between units, e.g. the units are mounted at the tips of the wing. In horizontal flight, there is no pressure difference measured by the measurement system which means the position angle is zero. In case the airplane turns, the tips of the wings mutually change their positions, one is going up and the second one is going down, and the [[pressure sensor]]s in every unit measure different values which are translated into a [[aircraft principal axes|position angle]].

== Overview ==
The [[strapdown]] inertial navigation system uses double integration of the accelerations measured by an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stovall |first=Sherryl H. |title=Basic Inertial Navigation |url=http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/nav/basicnav.pdf |publisher=Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division |date=September 1997 |accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process sums the sensors outputs together with all the sensor and measurement errors. The precision and long-term stability of the INS system depends on the quality of sensors used within the IMU. The sensor quality can be evaluated by [[Allan Variance]] technique. A precise IMU uses laser gyroscopes and precise accelerometers which are expensive. The INS is a sole system with no other inputs. Nowadays the trend of the modern navigation is to [[Kalman filter|integrate]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Weed |first1=D. |last2=Broderick |first2=J. |last3=Love |first3=J. |last4=Ryno |first4=T. |title=GPS Align In Motion of civilian strapdown INS |conference=Position Location and Navigation Symposium. 26–29 April 2004 |year=2004 |pages=184–192 |doi=10.1109/PLANS.2004.1308992 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1308992&amp;isnumber=29049 |accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; signals from IMU together with data provided by [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS). This approach gives long term stability to the INS output by suppressing sensor error influence on the calculation of the airplane position. The measurement system becomes [[attitude and heading reference system]] which can relax requirement on the sensor precision because the long-term stability is assured by GPS. The sensors used within AHRS are used only for position angles determination and so just one numerical integration of the [[angular rate]] measurements is required. The AHRS system is cheaper and a lot of universities and companies are developing AHRS systems based on [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) sensors. The MEMS sensors do not have [[performance-based navigation|performance required for navigation purposes]]. It is shown in an experimental research report,&lt;ref&gt;({{cite web |last1=Crittenden |first1=Jordan |last2=Evans |first2=Parker |title=MEMS Inertial Navigation System |url=http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/eceprojectsland/STUDENTPROJ/2007to2008/pae26_jsc59/final.pdf |format=PDF |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2012-12-31}})&lt;/ref&gt; where the output of the navigation solution drifts away after 2 seconds. The AHRS units based on MEMS inertial sensors usually also use a vector magnetometer, a GPS receiver, and a data fusion algorithm to cope with MEMS inertial sensors errors. Next to the sensor imperfections there are also environmental parameters which influence the computed values (position angles):
* temperature effects (and humidity, pressure, etc.)
* engine vibrations
* accelerations caused by airplane movement, e.g. turns
* etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MGL Avionics. SP-2 Magnetometer. SP-4 AHRS. User and Installation Manual |url=http://www.mglavionics.co.za/Docs/SP2-SP4.pdf |publisher=MGL Avionics |accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All these influences cause drifts in the computed output data which can confuse pilot who performs the flight.

* distributed sensors with separate volumes
* distributed sensors with a reference volume&lt;ref name=DASC&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Paces |first1=Pavel |last2=Popelka |first2=Jan |title=IMU aiding using two AHRS units |conference=Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC), 2012 IEEE/AIAA 31st. 14–18 October 2012 |year=2012 |pages=5B1-1–5B1-13 |doi=10.1109/DASC.2012.6382359 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6382359&amp;contentType=Conference+Publications&amp;queryText%3DIMU+AIDING+USING+TWO+AHRS+UNITS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While the first method gives only ambiguous results the second method works well as it can be replaced by two altimeters. Disadvantage of the second method is high measurement uncertainty of both values. This is being solved by the extension of the reference volumes used even in absolute pressure sensors.&lt;ref name=DASC /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8392">The '''priming''' theory states that [[Multimedia|media]] images [[association (psychology)|stimulate related thoughts]] in the minds of audience members.&lt;ref name="SLD"&gt;Straubhaar, LaRose, Davenport.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grounded in [[cognitive psychology]], the theory of media priming is derived from the associative network model of human memory, in which an idea or concept is stored as a node in the network and is related to other ideas or concepts by semantic paths.  Priming refers to the activation of a node in this network, which may serve as a filter, an interpretive frame, or a premise for further information processing or judgment formation.&lt;ref&gt;Pan, Z. &amp; Kosicki, G.M. (1997). Priming and Media Impact on the Evaluations of the President's Performance. Communication Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General aggression model==
The '''general aggression model''' ('''GAM''') integrates the priming theory with the [[social learning theory]] to describe how previously learned violent behavior may be triggered by thoughts, emotions, or physiological states provoked by media exposure.&lt;ref name=SLD/&gt;  However, the GAM has come under considerable criticism in recent years regarding underlying and unproven assumptions and poor data support for the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson &amp; Dyck|title=Paradigm change in aggression research: The time has come to retire the General Aggression Model|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|year=2012|volume=17|pages=220–228|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.02.007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927103208/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Paradigm%20Change.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political media priming==
[[Political media]] priming is "the process in which the media attend to some issues and not others and thereby alter the standards by which people evaluate election candidates".&lt;ref&gt;Severin &amp; Tankard, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have demonstrated that there is a dimension of powerful media effects that goes beyond agenda setting. In 1982, Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder first identified this added dimension as the “[[Priming (psychology)|priming effect]].”&lt;ref name="Iyengar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder|title=Experimental Demonstrations of the "Not-So-Minimal" Consequences of Television News Programs|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1982|volume=76|issue=4|pages=848–858|doi=10.2307/1962976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is founded on the assumption that people do not have elaborate knowledge about political matters and do not take into account all of what they do know when making political decisions — they must consider what more readily comes to mind. Through drawing attention to some aspects of politics at the expense of others, the media might help to set the terms by which political judgments are reached, including evaluations of political figures.&lt;ref&gt;Alger, D.E.  (1989).  The Media and Politics.  New Jersey:  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that priming is often discussed in tandem with [[agenda-setting theory]]. The reason for this association is two-fold. The first, per Hastie &amp; Park, is that both theories revolve around salient information recall, operating on the idea that people will use information that is most readily available when making decisions. The second, per Iyengar and Kinder, is that priming is latter part of a two-fold process with agenda-setting that takes place over time. Once agenda setting has made an issue salient, priming is the process by which "mass media can... shape the considerations that people take into account when making judgements about political candidates or issues". In short, both theories point to ease of accessibility of information in one's mind but priming is something that can occur over a period of time after exposure to a given media segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scheufele &amp; Tewksbury|title=Framing, Agenda Setting, and Priming: The Evolution of Three Media Effects Models|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2007|volume=57|pages=9–20|doi=10.1111/j.0021-9916.2007.00326.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Priming isn’t always unintentional, as Jacobs and Shapiro demonstrate in a quantitative and historical analysis of [[John F. Kennedy]]’s [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential campaign]]. Their research extends the application of priming theory from its original focus of how individuals form attitudes and make decisions to the study of candidate behavior. This new approach, they say, "changes the analytic focus from unintentional priming to intentional priming, namely, the deliberate strategies that candidates pursue to influence voters". Priming can be an effective [[political campaign|campaign]] strategy for presidential candidates, the authors indicate, by a process of carefully calculated uses of [[public opinion]] on policy issues to influence voters’ standards for assessing the candidates’ attributes. In this study, the authors focus on the 1960 election because innovative public opinion surveys were incorporated into Kennedy’s campaign strategy that enabled him to use position taking to shape his image. Their research was based on primary evidence drawn from archival records and interviews, as well as a combination of interpretative and quantitative analysis. They found that a relationship exists between Kennedy’s positions on policy matters and results from his private public opinion surveys. His campaign combined image building with position taking on issues that responded to perceived public opinion. Though this study does neglect questions concerning how and why real politicians use polling results to prime voters, Jacobs and Shapiro effectively demonstrate that the priming process is powerful enough to be used intentionally by political candidates as a tool to influence public opinion during election campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs and Shapiro (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 study of priming, they set out to determine what effect intentional priming might have on the public's evaluation of president [[Jimmy Carter]]. Their hypothesis stated that making certain political topics salient through primetime media, such as defense or spending, would cause viewers to evaluate president Carter based on said topics. The experiment's results demonstrated the phenomena of agenda-setting and priming. First, Iyengar et al. found evidence of agenda-setting in the positive correlation between exposure to a given political topic and its importance when evaluating the president. They then found that said standards affected the actual evaluation of the president's performance, demonstrating priming. This experiment points to the potential of news media to direct the public's attention and perception of political figures, though the researchers also indicate that subjects with higher self-reported levels of knowledge of politics showed decreased effects of priming. This lead Iyengar's team to the conclusion that priming has varied implications depending on an individual's given knowledge prior to political news media exposure.&lt;ref name="Iyengar"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of charity''' or '''charitable interpretation''' requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Normand Baillargeon: ''Intellectual Self-Defense''. Seven Stories Press 2007, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, [[logical fallacies]], or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available. According to [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Blackburn |first=Simon
|year=1994
|title=''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]''
|location=Oxford
|publisher=Oxford University Press
|page=62
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "it constrains the interpreter to maximize the truth or rationality in the subject's sayings."

==Application==
Neil L. Wilson gave the principle its name in 1958–59. Its main area of application, by his lights, is determining the referent of a proper name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How should we set about discovering the significance which a person attaches to a given name? […] Let us suppose that somebody (whom I am calling "Charles") makes just the following five assertions containing the name "Caesar." […]&lt;br/&gt;
(1) Caesar conquered Gaul. (Gc) &lt;br/&gt;
(2) Caesar crossed the Rubicon. (Rc) &lt;br/&gt;
(3) Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March. (Mc) &lt;br/&gt;
(4) Caesar was addicted to the use of the ablative absolute. (Ac)&lt;br/&gt;
(5) Caesar was married to Boadicea. (Bc)&lt;br/&gt;
[…] And so we act on what might be called the Principle of Charity. We select as designatum that individual which will make the largest possible number of Charles' statements true. […] We might say the designatum is that individual which satisfies more of the asserted matrices containing the word "Caesar" than does any other individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide other formulations of the principle of charity. Davidson sometimes referred to it as ''the principle of rational accommodation''. He summarized it: ''We make maximum sense of the words and thoughts of others when we interpret in a way that optimises agreement''. The principle may be invoked to make sense of a speaker's utterances when one is unsure of their meaning. In particular, Quine's use of the principle gives it this latter, wide domain.

Since the time of Quine ''et al.'', other philosophers{{Who|date=August 2011}} have formulated at least four versions of the principle of charity. These alternatives may conflict with one another, so which principle to use may depend on the goal of the conversation. The four principles are:

#The other uses words in the ordinary way;
#The other makes true statements;
#The other makes valid arguments;
#The other says something interesting.

A related principle is the [[principle of humanity]], which states that we must assume that another speaker's beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances" ([[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in ''The Intentional Stance'', p.&amp;nbsp;343).

'''Psychological statistics''' is application of formulas, theorems, numbers and laws to [[psychology]]. 
Statistical Methods for psychology include development and application statistical theory and methods for modeling psychological data. 
These methods include psychometrics, Factor analysis, Experimental Designs, Multivariate Behavioral Research. The article also discusses journals in the same field Wilcox, R. (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, R. (2012). Modern Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences: A Practical Introduction. FL: CRC Press. {{isbn|9781439834565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychometrics==
{{Main article|Psychometrics}}
Psychometrics deals with measurement of psychological attributes. It involved developing and applying statistical models for mental measurements (Lord and Novik, ; etc.) The measurement theories are divided into two major areas: (1) Classical test theory; (2) Item Response Theory  (Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994). Psychometric Theory.  McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Classical Test Theory===
{{Main article|Classical test theory}}
The classical test theory or true score theory or reliability theory in statistics is a set of statistical procedures useful for development of psychological tests and scales. It is based on fundamental equation 
X = T + E
where, X is total score, T is a true score and E is error of measurement. For each participant, it assumes that there exist a true score and it need to be obtained score (X) has to be as close to it as possible (Lord, F. M. , and Novick, M. R. ( 1 968),&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. M. , and Novick, M. R. ( 1 968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Reading, Mass. : Addison-Wesley, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Raykov, T.  &amp; Marcoulides, G.A. (2010) &lt;ref&gt;Raykov, T.  &amp; Marcoulides, G.A. (2010) Introduction to Psychometric Theory. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; ). The closeness of X has with T is expressed in terms of ratability of the obtained score. The reliability in terms of classical test procedure is correlation between true score and obtained score. The typical test construction procedures has following steps:

(1)	Determine the construct 
(2)	Outline the behavioral domain of the construct
(3)	Write 3 to 5 times more items than desired test length
(4)	Get item content analyzed by experts and cull items
(5)	Obtain data on initial version of the test 
(6)	Item analysis (Statistical Procedure)
(7)	Factor analysis (Statistical Procedure)
(8)	After the second cull, make final version
(9)	Use it for research

====Reliability ====
{{Main article|Reliability (research methods)}}

The reliability is computed in specific ways.  
(A)	Inter-Rater reliability: Inter-Rater reliability is estimate of agreement between independent raters. This is most useful for subjective responses. Cohen’s Kappa, Krippendorff’s Alpha, Intra-Class correlation coefficients, Correlation coefficients, Kendal’s concordance coefficient, etc. are useful statistical tools. 
(B)	Test-Retest Reliability: Test-Retest Procedure is estimation of temporal consistency of the test. A test is administered twice to the same sample with a time interval. Correlation between two sets of scores is used as an estimate of reliability. Testing conditions are assumed to be identical. 
(C)	 Internal Consistency Reliability: Internal consistency reliability estimates consistency of items with each other. Split-half reliability (Spearman- Brown Prophecy) and Cronbach Alpha are popular estimates of this reliability . (Cronbach LJ (1951)&lt;ref&gt;Cronbach LJ (1951). Coefficient alpha and the internal structure of tests. Psychometrika 16, 297–334. doi:10.1007/bf02310555&lt;/ref&gt;). 
(D)	Parallel Form Reliability: It is an estimate of consistency between two different instruments of measurement. The inter-correlation between two parallel forms of a test or scale is used as an estimate of parallel form reliability.

====Validity====
{{Main article|Test validity}}

Validity of a scale or test is ability of the instrument to measure what it purports to measure (Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). Construct validity, Content Validity, Criterion Validity are types of validity. 
Construct validity is estimated by convergent and discriminant validity and factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity are ascertained by correlation between similar of different constructs. 
Content Validity: Subject matter experts evaluate content validity. 
Criterion Validity is correlation between the test and a criterion variable (or variables) of the construct. Regression analysis, Multiple regression analysis, Logistic regression is used as an estimate of criterion validity. 
Software applications: The R software has ‘psych’ package that is useful for classical test theory analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, T. J. B. (2005)Psychological Testing: A Practical Approach to Design and Evaluation. Sage Publications: Thousand Oaks.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern test Theory ===
{{Main article|Item Response Theory}}

The modern test theory is based on latent trait model. Every item estimates the ability of the test taker. The ability parameter is called as theta (θ). The difficulty parameter is called b. the two important assumptions are local independence and unidimensionality.   
The Item Response Theory has three models. They are one parameter logistic model, two parameter logistic model and three parameter logistic model. In addition, Polychromous IRT Model are also useful (Hambleton &amp; Swaminathan, 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Hambleton, R. K., &amp; Swaminathan H. (1985). Item Response theory: Principles and Applications. Boston: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The R Software has ‘ltm’, packages useful for IRT analysis.

==Factor Analysis ==
{{Main article|Factor Analysis}}

Factor analysis is at the core of psychological statistics. It has two schools: (1) Exploratory Factor analysis (2) Confirmatory Factor analysis

===Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)===
{{Main article|Exploratory Factor Analysis}}
The exploratory factor analysis begins without a theory or with a very tentative theory. It is a dimension reduction technique. It is useful in psychometrics, multivariate analysis of data and data analytics. 
Typically a k-dimensional correlation matrix or covariance matrix of variables is reduced to k X r factor pattern matrix where r &lt; k. Principal Component analysis and common factor analysis are two ways of extracting data. Principal axis factoring, ML factor analysis, alpha factor analysis and image factor analysis is most useful ways of EFA. 
It employees various factor rotation methods which can be classified into orthogonal (resulting in uncorrelated factors) and oblique (resulting correlated factors).

The ‘psych’ package in R is useful for EFA.

===Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)===
{{Main article|Confirmatory Factor Analysis}}

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is factor analytic technique that begins with theory and test the theory by carrying out factor analysis. 
The CFA is also called as latent structure analysis, which considers factor as latent variables causing actual observable variables. The basic equation of the CFA is

X = Λξ + δ

where, X is observed variables, Λ are structural coefficients, ξ are latent variables (factors) and δ are errors. 
The parameters are estimated using ML methods however; other methods of estimation are also available. The chi-square test is very sensitive and hence various fit measures are used (Bollen,1989,&lt;ref&gt;Bollen, KA. (1989). Structural Equations with Latent Variables. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Loehlin, 1992&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Loehlin, J. E. (1992). Latent Variable Models: An Introduction to Factor, Path, and Structural Analysis (2nd ed.). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;).
R package ‘sem’, ‘lavaan’ are useful for the same.

==Experimental Design==
{{Main article|Experimental Psychology}}

Experimental Methods are very popular in psychology. It has more than 100 years tradition. Experimental psychology has a status of sub-discipline in psychology .
The statistical methods are applied for designing and analyzing experimental data. They involve, t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA,  MANOVA, MANCOVA, binomial test, chi-square etc. are used for the analysis of the experimental data.

==Multivariate Behavioral Research==
Multivariate behavioral research is becoming very popular in psychology. These methods include Multiple Regression and Prediction; Moderated and Mediated Regression Analysis; Logistics Regression; Canonical Correlations; Cluster analysis; Multi-level modeling; Survival-Failure analysis; Structural Equations Modeling; hierarchical linear modelling etc. are very useful for psychological statistics (Hayes, 2013;&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, A. F. (2013). Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis. The Guilford Press: NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Agresti, 1990;&lt;ref&gt;Agresti, A. (1990). Categorical data analysis. Wiley: NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Loehlin, 1992;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Menard, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Menard, S. (2001). Applied logistic regression analysis. (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks. CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tabachnick, &amp; Fidell, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Tabachnick, B. G., &amp; Fidell, L. S. (2007). Using Multivariate Statistics, 5th ed. Boston: Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Journals for statistical application for psychology==
There are many specialized journals that publish advances in statistical analysis for psychology. Psychometrika is at the forefront. Educational and Psychological Measurement, Assessment, American Journal of Evaluation, Applied Psychological Measurement, Behavior Research Methods, British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, Multivariate Behavioral Research, Psychological Assessment, Structural Equation Modeling are other useful journals.

==Software Packages for Psychological Research==

Various software packages are available for statistical methods for psychological research. They can be classified as commercial software (e.g., [[JMP (statistical software)|JMP]] and SPSS) and Open-Source (e.g., R). Among the free-wares, the R software is most popular one. There are many online references for R and specialised books on R for Psychologist are also being written (e.g., Belhekar, 2016 &lt;ref&gt;Belhekar, V. M. (2016). Statistics for Psychology Using R, New Delhi: SAGE. {{ISBN|9789385985003}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The "psych" package of R is very useful for psychologists. Among others, "lavaan", "sem", "ltm", "ggplot2" are some of the popular packages. PSPP and KNIME are other free packages. Among the commercial packages include JMP, SPSS and SAS. JMP and SPSS are commonly reported in books.

In [[data structures]], the '''range searching''' problem most generally consists of [[Data pre-processing|preprocessing]] a set ''S'' of objects, in order to determine which objects from ''S'' intersect with a query object, called a ''range''. For example, if ''S'' is a set of points corresponding to the coordinates of several cities, a geometric variant of the problem is to find cities within a certain [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] range.

The range searching problem and the [[data structure|data structures]] that solve it are a fundamental topic of [[computational geometry]]. Applications of the problem arise in areas including [[Geographic information system|geographical information systems]] (GIS) and [[Computer-aided design|computer-aided design]] (CAD), and [[database|databases]].

== Variations ==

There are several variations of the problem, and different data structures may be necessary for different variations.&lt;ref name="Agarwal99"&gt;{{citation|first1=P. K.|last1=Agarwal|author1-link=Pankaj K. Agarwal|first2=J.|last2=Erickson|year=1999|contribution=Geometric Range Searching and Its Relatives|title=Advances in Discrete and Computational Geometry: proceedings of the 1996 AMS-IMS-SIAM joint summer research conference, Discrete and Computational Geometry--Ten Years Later, July 14-18, 1996, Mount Holyoke College|series=Contemporary Mathematics|volume=223|publisher=American Mathematical Society Press|pages=1–56|editor1-first=Bernard|editor1-last=Chazelle|editor1-link=Bernard Chazelle|editor2-first=Jacob|editor2-last=Goodman|editor2-link=Jacob E. Goodman|editor3-first=Richard|editor3-last=Pollack|contribution-url=http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/pubs/pdf/survey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain an efficient solution, several aspects of the problem need to be specified:

* Object types: Algorithms depend on whether ''S'' consists of [[Point (geometry)|point]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[line segment]]s, [[rectangle|box]]es, [[polygon]]s.... The simplest and most studied objects to search are points.
* Range types: The query ranges also need to be drawn from a predetermined set. Some well-studied sets of ranges, and the names of the respective problems are [[axis-aligned rectangle]]s (orthogonal range searching), [[simplex|simplices]], [[Half-space (geometry)|halfspace]]s, and [[sphere]]s/[[circle]]s.
* Query types: If the list of all objects that intersect the query range must be reported, the problem is called [[range reporting]], and the query is called a ''reporting query''. Sometimes, only the number of objects that intersect the range is required. In this case, the problem is called ''range counting'', and the query is called a ''counting query''. The ''emptiness query'' reports whether there is at least one object that intersects the range. In the ''semigroup version'', a [[commutative]] [[semigroup]] ('''S''',+) is specified, each point is assigned a weight from '''S''', and it is required to report the semigroup sum of the weights of the points that intersect the range.
* [[Dynamization|Dynamic]] range searching vs. static range searching: In the static setting the set ''S'' is known in advance. In dynamic setting objects may be inserted or deleted between queries.
* Offline range searching: Both the set of objects and the whole set of queries are known in advance.

== Data structures ==

=== Orthogonal range searching ===
[[File:Orthogonal range query.svg|thumb|A 2D orthogonal range query. In this case, a range reporting query would return the two circled points, a range counting query would return 2, and an emptiness query would return false.]]
In orthogonal range searching, the set ''S'' consists of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, and the query consists of intervals in each of those dimensions. Thus, the query consists of a multi-dimensional [[axis-aligned rectangle]]. With an output size of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, [[Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|Jon Bentley]] used a [[k-d tree]] to achieve (in [[Big O notation]]) &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; space and &lt;math&gt;O\big(n^{1 - \frac{1}{d}} + k\big)&lt;/math&gt; query time.&lt;ref name="Bentley75"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bentley|first1= Jon|author1-link = Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|date= 1975|title= Multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching |journal= [[Communications of the ACM]]|volume= 18|issue= 9|pages= 509–517 |doi=10.1145/361002.361007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley also proposed using [[Range tree#Range queries|range trees]], which improved query time to &lt;math&gt;O(\log^d n + k)&lt;/math&gt; but increased space to &lt;math&gt;O(n\log^{d - 1} n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bentley80"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bentley|first1= Jon|author1-link = Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|date= 1980|title= Multidimensional divide-and-conquer |journal= [[Communications of the ACM]]|volume= 23|issue= 4|pages= 214–229 |doi=10.1145/358841.358850}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Willard]] used downpointers, a special case of [[fractional cascading]] to reduce the query time further to &lt;math&gt;O(\log^{d - 1} n + k)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref
name="Willard85"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Willard|first1= Dan|author1-link = Dan Willard|date= 1985|title= New data structures for orthogonal range queries |journal= [[SIAM Journal on Computing]]|volume= 14|issue= 1|pages= 232–253 |doi=10.1137/0214019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above results were achieved in the [[pointer machine]] model, further improvements have been made in the [[word RAM]] [[model of computation]]. [[Bernard Chazelle]] used compress range trees to achieve &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; query time and &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; space for range counting.&lt;ref name="Chazelle88"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chazelle|first1= Bernard|author1-link = Bernard Chazelle|date= 1988|title= A functional approach to data structures and its use in multidimensional searching |journal= [[SIAM Journal on Computing]]|volume= 17|issue= 3|pages= 427–462 |doi=10.1137/0217026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph JaJa and others later improved this query time to &lt;math&gt;O\left(\dfrac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for range counting, which matches a lower bound and is thus [[asymptotically optimal]].&lt;ref name="JaJa05"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= JaJa|first1= Joseph|last2= Mortensen|first2= Christian|last3 = Shi|first3 = Qingmin|date= 2005|title= Space-efficient and fast algorithms for multidimensional dominance reporting and counting |journal= [[International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation]]|pages= 558–568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the best results for range reporting found by [[Timothy M. Chan]], Kasper Larsen, and [[Mihai Pătrașcu]], also using compressed range trees in the word RAM model of computation, are one of the following:&lt;ref name="Chan11"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chan|first1= Timothy|author1-link=Timothy M. Chan|last2= Larsen|first2= Kasper|last3 = Pătrașcu|first3 = Mihai|author3-link = Mihai Pătrașcu|date= 2011|title= Orthogonal range searching on the RAM, revisited |journal= [[Symposium on Computational Geometry]]|pages= 1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; space, &lt;math&gt;O(\log ^\epsilon n + k \log ^\epsilon n)&lt;/math&gt; query time
* &lt;math&gt;O(n \log \log n)&lt;/math&gt; space, &lt;math&gt;O(\log \log n + k \log \log n)&lt;/math&gt; query time
* &lt;math&gt;O(n \log ^\epsilon n)&lt;/math&gt; space, &lt;math&gt;O(\log \log n + k)&lt;/math&gt; query time

In the orthogonal case, if one of the bounds is [[infinity]], the query is called three-sided. If two of the bounds are infinity, the query is two-sided, and if none of the bounds are infinity, then the query is four-sided.

=== Dynamic range searching ===
While in static range searching the set ''S'' is known in advance, [[Dynamization|dynamic]] range searching, insertions and deletions of points are allowed. In the incremental version of the problem, only insertions are allowed, whereas the decremental version only allows deletions. For the orthogonal case, [[Kurt Mehlhorn]] and Stefan Näher created a data structure for dynamic range searching which uses [[fractional cascading#Dynamic fractional cascading|dynamic fractional cascading]] to achieve &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; space and &lt;math&gt;O(\log n \log \log n + k)&lt;/math&gt; query time.&lt;ref name="Mehlhorn90"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mehlhorn|first1= Kurt|author1-link=Kurt Mehlhorn|last2= Näher|first2= Stefan|date= 1990|title= Dynamic fractional cascading |journal= [[Algorithmica]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages= 215–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both incremental and decremental versions of the problem can be solved with &lt;math&gt;O(\log n + k)&lt;/math&gt; query time, but it is unknown whether general dynamic range searching can be done with that query time.

=== Colored range searching ===
The problem of colored range counting considers the case where points have [[categorical variable|categorical]] attributes. If the categories are considered as colors of points in geometric space, then a query is for how many colors appear in a particular range. Prosenjit Gupta and others described a data structure in 1995 which solved 2D orthogonal colored range counting in &lt;math&gt;O(n^2\log ^2 n)&lt;/math&gt; space and &lt;math&gt;O(\log ^2 n)&lt;/math&gt; query time.&lt;ref name="Gupta95"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gupta|first1= Prosenjit|last2= Janardan|first2= Ravi|last3=Smid|first3=Michiel|date= 1995|title= Further results on generalized intersection searching problems: Counting, reporting, and dynamization |journal= [[Journal of Algorithms]]|volume=19|issue=2|pages= 282–317 |doi=10.1006/jagm.1995.1038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
In addition to being considered in [[computational geometry]], range searching, and orthogonal range searching in particular, has applications for [[range query (database)|range queries]] in [[database|databases]]. Colored range searching is also used for and motivated by searching through categorical data. For example, determining the rows in a database of bank accounts which represent people whose age is between 25 and 40 and who have between $10000 and $20000 might be an orthogonal range reporting problem where age and money are two dimensions.

'''Rhizome''' is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–1980) project. It is what Deleuze calls an "image of thought," based on the [[rhizome|botanical rhizome]], that apprehends [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicities]].

==As a mode of knowledge and model for society==
Deleuze and Guattari use the terms "rhizome" and "rhizomatic" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', they oppose it to an [[arborescent]] (hierarchic, tree-like) conception of knowledge, which works with dualist categories and binary choices. A rhizome works with planar and trans-species connections, while an arborescent model works with vertical and linear connections. Their use of the "orchid and the wasp" is taken from the biological concept of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], in which two different species interact together to form a [[multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (i.e. a unity that is multiple in itself). [[Hybridisation (biology)|Hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]] would also be good illustrations.

"As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the original source of 'things' and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those 'things.' A rhizome, on the other hand, is characterized by 'ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.' Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a 'rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.' The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favoring a nomadic system of growth and propagation.

"In this model, culture spreads like the surface of a body of water, spreading towards available spaces or trickling downwards towards new spaces through fissures and gaps, eroding what is in its way. The surface can be interrupted and moved, but these disturbances leave no trace, as the water is charged with pressure and potential to always seek its equilibrium, and thereby establish smooth space."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizomes.net/issue5/poke/glossary.html Rhizomes.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

Deleuze and Guattari introduce ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' by outlining the concept of the rhizome (quoted from ''A Thousand Plateaus''):

*1 and 2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity: "...any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be";
*3. Principle of multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity", that it ceases to have any relation to the One;
*4. Principle of asignifying rupture: a rhizome may be broken, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines;
*5 and 6. Principle of cartography and [[decalcomania]]: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model; it is a "map and not a tracing".

'''Scanimate''' is the name for an analog [[computer animation]] ([[video synthesizer]]) system developed from the late 1960s to the 1980s by [[Computer Image Corporation]] of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].

The 8 Scanimate systems were used to produce much of the [[video]]-based animation seen on [[television]] between most of the 1970s and early 1980s in commercials, promotions, and show openings. One of the major advantages the Scanimate system had over [[film]]-based animation and computer animation was the ability to create animations in [[Real-time computer graphics|real time]]. The speed with which animation could be produced on the system because of this, as well as its range of possible effects, helped it to supersede film-based animation techniques for television graphics. By the mid-1980s, it was superseded by digital [[computer animation]], which produced sharper images and more sophisticated 3D imagery.

Animations created on Scanimate and similar analog computer animation systems have a number of characteristic features that distinguish them from film-based animation: The motion is extremely fluid, using all 60 fields per second (in [[NTSC]] format video) or 50 fields (in [[PAL]] format video) rather than the 24 frames per second that film uses; the colors are much brighter and more saturated; and the images have a very "electronic" look that results from the direct manipulation of video signals through which the Scanimate produces the images.

==How it works==
A special high-resolution (around 800 lines) monochrome camera records high-contrast artwork. The image is then displayed on a high-resolution screen. Unlike a normal monitor, its deflection signals are passed through a special analog computer that enables the operator to bend the image in a variety of ways. The image is then shot from the screen by either a film camera or a video camera. In the case of a video camera this signal is then fed into a colorizer, a device that takes certain shades of grey and turns it into color as well as transparency. The idea behind this is that the output of the Scanimate itself is always monochrome. Another advantage of the colorizer is that it gives the operator the ability to continuously add layers of graphics. This makes possible the creation of very complex graphics. This is done by using two video recorders. The background is played by one recorder and then recorded by another one. This process is repeated for every layer. This requires very high-quality video recorders (such as both the [[Ampex]] [[Quadruplex videotape|VR-2000]] or [[International Video Corporation|IVC]]'s [[IVC videotape format|IVC-9000]] of Scanimate's era, the IVC-9000 being used quite frequently for Scanimate composition due to its very high generational quality between re-recordings).

==Scanimate today==
Two of the Scanimates are still in use at [[ZFx studios]] in Asheville, NC.  The original "Black Swan" R&amp;D machine has been updated with more modern power supplies and can produce material in standard or 1080P high definition video.  The "white Pearl" machine is the last one produced and is being kept in its original configuration for historical purposes by David Sieg at ZFx inc.  The machines are installed in a working production environment with Grass Valley switchers, Kaleidascope effects systems and Accom digital disk recorders for layering.

The group '''Science, Reason and Faith''' ('''CRYF''', standing for '''Ciencia, Razón y Fe''' in Spanish) is formed by teachers at the [[University of Navarra]]. Its purpose is to promote the interdisciplinary study of issues related to science, philosophy and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Udías Vallina, Agustín (2010). Ciencia y religión: dos visiones del mundo. Sal Terrae. p. 16. (In Spanish.)&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of the group cover three closely related areas: research, teaching and public engagement.

==History of the group==
The beginning of the CRYF group dates back to the informal conversations that, at the end of the 20th century, professors [[Mariano Artigas]] († 2006) and [[Carlos Pérez (academic)|Carlos Pérez]] († 2005) maintained about interdisciplinary questions and public debates concerning the relationship between science and faith.

In 2002, circumstances were favorable for the creation of the group. Its founding members were professors Mariano Artigas, Juan Luis Lorda, Antonio Pardo, Carlos Perez, Francisco Gallardo and Santiago Collado. Since its inception, in addition to other teachers from the University of Navarra, the group has incorporated prestigious intellectuals and experts on the topics of interest as collaborating members: Evandro Agazzi, William Shea, Juan Arana and Tito Arecchi are some of the present collaborators.

Professor Artigas was appointed the first director of the group, a position he held until his death. The contribution of his intellectual output, which the group has inherited as his legacy, could be summarized as having contributed to unify and highlight the relationship between science and religion. In this endeavor, it is important not to reduce thought to mere scientific rationality, where science is understood as empirical or experimental science. The name of the group expresses this conviction: science, reason and faith. The CRYF is currently considered one of the centers that has contributed most to explore the common ground shared by science, philosophy and theology in southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oviedo|first1=Lluis|last2=Garre|first2=Álvaro|title=The Interaction between Religion and Science in Catholic Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Portugal)|journal=Zygon L|date=2015|volume=1|pages=172-193|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zygo.12159/full|archivedate=11 February 2017|deadurl=yes|df=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075232/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zygo.12159/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CRYF has received funding from the [[Templeton Foundation]] twice. In 2006, for the project entitled "The Human Singularity: The Origin, Nature, and Destiny of the Human Being" and in 2011, in order to set up the "Mariano Artigas Memorial Lectures".&lt;ref&gt;José M. Gimenez-Amaya - Santiago Collado (2011-2014). «Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture (MAML)». &lt;/ref&gt;  The Mariano Artigas Lectures are held every two years in October and have a two-fold purpose: to honor the figure of Professor Artigas and to recognize the work done by the invited lecturer in the field of the relations between science and religion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Science, Reason and Faith Group|first1=|last2=John Templeton Foundation|first2=|title=Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture|date=2011-2017|publisher=[[John Templeton Foundation]] |isbn=|url=http://www.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/mariano-artigas-memorial-lecture|language=English|ref=harv}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous speakers have been William Shea in 2011, Karl Giberson in 2013 and Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti in 2015. In 2017, the Lecture was entrusted to Spanish philosopher Juan Arana.

At the beginning of 2007, after the death of Mariano Artigas, the professor of Physics, [[Héctor Mancini]] replaced him as head of the group until the beginning of 2010. During the period 2010-2016 the director was the [[neuroscientist]], philosopher and priest [[José Manuel Giménez Amaya]]. Since the beginning of 2016, this position is held by the physicist, theologian and priest [[Javier Sánchez Cañizares]].

==Interests and objectives==
Broadly speaking, the CRYF group is interested in discussing the big issues from the perspective of the dialogue between science, reason and faith. Specifically, the main topics of interest are the following:
* [[Origin of man]], [[origin of life]] and [[origin of the universe]]
* Nature and causes of [[evolution]]
* [[Mind#Relation to the brain|Mind-brain relationship]]
* Relations between science and truth
* Relations between science and religion
* Order, [[complexity]] and [[purpose]]
* Classic [[science-faith debates]] ([[Galileo case]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Artigas|first1=Mariano|last2=Shea|first2=William R.|title=Galileo Observed. Science and the Politics of Belief|date=2006|publisher=Science History Publications|isbn=9780881353563|url=|language=English|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and current ones ([[creationism]] and [[evolutionism]])
More specific goals of the group are: to promote among its members research and publications on the topics of interest; to develop lessons and teaching materials for intra- and extra-mural education; to make available, through the Internet, an archive of documents on the areas of interest that could be useful as teaching material and for outreach activities; and to promote the organization of activities, collaborations and scientific meetings that can help achieve the goals of the group.

==Activities and some outcomes==
The CRYF group organizes monthly open seminars with invited speakers, followed by a discussion in which academics from various areas of expertise (such as theology, physics, medicine, philosophy and biology) exchange ideas and opinions. These seminars may also have the format of a round table or a workshop, and they are uploaded to the YouTube channel of the University of Navarra. One activity that deserves special mention was the workshop organized by the CRYF in collaboration with the "Thomas More Institute"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.netherhall.org.uk/node/53|title=Thomas More Institute|publisher=Netherhall Educational Association|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of London in 2009, to study the contributions of Mariano Artigas. The presentations of that meeting were later collected and published in the book "Science and Faith Within Reason". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Navarro|first1=Jaume|title=Science and Faith within Reason: Reality, Creation, Life and Design|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781138268630|url=https://www.routledge.com/Science-and-Faith-within-Reason-Reality-Creation-Life-and-Design/Navarro/p/book/9781409426080|language=English|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In collaboration with the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University]] of Torun (Poland), the CRYF group publishes the interdisciplinary scientific journal "Scientia et Fides" twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/SetF/index|title=Scientia et Fides|publisher=Wydział Teologiczny UMK|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This peer-reviewed open-access magazine publishes original articles addressing in a rigorous way the relationships between science and religion from different perspectives. The second issue of 2016 was a special number commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of Mariano Artigas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|title=10th anniversary of Mariano Artigas' death|journal=Scientia et Fides|date=2016|volume=IV (2)|pages=538|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/SetF/issue/view/981|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to teaching, the CRYF group teaches three courses on issues related to science and religion at the University of Navarra. It also collaborates regularly with the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences of the same University. The members of the CRYF are available to give seminars or conferences on the topics of interest to any institution requesting it. Several schools, cultural foundations and universities across Spain, Europe and Latin America have already benefited from this collaboration.

'''Scriptorium''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-scriptorium.ogg|s|k|r|ɪ|p|ˈ|t|ɔːr|i|ə|m}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|scriptorium|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "a place for writing", is commonly used to refer to a room in medieval European [[monasteries]] devoted to the writing, copying and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminating]] of manuscripts by monastic [[scribe]]s.

== The functional outset ==
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|This late 15th-century miniature of [[Jean Miélot]] (died 1472)&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 
depicts the author at work: perhaps his ''Miracles de Nostre Dame'', in which this miniature appears.]]

When monastic institutions arose in the early 6th century (the first European monastic writing dates from 517), they defined European literary culture and selectively preserved the literary history of the West. Monks copied Jerome's Latin Vulgate Bible and the commentaries and letters of early Church Fathers for missionary purposes as well as for use within the monastery.

In the copying process, there was typically a division of labor between the monks who readied the parchment for copying by smoothing and chalking the surface, those who ruled the parchment and copied the text, and those who illuminated the text. Sometimes a single monk would engage in all of these stages to prepare a manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Shailor, ''The Medieval Book'', (Toronto: U Toronto Press, 1991), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators of manuscripts]] worked in collaboration with scribes in intricate varieties of interaction that preclude any simple understanding of monastic manuscript production.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Aliza Muslin-Cohen, ''A Medieval Scriptorium: St. maria Magdalena de Frankenthal'' series Wolfenbüttler Mittelalter Studien (Wiesbaden) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the monasteries provided a valuable medium of exchange.
Comparisons of characteristic regional, periodic as well as contextual styles of [[handwriting]] do reveal social and cultural connections among them, as new hands developed and were disseminated by travelling individuals, respectively what these individuals represented, and by the examples of manuscripts that passed from one cloister to another. 
Recent studies follow the approach, that ''scriptoria'' developed in relative isolation, to the extent that the [[Paleography|paleographer]] is sometimes able to identify the product of each writing centre and to date it accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;
McKitterick, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 13th century secular workshops developed,&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 
where professional scribes stood at writing-desks to work the orders of customers, and during the [[Late Middle Ages]] the praxis of writing was becoming not only confined to being generally a monastic or regal activity. However, the practical consequences of private workshops, and as well the invention of the [[printing press]] vis-a-vis monastic ''scriptoria'' is a complex theme.&lt;ref&gt;
for example, cf. De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==The physical scriptorium==

Much as medieval libraries do not correspond to the exalted sketches from [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Name of the Rose,”&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/library-or-labyrinth/ "Library or labyrinth" Irene O’Daly. January 11, 2013 (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
it seems that ancient written accounts, as well as surviving buildings, and archaeological excavations do not invariably attest to the evidence of scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/pondering-the-physical-scriptorium/ "Pondering the physical scriptorium" Jenneka Janzen. January 25, 2013 by medievalfragments (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Scriptoria in the physical sense of a room set aside for the purpose perhaps mostly existed in response to specific scribal projects; for example, when a monastic (and) or regal institution wished a large number of texts copied.

References in modern scholarly writings to 'scriptoria' typically refer to the collective written output of a monastery, 
somewhat like the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] in the early regal times is taken to refer to a specific fashion of modelling formulars, 
but especially traditional is the view that scriptoria was a necessary adjunct to a library, as per the entry in du Cange, 1678 'scriptorium'.&lt;ref&gt;
Du Cange, et al., ''Glossarium mediae et infimae Latinitatis'', Niort: L. Favre, 1883–1887 (10 vol.).

&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Giovanni Evangelista, Rimini===
At this church whose patron was [[Galla Placidia]] (died 450), paired rectangular chambers flanking the apse, accessible only from each aisle, have been interpreted as paired (Latin and Greek) libraries and perhaps scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Charlotte Smith, "The Side Chambers of San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna: Church Libraries of the Fifth Century" ''Gesta,'' '''29'''.1 (1990): 86–97)&lt;/ref&gt; The well-lit niches .5 meter deep, provisions for [[hypocaust]]s beneath the floors to keep the spaces dry, have prototypes in the architecture of Roman libraries.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mackowiecka, ''The Origin and the Evolution of the Architectural Forms of the Roman Library'' (Warsaw) 1978, noted by Smith 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassiodorus and the Vivarium===
The monastery built in the second quarter of the 6th century under the supervision of [[Cassiodorus]] at the Vivarium near [[Squillace]] in southern Italy contained a scriptorium, for the purpose of collecting, copying, and preserving texts.

Cassiodorus' description of his monastery contained a purpose-built scriptorium, with self-feeding{{clarify|date=February 2016}} oil lamps, a [[sundial]], and a [[water-clock]]. The scriptorium would also have contained desks where the monks could sit and copy texts, as well as the necessary ink wells, penknives, and quills. Cassiodorus also established a library where, at the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|end of the Roman Empire]], he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and to preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of texts. In the end, however, the library at the Vivarium was dispersed and lost, though it was still active around 630.&lt;ref name=JNormanVivarium&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Jeremy|title=The Scriptorium and Library at the Vivarium (Circa 560)|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=204|website=HistoryofInformation.com|publisher=Jeremy Norman &amp; Co., Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
The scriptoria of the [[Cistercian]] order seem to have been similar to those of the Benedictines. The mother house at [[Cîteaux]], one of the best-documented high-medieval scriptoria, developed a severe "house style" in the first half of the 12th century. 
The 12th-century scriptorium of [[Cîteaux]] and its products, in the context of Cistercian scriptoria, have been studied by Yolanta Załuska, ''L'enluminure et le scriptorium de Cîteaux au XIIe siècle'' (Brecht:Cîteaux) 1989.

== Institutions ==
In [[Byzantium]] or [[Eastern Roman Empire]] learning maintained importance and numerous monastic 'scriptoria' were known for producing Bible/Gospel illuminations, along with workshops that copied numerous classical and Hellenistic works.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that one such monastic community was that of [[Mount Athos]], which maintained a variety of illuminated manuscripts and ultimately accumulated over 10,000 books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Benedictines===
Cassiodorus' contemporary, [[Benedict of Nursia]], allowed his monks to read the great works of the pagans in the monastery he founded at [[Monte Cassino]] in 529. The creation of a library here initiated the tradition of Benedictine scriptoria, where the copying of texts not only provided materials needed in the routines of the community and served as work for hands and minds otherwise idle, but also produced a marketable end-product. Saint [[Jerome]] stated that the products of the scriptorium could be a source of revenue for the monastic community, but Benedict cautioned, "If there be skilled workmen in the monastery, let them work at their art in all humility".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 57, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch57 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Benedictine monasteries, the writing room was actually a corridor open to the central quadrangle of the [[cloister]].&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/03script.html#location OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The space could accommodate about twelve monks, who were protected from the elements only by the wall behind them and the vaulting above. Monasteries built later in the Middle Ages placed the scriptorium inside, near the heat of the kitchen or next to the [[calefactory]]. The warmth of the later scriptoria served as an incentive for unwilling monks to work on the transcription of texts (since the charter house was rarely heated).

====St. Gall====
The Benedictine [[Plan of St. Gall]] is a sketch of an idealised monastery dating from 819–826, which shows the scriptorium and library attached to the northeast corner of the main body of the church; this is not reflected by the evidence of surviving monasteries. Although the purpose of the plan is unknown, it clearly shows the desirability of scriptoria within a wider body of monastic structures at the beginning of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Murray, ''After Rome's Fall,'' (Toronto: University Toronto Press, 1998), pp. 262, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
There is evidence that in the late 13th century, the Cistercians would allow certain monks to perform their writing in a small cell "which could not... contain more than one person".&lt;ref&gt;George Haven Putnam, ''Books and their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), 405.&lt;/ref&gt; These cells were called scriptoria because of the copying done there, even though their primary function was not as a writing room.

===Carthusians===
The [[Carthusian]]s viewed copying religious texts as their missionary work to the greater [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]; the strict solitude of the Carthusian order necessitated that the manual labor of the monks be practiced within their individual cells, thus many monks engaged in the transcription of texts. In fact, each cell was equipped as a copy room, with parchment, quill, inkwell, and ruler. Guigues du Pin, or Guigo, the architect of the order, cautioned, "Let the brethren take care the books they receive from the cupboard do not get soiled with smoke or dirt; books are as it were the everlasting food of our souls; we wish them to be most carefully kept and most zealously made."&lt;ref&gt;C.H.Lawrence, ''Medieval Monasticism'', Ed.2 (London &amp; New York: Longman, 1989) 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of [[Manasija]] Monastery by [[Stefan Lazarević]] in the early 15th century, many educated monks have gathered there. They fostered copying and literary work that by its excellence and production changed the history of the South Slavic literature and languages spreading its influence all over the Orthodox [[Balkans]]. One of the most famous scholars of the so-called School of Resava was Constantine the Philosopher /Konstantin Filozof/, an influential writer and biographer of the founder of the school (Stefan Lazarević).

====Rača====
During the Turkish invasions of the Serbian lands (which lasted from the end of the 14th to the beginning of the 19th centuries) the monastery was an important centre of culture. The scriptorium of each monastery was a bastion of learning where illuminated manuscripts were being produced by monk-scribes, mostly Serbian liturgical books and Old Serbian ''Vita.'' [[hagiographies]] of kings and archbishops.

Numerous scribes of the Serbian Orthodox Church books—at the term of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th centuries—who worked in the [[Rača monastery]] are named in Serbian literature – "The Račans". . Among the monk-scribes the most renown are the illuminator Hieromonk Hristifor Račanin, [[Kiprijan Račanin]], [[Jerotej Račanin]], [[Teodor Račanin]] and [[Gavril Stefanović Venclović]]. These are well-known Serbian monks and writers that are the link between literary men and women of the late medieval ([[Late Middle Ages]]) and [[Baroque]] periods in art, architecture and literature in particular.

===Cassiodorus' ''Institutes''===
Although it is not a monastic rule as such, [[Cassiodorus]] did write his ''[[Institutes]]'' as a teaching guide for the monks at Vivarium, the monastery he founded on his family's land in southern Italy. A classically educated Roman convert, Cassiodorus wrote extensively on scribal practices. He cautions over-zealous scribes to check their copies against ancient, trustworthy [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplars]] and to take care not to change the inspired words of scripture because of grammatical or stylistic concerns. He declared "every work of the Lord written by the scribe is a wound inflicted on Satan", for "by reading the Divine Scripture he wholesomely instructs his own mind and by copying the precepts of the Lord he spreads them far and wide".&lt;ref&gt;Cassiodorus, Institutes, I, xxx&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Cassiodorus did include the classical texts of ancient Rome and Greece in the monastic library. This was probably because of his upbringing, but was, nonetheless, unusual for a monastery of the time. When his monks copied these texts, Cassiodorus encouraged them to amend texts for both grammar and style.&lt;ref&gt;James O. O'Donnell, ''Cassiodorus,'' University of Californian Press, 1979. Postprint online (1995), [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html Upenn.edu], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Benedict===
The more famous monastic treatise of the 7th century, Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]'s [[Rule of St Benedict|Rule]], fails to mention the labor of transcription by name, though his institution, the monastery of [[Montecassino]], developed one of the most influential scriptoria, at its acme in the 11th century, which made the abbey "the greatest center of book production in South Italy in the High Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1999:3; the scriptorium is fully examined in Francis Newton, ''The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058–1105'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Here was developed and perfected the characteristic "Cassinese" [[Beneventan script]] under [[Desiderius of Montecassino|Abbot Desiderius]].

The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] does explicitly call for monks to have ready access to books during two hours of compulsory daily reading and during [[Lent]], when each monk is to read a book in its entirety.&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 48, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch48 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus each monastery was to have its own extensive collection of books, to be housed either in [[armarium]] (book chests) or a more traditional library. However, because the only way to obtain a large quantity of books in the [[Middle Ages]] was to copy them, in practice this meant that the monastery had to have a way to transcribe texts in other collections.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. Haven Putnam, ''Books and Their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative translation of Benedict's strict guidelines for the oratory as a place for silent, reverent prayer actually hints at the existence of a scriptorium. In Chapter 52 of his Rule, Benedict's warns: "Let the oratory be what it is called, and let nothing else be done or stored there".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 52, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch52 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; But ''condatur'' translates both as ''stored'' and ''to compose or write,'' thus leaving the question of Benedict's intentions for manuscript production ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/07script.html#rules OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commentaries on the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] describe the labor of transcription as the common occupation of the community, so it is also possible that Benedict failed to mention the scriptorium by name because of the integral role it played within the monastery.

====Saint Ferréol====
Monastic life in the [[Middle Ages]] was strictly centered around [[Liturgy of the Hours|prayer]] and manual labor. In the early Middle Ages, there were many attempts to set out an organization and routine for monastic life. [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert|Montalembert]] cites one such sixth-century document, the Rule of [[Ferréol of Uzès|Saint Ferréol]], as prescribing that "He who does not turn up the earth with the plough ought to write the parchment with his fingers."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861–1879) p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; As this implies, the labor required of a [[scribe]] was comparable to the exertion of agriculture and other outdoor work. Another of Montalembert's examples is of a scribal note along these lines: "He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labour, but although these fingers only hold the pen, the whole body grows weary."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861–1879) p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
An undated Cistercian ordinance, ranging in date from 1119–52 (Załuska 1989) prescribed ''literae unius coloris et non depictae'' ("letters of one color and not ornamented"), that spread with varying degrees of literalness in parallel with the Cistercian order itself, through the priories of Burgundy and beyond.

In 1134, the Cistercian order declared that the monks were to keep silent in the scriptorium as they should in the [[cloister]].

==Books and transcription in monastic life==

Manuscript-writing was a laborious process in an ill-lit environment that could damage one's health. One prior complained in the tenth century:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''Only try to do it yourself and you will learn how arduous is the writer's task. It dims your eyes, makes your back ache, and knits your chest and belly together. It is a terrible ordeal for the whole body''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Greer, Germaine. ''The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work''. Tauris Parke, 2001. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The director of a monastic scriptorium would be the ''armarius'' ("provisioner"), who provided the scribes with their materials and supervised the copying process. However, the armarius had other duties as well. At the beginning of Lent, the armarius was responsible for making sure that all of the monks received books to read,&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"/&gt; but he also had the ability to deny access to a particular book. By the 10th century the armarius had specific liturgical duties as well, including singing the eighth [[responsory]], holding the lantern aloft when the abbot read, and approving all material to be read aloud in church, chapter, and [[refectory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fassler, Margot E., "The Office of the Cantor in Early Western Monastic Rules and Customaries," in ''Early Music History'', 5 (1985), pp. 35, 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Vivarium c. 540–548, '''Cassiodorus''' wrote a commentary on the Psalms entitled ''Expositio Psalmorum'' as an introduction to the Psalms for individuals seeking to enter the monastic community. The work had a broad appeal outside of Cassiodorus' monastery as the subject of monastic study and reflection.

Abbot '''[[Johannes Trithemius]]''' of Sponheim wrote a letter, ''De Laude Scriptorum'' (In Praise of Scribes), to Gerlach, Abbot of Deutz in 1492 to describe for monks the merits of copying texts. Trithemius contends that the copying of texts is central to the model of monastic education, arguing that transcription enables the monk to more deeply contemplate and come to a more full understanding of the text. He then continues to praise scribes by saying "The dedicated scribe, the object of our treatise, will never fail to praise God, give pleasure to angels, strengthen the just, convert sinners, commend the humble, confirm the good, confound the proud and rebuke the stubborn".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons he gives for continuing to copy manuscripts by hand, are the historical precedent of the ancient scribes and the supremacy of transcription to all other manual labor. This description of monastic writing is especially important because it was written after the first printing presses came into popular use. Trithemius addresses the competing technology when he writes, "The printed book is made of paper and, like paper, will quickly disappear. But the scribe working with parchment ensures lasting remembrance for himself and for his text".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"/&gt; Trithemius also believes that there are works that are not being printed but are worth being copied.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manuscript-Alexander-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|[[John White Alexander]], Manuscript Book mural (1896), Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]

In his comparison of modern and medieval scholarship, '''James J. O'Donnell''' describes monastic study in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''[E]ach Psalm would have to be recited at least once a week all through the period of study. In turn, each Psalm studied separately would have to be read slowly and prayerfully, then gone through with the text in one hand (or preferably committed to memory) and the commentary in the other; the process of study would have to continue until virtually everything in the commentary has been absorbed by the student and mnemonically keyed to the individual verses of scripture, so that when the verses are recited again the whole phalanx of Cassiodorian erudition springs up in support of the content of the sacred text''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James O. |last=O'Donnell |title=Cassiodorus |publisher=University of California Press |year=1979 |url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap5.html |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this way, the monks of the Middle Ages came to intimately know and experience the texts that they copied. The act of transcription became an act of meditation and prayer, not a simple replication of letters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7275">'''Sperm-mediated gene transfer''' (SMGT) is a transgenic technique that transfers [[genes]] based on the ability of [[sperm cells]] to spontaneously bind to and internalize exogenous [[DNA]] and transport it into an oocyte during fertilization to produce genetically modified animals.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Exogenous DNA refers to DNA that originates outside of the organism. Transgenic animals have been obtained using SMGT, but the efficiency of this technique is low. Low efficiency is mainly due to low uptake of exogenous DNA by the spermatozoa, reducing the chances of fertilizing the oocytes with transfected spermatozoa.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In order to successfully produce transgenic animals by SMGT, the spermatozoa must attach the exogenous DNA into the head and these transfected spermatozoa must maintain their functionality to fertilize the oocyte.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Genetically modified animals produced by SMGT are useful for research in biomedical, agricultural, and veterinary fields of study. SMGT could also be useful in generating animals as models for human diseases or lead to future discoveries relating to human gene therapy.

==Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer Mechanism==

The method for SMGT uses the sperm cell, a natural vector of genetic material, to transport exogenous DNA. The exogenous DNA molecules bind to the cell membrane of the head of the sperm cell. This binding and internalization of the DNA is not a random event. The exogenous DNA interacts with the DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) that are present on the surface of the sperm cell.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Spermatozoa]] are naturally protected against the intrusion of exogenous DNA molecules by an inhibitory factor present in mammals’ seminal fluid. This factor blocks the binding of sperm cells and exogenous DNA because in the presence of the inhibitory factor, DBPs lose their ability to bind to exogenous DNA. In the absence of this inhibitory factor, DBPs on sperm cells are able to interact with DNA and can then translocate the DNA into the cell. Therefore, the seminal fluid must be removed from the sperm samples by extensive washing immediately after [[ejaculation]].&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; After the DNA is internalized, the exogenous DNA must be integrated into the genome. There are various mechanisms suggested for DNA integration, including integrating DNA at oocyte activation, at nucleus decondensation, or at the formation of the pronulcei, but all of these suggested mechanisms imply that the integration of DNA happens after the penetration of the sperm cell into the oocyte.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

==Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer Controversy==

Sperm-mediated gene transfer is considered controversial because despite the successes, it has not yet become established as a reliable form of genetic manipulation. Skepticism arises based on the assumption that evolutionary chaos could arise if sperm cells could act as vectors for exogenous DNA.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Reasonable assumption tells us that because reproductive tracts contain free DNA molecules, sperm cells should be highly resistant to the risk of picking up exogenous DNA molecules. SMGT has been demonstrated experimentally and followed the assumption that nature has barriers against SMGT. These barriers are not always absolute and could explain the inconsistent experimental outcomes of SMGT.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; If there are natural barriers against SMGT, then the successes may only represent unusual cases in which the barriers failed. Two barriers have been identified; the inhibitory factor in seminal fluid that prevents binding to foreign DNA molecules and a sperm endogenous nuclease activity that is triggered upon interaction of sperm cells with foreign DNA molecules.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; These protections give reason to believe that unintentional interactions between sperm and exogenous genetic sequences is kept to a minimal. These barriers allow for protection against the threat that every fertilization event could become a potentially mutagenic one.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

==Applications of Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer==

=== Animal Transgenesis ===

Transgenic animals have been produced successfully using gene transfer techniques such as sperm-mediated gene transfer. Though this production has been successful, the efficiency of the process is low. Low efficiency of SMGT in the production of transgenic animals is mainly due to poor uptake of the exogenous DNA by the sperm cells, thus reducing the number of fertilized oocytes with transfected spermatozoa.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; From 1989 to 2004, there were over 30 claims for the production of viable transgenic animals using SMGT, but only about 25 percent of these demonstrated a transmission of the transgenes beyond the F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; This transmission is required in order to claim usable animal transgenesis. According to previous studies, numerous animal species, including mammals, birds, insects, and fish, have been found susceptible to SMGT techniques, thus indicating that SMGT has broad applicability across a wide variety of Metazoan species.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Currently, despite the low frequency of transmission of transgenes, the frequency of phenotype modifications and overall animal transgenesis has been as high as 80 percent in some experiments.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Gene Therapy ===

The potential use of sperm-mediated gene transfer for embryo somatic gene therapy is a possibility for future research. Embryo somatic gene therapy would be advantageous because there seems to be an inverse correlation between the age of the patient and the effectiveness of gene therapy. Therefore, the possibility of gene therapy treatment before irreversible damage occurs would be ideal.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A majority of the experiments that report successful SMGT provide evidence of post-fertilization transfer and maintenance of transgenes.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; SMGT has potential advantages of being a simple and cost-effective method of gene therapy, especially in contrast with pronuclear microinjection, another transgenic technique. Nevertheless, despite some successes and its potential utility, SMGT is not yet established as a reliable form of genetic modification.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Stereopsis recovery''', also '''recovery from stereoblindness''', is the phenomenon of a [[stereoblind]] person gaining partial or full ability of stereo vision ([[stereopsis]]).

Recovering stereo vision as far as possible has long been established as an approach to the therapeutic treatment of stereoblind patients. Treatment aims to recover stereo vision in very young children, as well as in patients who had acquired but lost their ability for stereopsis due to a medical condition. In contrast, this aim has normally not been present in the treatment of those who missed out on learning stereopsis during their first few years of life. In fact, the acquisition of binocular and stereo vision was long thought to be impossible unless the person acquired this skill during a [[critical period]] in infancy and early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{cite journal|author=Uri Polat|title=Restoration of underdeveloped cortical functions: Evidence from treatment of adult amblyopia|journal=Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience|volume=26|number=4-5|year=2008|pages=413–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis normally went unquestioned and has formed the basis for the therapeutic approaches to binocular disorders for decades. It has been put in doubt in recent years. In particular since studies on stereopsis recovery began to appear in scientific journals and it became publicly known that neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]] achieved stereopsis well into adulthood, that assumption is in retrospect considered to have held the status of a scientific [[dogma]].&lt;ref name="barry-2009"&gt;Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions''. New York: Basic Books. {{ISBN|978-0-465-02073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[…] The book's main contribution, however, is exposing the wrong-headed dogma that acuity and binocular vision can be restored only during a critical developmental period." —''New England Journal of Medicine''. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[…] Part memoir and part science, ''Fixing My Gaze'' is a fitting tribute to the determination of a patient and her optometrist in challenging conventional wisdom and dogma." —''Journal of Behavioral Optometry''. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astle-etal-2011a"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrew T. Astle|author2=Paul V. McGraw|author3=Ben S. Webb|title=Myth exploded: Recovery of stereo acuity in adults with amblyopia|journal=BMJ Case Reports|year=2011|doi=10.1136/bcr.07.2010.3143|pmid=22707543|pmc=3062842|volume=2011|issue=feb21 2|pages=bcr0720103143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very recently, there has been a rise in scientific investigations into stereopsis recovery in adults and youths who have had no stereo vision before. While it has now been shown that an adult ''may'' gain stereopsis, it is currently not yet possible to predict how likely a stereoblind person is to do so, nor is there general agreement on the best therapeutic procedure. Also the possible implications for the treatment of children with [[infantile esotropia]] are still under study.

== Clinical management of strabismus and stereoblindness ==
In cases of acquired strabismus with [[double vision]] (diplopia), it is long-established state of the art to aim at curing the double vision and at the same time recovering a patient's earlier ability for stereo vision. For example, a patient may have had full stereo vision but later had diplopia due to a medical condition, losing stereo vision. In this case, medical interventions, including [[vision therapy]] and [[strabismus surgery]], may remove the double vision and recover the stereo vision which had temporarily been absent in the patient.

Also when children with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. [[infantile esotropia]]) receive strabismus surgery within the first few years or two of their life, this goes along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for [[binocular vision]] including stereopsis.

In contrast, in a case where a child's eyes are straightened surgically after the age of about five or six years and the child had no opportunity to develop stereo vision in early childhood, normally the clinical expectation is that this intervention will lead to cosmetic improvements but not to stereo vision. Conventionally, no follow-up for stereopsis was performed in such cases.

For instance, one author summarized the accepted scientific view of the time with the words: "Stereopsis will never be obtained unless [[amblyopia]] is treated, the eyes are aligned, and binocular fusion and function are achieved before the critical period for stereopsis ends. Clinical data suggest that this occurs before 24 months of age,[…] but we do not know exactly when it occurs, because crucial pieces of basic science information are missing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nigel W. Daw|title=Critical Periods and Amblyopia|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology: Mechanisms of Ophthalmic Disease|date=April 1998|volume=116|number=4|pages=502–505|doi=10.1001/archopht.116.4.502}}&lt;/ref&gt; For purposes of illustration, reference is made to a book of doctors' handouts for patients, written for the general public and published in 2002, which summarizes the limitations in the terms in which they, at the time, were fully accepted as [[Medical consensus|medical state of the art]] as follows: "If an adult has a childhood strabismus that was never treated, it is too late to improve any amblyopia or [[depth perception]], so the goal may be simply cosmetic – to make the eyes appear to be properly aligned – though sometimes treatment does enlarge the extent of side vision."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin L.

Recently, however, stereopsis recovery is known to have occurred in a number of adults. While this has in some cases occurred after visual exercises or spontaneous visual experiences, recently also the medical community's view of strabismus surgery has become more optimistic with regard to outcomes in terms of binocular function and possibly stereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.

:"The majority of adults will experience some improvement in binocular function after strabismus surgery even if the strabismus has been longstanding. Most commonly this takes the form of an expansion of binocular visual fields; however, some patients may also regain stereopsis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The efficacy of strabismus surgery in adults: a review for primary care physicians|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=April 2011|volume=87|number=1026|pages=269–273|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2010.108670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific investigations on residual [[neuroplasticity|neural plasticity]] in adulthood now also include studies on the recovery of stereopsis. Now it is a matter of active scientific investigation under which conditions and to which degree binocular fusion and stereo vision can be acquired in adulthood, especially if the person is not known to have had any preceding experience of stereo vision, and how outcomes may depend on the patient's history of therapeutic interventions.

== Examples and case studies ==
[[File:9.13.09OliverSacksByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Sacks]] was the first to make the story of Susan Barry, whom he nicknamed "Stereo Sue", known to the general public.]]
Stereopsis recovery has been reported to have occurred in a few adults as a result of either medical treatments including [[strabismus surgery]] and [[vision therapy]], or spontaneously after a stereoscopic [[3D cinema]] experience.

=== Personal reports in ''Fixing my Gaze'' ===
The most renowned case of regained stereopsis is that of neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]], who had had alternating [[infantile esotropia]] with [[diplopia]], but no amblyopia, underwent three [[Strabismus surgery|surgical corrections]] in childhood without achieving binocular vision at the time, and recovered from stereoblindness in adult age after [[vision therapy]] with optometrist Theresa Ruggiero. Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]].&lt;ref name="sacks-2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=Oliver Sacks|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/19/060619fa_fact_sacks |title=Stereo Sue: Why two eyes are better than one|journal=The New Yorker|date=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[David H. Hubel]], winner of the 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Torsten Wiesel]] for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case.&lt;ref name="barry-2009-p138-140"&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', 2009, pages 138-140&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Barry published a book ''Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions'', reporting on her own and several other cases of stereopsis recovery.&lt;ref name="barry-2009"/&gt;

In her book ''Fixing my Gaze'', Susan Barry gives a detailed description of her surprise, elation and subsequent experiences when her stereo vision suddenly set in.

Hubel wrote of her book:
{{Quote box|“It has been widely thought that an adult, cross-eyed since infancy, could never acquire stereovision, but to everyone's surprise, Barry succeeded. In ''Fixing my Gaze'', she describes how wonderful it was to have, step-by-step, this new 3D world revealed to her. And as a neurobiologist she is able to discuss the science as an expert, in simple language.”|source=David H. Hubel, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine, John Franklin Enders Professor of Neurobiology, Emeritus, Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name="barry-2009"/&gt;}}

Her book includes reports of further persons who have had similar experiences with stereopsis recovery. Barry cites the personal experiences of several persons,&lt;!--Comment: the names ofpatients and their optometrists are purposely not listed here in Wikipedia out of respect of their privacy as ordinary people who may not wish to have their names retrieved by search engines, and the names make no difference to the message here--&gt; including a man who was an artist and described his experience of seeing with stereopsis as "that he could see one hundred more times [[negative space]]",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 123&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who had been amblyopic before seeing in 3D described how empty space now "looks and feels palpable, tangible—alive!",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who had been strabismic since age two and saw in 3D after taking vision therapy and stated that "The coolest thing is the feeling you get being “in the dimension”",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', page 124&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who felt quite alarmed at the experience of suddenly seeing roadside trees and signs [[looming]] towards her,&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; and two women who experienced an abrupt onset of stereo vision with a wide-angled view of the world, the first stating: "I was able to take in so much more of the room than I did before" and the second: "It was very dramatic as my [[peripheral vision]] suddenly filled in on both sides".&lt;ref name="barry-p129-131"&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 129-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Common to Barry and at least one person on whom she had reported is the finding that also their [[Visual space|mental representation of space]] changed after having acquired stereo vision: that even with one eye closed the feeling is to see "more" than seeing with one eye closed before recovering stereopsis.&lt;ref name="barry-p129-131"/&gt;

[[File:RealD glasses.jpg|thumb|Although stereoblind, Bridgeman used polarized glasses in a 3D cinema and could suddenly see in 3D.]]

=== Further cases in the media ===
Apart from Barry, another formerly stereoblind adult whose acquired ability for stereopsis has received media attention is neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, professor of psychology and psychobiology at [[University of California Santa Cruz]], who had grown up nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie [[Hugo (movie)|Hugo]] with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability to see the world in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen Peck: [http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120719-awoken-from-a-2d-world/all How a movie changed one man’s vision forever], BBC Future, 19 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry B.

== Recent scientific investigations ==
There is a growing recent body of scientific literature on investigations into the recovery of stereopsis in adults which started to appear shortly before Oliver Sacks' ''The New Yorker'' publication&lt;ref name="sacks-2006"/&gt; drew public attention to Barry's discovery. A number of scientific publications have systematically assessed patients' post-surgical stereopsis,&lt;ref name="kim-etal-2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kim|author2=S.T. Yi|author3=Y.A.

=== Post-surgical stereopsis ===
Certain conditions are known to be a prerequisite for stereo vision, for instance, that the amount of horizontal deviation, if any is present, needs to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David A. Leske|author2=Jonathan M. Holmes|title=Maximum angle of horizontal strabismus consistent with true stereopsis|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume=8|number=1|date=February 2004|pages=28–34|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2003.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several studies it has been recognized that surgery to correct strabismus can have the effect of improving binocular function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John D.

Among the investigations into post-surgical stereopsis is a publication of 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal strabismus for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or stereopsis, with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, stereopsis was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of stereopsis and stereoacuity being uncorrelated to the number of years the deviation had persisted.&lt;ref name="kim-etal-2005"/&gt; A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on stereopsis recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all those patients who had had congenital or early-onset strabismus with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone strabismus surgery in the years 1997–1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6–30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with [[Bagolini Striated Glasses Test|Bagolini striated glasses]], 39% with Titmus test, 33% with [[Worth 4 dot test|Worth 4-dot]] test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 [[Second of arc|sec of arc]] of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of stereopsis can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism.&lt;ref name="gharabaghi-azadeh-2006"/&gt; Another study  found that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and stereopsis by means of surgical alignment.&lt;ref name="fatima-etal-2009"/&gt;

In contrast, in a study in which a group of 17 adults and older children of at least 8 years of age, all of whom received strabismus surgery and post-operative evaluation after long-standing untreated [[infantile esotropia]], most showed binocular fusion when tested with Bagolini lenses and an increased [[visual field]], but none demonstrated stereo fusion or stereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthony David Neil Murray|author2=Jane Orpen|author3=Carolyn Calcutt|title=Changes in the functional binocular status of older children and adults with previously untreated infantile esotropia following late surgical realignment|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume=11|number=2|date=April 2007|pages=125–130|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2006.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stereoacuity]] is limited by the [[visual acuity]] of the eyes, and in particular by the visual acuity of the weaker eye. That is, the more a patient's vision of any one of the two eyes is degraded compared to the 20/20 vision standard, the lower are the prospects of improving or re-gaining stereo vision, unless visual acuity itself were improved by other means. Strabismus surgery itself does not improve visual acuity.

=== Stereopsis following training procedures ===
[[Eye exercises|Orthoptic exercises]] have proven to be effective for reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating [[exophoria]] by improving the near-point convergence of the eyes that is necessary for binocular fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Aziz|author2=M. Cleary|author3=H.K. Stewart|author4=C.R. Weir|title=Are orthoptic exercises an effective treatment for convergence and fusion deficiencies?|journal=Strabismus|date=December 2006|volume=14|number=|pages=183–189|pmid=17162439|doi=10.1080/09273970601026185|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments on monkeys, published 2007, revealed improvements in stereoacuity in monkeys who, after having been raised with binocular deptivation through prisms for the first two years, were exposed to extensive psychophysical training. Their stereo vision recovered in part, but remained far more limited than that of normally raised monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Nakatsuka|title=Effects of Perceptual Learning on Local Stereopsis and Neuronal Responses of V1 and V2 in Prism-Reared Monkeys|journal=AJP: Journal of Neurophysiology|date=April 2007|volume=97|number=4|pages=2612–2626|doi=10.1152/jn.01001.2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] have stated that [[perceptual learning]] appears to play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dennis M. Levi|title=Perceptual learning in adults with amblyopia: A reevaluation of critical periods in human vision|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=46|number=3|pages=222–232|date=April 2005|doi=10.1002/dev.20050}}&lt;/ref&gt; One investigation, published 2011, reported on a study on human stereopsis recovery using [[perceptual learning]] which was inspired by Barry's work. In this study, a small number of stereoblind subjects who had initially been stereoblind or stereoanomalous recovered stereopsis using perceptual learning exercises. Alongside the scientific assessment of the extent of recovery, also the subjective outcomes are described: "After achieving stereopsis, our observers reported that the depth “popped out,” which they found very helpful and joyful in their everyday life. The anisometropic observer GD noticed “a surge in depth” one day when shopping in a supermarket. While playing table tennis, she feels that she is able to track a ping-pong ball more accurately and therefore can play better. Strabismic observer AB is more confident now when walking down stairs because she can judge the depth of the steps better. Strabismics AB, DP, and LR, are able to enjoy 3D movies for the first time, and strabismic GJ finds it easier to catch a fly ball while playing baseball."&lt;ref name="ding-levi-2011a"/&gt; In a follow-up study, the authors of this study pointed out that the stereopsis that was recovered following perceptual learning was more limited in resolution and precision compared to normal subjects' stereopsis.&lt;ref name="ding-levi-2011b"/&gt; [[Dennis M.

[[File:Emacs Tetris vector based detail.svg|upright|thumb|[[Tetris]] is a popular video game from the 1980s. A modified version of the game (not shown here) has been used for dichoptic training.]]
There have been several attempts to make use of modern technology for enhanced binocular eye training, in particular for treating [[amblyopia]] and [[Suppression (eye)|interocular suppression]]. In some cases these modern techniques have improved patients' stereoacuity. Very early technology-enhanced vision therapy efforts have included the [[cheiroscope]], which is a [[haploscope]] in which left- and or right-eye images can be blended into view over a drawing pad, and the subject may be given a task such as to reproduce a line image presented to one eye. However, historically these approaches were not developed much further and they were not put to widespread use. Recent systems are based on [[dichoptic presentation]] of the elements of a [[video game]] or [[virtual reality]] such that each eye receives different signals of the virtual world that the player's brain must combine in order to play successfully.

One of the earliest systems of this kind has been proposed by a research group in the [[University of Nottingham]] with the aim of treating amblyopia, using virtual reality masks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/WO2003092482A1?hl=en Patent WO2003092482 A1 Ocular display apparatus for assessment and measurement of and for treatment of ocular disorders, and methods therefor], priority date 4 May 2002, publication date 13 November 2003, Isabel Ash et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eastgate-etal-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eastgate RM, Griffiths GD, Waddingham PE, Moody AD, Butler TK, Cobb SV, Comaish IF, Haworth SM, Gregson RM, Ash IM, Brown SM |title=Modified virtual reality technology for treatment of amblyopia |journal=Eye (London, England) |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=370–4 | date=March  2006 |pmid=15832182 |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6701882 |url= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|author=Gareth Mitchell|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4849244.stm|journal=BBC News|title=Video games tackle 'lazy eye'|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or commercially available [[Active shutter 3D system|3D shutter glasses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

== Health care policy matters ==
[[File:Prismenglaeser2.jpg|thumb|Prism lenses (here unusually thick) are used for pre-operative prism adaptation.]]
Health insurances always review therapies in terms of [[Clinical governance#Clinical effectiveness|clinical effectiveness]] in view of existing scientific literature, benefit, risk and cost. Even if individual cases of recovery exist, a treatment is only considered effective under this point of view if there is sufficient likelihood that it will predictably improve outcomes.

In this context, medical coverage policy of the global health services organization [[Cigna]] "does not cover [[vision therapy]], [[Optometry|optometric]] [[Vision training|training]], [[eye exercises]] or [[orthoptics]] because they are considered experimental, investigational or unproven for any indication including the management of visual disorders and learning disabilities" based on a bibliographic review published by Cigna which concludes that "insufficient evidence exists in the published, [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] literature to conclude that vision therapy is effective for the treatment of any of the strabismic disorders except preoperative [[prism]] adaptation for acquired esotropia".&lt;ref&gt;[https://cignaforhcp.cigna.com/public/content/pdf/coveragePolicies/medical/mm_0221_coveragepositioncriteria_vision_therapy_orthoptics.pdf Cigna Medical Coverage Policy], Coverage policy number 0221, effective 15 November 2012, for review 15 November 2013 (downloaded 20 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the U.S. [[managed health care]] company [[Aetna]] offers vision therapy only in contracts with [[Health insurance in the United States#Supplemental coverage|supplemental coverage]] and limits its prescriptions to a number of conditions that are explicitly specified in a list of vision disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/400_499/0489.html Clinical policy bulletins: Vision therapy], Number 0489, 4 June 2013, for review 13 June 2013 (downloaded 21 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge''''' is a 1998 [[non-fiction]] book by anthropologist Dr. [[Jeremy Narby]].  

==Research==
Narby performed two years of [[field work]] in the Pichis Valley of the [[Peruvian Amazon]] researching the ecology of the [[Asháninka]], an [[indigenous peoples in Peru]].

==Hypothesis==
Investigating the connections between [[shamanism]] and [[molecular biology]], Narby hypothesizes that shamans may be able to access information at the molecular level through the ingestion of [[entheogens]], specifically [[ayahuasca]].&lt;ref name="iin" /&gt;  [[Biophysicist]] Jacques Dubochet criticized Narby for not testing his hypothesis.&lt;ref name="iin"&gt;{{cite book

'''World College West''' was an undergraduate [[liberal arts college]] in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[California]]. Founded by Dr. [[Richard M. Gray]], it offered a program that integrated a grounding in the [[liberal arts]] with work-study and a required two-quarter "World Study" in a developing country. It opened with its first seven students on September 17, 1973.

Fully accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], World College West had programs in International Service and Development (ISD), International Environmental Studies (IES), Art and Society (AS), and Meaning, Culture, and Change (MCC). In later years, Business and International Business was added to the program line-up. ISD focused on the economic, political, and social development of "Third World" nations; IES concentrated on the wise use and global conservation of natural resources; AS examined the relationship between culture and the performing and visual arts; and MCC focused on the variety of ways in which the world's diverse cultures, through their systems of religion, philosophy, and tradition, give meaning and purpose to human life, and to the world around us. 

The college's World Study Programs were established in [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Ghana]], and [[Russia]]. Students could spend two quarters (six months) studying in both an urban and rural setting in one of these countries. During the urban stay, students lived with a host family and attended regularly scheduled language, culture, and history classes. During the rural stay, students again lived with host families and conducted independent research studies while continuing to learn the country's language.

The college placed a special emphasis on work-study and internships, because the founders of the college believed that learning occurred best through "disciplined reflection on experience". Once an area of study was selected, students were required to complete 480 internship hours in their field of study as part of their graduation requirement.

During its first few years, the College leased space on the campus of the [[San Francisco Theological Seminary]] in [[San Anselmo, California|San Anselmo]], followed by several years in surplus army [[barracks]] at [[Fort Cronkhite]] on the Pacific Ocean. In the early 1980s the college built and moved to a permanent campus off [[U.S. Highway 101]] in the rolling hills of northern Marin County, between [[Novato, California|Novato]] and [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] (now the home of the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]]).

World College West closed due to inadequate funding in Fall of 1992, the result of difficulties in succession after its founding president retired. The spirit of WCW lives on in Dick Gray's successor institution [[Presidio Graduate School]][http://www.presidiomba.org/]. The hundreds of WCW alumni call themselves "Westies".
