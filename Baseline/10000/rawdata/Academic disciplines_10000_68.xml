The '''Animal Demography Unit (ADU)''' is a formally recognized research unit of the '''[[University of Cape Town]]''' (UCT) located within the Department of Biological Sciences of UCT. (The Department of Biological Sciences was formed from the merger of the Department of Botany and the Department of Zoology at the start of the 2013 academic year). The Animal Demography Unit, popularly known as the ADU, was responsible for the management of the First and Second Southern African Bird Atlas Projects '''[[Southern African Bird Atlas Project|SABAP1]]''' and '''[[SABAP2]]'''. The unit has submitted over eight million georeferenced biodiversity records to [[GBIF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Publisher - Animal Demography Unit, Department of Zoology, University of Cape Town|url=https://www.gbif.org/publisher/dd862d06-e6e9-4ab9-bc86-c875cc148c1f|website=www.gbif.org|publisher=Global Biodiversity Information Facility|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Animal Demography Unit (formerly the Avian Demography Unit), or ADU as it is mostly known in the vernacular, is a research unit of the University of Cape Town. Initially it was built on the nucleus of the South African Bird Ringing Unit ([[SAFRING]]) and the Southern African Bird Atlas Project ([[SABAP]]). The ADU was established in December 1991 within the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Cape Town. Over the years, the ADU has grown far beyond its starting point.

The concept on which the ADU is based can be traced back to 1983, when a workshop was held in Johannesburg on the establishment of a Bird Populations Data Bank for South Africa. This workshop was held in conjunction with a "Birds and Man" symposium which had been organised by the Southern African Ornithological Society (now BirdLife South Africa).

The ADU has continued to be closely associated with [[BirdLife South Africa]]. and has a formal partnership relationship with that organization, with the objective of fostering the development of further ornithological projects. This close association is appropriate because much of the research of the ADU continues to focus on large scale demographic studies in which participation by amateurs is a vital element.

Over the past years, the ADU has expanded the range of projects for which it is responsible. This website provides information on them, and the people who undertake them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =About the ADU| url =http://adu.org.za/about.php| website =| date= | accessdate =16 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art critics]] usually criticise art in the context of [[aesthetics]] or the theory of beauty.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marty.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/marty_kaplan/article/the_curious_case_of_criticism "The curious case of criticism."] ''Jewish Journal''.  23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of [[Art movement|artistic movements]] has resulted in a division of art criticism into different disciplines which may each use different criteria for their judgements.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; The most common division in the field of criticism is between historical criticism and evaluation, a form of art history, and contemporary criticism of work by living artists.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;

Despite perceptions that art criticism is a much lower risk activity than making art, opinions of current art are always liable to drastic corrections with the passage of time.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Critics of the past are often ridiculed for either favouring artists now derided (like the [[Academic art|academic painters]] of the late 19th century){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} or dismissing artists now venerated (like the early work of the [[Impressionists]]).&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rewald1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=James S.|title=Art History and the Problems of Criticism|journal=Daedalus|date=Winter 1960|volume=89|issue=1 – The Visual Arts Today|pages=253–263|jstor=20026565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art movements themselves were named disparagingly by critics, with the name later adopted as a sort of badge of honour by the artists of the style (e.g., [[Impressionism]], [[Cubism]]), with the original negative meaning forgotten.&lt;ref name="rewald1973"&gt;Rewald, John (1973).

New York: The Museum of Modern Art. p. 323 {{ISBN|0-87070-360-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists have often had an uneasy relationship with their critics. Artists usually need positive opinions from critics for their work to be viewed and purchased; unfortunately for the artists, only later generations may understand it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seenan|first=Gerard|title=Painting by ridiculed but popular artist sells for £744,800|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/20/arts.artsnews1|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art is an important part of being human and can be found through all aspects of our lives, regardless of the culture or times. There are many different variables that determine one's judgment of art such as aesthetics, cognition or perception. Art can be objective or subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form. It can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance. Art is a basic human instinct with a diverse range of form and expression. Art can stand-alone with an instantaneous judgment or can be viewed with a deeper more educated knowledge. Aesthetic, pragmatic, expressive, formalist, relativist, processional, imitation, ritual, cognition, mimetic and postmodern theories are some of many theories to criticize and appreciate art. Art criticism and appreciation can be subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form, or it can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Definition==
Art criticism has many and often numerous subjective viewpoints which are nearly as varied as there are people practising it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; It is difficult to come by a more stable definition than the activity being related to the discussion and interpretation of art and its value.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Depending on who is writing on the subject, "art criticism" itself may be obviated as a direct goal or it may include [[art history]] within its framework.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Regardless of definitional problems, art criticism can refer to the [[history of art|history of the craft]] in its essays and art history itself may use critical methods implicitly.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; According to art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], "The borders between art history and art criticism... are no more as firmly drawn as they once used to be. It perhaps began with art historians taking interest in modern art."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Art criticism includes a descriptive aspect,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; where the work of art is sufficiently translated into words so as to allow a case to be made.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of a work of art that follows the description (or is interspersed with it) depends as much on the artist's output as on the experience of the critic.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6" /&gt; There is in an activity with such a marked subjective component a variety of ways in which it can be pursued.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; As extremes in a possible spectrum,&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5" /&gt; while some favour simply remarking on the immediate impressions caused by an artistic object,&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; others prefer a more systematic approach calling on technical knowledge, favoured [[aesthetic theory]] and the known sociocultural context the artist is immersed in to discern their intent.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of art criticism}}
Critiques of art likely originated with the origins of art itself, as evidenced by texts found in the works of [[Plato]], [[Vitruvius]] or [[Augustine of Hippo]] among others, that contain early forms of art criticism.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Also, wealthy [[patron]]s have employed, at least since the start of [[Renaissance]], intermediary art-evaluators to assist them in the procurement of commissions and/or finished pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton E.|title=What Did the Renaissance Patron Buy?|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Summer 1998|volume=51|issue=2|pages=392–450|url=http://classroom.kleinisd.net/users/1243/docs/what_did_the_renaissance_patron_buy.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Renaissance Society of America|doi=10.2307/2901572|jstor=2901572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Alexander|title=Negotiating the Gift: Pre-Modern Figurations of Exchange|year=2003|pages=319–360|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/nagel_PDFs/Art_as_Gift_lq.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|chapter=Art as Gift: Liberal Art and Religious Reform in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Jonathan Richardson by Jonathan Richardson.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] coined the term 'art criticism' in 1719.]]
Art criticism as a genre of writing, obtained its modern form in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; The earliest use of the term art criticism was by the English painter [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] in his 1719 publication ''An Essay on the Whole Art of Criticism''. In this work, he attempted to create an objective system for the ranking of works of art. Seven categories, including drawing, composition, invention and colouring, were given a score from 0 to 18, which were combined to give a final score. The term he introduced quickly caught on, especially as the English middle class began to be more discerning in their art acquisitions, as symbols of their flaunted social status.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and England in the mid 1700s, public interest in art began to become widespread, and art was regularly exhibited at the Salons in Paris and the [[Summer Exhibition]]s of London. The first writers to acquire an individual reputation as art critics in 18th-century France were [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] with his ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'' (1718)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubos|first=Jean-Baptiste|title=Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture|year=1732|publisher=E. Neaulme|location=Utrecht|url=https://archive.org/details/reflexionscriti03jeagoog|edition=3rd|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; which garnered the acclaim of [[Voltaire]] for the sagacity of his approach to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire |title=Le Siècle de Louis XIV|year=1874|publisher=Charpentier et C&lt;sup&gt;ie&lt;/sup&gt;, Libraires-Éditeurs|location=Paris|page=581|url=https://archive.org/details/sicledelouisxiv00voltgoog|editor=Charles Louandre|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Étienne La Font de Saint-Yenne]] with ''Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France'' who wrote about the Salon of 1746,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Font de Saint-Yenne|first=Étienne|title=Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France : avec un examen des principaux ouvrages exposés au Louvre le mois d'août 1746|year=1747|publisher=Jean Neaulme|location=The Hague|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting on the socioeconomic framework of the production of the then popular [[Baroque]] art style,&lt;ref name="saisselin1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saisselin|first=Rémy G.|title=The Enlightenment Against the Baroque: Economics and Aesthetics in the Eighteenth Century|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–50|url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0779n6fb/|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a perception of anti-monarchist sentiments in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Walter |first=Nancy Paige Ryan |title=From Armida to Cornelia: Women and Representation in Prerevolutionary France |type=MA |page=11 |url=http://repositories.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/15694 |year=1995 |publisher=Texas Tech University |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century French writer [[Denis Diderot]] greatly advanced the medium of art criticism. Diderot's "The Salon of 1765"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diderot|first=Denis|title=Essais sur la peinture|year=1795|publisher=François Buisson|location=Paris|pages=118–407|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_000033125010886956|editor=François Buisson|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first real attempts to capture art in words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morley|first=John|authorlink=John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|editor=Hugh Chisholm, Franklin Henry Hooper|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=DIDEROT, DENIS|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_08.djvu/222|accessdate=10 December 2012|edition=11th|year=1911|volume=8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Thomas E. Crow]], "When Diderot took up art criticism it was on the heels of the first generation of professional writers who made it their business to offer descriptions and judgments of contemporary painting and sculpture. The demand for such commentary was a product of the similarly novel institution of regular, free, public exhibitions of the latest art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Thomas E.|title=Diderot on Art, Volume I: The Salon of 1765 and Notes on Painting|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=x|editor=Denis Diderot|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in England an exhibition of the [[Society of Arts]] in 1762 and later, in 1766, prompted a flurry of critical, though anonymous, pamphlets. Newspapers and periodicals of the period, such as the ''[[London Chronicle]]'', began to carry columns for art criticism; a form that took off with the foundation of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.
In the 1770s, the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' became the first newspaper to systematically review the art featured at exhibitions.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:John Ruskin - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]], the preeminent art critic of 19th century England.]]
From the 19th century onwards, art criticism became a more common vocation and even a profession,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; developing at times formalised methods based on particular [[aesthetic theory|aesthetic theories]].&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a rift emerged in the 1820s between the proponents of traditional [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] forms of art and the new [[romanticism|romantic]] fashion. The Neoclassicists, under [[Étienne-Jean Delécluze]] defended the classical ideal and preferred carefully finished form in paintings. Romantics, such as [[Stendhal]], criticized the old styles as overly formulaic and devoid of any feeling. Instead, they championed the new expressive, Idealistic, and emotional nuances of Romantic art. A similar, though more muted, debate also occurred in England.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the prominent critics in England at the time was [[William Hazlitt]], a painter and essayist. He wrote about his deep pleasure in art and his belief that the arts could be used to improve mankind's generosity of spirit and knowledge of the world around it. He was one of a rising tide of English critics that began to grow uneasy with the increasingly abstract direction [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s landscape art was moving in.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the great critics of the 19th century was [[John Ruskin]]. In 1843 he published ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in which he robustly defended the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] from his critics, who charged Turner with being unfaithful to nature. Through painstaking analysis and attention to detail, Ruskin was able to demonstrate the very opposite, in what the art historian [[E. H. Gombrich]] called "the most ambitious work of scientific art criticism ever attempted." Ruskin became renowned for his rich and flowing prose, and later in life he branched out to become an active and wide-ranging critic, publishing works on architecture and [[Renaissance art]], including the ''[[Stones of Venice]]''.

[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''Salon of 1845'' art review shocked its audience with its ideas.]]
Another dominating figure in 19th-century art criticism, was the French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], whose first published work was his art review ''Salon of 1845'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Curiosités esthétiques: Salon 1845–1859|year=1868|publisher=M.

He tried to move the debate from the old binary positions of previous decades, declaring that "the true painter, will be he who can wring from contemporary life its epic aspect and make us see and understand, with colour or in drawing, how great and poetic we are in our cravats and our polished boots".&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===Turn of the twentieth century===
[[File:Roger Fry self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Self portrait of [[Roger Fry]], described by the [[art historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]] as "incomparably the greatest influence on taste since [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]... In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry".&lt;ref&gt;IAN CHILVERS. "Fry, Roger." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists. 2003.

Towards the end of the 19th century a movement towards abstraction, as opposed to specific content, began to gain ground in England, notably championed by the playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. By the early twentieth century these attitudes formally coalesced into a coherent philosophy, through the work of [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, as art critic &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_artcritic.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Group Profiles &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/group.htm#bellc|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an art historian in the 1890s, Fry became intrigued with the new modernist art and its shift away from traditional depiction. His 1910 exhibition of what he called [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] art attracted much criticism for its iconoclasm. He vigorously defended himself in a lecture, in which he argued that art had moved to attempt to discover the language of pure imagination, rather than the staid and, to his mind, dishonest scientific capturing of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, ideas &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_ideas.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, modern art &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_modernart.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's argument proved to be very influential at the time, especially among the progressive elite. [[Virginia Woolf]] remarked that: "in or about December 1910 [the date Fry gave his lecture] human character changed."&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

Independently, and at the same time, [[Clive Bell]] argued in his 1914 book ''Art'' that all art work has its particular 'significant form', while the conventional subject matter was essentially irrelevant. This work laid the foundations for the [[formalism (art)|formalist]] approach to art.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tekiner|first=Deniz|title=Formalist Art Criticism and the Politics of Meaning|journal=Social Justice|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2 (104) – Art, Power, and Social Change|pages=31–44|jstor=29768369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Fry argued that "it’s all the same to me if I represent a Christ or a [[saucepan]] since it's the form, and not the object itself, that interests me." As well as being a proponent of [[formalism (art)|formalism]], he argued that the value of art lies in its ability to produce a distinctive aesthetic experience in the viewer. an experience he called "aesthetic emotion". He defined it as that experience which is aroused by significant form. He also suggested that the reason we experience aesthetic emotion in response to the significant form of a work of art was that we perceive that form as an expression of an experience the artist has. The artist's experience in turn, he suggested, was the experience of seeing ordinary objects in the world as pure form: the experience one has when one sees something not as a means to something else, but as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4XeRgAACAAJ|title=Art|author=Clive Bell|year=2010|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=9781770451858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Read]] was a champion of modern British artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] and became associated with Nash's contemporary arts group Unit One. He focused on the [[modernism]] of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and published an influential 1929 essay on the meaning of art in ''The Listener''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Paul Nash (1889–1946)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/paul-nash|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Ben Nicholson (1894–1982)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/ben-nicholson|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Henry Moore (1898–1986)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/henry-moore|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/barbara-hepworth|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the trend-setting ''Burlington Magazine'' (1933–38) and helped organise the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
As in the case of Baudelaire in the 19th century, the poet-as-critic phenomenon appeared once again in the 20th, when French poet [[Apollinaire]] became the champion of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Katharine |title=The Cubist Painters by Guillaume Apollinaire; Peter Read|journal=French Forum|date=Spring 2005|volume=30|issue=2|pages=139–141|jstor=40552391|doi=10.1353/frf.2005.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Timothy|title=Apollinaire and Cubism?|journal=Style|date=Summer 1988|volume=22|issue=2|pages=275–298|url=http://mlpa.nottingham.ac.uk/archive/00000033/01/Rec_Mathews.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, French writer and hero of the Resistance [[André Malraux]] wrote extensively on art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Derek|title=Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi}}&lt;/ref&gt; going well beyond the limits of his native Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudek|first=Antony|title=The Vocal Turn|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|year=2012|volume=10|issue=1|pages=64–65|doi=10.5334/jcms.1011210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction that the vanguard in Latin America lay in [[Mexican Muralism]] ([[José Clemente Orozco|Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]]){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} changed after his trip to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1958. After visiting the studios of several Argentine artists in the company of the young Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Buenos Aires [[Rafael Squirru]], Malraux declared the new vanguard to lie in [[Argentina]]'s new artistic movements.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Squirru, a poet-critic who became Cultural Director of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] in [[Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], during the 1960s, was the last to interview [[Edward Hopper]] before his death, contributing to a revival of interest in the American artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Gail|title=Edward Hopper : an intimate biography|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]]) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the [[New York Vanguard]].&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=The Art Story: Gallery – The Art of This Century Gallery|url=http://www.theartstory.org/gallery-art-of-this-century.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]] who functioned as critics as well.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-robert-motherwell-13286 |title=Oral history interview with Robert Motherwell, 1971 Nov. 24-1974 May 1 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Motherwell|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-motherwell-1673|publisher=Tate|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Chronology of the Artist's Life page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although New York and the world were unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury" /&gt; by the late 1940s most of the artists who have become household names today had their well established patron critics.&lt;ref name="oxfordart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Painters in Postwar New York City|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/public/page/benz/themes/PostwarNYC|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Barnett Newman, [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Abstract Expressionism|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-abstract-expressionism.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uima.uiowa.edu/mural/ Jackson Pollock, ''Mural'' (1943)] [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]], Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenberg55"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Clement|title=American-Type Painting|journal=[[Partisan Review]]|year=1955|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Abstract Expressionism: Painting Action and Colorfields|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/abstract-expressionism.html|work=Color Vision &amp; Art|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php|publisher=The Barnett Newman Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibitions – Adolph Gottlieb|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/home/content/exhibitions/special/gottlieb/gottlieb.html|publisher=The Jewish Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Hofmann: Biography|url=http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|publisher=The Estate of Hans Hofmann|accessdate=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129075738/http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de&amp;nbsp;Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Mark|author2=Annalyn Swan|title=When de Kooning Was King|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=8 November 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/10248/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Harold Rosenberg|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-rosenberg-harold.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas B. Hess]], the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Thomas B. Hess|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hess-thomas.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers" or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.:13&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, in 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] "became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Biennale of Venice. New York's two leading art magazines were not interested. ''Arts'' mentioned the historic event only in a news column and ''Art News'' (Managing editor: Thomas B. Hess) ignored it completely. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' printed feature articles".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/5750568&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]] wrote catalogue forewords and reviews and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Session at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pgs.: 240–241, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter to [[Sidney Janis]] on 9 April 1955: {{quotation|It is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, p.: 201, University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York [[Trotskyist]], [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordart"/&gt; As long time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; Artist [[Robert Motherwell]], well-heeled, joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Robert Motherwell, Master of Abstract, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/obituaries/robert-motherwell-master-of-abstract-dies.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement Greenberg proclaimed [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. Greenberg supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever "purer" and more concentrated in what was "essential" to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:154–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New,'' Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", Da Capo Press, 1959 pp.:23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Abstract Expressionism at the time was ''New York Times'' art critic [[John Canaday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=John Canaday|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-canaday-john.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] were also important postwar art historians who voiced support for Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|title=A Critic Turns 90; Meyer Schapiro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/magazine/a-critic-turns-90-meyer-schapiro.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Kristi|title=Remembering Leo Steinberg (1920–2011)|url=http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2011/03/15/remembering-leo-steinberg-1920-2011.html|work=The Chicago Blog|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early to mid sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Michael Fried|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-fried-michael.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Robert Hughes|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hughes-robert.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art criticism===
[[Feminist art criticism]] emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=N.paradoxa|date=September 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of art criticism.

==Today==

Art critics today work not only in print media and in specialist art magazines as well as newspapers. Art critics appear also on the internet, TV, and radio, as well as in museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="ntifotva"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Criticism|url=http://art.unt.edu/ntieva/pages/teaching/tea_comp_artcriticism.html|work=Comprehensive Art Education|publisher=North Texas Institute For Educators on the Visual Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gratza|first=Agnieszka|title=Frieze or faculty?

Art critics curate exhibitions and are frequently employed to write exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Art critics have their own organisation, a [[UNESCO]] non-governmental organisation, called the [[International Association of Art Critics]] which has around 76 national sections and a political non-aligned section for refugees and exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association of Art Critics|url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100031328|work=UNESCO NGO – db|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art blogs===
{{Main|Art blog}}

Since the early 21st century, online art critical websites and art blogs have cropped up around the world to add their voices to the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Tyler|title=Tyler Green|url=http://www.nyfa.org/level3.asp?id=283&amp;fid=6&amp;sid=17|work=In Their Own Words|publisher=New York Foundation for the Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Michael|title=The Death of Criticism or Everyone Is a Critic|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-kaiser/the-death-of-criticism-or_b_1092125.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these writers use [[social media]] resources like Facebook, Twitter, [[Tumblr]] and [[Google+]] to introduce readers to their opinions about art criticism.

The word "astrochemistry" may be applied to both the [[Solar System]] and the [[interstellar medium]]. The study of the abundance of elements and [[isotope]] ratios in Solar System objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, is also called [[cosmochemistry]], while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [[molecular cloud|molecular gas clouds]] is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

== History ==
As an offshoot of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry, the history of astrochemistry is founded upon the shared history of the two fields. The development of advanced observational and experimental [[spectroscopy]] has allowed for the detection of an [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|ever-increasing array of molecules]] within solar systems and the surrounding interstellar medium. In turn, the increasing number of chemicals discovered by advancements in spectroscopy and other technologies have increased the size and scale of the [[chemical space]] available for astrochemical study.

=== History of Spectroscopy ===
{{Main|History of spectroscopy|Astronomical spectroscopy}}

Observations of solar spectra as performed by [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1646), [[Jan Marek Marci]] (1648), [[Robert Boyle]] (1664), and [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]] (1665) all predated Newton's 1666 work which established the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] nature of light and resulted in the first [[optical spectrometer|spectroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Spectroscopy was first used to distinguish between different materials after the release of [[Charles Wheatstone]]'s 1835 report that the [[Atomic emission spectroscopy|sparks]] given off by different metals have distinct emission spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An equivalent statement was independently postulated by [[Anders Jonas Ångström]] in his 1853 work ''Optiska Undersökningar,'' where it was theorized that luminous gases emit rays of light at the same frequencies as light which they may absorb.

This spectroscopic data began to take upon theoretical importance with Johann Balmer's observation that the spectral lines exhibited by samples of hydrogen followed a simple empirical relationship which came to be known as the [[Balmer Series]]. This series, a special case of the more general [[Rydberg formula|Rydberg Formula]] developed by [[Johannes Rydberg]] in 1888, was created to describe the spectral lines observed for [[Hydrogen]]. Rydberg's work expanded upon this formula by allowing for the calculation of spectral lines for multiple different chemical elements.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, N Rydberg's discovery of the spectral laws. Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical importance granted to these spectroscopic results was greatly expanded upon the development of [[quantum mechanics]], as the theory allowed for these results to be compared to atomic and molecular emission spectra which had been calculated ''a priori''.

=== History of Astrochemistry ===

While [[radio astronomy]] was developed in the 1930s, it was not until 1937 that any substantial evidence arose for the conclusive identification of an interstellar ''molecule''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These findings were confirmed in 1940, when McKellar et al. identified and attributed spectroscopic lines in an as-of-then unidentified radio observation to CH and CN molecules in interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The discovery of interstellar formaldehyde - and later, other molecules with potential biological significance such as water or [[carbon monoxide]] - is seen by some as strong supporting evidence for [[Abiogenesis|abiogenetic]] theories of life: specifically, theories which hold that the basic molecular components of life came from extraterrestrial sources. This has prompted a still ongoing search for interstellar molecules which are either of direct biological importance - such as interstellar [[glycine]], discovered in 2009&lt;ref name="Glycine Discovery Announcement"&gt;{{cite web

{{main|Spectroscopy}}
One particularly important experimental tool in astrochemistry is [[spectroscopy]] through the use of [[telescope]]s to measure the absorption and emission of [[light]] from molecules and atoms in various environments. By comparing astronomical observations with laboratory measurements, astrochemists can infer the elemental abundances, chemical composition, and [[temperature]]s of [[star]]s and [[interstellar cloud]]s. This is possible because [[ion]]s, [[atom]]s, and molecules have characteristic spectra: that is, the absorption and emission of certain wavelengths (colors) of light, often not visible to the human eye. However, these measurements have limitations, with various types of radiation ([[radio waves|radio]], [[infrared radiation|infrared]], visible, [[ultraviolet radiation|ultraviolet]] etc.) able to detect only certain types of species, depending on the chemical properties of the molecules. [[Interstellar formaldehyde]] was the first [[organic molecule]] detected in the interstellar medium.

Perhaps the most powerful technique for detection of individual [[chemical species]] is [[radio astronomy]], which has resulted in the detection of over a hundred [[interstellar species]], including [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] and ions, and [[organic compounds|organic]] (i.e. [[carbon]]-based) compounds, such as [[alcohol]]s, [[acid]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[ketone]]s. One of the most abundant interstellar molecules, and among the easiest to detect with radio waves (due to its strong electric [[dipole]] moment), is CO ([[carbon monoxide]]). In fact, CO is such a common interstellar molecule that it is used to map out molecular regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/mmw/CO_survey_aitoff.jpg |title=CO_survey_aitoff.jpg  |publisher=Harvard University |date=18 Jan 2008 |accessdate=18 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio observation of perhaps greatest human interest is the claim of interstellar [[glycine]],&lt;ref name=Kuan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuan |first1=Y.

Moreover, such methods are completely blind to molecules that have no [[dipole]]. For example, by far the most common molecule in the universe is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrogen]] gas), but it does not have a dipole moment, so it is invisible to radio telescopes. Moreover, such methods cannot detect species that are not in the gas-phase. Since dense molecular clouds are very cold ({{convert|10|to|50|K|C F|disp=sqbr}}), most molecules in them (other than hydrogen) are frozen, i.e. solid. Instead, hydrogen and these other molecules are detected using other wavelengths of light. Hydrogen is easily detected in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible ranges from its absorption and emission of light (the [[hydrogen line]]). Moreover, most organic compounds absorb and emit light in the infrared (IR) so, for example, the  detection of [[methane]] in the atmosphere of Mars&lt;ref name= Mumma&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mumma |title=Strong Release of Methane on Mars in Northern Summer 2003 |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1165243 |pmid=19150811 |doi=10.1126/science.1165243 |date=2009 |volume=323 |pages=1041–5 |last2=Villanueva |first2=GL |last3=Novak |first3=RE |last4=Hewagama |first4=T |last5=Bonev |first5=BP |last6=Disanti |first6=MA |last7=Mandell |first7=AM |last8=Smith |first8=MD |issue=5917 |bibcode=2009Sci...323.1041M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was achieved using an IR ground-based telescope, NASA's 3-meter [[Infrared Telescope Facility]] atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

Infrared astronomy has also revealed that the interstellar medium contains a suite of complex gas-phase carbon compounds called [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|polyaromatic hydrocarbons]], often abbreviated PAHs or PACs. These molecules, composed primarily of fused rings of carbon (either neutral or in an ionized state), are said to be the most common class of carbon compound in the galaxy. They are also the most common class of carbon molecule in meteorites and in cometary and asteroidal dust ([[cosmic dust]]). These compounds, as well as the amino acids, [[nucleobase]]s, and many other compounds in meteorites, carry [[deuterium]] and [[isotope]]s of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that are very rare on earth, attesting to their extraterrestrial origin. The PAHs are thought to form in hot circumstellar environments (around dying, carbon-rich [[red giant]] stars).

Infrared astronomy has also been used to assess the composition of solid materials in the interstellar medium, including [[silicate]]s, [[kerogen]]-like carbon-rich solids, and [[ice]]s. This is because unlike visible light, which is scattered or absorbed by solid particles, the IR radiation can pass through the microscopic interstellar particles, but in the process there are absorptions at certain wavelengths that are characteristic of the composition of the grains.&lt;ref name="astrochem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrochemistry.org/observe |title=The Astrophysics &amp; Astrochemistry Laboratory |publisher=NASA Ames Research Center |date=10 Sep 2013 |accessdate=18 Apr 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As above with radio astronomy, there are certain limitations, e.g. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is difficult to detect by either IR or radio astronomy.

Such IR observations have determined that in dense clouds (where there are enough particles to attenuate the destructive UV radiation) thin ice layers coat the microscopic particles, permitting some low-temperature chemistry to occur. Since hydrogen is by far the most abundant molecule in the universe, the initial chemistry of these ices is determined by the chemistry of the hydrogen. If the hydrogen is atomic, then the H atoms react with available O, C and N atoms, producing "reduced" species like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, if the hydrogen is molecular and thus not reactive, this permits the heavier atoms to react or remain bonded together, producing CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CN, etc. These mixed-molecular ices are exposed to ultraviolet radiation and [[cosmic ray]]s, which results in complex radiation-driven chemistry.&lt;ref name="astrochem" /&gt; Lab experiments on the photochemistry of simple interstellar ices have produced amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/links/020328/020328-3.html |title=Astrobiology: Photochemistry on ice |publisher=Macmillan Publishers Ltd. |date=28 Mar 2002 |accessdate=18 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity between interstellar and cometary ices (as well as comparisons of gas phase compounds) have been invoked as indicators of a connection between interstellar and cometary chemistry. This is somewhat supported by the results of the analysis of the organics from the comet samples returned by the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust mission]] but the minerals also indicated a surprising contribution from high-temperature chemistry in the solar nebula.

Research is progressing on the way in which interstellar and circumstellar molecules form and interact, e.g. by including non-trivial [[Quantum tunnelling#Astrochemistry in interstellar clouds|quantum mechanical phenomena]] for synthesis pathways on interstellar particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768233/pdf/COC-17-1758.pdf|last=Trixler|first=F|title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life.|journal=Current Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=17|number=16|pages=1758–1770|doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083|pmid=24039543|pmc=3768233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research could have a profound impact on our understanding of the suite of molecules that were present in the molecular cloud when our solar system formed, which contributed to the rich carbon chemistry of comets and asteroids and hence the meteorites and interstellar dust particles which fall to the Earth by the ton every day.

The sparseness of interstellar and interplanetary space results in some unusual chemistry, since [[Woodward–Hoffmann rules|symmetry-forbidden]] reactions cannot occur except on the longest of timescales. For this reason, molecules and molecular ions which are unstable on Earth can be highly abundant in space, for example the [[Protonated molecular hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ion. Astrochemistry overlaps with [[astrophysics]] and [[nuclear physics]] in characterizing the nuclear reactions which occur in stars, the consequences for [[stellar evolution]], as well as stellar 'generations'. Indeed, the nuclear reactions in stars produce every naturally occurring chemical element. As the stellar 'generations' advance, the mass of the newly formed elements increases. A first-generation star uses elemental hydrogen (H) as a fuel source and produces [[helium]] (He). Hydrogen is the most abundant element, and it is the basic building block for all other elements as its nucleus has only one [[proton]]. Gravitational pull toward the center of a star creates massive amounts of heat and pressure, which cause [[nuclear fusion]]. Through this process of merging nuclear mass, heavier elements are formed. [[Carbon]],  [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]] are examples of elements that form in stellar fusion. After many stellar generations, very heavy elements are formed (e.g. [[iron]] and [[lead]]).

In October 2011, scientists reported that [[cosmic dust]] contains [[organic compound|organic]] matter ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [[aromatic]]-[[aliphatic]] structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [[stars]].&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chow |first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Matter from Stars |url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ScienceDaily]] Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111026"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kwok |first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature10542 |bibcode=2011Natur.479...80K |pmid=22031328 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=80–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system.

In September, 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that [[polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], subjected to [[Interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compound|organics]] - "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Organics to Mimic Life's Origins |url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html |date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui |title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=756 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |bibcode=2012ApJ...756L..24G |issue=1 |pages=L24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

For the study of the recourses of chemical elements and molecules in the universe is developed the mathematical model of the molecules composition distribution in the interstellar environment on thermodynamic potentials by professor M.Yu. Dolomatov using methods of the probability theory, the mathematical and physical statistics and the equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="abundance of chemical elements"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-014-1844-8 |title=Thermodynamic models of the distribution of life-related organic molecules in the interstellar medium |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science | date=May 2014 |accessdate=25 Feb 2014 |doi=10.1007/s10509-014-1844-8 |volume=351 |pages=213–218|bibcode = 2014Ap&amp;SS.351..213D  | last1 = Dolomatov | first1 = Michel Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abundance of chemical elements2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/apr/article/view/38799 |title=About Organic Systems Origin According to Equilibrium Thermodynamic Models of Molecules Distribution in Interstellar Medium |publisher= Canadian Center of Science and Education | date=20 July 2014 |accessdate=4 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abundance of chemical elements3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/apr/article/view/38799 |title=The Thermodynamic Models of Molecular Chemical Compound Distribution in the Giant Molecular Clouds Medium |publisher= Canadian Center of Science and Education | date=25 Sep 2012 |accessdate=11 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this model are estimated the resources of life-related molecules, amino acids and the nitrogenous bases in the interstellar medium. The possibility of the oil hydrocarbons molecules formation is shown. The given calculations confirm Sokolov’s and Hoyl’s hypotheses about the possibility of the oil hydrocarbons formation in Space. Results are confirmed by data of astrophysical supervision and space researches.

In July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the ''[[Philae (spacecraft)|Philae]]'' lander on [[comet]] [[67/P]]{{'s}} surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen [[organic compound]]s, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including [[acetamide]], [[acetone]], [[methyl isocyanate]] and [[propionaldehyde]].&lt;ref name="wapo20150730"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/philae-probe-finds-evidence-that-comets-can-be-cosmic-labs/2015/07/30/63a2fc0e-36e5-11e5-ab7b-6416d97c73c2_story.html |title=Philae probe finds evidence that comets can be cosmic labs |work=The Washington Post |agency=Associated Press |first=Frank |last=Jordans |date=July 30, 2015 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esa20150730"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Science_on_the_surface_of_a_comet |title=Science on the Surface of a Comet |publisher=European Space Agency |date=July 30, 2015 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20150731"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bibring |first1=J.-P. |last2=Taylor |first2=M.G.G.T. |last3=Alexander |first3=C. |last4=Auster |first4=U. |last5=Biele |first5=J. |last6=Finzi |first6=A.

[[Australian]] Aboriginal [[kinship]] are the systems of [[law]] governing social interaction, particularly [[marriage]], in traditional [[Australian Aboriginal culture]]s. It is an integral part of the culture of every [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Aboriginal group]] across Australia.

==The subsection system==

Subsection systems are a unique social structure that divide all of Australian Aboriginal society into a number of groups, each of which combines particular sets of kin. In Central Australian Aboriginal English vernacular, subsections are widely known as "'''skins'''". Each subsection is given a name that can be used to refer to individual members of that group. Skin is passed down by a person's parents to their children.

The name of the groups can vary. There are systems with two such groupings (these are known as '[[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]' in kinship studies), systems with four (sections), six and eight (subsection systems). Some language groups extend this by having distinct male and female forms, giving a total of sixteen skin names, for example the Pintupi (listed below) and Warlpiri. While membership in skin groups is ideally based on blood relations, Australian Aboriginal subsection systems are classificatory, meaning that even people who are not actual blood relations are assigned to a subsection. They are also universal, meaning that every member of the society is assigned a position in the system.

Subsection systems are found in Aboriginal societies across much of Central, Western and Northern Australia. On the basis of detailed analysis and comparison of the various subsection systems and their terminologies, and in particular the apparent prefix /j-/ for male and /n-/ for female, it has been identified as a social innovation originally from the Daly River region of the Northern Territory, which then spread rapidly southwards to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Systems with two groupings (moieties)===

====Yolngu====

The [[Yolngu|Yolŋu]] people of north-eastern [[Arnhem Land]] divide society (and much of the natural world) into two [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]: ''Dhuwa'' and ''Yirritja''. Each of these is represented by people of a number of different groups (each with their own lands, languages and philosophies) through their [[hereditary]] [[Estate (law)|estates]] – so many things are either ''Yirritja'' or ''Dhuwa'':

|Rirratjingu, Galpu, Djambarrpuyngu, Golumala, Marrakulu,&lt;br/&gt;Marrangu, Djapu, Datiwuy, Ngaymil, Djarrwark.
|}

Fish, stone, river, sea etc., belongs to one or the other moiety. Things that are not either Dhuwa or Yirritja are called ''wakinŋu''. Yolŋu also have a kinship system with eight subsections (four Dhuwa and four Yirritja which is what creates moiety).

===Systems with four sections===

====Gamilaraay====

The [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] language group from [[New South Wales]] have a four section system.

====Martuthunira====

The [[Martuthunira language|Martuthunira]] language group from the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]] have a four section system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilybara: Aboriginal languages of the Pilbara region |last=Sharp, Janet |author2=Nicholas Thieberger |year=1992 |publisher= Wangka Maya, The Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre|location= Port Hedland, Western Australia |isbn= 0-646-10711-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The spelling '''''l.y''''' indicates that the letters represent two distinct [[phoneme]]s, and are not a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]).

Similar systems are found across most language groups in the Pilbara, though with some variation in the forms of the names. For example, speakers of [[Ngarla language|Ngarla]] use ''Milangka'' where Martuthunira use ''Pal.yarri''.

====Alyawarra====

The [[Alyawarre]] language group from [[Central Australia]] also have a four section system, but use different terms from the Martuthunira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Simple Introduction to Central Australian Kinship Systems |last=Wafer, Jim |year=1982 |publisher= Institute for Aboriginal Development, Alice Springs, Northern Territory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems with eight groups (subsection systems)===

====Lardil====
The [[Lardil]] of [[Mornington Island]] in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] have eight subsection groups, shown here with some of their totems:

|Balyarriny
|''Black tiger shark,&lt;br/&gt;sea turtle''
|Kamarrangi
|Buranyi
|-
|Bangariny
|''Brown shark, turtle''
|Yakimarr
|Ngarrijbalangi
|-
|Buranyi
|''Crane, salt water, &lt;br/&gt;sleeping turtle''
|Kangal
|Balyarriny
|-
|Burrarangi
|''Lightning, rough sea,&lt;br/&gt;black dingo''
|Ngarrijbalangi
|Kamarrangi
|-
|Kamarrangi
|''Rock, pelican, [[brolga]],&lt;br/&gt;red dingo''
|Balyarriny
|Burrarangi
|-
|Kangal
|''[[Barramundi]],&lt;br/&gt;grey shark''
|Buranyi
|Yakimarr
|-
|Ngarrijbalangi
|''Rainbird, shooting star,&lt;br/&gt;egret''
|Burrarangi
|Bangariny
|-
|Yakimarr
|''Seagull, barramundi,&lt;br/&gt;grey shark''
|Bangariny
|Kangal
|}

Each Lardil person belongs to one of these groups. Their paternal [[grandfather]]'s subsection determines their own; so a Balyarriny man or woman will have a Balyarriny grandfather. Members of each group may only marry members of one other, specified, group.

Once a person's subsection group is known, their relationship to any other Lardil can be determined. A Ngarrijbalangi is a 'father' to a Bangariny, a 'father-in-law' to a Yakimarr and a 'son' to another Bangariny, either in a social sense or purely through linearship.

The mechanics of the Lardil skin system means that generations of males cycle back and forth between two subsections. ''Ngarrijbalangi'' is father to ''Bangariny'' and ''Bangariny'' is father to ''Ngarrijbalangi'' and similarly for the three other pairs of subsections. Generations of women, however, cycle through four subsections before arriving back at the starting point. This means that a woman has the same subsection name as her ([[Matrilineality|matrilineal]]) great-great-grandmother.

====Pintupi====&lt;!-- This section header is linked to from the article "Makinti Napanangka" --&gt;
The [[Pintupi]] of the [[Western Desert (Australia)|Western Desert]] also have an eight subsection system, made more complex by distinct forms for male and female subsection names; male forms begin with "Tj", the female forms with "N". The [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] system is almost the same:

====Kunwinjku====
The [[Kunwinjku language|Kunwinjku]] of [[Arnhem Land|Western Arnhem Land]] have a similar system; male forms begin with "Na", the female forms with "Ngal":&lt;ref&gt;Etherington, Steven; Etherington, Narelle, ''[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/15561244?selectedversion=NBD12689936 Kunwinjku Kunwok : a short introduction to Kunwinjku language and society]'', Kunwinjku Language Centre, 1996, {{ISBN|0958690901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each person therefore has a [[patriline|patrimoiety]] and a [[matriline|matrimoiety]], a father's and a mother's subsection group.

===Extension of the system to non-relatives===

Outsiders who have significant interaction with such groups may be given a 'skin name', commonly based on the people they have interacted with and the types of interaction.

==Some common kinship terms used in Aboriginal English==
{{Main article|Australian Aboriginal English}}

The variety of English used by many Australian Aboriginal people employs kinship terms in ways that are based on their equivalents in Australian Aboriginal languages.

*''Aunty'' and ''uncle''  are terms of address for older people, to whom the speaker may not be related. 
*''Brother'' and ''sister''—as well as siblings this term is used to refer to children of one's mother's sister and of father's brother (cousin), just as in many indigenous languages.
*''Cousin-brother'' and ''cousin-sister'' are often used to refer to children of one's mother's sister and father's brother.
*''Cousin'' refers to children of one's father's sister and mother's brother, but may be extended to any relative of one's own generation, such as one who might share the same great grandparent as their own great grandparent, which is a second-cousin in Aboriginal terms.
*In south-east Queensland, ''daughter'' is used to refer to any woman of one's great-grandparents' generation. This is due to the cyclical nature of traditional kinship systems and mirrors usage in many Australian languages.
*''Father'' and ''mother'' include any relative of one's parents' generation, such as uncles, aunts, their own cousins and in-laws.
*''Grandfather'' and ''grandmother'' can refer to anyone of one's grandparents' generation. ''Grandfather'' can also refer to any respected elderly man, to whom the speaker may not be related.
*''Poison'' refers to a relation one is obligated to avoid. See ''[[Mother-in-law language]]''.
*The term ''second'', or ''little bit'' in northern Australia, is used with a distant relative who is described using a close kinship term. For example, one's ''second father'' or ''little bit father'' is a man of one's father's generation not closely related to the speaker. Usually having a ''second mother'' is having a woman of your own mother's generation who seems to act like a mother and would most likely care for you if anything were to happen to your own parents. It is contrasted with ''close'', ''near'' or ''true''.
*A ''skin'' or ''skin group'' is a section determined by the skin of a person's parents, and determines who a person is eligible to marry.
*''Son'' can refer to any male of the next generation, such as nephews, just as ''daughter'' can refer to any female of the next generation, including nieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1306">'''Campaign plan''' is a plan to achieve an objective, usually of a large-scale over an extended period of time.  It usually coordinates many activities and uses of resources involving multiple organizations.  A campaign plan could also have subordinate objectives or intermediate milestones and is often broken down by phases.  They often begin with an assessment of the situation to put the plan in context.  Campaign plans are often created in [[business marketing]], [[Political campaign|political campaigning]] and [[Military campaign|military campaigning]]. 

==Examples==
An example of a military campaign plan is [[Noble Resolve]].

==Official definitions==
The [[Military of the United States|U.S. Military]] defines campaign plan as: 

:"A joint operation plan for a series of related major operations aimed at achieving strategic or operational objectives within a given time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Chairman, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, [[Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]], Joint Publication (JP) 1-02 (Washington, DC: CJCS, April 12, 2001, Amended October 31, 2009), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its establishment in May 2006, the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs (IPE), a registered non-profit organization based in [[Beijing]], China, has developed the China Pollution Map Database to  monitor corporate environmental performance, pinpoint geographical locations of [[pollution]] sources and to act as an informational platform on regional pollution status, such as water and air quality, and pollutant discharge rankings. This publicly available information resource brings together over 97,000 environmental supervision records from government departments, at all levels and regions, throughout mainland China. These records, dating back as far as 2004, allow for the expansion of environmental information disclosure, enabling communities to fully understand the hazards and risks in the surrounding environment, thus promoting widespread public participation in environmental governance. 

With the improvements made to the IPE website and thus ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ over the last two years the number of official government-sourced violation records, from all regions in China, added to the ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ has grown by over 40,000; each having its own particular circumstances and need for a prompt and effective resolution. 

This important publicly available resource allows stakeholders, at all levels, to be informed, providing opportunities for individual and community inclusion, as well as NGO and media engagement. The IPE hopes this societal supervision of corporate and regional environmental performance and the external pressure on government will promote greater efforts towards enforcement and compliance, and in turn will provide a safer, cleaner and healthier environment for all.

When developing and updating the ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ the IPE pays special attention to the annually published, government authored, ''List of Key State Monitored Enterprises''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipe.org.cn/Upload/file/Notices/Reports/Key-State-Monitored-Enterprises-2010.pdf ''List of Key State Monitored Enterprises''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903001551/http://www.ipe.org.cn/Upload/file/Notices/Reports/Key-State-Monitored-Enterprises-2010.pdf |date=2012-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which according to set selection principles and methods, identifies those companies that occupy 65% of China’s industrial discharge volume, in traditionally heavy polluting industries. Through, often difficult, research and field visits, the IPE aims to continue the geographical positioning of the location of these companies.

In continuation of this program, the IPE intends to continue arduously collecting, organizing and disseminating this environmental data, and information on corporate violations from around China.

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}
'''Christian deism''' is a standpoint in the [[philosophy of religion]], which branches from [[Christianity]]. It refers to a deist who believes in the moral teachings—but not divinity—of [[Jesus]]. Corbett and Corbett (1999) cite [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;!--Discuss on talk page before removing!--&gt; as exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Corbett and Julia Mitchell Corbett, ''Politics and religion in the United States'' (1999) p. 68
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest-found usage of the term ''Christian deism'' in print in English is in 1738 in a book by [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_fP-TKe-PwC&amp;pg=PA189 | title=The moral philosopher: In a dialogue between Philalethes a Christian deist, and Theophanes a Christian Jew | first=Thomas | last=Morgan | authorlink=Thomas Morgan (deist) | year=1738}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing about ten times by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=%22christian+deism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lpJ0TbX-JpHmsQPxhcTQCw&amp;ved=0CCEQpwUoBA&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=bks%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3ADec+31_2+399%2Ccd_max%3A1799-12-31&amp;tbm= |title=Googlebooks.com search for "Christian Deism" before 1800.}} In most cases it was used to name a group that the author opposed.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''Christian deist'' is found as early as 1722,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title=Christianity vindicated against infidelity | first=Daniel | last=Waterland | year=1722 | page=63 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4pbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
in ''Christianity vindicated against infidelity'' by Daniel Waterland (he calls it a misuse of language), and adopted later by [[Matthew Tindal]] in his 1730 work, ''Christianity as Old as the Creation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Christianity as Old as the Creation | first=Matthew | last=Tindal |authorlink=Matthew Tindal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aIOAAAAIAAJ | year=1730 |pages=368 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian deism is influenced by [[Christianity]], as well as both main forms of deism: classical and modern. In 1698 English writer Matthew Tindal (1653–1733) published a pamphlet "The Liberty of the Press" as a "Christian" deist.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}{{dubious|date=July 2011|reason= also vague in terms of meaning}} He believed that the state should control the Church in matters of public communication.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Thiselton, ''Hermeneutics: An Introduction'' (2009) p 137&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=October 2012}}

It adopts the ethics and non-mystical teachings of Jesus, while denying that Jesus was a deity. Scholars of the founding fathers of the United States "have tended to place the founders' religion into one of three categories—non-Christian deism, Christian deism, and orthodox Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;The faiths of the founding fathers, by David Lynn Holmes, p. 163 (2006)
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Locke]] and [[John Tillotson]], especially, inspired Christian deism, through their respective writings.&lt;ref name="Williston Walker 1985"&gt;A history of the Christian church, by Williston Walker, 579 (1985)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Possibly the most famed person to hold this position was Thomas Jefferson, who praised "nature's God" in the "Declaration of Independence" (1776) and edited the "[[Jefferson Bible]]"—a Bible with all reference to revelations and other miraculous interventions from a deity cut out.

In an 1803 letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], Jefferson states that he conceived the idea of writing his view of the "Christian system" in a conversation with [[Benjamin Rush]] during 1798–99. He proposes beginning with a review of the morals of the ancient philosophers, moving on to the "deism and ethics of the Jews", and concluding with the "principles of a pure deism" taught by Jesus, "omit[ting] the question of his divinity, and even his inspiration."&lt;ref name="Correspondence"&gt;[http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/jefferson_m_03.html Excerpts from the Correspondence of Thomas Jefferson] Retrieved 12 Jul 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian deists see no paradox in adopting the values and ideals espoused by Jesus without believing he was God. Without providing examples or citations, one author maintains, "A number of influential 17th- and 18th-century thinkers claimed for themselves the title of 'Christian deist' because they accepted both the Christian religion based on revelation and a deistic religion based on natural reason. This deistic religion was consistent with Christianity but independent of any revealed authority. Christian deists often accepted revelation because it could be made to accord with natural or rational religion."&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'', Edgar V. McKnight, p. 96 (1999)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Deism===
Deism is a [[Humanism|humanist]] theological position (though encompassing a wide variety of view-points) concerning God's relationship with the [[Nature|natural world]] which emerged during the [[scientific revolution]] of 17th-century Europe and came to exert a powerful influence during the [[Age of Enlightenment|18th-century enlightenment]].

Deists reject atheism,&lt;ref name="González1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justo L. González|title=The Reformation to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWoHUb5qQccC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=14 Aug 2010|year=1984|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060633165|pages=190–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were a number of different types of deists in the 17th and 18th century.

Deism holds that God does not intervene with the functioning of the natural world in any way, allowing it to run according to the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] that he configured when he created all things. Because God does not control or interfere with his self-sustaining Creation, its component systems work in concert to achieve the balanced natural processes that make up the physical world. As such, Human beings are "free agents in a free world." A "free agent" is someone who has authority and ability to choose his/her actions and who may make mistakes. A "free world" is one which ordinarily operates as it is designed to operate and permits the consequential properties of failure and accident to be experienced by its inhabitants. God is thus conceived to be wholly [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and never [[immanent]]. For deists, human beings can only know God via [[reason]] and the observation of nature but not by revelation or supernatural manifestations (such as miracles)—phenomena which deists regard with caution if not skepticism.

Christian deism is one of several branches of deism to have come about over time:
{{quote|Over time there have been other schools of thought formed under the umbrella of deism including Christian deism, belief in deistic principles coupled with the moral teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and [[Pandeism]], a belief that God became the entire universe and no longer exists as a separate being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/what-is-deism What Is Deism?], Douglas MacGowan, ''[[Mother Nature Network]]'', May 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===History===
[[Williston Walker]], in ''A History of the Christian Church'', wrote: "In its milder form, it emerged as 'rational supernaturalism,' but in its central development it took the form of a full Christian Deism, while its radical wing turned against organized religion as anti-Christian Deism."&lt;ref name="Williston Walker 1985"/&gt; "English Deism on the whole was a cautious, Christian Deism, largely restricted in influence to the upper classes. But a radical anti-Christian Deism, militant in its attack on organized Christianity, though with few supporters, accompanied it."&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Christian church, by Williston Walker, 584 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

An early Christian deist wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For God, according to these [[Philosophers]], makes and governs a natural World that is capable of governing itself, and that might have made itself as well, had they not pass'd a needless and insignificant Compliment upon, the Creator. But I hope they will mend their Scheme, and compound this Matter for their own Honour, and not pretend to fay, that God has made a necessary World, or a self-existent System of Creatures. Yet this is the philosophical Scheme of Atheism, which its Patrons would fain call Deism, and in which the Christian Jews or Jewish Christians assist them, by joining inadvertently in the fame Cry. But if this be not a fine Scheme of Philosophy, let Christian Deism stand for an odd Sort of Religion, and let the Christian Jews be for ever orthodox, and be allow'd as the only religious Men in the World. It is certain, that if God governs moral Agents at all, he must; govern them by Hope and Fear, or by such a wise and suitable Application of Rewards and Punishments, as the different Circumstances of Persons, and the Ends of Government require. And these Rewards and Punishments must be such as are not the natural, necessary Consequences of the Actions themselves, themselves, since every one must see that this would be no Government at all, and that the Case, in this Respect, must be the very same whether we suppose any rectoral Justice, or any Presence or Operation of God in the World or not. And yet this which is really no Government at all, is all the general Providence which some seem willing to allow. But since those Gentlemen are all deep Philosophers, and above the gross Ignorance of the common Herd, I would here only ask them, What are the Laws of Nature ? What is the Law of Gravity, the Law of communicating Motion from one Body to another by Impulse, and the Law of the Vis -Inertia of Bodies ? Are these natural, essential and inherent Properties of the Bodies themselves, or are they the regular Effects of some universal, extrinsick Cause acting incessantly upon the whole material System, by such and such general Laws and Conditions of Agency?&lt;ref&gt;The moral philosopher: in a dialogue between Philalethes, a Christian deist and Theophanes a Christian Jew. By Thomas Morgan, 189-190 (1737).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This may give the Reader some Notion of this Writer's Candour and Sincerity, and what we are to think of his pretended Regard for Christianity, which in Effect amounts to this: That the Christianity revealed in the Writings of the New Testament is Jewish Christianity; that is, Christianity corrupted and adulterated with Judaism, which according to him is the worst Religion in the World. But the true and genuine Christianity is Christian Deism, to be learned not from the Writings of the New Testament, but from the Volume of Nature, from every Man's own Breast, from the Heavens, the Earth, and especially the Brute Creatures,the genuine uncorrupted Instructors in our Author's Christianity. So that the "Gentlemen that assume to themselves the Title of Deists, seem resolved that for the future they only shall be called the true Christians too. Those that look upon the New Testament to be divinely inspired, and receive it as the Rule of their Faith, and take their Religion from thence, must be called Christian Jews, who only put a strange Mixture of inconsistent Religions upon the World for Christianity : whereas these Christian Deists teach it in its Purity, and in order to propagate pure uncorrupted Christianity they do their utmost to discard.the Writings of the New Testament, that Is, the Writings that give us aft Account of the Doctrines taught by Christ and his Apostles, But since these Gentlemen will not allow; us the honorable Title of Christians, it is but fair that they should leave us that of Free-Thinkers, to which I really think the Advocates for the Gospel Revelation have a much juster Pretension than they.&lt;ref&gt;''The divine authority of the Old and New Testament asserted'', by John Leland, p viii-ix (1739)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christian foundation===
In conjunction with deistic perspectives, Christian deism incorporates Christian tenets. Christian deists believe that [[Jesus Christ]] was a deist. Jesus taught that there are two basic laws of God governing humankind. The first law is that life comes from God and we are to use it as God intends, as illustrated in Jesus' parable of the [[Attic talent|talents]]. The second law is that God intends for human beings to live by love for each other, as illustrated in Jesus' parable of the good Samaritan.

Jesus summarized two basic "commandments" or laws of God as "love for God and love for neighbor." These two commandments through Christian deism were known to Jesus from the Hebrew scriptures but Jesus expanded the definition of "neighbor" to include everyone concerned in the natural world. "Love for God" means having appreciation for God as the creator of the world and the source of human life. "Love for neighbor" means having appreciation for the value of every human life. These are not laws or "truths" that Jesus received through some supernatural "revelation" according to Christian deism. In his "parable of the sower," Jesus taught that the "word of God" is known naturally because it is sown "in the heart" of everyone. For instance, the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], who was a Jew, recognized that God's laws are known naturally by everyone. Paul wrote, "When Gentiles (non-Jews) who do not have the (Mosaic) law do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts" (Romans 2:14-15). Christian deism is therefore based on appreciation for all creation and on appreciation for every human life.

In his teachings, Jesus used examples from the natural world and from human nature to explain basic truths about life. In his parables, Jesus spoke of mustard seeds, wheat, weeds, fishing nets, pearls, vineyards, fig trees, salt, candlelight and sheep to illustrate his points. Jesus also used illustrations from human nature to teach basic concepts such as repentance, forgiveness, justice, and love.

Jesus called for people to follow God's laws, or commandments, so the "kingdom of God" could come "on earth as it is in heaven." As Jesus preached the "gospel", or good news, that the "kingdom of God is at hand," Christians deists believe the Romans viewed Jesus as a Jewish revolutionary seeking to liberate the Jews from Roman rule. Jesus refused to stop preaching his "gospel" even though he knew that he was risking crucifixion, the usual Roman penalty for revolutionaries. Jesus called for his followers to take this same risk, "If a man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it" (Mark 8:34-35).

After his crucifixion, Jesus' cross became a symbol of commitment to establishing the "kingdom of God" on earth. Christian deists are committed to following God's natural laws, as summarized in the two "commandments" to love God and love our neighbor.

==Different schools of thought==
The broad spectrum of thought available within the idea of a Christian deism encompasses models of [[Deism#The history of classical deism|classical deism]] and [[pandeism]] with simple [[Reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the message of [[Toleration|tolerance]] claimed as espoused by the human Jesus, to belief in Jesus as a sort of naturally occurring divine figure, a mystical product of the rational processes of a rational [[universe]]. An example of the broadness attributed to Christian deism is found in this criticism of the position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christian Deist, i.e., a man who alleges that the Christian religion is nothing else than pure natural religion. The Deist, whom he introduces speaking, speaks with great presumption, as the ignorant are accustomed to do: that he neither possessed any acquaintance with the ancient languages nor with history, which he betrays in the very beginning, awakens no good anticipations in favour of Morgan, who appears in the person of the Deist. Morgan alleges with great boldness, that his religion of reason alone is divine, that the Christian is a mere invention and device of man, and through all ages since its introduction, has been regarded as such by a small but oppressed party: that the character of [[Judaism]], which is not only human, but altogether devilish, cleaves still to the followers of a blind faith': that the apostle Paul was the chief of the freethinkers who wished to have no connexion with Judaism, and alone preached Christianity in its purity, whilst the other apostles were merely the chiefs of a political party who in the spirit of Judaism had attached themselves to it.

....

The freer Paulinian party, according to Morgan's view, had been from the first always persecuted and oppressed by the others; and although the Jewish Christians had afterwards fallen asunder and separated into various hostile sects, the same intolerant Jewish spirit still, in a greater or a less degree, animated them all, and they would not consent to relinquish the service of sacrifices; this spirit has given birth to a religion of priests among all those sects, which is immeasurably removed from the true religion. In addition, Morgan will not at all admit that his opinions approach in any respect to atheism, or that his object is to defend any thing similar to it; he alone, as he alleges, is a teacher of the true moral religion. It will not therefore be a matter of surprise, that a division of his book treats of the public forms of divine worship, and especially upon prayer. On the other hand, his Christian Deist will have nothing to do with sacrifices or satisfaction,—nothing with the vicarious death of Christ,—nothing with sacrifices and ceremonies,—with grace or election, which does not depend upon the merit of the person elected.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Eighteenth Century and of the Nineteenth'', by F.C. Schlosser, p. 47 (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christian deists do not worship Jesus as God. However, there are differing views concerning the exact nature of Jesus, as well as differing levels of hewing to traditional, orthodox deistic belief on this issue. There are two main theological positions.

===Jesus as the Son of God===
Of the Christian deists who look upon Jesus as the Son of God, (but not God himself), the Christian aspect of their faith is drawn from three main aspects of prior Christian thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightenmentdeism.com/?page_id=156 |title=Christian Deism |publisher=Enlightenment Deism |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They take a modified view of [[Pelagius]], that there is no need for divine aid in performing good works and that the only "grace" necessary is the declaration of the law. They also hold a mild version of the [[moral influence theory of atonement]] philosophy. They combine these two philosophies with certain aspects of classical [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology. Indeed, mainstream deistic thought contributed to the rise of Unitarianism itself, with people in the 19th century increasingly self-identifying as Unitarians rather than as deists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Campbell Mossner|Mossner, Ernest Campbell]] (1967).

===Jesus as a moral teacher===
Christian deists who do not believe in Jesus as the son of God strongly reject any theories of atonement.

Different theories receive different levels of rejection, the strongest rejection being reserved for the theory of [[penal substitution]], that claims that Jesus had to die as a sacrifice to pay the "death penalty" for humankind and save them from the "wrath" of God. And they do not view God as a whimsical tyrant who sends plagues and pestilence to punish people on earth and who plans to torture people in "[[hell]]" in the future. Christian deists reject these ideas as products of human hatred and a failure to recognize God's natural laws of love for others.

Christian deists consider themselves to be disciples, or students, of Jesus because Jesus taught the natural laws of God. But Christian deists believe that Jesus was only human.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christiandeism.com/Jesus.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925150953/http://christiandeism.com/Jesus.html |date=25 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus had to struggle with his own times of disappointment, sorrow, anger, prejudice, impatience, and despair, just as other human beings struggle with these experiences. Jesus never claimed to be perfect but he was committed to following God's natural laws of love.

==Diverging from Christianity and deism==
Christian deism can differ from both mainstream deism and orthodox Christianity. This can occasionally be on the same subject but most often, Christian deism finds itself in agreement with one on a given theological topic, only to disagree on the next theological topic.

Christian deism is opposed to the doctrine of predestination in which everything that happens is thought to be the will of God, and instead tend to believe in the concept of free will. [[John Calvin]] was a proponent of the theory of predestination in which God allegedly determines everything that happens, whether good or bad. Christian deists believe that it is never God's will for anyone to be sick or injured. In that bad things occur as a result of prior interactions that resulted in a specified outcome. These bad things may be caused by interfering with naturalistic processes that result in negative consequences to carbon-based life, or by human interaction on the surface of the Earth that leads to degrees of inhospitable conditions for others. Christians deists believe God gifted the human intellect to heal many illnesses, but God does not directly intervene to heal people on demand by some supernatural occurrence. Humans are believed to already have the endowed capacity to create synergies and contribute in some way toward the development of fairer societies on Earth, whether it be through scientific understanding or spiritual enlightenment. However, Christian deists also strongly oppose the mainstream deistic notion that sacred texts like the Bible contain no revealed truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-deist.blogspot.com/ |title=the christian deist café |publisher=Christian-deist.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christiandeism.com/beliefs/ |title=Beliefs |publisher=Christiandeism.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10057">The '''Clean Air Society of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]''' ('''CASANZ''') is a non-governmental, non-profit organization formed in the 1960s to bring together people with an interest in clean air and the study of [[air pollution]]. Its focus has since grown to include broader [[environmental management]] affairs, but with special emphasis on air quality and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casanz.org.au/ Official CASANZ website]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2005, the society had 836 members (683 in Australia, 140 in New Zealand, and 13 in other countries). In September 2007, CASANZ hosted the 14th [[International Union of Air Pollution Prevention and Environmental Protection Associations|IUAPPA]] World Congress in Brisbane, Australia.

==Activities promoting environmental protection==
CASANZ promotes the protection of the environment by a variety of activities, including:
*Advancement of knowledge and practical experience of [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[air quality]] management. 
*Providing an organization which gathers and distributes the experience and knowledge of its members. 
*Providing lectures, exhibitions, public meetings and conferences that expand knowledge of environmental matters and, in particular,  air quality — including causes, effects, measurement, legislative aspects and control of [[air pollution]]. 
*Liaison with organizations having similar interests in other countries. 
*Providing scholarships, monetary grants, awards and prizes to encourage the study of relevant subjects.

==The operation and governing of CASANZ==
CASANZ operates through autonomous branches which determine their own programs of activities, including technical meetings, seminars, workshops, conferences, training courses, etc. Details of these activities are circulated to branch members and posted on the society's online web site.

CASANZ is governed by an Executive Committee consisting of:
*An elected Executive Director
*Other officers and representatives nominated by the branches.

The Executive Committee manages the day-to-day activities of the society and directs the work of the Executive Director.

==Special Interest Groups (SIGS)==
As of September 2013, CASANZ has eight Special Interest Groups (commonly referred to as SIGs), each of which is briefly discussed in the following subsections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Default.aspx The eight SIGs of CASANZ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614033919/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modelling Special Interest Group===
The objective of the '''''Modelling Special Interest Group''''' is to bring together CASANZ members who have an interest in the development and/or application of [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to exchange ideas, identify common problems, inform members of new developments, and establish, as appropriate, a 'ModSIG view' on issues of relevance.

Dispersion modelling is becoming more and more a part of licensing emissions to the atmosphere throughout Australia, and there is growing awareness of the role that air quality modelling can play in areas such as air resource management, [[risk assessment]] and land-use planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/modelling.aspx The Modelling SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035243/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/modelling.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odour Special Interest Group===
The '''''[[Odour Special Interest Group]]''''' is an important forum for the exchange of information, and in encouraging improved practices in [[odour]] measurement, modelling, assessment, control, management and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/odour.aspx The Odour SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614031539/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/odour.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor Air Special Interest Group===
The '''''Indoor Air Special Interest Group''''' promotes discussion and debate on the state of knowledge and the quality of indoor air, and on related environmental health concerns. The group encourages research, education, community awareness and management of issues related to this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035113/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/indoorair.aspx The Indoor Air SIG page on the Casanz website].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenhouse Special Interest Group===
The purpose of the '''''Greenhouse Special Interest Group''''' is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035109/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/greenhouse.aspx The Greenhouse SIG page on the CASANZ website].&lt;/ref&gt;

*To identify the research and development work being done at national and international levels on the science of greenhouse and global climate modelling as well as the developments being undertaken to assess and quantify the impact of climate change.
*To inform CASANZ members and the broader community on greenhouse gas emissions, emission scenarios, regional contributions and economic and technological developments.
*To provide response to government policies and initiatives in the area of energy reform and greenhouse abatement so as to stimulate debate amongst members and the broader community.

===Measurement Special Interest Group===
The primary objective of the '''''Measurement Special Interest Group''''' is to ensure that atmospheric pollutants in the ambient air and industrial source emissions are measured utilising methods that are fit for that purpose.

The objective is to be achieved by: conducting workshops, developing decision trees to assist in selecting appropriate air pollution measurement test methods and developing source emission and ambient air quality test methods in cooperation with Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/measurement.aspx The Measurement SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035227/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/pages/measurement.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport Special Interest Group===
The '''''Transport Emissions and Fuel Consumption Modeling Special Interest Group''''' (or simply the '''''Transport Special Interest Group''''') focuses on the quantification and modelling of air pollutant and greenhouse gas impacts from all forms of transport and their support equipment. The Transport Special Interest Group is intended to be a platform for information sharing, discussion of emerging issues and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Transport/Default.aspx The Transport SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035221/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Transport/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk Assessment Interest Group===
The '''''Risk Assessment Interest Group''''' exists to be knowledgeable and supportive of governmental policy developments involving risk assessment, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035058/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/Riskassessment/Default.aspx The Risk Assessment SIG page on the Casanz website].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''National Air Quality Standards (Air NEPM)'' which were developed with the help of risk assessment.
* Variations to the State of Victoria's ''Environment Protection Policy for Air Quality Management'' to incorporate formalised risk assessments. 
* The ''National Environmental Health Strategy'', which includes risk assessment as a basis for decision making.
* The Australian Standard for ''Risk Management (AS4360-1999)''.
* The proposal to develop a coordinated national strategy for ''air toxics''.

===Air Policy Special Interest Group===
The purpose of the '''''Air Policy Special Interest Group''''' is to bring together CASANZ members interested in advancing air policy development and contributing to responsible air quality related risk communication by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/airpolicy/Default.aspx The Air Policy SIG page on the CASANZ website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614035103/http://www.casanz.org.au/sigs/airpolicy/Default.aspx |date=2015-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exchanging ideas, and informing members of new air policy related developments and air quality issues of significant public concern.
* Coordinating and communicating science-based inputs for air policy, legislative and regulatory development processes.
* Collating and communicating science-based information to communities and decision makers on pressing air quality related issues, including official inquiries

[[File:Dewbow on a spiderweb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dewbow on a spiderweb]]

A '''dewbow''' is an [[optical effect]], similar to a [[rainbow]], where [[dew]]drops instead of rain droplets reflect and disperse sunlight.&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/dewbow.htm|title=Dewbow|last=Boyle|first=Kevin |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary of Dewbows"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlop|first=Storm|title=Weather|publisher=Collins|year=2009|pages=151|isbn=978-0-00-784141-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Dewbows can be seen on fields covered with dew, when the sun shines. Dew forms outdoors in the early morning after a clear night, when the surface temperature drops below the [[dew point]]. It forms most easily on surfaces that are isolated from conducted heat from deep ground, such as grass, leaves, and spider webs. Dew bows will be clearest on fields littered with cobwebs, as may occur in autumn. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&amp;subcat=dew_bow|title=Dew bow |last=Edens|first=Harald  |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shape==
A ''rainbow'' is perceived as a circle in the sky; and its contributing light rays form a cone. In contrast, a ''dewbow'' is perceived as the intersection of that cone and the ground. If the ground is flat and horizontal, and the sun is low in the sky, the dew bow is a [[hyperbola]]. Theoretically, when the sun is high, the intersection might be another [[conic section]], like a [[parabola]] or an [[ellipse]].&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt; However, dew usually evaporates before the sun is high. Nonetheless, an elliptical dew bow was captured on camera, when at night the full moon, high in the sky, illuminated a field loaded with dew.&lt;ref name="Großmann"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atoptics.wordpress.com/author/atoptics/page/10/|title=Dew bow|last=Großmann|first=Michael |accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divine command theory''' (also known as '''theological voluntarism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/ Theological Voluntarism]&amp;nbsp;— [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[medieval theological voluntarism]] and [[theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory which proposes that an action's status as [[Morality|morally]] [[good]] is equivalent to whether it is commanded by [[God]]. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that for a person to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.

Numerous variants of the theory have been presented: historically, figures including [[Saint Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] have presented various versions of divine command theory; more recently, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] has proposed a "modified divine command theory" based on the [[omnibenevolence]] of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong. [[Paul Copan]] has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint, and [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski]]'s divine motivation theory proposes that God's motivations, rather than commands, are the source of morality.

Semantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostics]] could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on [[Modal logic|modal]] grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], first proposed by [[Plato]] (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral [[autonomy]] and [[religious pluralism]], although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.

==General form==
Various forms of divine command theory have been presented by philosophers including [[William of Ockham]], [[St Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[John Calvin]]. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of [[God]] and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the only reason that a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin 1993, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of their being commanded by God, and many [[religious belief|religious believers]] subscribe to some form of divine command theory.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson, Holmgren 2010, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/ | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine command theory features in the ethics of many modern religions, including [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and [[Christianity]], as well as being a part of numerous older [[polytheism|polytheistic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Rae 2009, ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Athens]], it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 2011, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

===Augustine===
[[Saint Augustine]] offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good, which delivers human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment.&lt;ref name=IEP-2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H2 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=15 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine supported [[Plato|Plato's]] view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting [[autonomy#Philosophy|autonomously]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Keller, Leever &amp; White 2009, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Duns Scotus===
[[File:JohnDunsScotus.jpg|thumb|John Duns Scotus, who proposed a variant of divine command theory]]
[[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher [[John Duns Scotus]] argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Swinburne, Richard | year=2007 | pages=358–359 | isbn=978-0-19-921246-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus argued that the [[natural law]], in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently [[logical truth|analytically true]] and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the [[Ten Commandments]]. The last seven of the [[Ten Commandments]] do not belong to the natural law in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst our duties to God are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without. Hence, the last seven commandments do belong to the natural law, but not in the strictest sense, as they belong to the natural law by rectitude rather than by definition.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

Whilst Aquinas, as a natural law theorist, is generally seen as holding that morality is not willed by God,&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#NatLaw&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly James Clark and Anne Poortenga have presented a defence of divine command theory based on [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas']] moral theory. Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence, and so human nature can determine what is moral. Clark and Poortenga argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
The [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures, among whom is ethicist [[R. M. Hare]]. Kant's view that morality should be determined by the [[categorical imperative]]&amp;nbsp;– duty to the moral law, rather than acting for a specific end&amp;nbsp;– has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory. Philosopher and theologian [[John E. Hare]] has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant's [[heteronomy|heteronomous will]]&amp;nbsp;– motives besides the moral law, which Kant regarded as non-moral.&lt;ref name=PT263&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher [[Lewis White Beck]] takes Kant's argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends of divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Hare challenges this view, arguing that [[Kantian ethics]] should be seen as compatible with divine command theory.&lt;ref name=PT263/&gt;

===Robert Adams===
[[File:RobertMerrihewAdams20060625.jpg|thumb|Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory"]]
American philosopher [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory".&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent:
#It is wrong to do X.
#It is contrary to God's commands to do X.&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008/&gt;
He proposes that God's commands precurse moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths, not the other way around. Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically 'wrong' consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a [[Judeo-Christian]] context. In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it, he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake. Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty, rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature. Adams emphasises the importance of [[faith]] in God, specifically faith in God's goodness, as well as his existence.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams proposes that an action is morally wrong [[if and only if]] it defies the commands of a loving God. If cruelty was commanded, he would not be loving; Adams argued that, in this instance, God's commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2003, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his [[omnibenevolence]]. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"/&gt;

Adams proposes that in many Judeo-Christian contexts, the term 'wrong' is used to mean being contrary to God's commands. In ethical contexts, he believes that 'wrong' [[logical consequence|entails]] an [[emotivism|emotional]] attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 561-2&lt;/ref&gt; Adams suggests that a believer's concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right. If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong, the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him; rather their concept of morality would break down.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God's omnipotence. Thomas Aquinas argued that God's omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible: he attempted to refute the idea that God's inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence. Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical, so is not covered by Aquinas' defence, although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7a | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
[[Paul Copan]] argues from a Christian viewpoint that man, made in God's image, conforms to God's sense of morality. The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God; a person's sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God's.&lt;ref name=Copan&gt;Copan, Paul, and William Lane Craig. ''Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics.'' Nashville, Tennessee: B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2007. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|We would not know goodness without God's endowing us with a moral constitution. We have rights, dignity, freedom, and responsibility because God has designed us this way. In this, we reflect God's moral goodness as His image-bearers.|Paul Copan|Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics&lt;ref name="Copan" /&gt;}}

As an alternative to divine command theory, Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory, which still fits into a monotheistic framework. According to this theory, goodness is determined by God's motives, rather than by what he commands. Divine motivation theory is similar to [[virtue ethics]] because it considers the character of an agent, and whether they are in accordance with God's, as the standard for moral value.&lt;ref&gt;Baggett &amp; Walls 2011, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties, such as being lovable, which are given to them through God's perception of them. God's attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-238093747.html | title=Zagzebski, Linda Trinkaus. Divine Motivation Theory.(Book review) | publisher=The Review of Metaphysics | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=25 August 2012 | author=Toner, Christopher |via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory casts God as a good example for morality, and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite, imperfect beings.&lt;ref&gt;Langermann 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==

===Semantic objections===
Philosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds, arguing that "being commanded by God" and "being obligatory" do not mean the same thing, contrary to what the theory suggests. He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to propose that "being commanded by God" does not have an identical meaning to "being obligatory". This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on [[modal logic|modal]] ideas of what might exist in different worlds. He suggested that, even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same, they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral motivation===
Michael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations. He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued, rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward. This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate.&lt;ref name=IEP-2 /&gt;

===Euthyphro dilemma===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato presents the Euthyphro dilemma in one of his dialogues.]]
{{Main|Euthyphro dilemma}}
The [[Euthyphro dilemma]] was proposed in [[Plato|Plato's]] dialogue between [[Socrates]] and [[Euthyphro]]. In the scene, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma, which can be presented as the question 'Is X good because God commands it, or does God command X because it is good?'&lt;ref name=IEPPlato&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H3 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?|Plato|Euthyphro&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;}}
The Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action, or that God commands an action because it is good. If the first is chosen, it would imply that whatever God commands must be good: even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering, then inflicting suffering must be moral. If the latter is chosen, then morality is no longer dependent on God, defeating the divine command theory. Additionally, if God is subject to an external law, he is not sovereign or [[omnipotent]], which would challenge the orthodox conception of God. Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws.&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;

[[William of Ockham]] responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by '[[bite the bullet|biting the bullet]]'. He argued that, if God did command people to be cruel, then that would be morally obligatory, proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the [[principle of non-contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Moral Dilemmas in Medieval Thought: From Gratian to Aquinas | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Dougherty, M. V. | year=2011 | pages=163–164 | isbn=978-1-107-00707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] defended Ockham's view, noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what we consider to be immoral, not an actuality. Even if God could logically command these actions, he would not because that is not his character.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH4 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonore Stump and [[Norman Kretzmann]] have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of [[divine simplicity]], a concept associated with Aquinas and [[Aristotle]] which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical. They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=God, Goodness and Philosophy | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Harris, Harriet | year=2011 | pages=101 | isbn=978-1-4094-2852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American philosopher [[William Alston]] responded to the [[Euthyphro dilemma]] by considering what it means for God to be morally good. If divine command theory is accepted, it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God's goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations. He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God, so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands. Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character, which is necessarily good. There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Omnibenevolence===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and some more recent philosophers, challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God's goodness consists of his following his own commands. It is argued that, if divine command theory is accepted, God's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent. Neither could God hold any virtues, as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands&amp;nbsp;– if he cannot logically command himself, then he cannot logically have any virtues. Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good, but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy. William Wainwright argues that, although God does not act because of his commands, it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions. He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and, when he commands what is morally good, it becomes morally obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7b | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomy===
Michael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy, which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by. This challenges the view of divine command theory that God's will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous, but followers of an imposed moral law, making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory. Robert Adams challenges this criticism, arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God's commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7c | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Austin considers the view that, in a world of [[religious pluralism]], it is impossible to know which god's or religion's commands should be followed, especially because some religions contradict others, leaving it impossible to accept all of them. Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded. Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant, as an agent must choose whichever [[religion and morality]] they judge to be correct. He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that [[Ethics in religion|moral truths can be found in all religions]] and that moral revelation can be found [[Morality without religion|apart from religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7d | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heimir Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other (monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity, for example, and some Greek or Norse gods magnified human weaknesses). They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that, even within a religion, contrasting views of God exist&amp;nbsp;– the commands of God in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s could seem to contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson &amp; Holmgren 2010, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">In [[second language acquisition]], '''error treatment''' refers to the way teachers respond to learners' [[Speech error|linguistic errors]] made in the course of learning a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Rod|authorlink=Rod Ellis|title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many error treatment studies seek to address issues like when, how, and by whom such errors should be corrected.

== Types ==
Craig Chaudron (1977) has pointed out four types of treatment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Chaudron|title=A descriptive model of discourse in the corrective treatment of learners' errors|journal=Language Learning|date=January 1977|volume=27|issue=1|pages=29–46|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1977.tb00290.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Treatment that creates an autonomous ability in learners to correct themselves on any item
* Treatment that elicits a correct response from the learners
*Any reaction/treatment by a teacher that demands improvement
*Positive or negative reinforcement involving the expression of approval or disapproval

== Terminologies ==
A number of terms are used to discuss the various areas of error treatment, though the differences among these terms are very subtle.

=== Feedback ===
It has characteristics of constructive criticism which may be positive or negative usually from a more informed source.

=== Correction ===
In correcting errors, correction is a post-production exercise and basically deals with the linguistic errors.&lt;ref name=Ellis584&gt;Ellis, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; Often in the form of feedback, it draws learners' attention to the mistakes they have made and acts as a reminder of the correct form of language.

=== Repair ===
Errors that cause "communication difficulties" are likely to be "repaired" either by speaker or listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allwright |first1=Dick |last2=Bailey |first2=Kathleen M.|title=Focus on the Language classroom |url= |accessdate= |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-26909-1 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term repair, which includes correction, is an attempt to identify and correct the communication difficulties.

== Role of teachers and learners ==
The role of teachers and that of learners in correcting errors are of great importance. This tries to answer the question as to ''who'' should indicate and fix the error. The phenomenon is known as "self" and "other". Depending on who indicates and fixes the error either in conversation or in classroom, there can be four possible ways of error correction:&lt;ref&gt;Allwright, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
* self-initiated other-completed
* self-initiated self-completed
* other-initiated self-completed
* other-initiated other-completed
According to Van Lier (1988), in naturally occurring conversation, self-initiated and self-completed repair occurs while in teacher-dominated classroom, other-initiated and other-completed repair can be sought for.

== Description ==
Much of the studies on error treatment have focused on the following three issues:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Michael Byram |encyclopedia=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning |publisher= |year=2004 |isbn=9780415332866|page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the type of errors that should be treated/corrected
* who performs the correction
* when and how corrections should be made

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ethnohistory''' is the study of cultures and [[indigenous peoples]]' customs by examining historical records as well as other sources of information on their lives and history. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the [[history of the Americas]].

Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi=10.2307/481465| jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
Scholars studying the history of [[Mexico]]'s indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]'', edited by archeologist [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] was involved with creating a multiple volumes on [[Mesoamerican]] ethnohistory, published as ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', appearing in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', volumes 12-16, Howard F. Cline, general editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the volumes were published, "both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 12, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources "which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory."&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the [[New Philology]]. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the [[history of Mexico]] that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html | title=Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, Provisional Version, James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood, editors (2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist [[Howard F. Cline]], who was commissioned to work on Florda Indians and [[Jicarilla Apache]].  

The field has also reached into [[Melanesia]], where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. [[Michael Harkin]] argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Harkin, "Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory," ''Social Science History,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 34#2 pp 113-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = N. | year = 1961 | title = Ethnohistory: An Ethnological Point of View | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 83 | doi=10.2307/480349| jstor = 480349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/482586 | last1 = DeMallie | first1 = Raymond J. | year = 1993 | title = These Have No Ears": Narrative and the Ethnohistorical Method | jstor = 482586| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 515–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related [[methodology|methodologies]] in that it embraces [[emic]] perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past.

The definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically "the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material," as described by [[William N. Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenton | first1 = W. N. | year = 1966 | title = Field Work, Museum Studies, and Ethnohistorical Research | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 13 | issue = 1/2| page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[James Axtell]] described ethnohistory as "the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories."&lt;ref name="Axtell1979" /&gt; Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. [[Ed Schieffelin]] asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, E. and D. Gewertz (1985), ''History and Ethnohistory in Papua New Guinea'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as "a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow." He described ethnohistory as an endeavor based on a [[holistic]], [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] approach that is most rewarding when it can be "joined to the memories and voices of living people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = W. S. | year = 1988 | title = Culture Theory in Contemporary Ethnohistory | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2k09f06d| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 35 | issue = 1| page = 10 | doi=10.2307/482430| jstor = 482430 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting upon the history of ethnohistory as research field in the US, Harkin has situated it within the broader context of convergences and divergences of the fields of history and anthropology and the special circumstances of American Indian land claims and legal history in North American in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1215/01455532-2009-022 | last1 = Harkin | first1 = Michael | year = 2010 | title = Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory: Creating a Discipline from the Ground Up | url = | journal = Social Science History | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 113–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Championship in Forestry Skills''' is a competition in [[forestry]] skills among students from European forestry and agricultural colleges, staged each year since 2002. The students are formed into teams and tested in various disciplines. 

== Goals ==
The short‐term goal of the competition is the presentation of the latest achievements in [[logging]] techniques, logging machinery tools and loggers safety equipment and a comparison of these at an international level in theory and practice.

The long‐term aim of the competitions is to increase the appreciation of forest work and to draw general attention to forestry training and the forestry industry on both a national and international level. These competitions play a particularly significant role in creating international contacts between students and schools, which contribute to the furthering peaceful coexistence between nations.

== Structure ==
This competition is a team competition between schools of the [[EU]]. The best team from each country may attend the competition. Students who are in forestry training and between 16 – 25 years of age are eligible to compete. A team consists of four participants. Each participant must compete in theory and practice components.

In planning and carrying out the competitions, special attention is paid to safety aspects in working techniques.

The competition consists of two parts. First part is demonstrating specific knowledge of working with a [[chainsaw]] and consists of five disciplines (Fitting a new chain, [[Log bucking|Bucking]] by combined cut, Precision bucking, Undercut and [[Felling]] Cut, and [[Limbing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XIV European Championship of Forestry Skills|url=http://forestryskills.eu/en/hello/|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part is demonstrating knowledge about forests. This part takes place over an approximately 3&amp;nbsp;km long orientation course, within which are 16 points. At each point the competitors must demonstrate their knowledge of forest surveying, or recognize tree and animal species, forest pests and diseases of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulary(sic): European Students Championships in Forestry Skills: 3.6 Event VI:  Forestry Course|url=http://www.lfs-st-andrae.ksn.at/eigene_dateien/regelwerk_em2013/Rules_Forestry_course_2012.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner is the one country whose competitors achieve the highest number of points from both parts.

'''FOSS Movement in India''' refers to the campaign across the country during the 1990s and 2000s in particular, to promote Free and Open Source Software. It was marked by the existence of many [[Indian Linux User Groups]] (ILUGs) groups and [[Free Software User Groups]] (FSUGs) in different cities, town and other areas.

The prominent members of the campaign include the late [[Atul Chitnis]], Prof [[Nagarjuna G.]] and others.

A '''forest kindergarten''' is a type of [[preschool education]] for children between the ages of three and six that is held almost exclusively outdoors. Whatever the weather, children are encouraged to play, explore and learn in a forest or natural environment. The adult supervision is meant to assist rather than lead. It is also known as ''[[:de:Waldkindergarten|Waldkindergarten]]'' (in German), ''outdoor nursery'', ''nature kindergarten'', or ''nature preschool''. &lt;ref&gt;Alice Gregory, "Running Free in Germany’s Outdoor Preschools". The New York Times Style Magazine, May 18, 2017 [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/t-magazine/germany-forest-kindergarten-outdoor-preschool-waldkitas.html?_r=0] &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activities==
A forest kindergarten can be described as a [[kindergarten]] "without a ceiling or walls". The daycare staff and children spend their time outdoors, typically in a forest. A distinctive feature of forest kindergartens is the emphasis on play with toys that are fashioned out of objects that can be found in nature, rather than commercial toys. Despite these differences, forest kindergartens are meant to fulfill the same basic purpose as other nurseries, namely, to care for, stimulate, and educate young children.

Each forest kindergarten is different, partly because the organisations are independently minded. But typical activities and goals may include:&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secretgardencurriculum"&gt;{{citation|last=Bache|first=Cathy|title=Pre-school curriculum|publisher=Secret Garden Outdoor Nursery|year=2008|url=http://www.secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/pre%20school%20curriculum.doc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219101917/http://secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/pre%20school%20curriculum.doc|archivedate=2009-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and organization==
Forest kindergartens operate mainly in woodland, although some other sites can be equally inspiring, for example beaches and meadows. There should be a building where children can shelter from extreme weather. They may also spend a small part of each day indoors, although that is more likely to be for administrative and organisational reasons, such as to provide a known location where parents can deliver and collect their children. If the woodland is too far away to walk, a vehicle might reluctantly be used for transport.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Children are encouraged to dress for the weather, with waterproof clothes and warm layers, according to the climate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There are some [[forest schools]] that take children of various ages to woodland less frequently, and with a stronger focus on environmental topics themselves. For example, the "Woods for Learning" strategy&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcfc106.pdf/$FILE/fcfc106.pdf|title=Woods for Learning Education Strategy|publisher=Forestry Commission|year=2005|isbn=0-85538-684-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the British Forestry Commission proposes "regular" access, for example once a week for eight weeks.

==History==
In rural areas, and historical times, access to nature has not been a problem. Over the last century, with increasing urbanisation and "[[nature deficit disorder]]", there have been many changes in stance on [[outdoor education]]. 

The first forest Kindergarten was created by Ella Flautau in [[Denmark]] in the early 1950s. The idea formed gradually as a result of her often spending time with her own and neighbors' children in a nearby forest, a form of daycare which elicited great interest among the neighborhood parents. The parents formed a group and created an initiative to establish the first forest kindergarten. 

In [[Sweden]] in 1957, an ex-military man, Goesta Frohm, created the idea of "Skogsmulle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skogsmullestiftelsen.org/eng/index.htm Skogsmulle Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; "Skog" means wood in Swedish. "Mulle" is one of four fictional characters he created to teach children about nature, along with "Laxe" representing water, "Fjällfina" representing mountains and "Nova" representing an unpolluted nature. [[Forest schools]] based on Frohm's model, called "I Ur och Skur" (Rain or Shine Schools) moved the idea from occasional activities to formal nursery schools, being set up by Siw Linde in 1985. Juliet Robertson's review of Skogsmulle is a valuable modern-day summary.&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 1|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084834/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-2"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 2|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084915/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest kindergartens have existed in [[Germany]] since 1968 but were first officially recognized as a form of daycare in 1993, enabling state subsidies to reduce the daycare fees of children who attended Forest Kindergarten. Since then, the forest kindergartens have become increasingly popular. As of 2005 there were approximately 450 forest kindergartens in Germany, some of which offer a mix of forest kindergarten and traditional daycare, spending their mornings in the forest and afternoons inside. By late 2017, the number of forest kindergartens in Germany surpassed 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvnw.de/uber-uns/|title=ÜBER UNS {{!}} Bundesverband der Natur- und Waldkindergärten in Deutschland e.V.|website=bvnw.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain in 2005, a Swedish early years educator, Helena Nilsson, started Wildflowers Kindergarten, where preschool-aged children spend each morning in nature, throughout the year.

[[Childminder]] Cathy Bache opened the [[Secret Garden (outdoor nursery)|Secret Garden]] in Scotland in 2008 with support from funding authorities and private donors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/Early-Education-Child-Care/17970/11874 Childcare regulations] of the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taxfreevouchers"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childcare/ Tax Free Childcare Regulations], UK government HMRC&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2018 on all forest kindergartens are invited to celebrate the [[:de:Liste_von_Gedenk-_und_Aktionstagen#Mai|"International Day of Forest Kindergarten"]] every year on the 3rd of May.

==Effects==
The fact that most forest kindergartens do not provide commercial toys that have a predefined meaning or purpose supports the development of language skills, as children verbally create a common understanding of the objects used as toys in the context of their play. Forest kindergartens are also generally less noisy than closed rooms, and noise has been shown to be a factor in the [[stress (biological)|stress]] level of children and daycare professionals.

Playing outside for prolonged periods has been shown to have a positive impact on children's development, particularly in the areas of balance and agility, but also [[manual dexterity]], physical [[motor coordination|coordination]], [[Touch|tactile]] sensitivity, and [[depth perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/Colleges/ArchitecturePlanning/discover/centers/CYE/Publications/Documents/Benefitsofnature-FactSheet1-April2007.pdf |title=Benefits of Nature for Children’s Health |date=April 2007 |publisher=[[Children Youth and Environments Center]] for Research and Design, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731075831/http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/Colleges/ArchitecturePlanning/discover/centers/CYE/Publications/Documents/Benefitsofnature-FactSheet1-April2007.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Grahn|first=P |last2=Martensson|first2=F | last3=Lindblad|first3=B | last4=Nilsson|first4=P | last5=Ekman|first5=A |year=1997 | chapter=Ute på dagis|title=Stad and Land| volume=145| place=Håssleholm, Sweden| publisher=Nora Skåne Offset}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these studies, children who attend forest kindergartens experience fewer injuries due to accidents and are less likely to injure themselves in a fall.

When children from German ''[[:de:Waldkindergarten|Waldkindergarten]]s'' go to primary school, teachers observe a significant improvement in reading, writing, mathematics, social interactions and many other areas.&lt;ref name="gorges"&gt;Gorges R. [http://bvnw.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Prof_Gorges_Schulfhigkeit.pdf] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Boys may be less intellectually able than girls at typical school tasks such as reading and mathematics, so forest kindergartens have been recommended in the early years.&lt;ref&gt;Sax L.

Roland Gorges found&lt;ref name="gorges"/&gt; that children who had been to a forest kindergarten were above average, compared by teachers to those who had not, in all areas of skill tested. In order of advantage, these were:

[[Image:Quentin_Massys_-_Portrait_of_a_Man_-_National_Gallery_of_Scotland.jpg|200px|thumb|16th-century painting of a [[civil law notary]], by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]]. A civil law notary is roughly analogous to a common law [[solicitor]], except that, unlike solicitors, civil law notaries do not practice litigation.]]

The [[legal profession]] has its origins in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Although in Greece it was forbidden to take payment for pleading the [[Lawsuit|cause]] of another, the rule was widely flouted. After the time of [[Claudius]], lawyers (''iuris consulti'') could practise openly, although their remuneration was limited. A skilled and regulated profession developed gradually during the late Roman Empire and the [[Byzantine Empire]]: [[advocate]]s acquired more status, and a separate class of [[Notary|notaries]] (''tabelliones'') appeared.

In [[Western Europe]], the legal profession went into decline during the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], re-emerging during the 12th and 13th centuries in the form of experts on [[canon law]]. The profession started to be regulated and to extend its reach to civil as well as ecclesiastical law.

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
The earliest people  who could be described as "lawyers" were probably the [[orators]] of ancient [[Athens]] (see [[History of Athens]]). However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a "friend" for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession&amp;mdash;with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance&amp;mdash;like their modern counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly&amp;mdash;but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90. Crook cites [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' VI, 5 and 7 for this point. For more information about the complex political affair that forced Emperor Claudius to decide this issue, see ''The Annals of Tacitus'', Book VI ([[Franklin Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Center, PA]]: The Franklin Library, 1982), 208.&lt;/ref&gt; This was apparently not much money; the [[Satires of Juvenal]] complain that there was no money in working as an advocate.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Like their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in [[rhetoric]], not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults (''iuris consulti'').&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"&gt;Crook, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby. Advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt; Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so "precise, detailed, and technical."&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt;

During the [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire]], jurisconsults and advocates were unregulated, since the former were amateurs and the latter were technically illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Any citizen could call himself an advocate or a legal expert, though whether people believed him would depend upon his personal reputation. This changed once Claudius legalized the legal profession. By the start of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the legal profession had become well-established, heavily regulated, and highly stratified.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic, and Administrative Survey'', vol. 1 ([[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman, OK]]: University of Oklahoma Press, 1964), 507.&lt;/ref&gt; The centralization and bureaucratization of the profession was apparently gradual at first, but accelerated during the reign of Emperor [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Schulz, ''History of Roman Legal Science'' ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 1946), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the jurisconsults went into decline during the imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Fritz Schulz, "by the fourth century things had changed in the eastern Empire: advocates now were really lawyers."&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by the fourth century, advocates had to be enrolled on the bar of a court to argue before it, they could only be attached to one court at a time, and there were restrictions (which came and went depending upon who was emperor) on how many advocates could be enrolled at a particular court.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 508–510.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 380s, advocates were studying law in addition to rhetoric (thus reducing the need for a separate class of jurisconsults); in 460, [[Leo I the Thracian|Emperor Leo]] imposed a requirement that new advocates seeking admission had to produce testimonials from their teachers; and by the sixth century, a regular course of legal study lasting about four years was required for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 512–513.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius's fee ceiling lasted all the way into the Byzantine period, though by then it was measured at 100 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]].&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"&gt;Jones, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, it was widely evaded, either through demands for maintenance and expenses or a ''sub rosa'' [[barter (economics)|barter]] transaction.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt; The latter was cause for disbarment.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt;

The notaries (''tabelliones'') appeared in the late Roman Empire. Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law notaries, they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"&gt;Jones, 515.&lt;/ref&gt; They were ubiquitous and most villages had one.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; In Roman times, notaries were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jurisconsults.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; Roman notaries were not law-trained; they were often barely literate, with an unfavorable reputation for wrapping simple transactions in mountains of legal jargon, since they were paid by the line.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Pieter Brueghel the Younger - Village Lawyer - WGA3633.jpg|300px|thumb|''Village Lawyer'' by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], 1621 ]]

After the fall of the western Empire and the onset of the Dark Ages, the legal profession of Western Europe collapsed. As James Brundage has explained: "[by 1140], no one in Western Europe could properly be described as a professional lawyer or a professional canonist in anything like the modern sense of the term 'professional.' "&lt;ref&gt;James A. Brundage, "The Rise of the Professional Jurist in the Thirteenth Century," &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;20 Syracuse J. Int'l L. &amp; Com. 185&lt;/span&gt; (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1150 onward, a small but increasing number of men became experts in [[canon law]] but only in furtherance of other occupational goals, such as serving the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as priests.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1190 to 1230, however, there was a crucial shift in which some men began to practice canon law as a lifelong profession in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The legal profession's return was marked by the renewed efforts of church and state to regulate it. In 1231 two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop's courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the papal legate in London in 1237.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same decade, Frederick II, the emperor of the Kingdom of Sicily, imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1250 the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1275 that ''all'' ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"&gt;Brundage, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"/&gt; The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of deceit, and in 1280 the mayor's court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamilton Baker, ''An Introduction to British Legal History'', 3rd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1990), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Typographic Style''', also known as the '''Swiss Style''', is a [[graphic design]] style that emerged in Russia, the Netherlands, and Germany in the 1920s and was developed by designers in [[Switzerland]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lessons From Swiss Style Graphic Design – Smashing Magazine|url = http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/lessons-from-swiss-style-graphic-design/|website = Smashing Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design as a part of the modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1080070/International-Typographic-Style International Typographic Style]&lt;/ref&gt; Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]], [[sans-serif]] typefaces like [[Akzidenz Grotesk]], and [[flush left]], ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured [[typography]] as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Arts &amp; Entertainment: graphic design, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design THE INTERNATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC STYLE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalposter.com/about-poster-art/international-typographic.aspx International Poster Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day.

==History==
The style emerged from a desire to represent information objectively, free from the influence of associated meaning. In 1896 the [[Berthold Type Foundry]] released its [[Akzidenz Grotesk]] Typeface in an attempt to capture an objective style, and from that point the International Typographic style evolved as a modernist graphic movement that sought to convey messages clearly and in a universally straightforward manner. Two major Swiss design schools are responsible for the early years of International Typographic Style. A graphic design technique based on grid-work that began in the 19th century became inspiration for modifying the foundational course at the [[Schule für Gestaltung Basel|Basel School of Design]] in 1908. Shortly thereafter, in 1918 Ernst Keller became a professor at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] and began developing a graphic design and typography course. He did not teach a specific style to his students, rather he taught a philosophy of style that dictated “the solution to the design problem should emerge from its content.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the solution to the design emerging from the problem itself was a reaction to previous artistic processes focused on "beauty for the sake of beauty" or "the creation of beauty as a purpose in and of itself". Keller’s work uses simple geometric forms, vibrant colors and evocative imagery to further elucidate the meaning behind each design. Other early pioneers include Théo Ballmer and [[Max Bill]].

The 1950s saw the distillation of International Typographic Style elements into sans-serif font families such as [[Univers]]. Univers paved the way for [[Max Miedinger]] and collaborator Edouard Hoffman to design the typeface Neue Haas Grotesk, which would be later renamed [[Helvetica]]. The goal with Helvetica was to create a pure typeface that could be applied to longer texts and that was highly readable. The movement began to coalesce after a periodical publication began in 1959 titled New Graphic Design, which was edited by several influential designers who played major roles in the development of International Typographic Style. The format of the journal represented many of the important elements of the style—visually demonstrating the content—and was published internationally, thus spreading the movement beyond Switzerland’s borders. One of the editors, [[Josef Müller-Brockmann]], “sought an absolute and universal form of graphic expression through objective and impersonal presentation, communicating to the audience without the interference of the designer’s subjective feelings or propagandist techniques of persuasion.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Müller-Brockmann’s feature large photographs as objective symbols meant to convey his ideas in particularly clear and powerful ways.

After World War II international trade began to increase and relations between countries grew steadily stronger. Typography and design were crucial to helping these relationships progress—clarity, objectivity, region-less glyphs, and symbols are essential to communication between international partners. International Typographic Style found its niche in this communicative climate and expanded further beyond Switzerland, to America.

One of the first American designers to integrate Swiss design with his own was [[Rudolph de Harak]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of International Typographic Style on de Harak’s own works can be seen in his many book jacket designs for McGraw-Hill publishers in the 1960s. Each jacket shows the book title and author, often aligned with a grid—flush left, ragged-right. One striking image covers most of the jacket, elucidating the theme of the particular book. International Typographic Style was embraced by corporations and institutions in America from the 1960s on, for almost two decades. One institution particularly devoted to the style was [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated movements ==
During 1900s other design based movements were formulating, influencing and influenced by the International Typographic movement. These movements emerged within the relationships between artistic fields including architecture, literature, graphic design, painting, sculpting etc.

[[De Stijl]] was a Dutch artistic movement that saw prominence in the period between 1917-1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = .. :: The International Typographic Style Timeline :: ..|url = http://smearedblackink.com/swiss_style_timeline/|website = smearedblackink.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as neoplasticism, this artistic strategy sought to reflect a new Utopian ideal of spiritual harmony and order. It was a form of pure abstraction through reduction to the essentials of form and colour, employing vertical and horizontal layouts using only black and white and primary colors. Proponents of this movement included painters like [[Piet Mondrian]], Vilmes Huszar and Bart van der Hoff as well as architects like [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff|Robert van't Hoff]] and [[Jacobus_Oud|J.J.P. Oud]].

[[Bauhaus]] was a German-based movement that emphasized purity of geometry, absence of ornamentation and the motto 'form follows function'. This was a school of thought that combined craftsmaking with the fine arts and was founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. The goal was to work towards the essence of the form follows function relationship to facilitate a style that could be applied to all design problems; the International Style.

[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] was an art/architectural philosophy that emerged from Russia in 1920s. The style develops by assorted mechanical objects that are combined into abstract mobile structural forms. Hallmarks of the movement include geometric reduction, photo-montage and simplified palettes.

[[Suprematism]], which arose in 1913, is another Russian art movement similarly focused on the simplification and purity of geometric forms to speak to values of spirituality.

All of these movements including the International Typographic styles are defined by reductionist purity as a visually compelling strategy of conveying messages through geometric and color based hierarchies.

== Notes on theory ==
The Bauhaus mantra of 'form follows function' applies to design in the spirit of the International Typographic movement. The movement was structured by focusing on detail, precision, craft skill, systems of education and approach, technical training, high standards of print and the innovative application of lettering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Swiss Style: The Principles, the Typefaces &amp; the Designers - Print Magazine|url = http://www.printmag.com/typography/swiss-style-principles-typefaces-designers/|website = Print Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory revolves around critically approaching the development of a system specific to the design problem presented.

For example, a father of the style Ernst Keller argued that a design solution should always be respectful of its content.

A good comparison is the structure that defines a math problem. You only use specific equations for specific types of problems. You similarly only can work through these equations in specific ways. With the International Typographic and other related philosophies, a design context is critical to deriving a response.

==Characteristics of style==
Each design done with International Typographic Style in mind begins with a mathematical grid, because a grid is the “most legible and harmonious means for structuring information.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Text is then applied, most often aligned flush left, ragged right. Fonts chosen for the text are sans serif, a type style believed to “[express] the spirit of a more progressive age” by early designers in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Objective photography is another design element meant to present information clearly, and without any of the persuading influences of propaganda or commercial advertising. Such a strong focus on order and clarity is drawn from early pioneers of the movement believing that design is a “socially useful and important activity... the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society.” &lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logos.svg|Left|thumb|[[Greek alphabet|Greek spelling]] of ''logos'']]

'''''Logos''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|ɒ|s|,_|ˈ|l|ɒ|ɡ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|oʊ|s}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]]|lógos}}; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}, {{transl|grc|légō}}, {{Literal translation|'I say'|lk=on}}) is a term in [[Western philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]], and [[religion]] derived from a Greek word variously meaning "ground", "plea", "opinion", "expectation", "word", "speech", "account", "reason", "proportion", and "discourse",&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: logos, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entrys[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; but it became a technical term in [[Western philosophy]] beginning with [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa| 535| 475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Heraclitus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' is the logic behind an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html |title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos |last=Butler|first=S|website=members.tripod.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' tries to persuade an audience using [[logical argument]]s and supportive evidence. ''Logos'' is a persuasive technique often used in writing and rhetoric.

Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The [[sophist]]s used the term to mean [[discourse]]; [[Aristotle]] applied the term to refer to "reasoned discourse"&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"/&gt; or "the argument" in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] alongside ''[[ethos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/ Aristotle's Rhetoric]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers identified the term with the [[divine]] animating principle pervading the Universe. Within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], [[Philo of Alexandria]] ({{Circa| 20&amp;nbsp;BC| 50&amp;nbsp;AD}}) adopted the term into [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Philo Judaeus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] identifies the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], through which all things are made, as divine (''[[God|theos]]''),&lt;ref name = "May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and further identifies [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[incarnate]] Logos. The term is also used in [[Sufism]], and the analytical psychology of [[Carl Jung]].

Despite the conventional translation as "word", it is not used for a [[word]] in the grammatical sense; instead, the term ''lexis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέξις|λέξις]]}}, {{transl|grc|léxis}}) was used.&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: lexis, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both ''logos'' and ''lexis'' derive from the same verb {{transl|grc|légō}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}), meaning  "(I) count, tell, say, speak".&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlego"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw2 ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: legō, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a "premise". She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor's backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different "premises" that the [[rhetor]] applies via his or her chosen diction.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor's success, she argues, will come down to "certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience". "Logos is logical appeal, and the term logic is derived from it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's topic."&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle's Three Modes of Persuasion in Rhetoric|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/ESSENES/aristotles_modes_of_persuasion_in_rhetoric.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, logos is credited with appealing to the audience's sense of logic, with the definition of "logic" being concerned with the thing as it is known.&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"/&gt;
Furthermore, one can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways.  The first is through [[inductive reasoning]], providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is through [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[enthymeme]], providing the audience with general scenarios and then indicating commonalities among them.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"/&gt;

Philo distinguished between ''logos prophorikos'' ("the uttered word") and the ''logos endiathetos'' ("the word remaining within").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adam Kamesar|title=The ''Logos Endiathetos'' and the ''Logos Prophorikos'' in Allegorical Interpretation: Philo and the D-Scholia to the ''Iliad'' |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501000000*/https://web.duke.edu/classics/grbs/FTexts/44/Kamesar.pdf |journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies (GRBS)|volume=44|year=2004|pages=163–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] also spoke of the ''[[logos spermatikos]]'' (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L. Jeffrey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD6xVr1CizIC&amp;pg=PA459&amp;dq=Neoplatonism+logos#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20prophorikos%20the%20uttered%20word%20and%20the%20logos%20endiathetos%20the%20word%20remaining%20within&amp;f=false |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA|publisher=Wm.

Eerdmans Publishing Co|year=1992|isbn=0-8028-3634-8|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early translators of the Greek [[New Testament]] such as [[Jerome]] (in the 4th century AD) were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the meaning of the word ''Logos'' as used to describe Jesus Christ in the [[Gospel of John]]. The [[Vulgate]] Bible usage of {{lang|la|in principio erat verbum}} was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun {{lang|la|verbum}} for "word", but later [[Romance language]] translations had the advantage of nouns such as {{lang|fr|le mot}} in French. Reformation translators took another approach. [[Martin Luther]] rejected {{lang|de|Zeitwort}} (verb) in favor of {{lang|de|Wort}} (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving ''the living word'' as felt by Jerome and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==

===Heraclitus===
{{Further|Heraclitus#Logos}}
The writing of [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa|535|475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}})&lt;!---maintain consistency throughout article re: BC vs. BCE---&gt; was the first place where the word ''logos'' was given special attention in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962, pp. 419ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heraclitus, ''logos'' provided the link between rational discourse and the world's rational structure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to ever understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.|[[Diels–Kranz]]|22B1}}

{{quote|For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the ''logos'' is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.|Diels–Kranz|22B2}}

{{quote|Listening not to me but to the ''logos'' it is wise to agree that all things are one.|Diels–Kranz|22B50&lt;ref&gt;Translations from Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Hackett, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What ''logos'' means here is not certain; it may mean "reason" or "explanation" in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than "saying" or "wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;''Handboek geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte 1'', Article by Jaap Mansveld &amp; Keimpe Algra, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, an independent existence of a universal ''logos'' was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie, ''The Greek Philosophers: From Thales to Aristotle'', Methuen, 1967, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle identifies two specific types of persuasion methods: artistic and inartistic.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering the Arguments: Artistic and Inartistic Proofs|url=http://www.classicalwriting.com/blog/2010/01/12/discovering-the-arguments-artistic-and-inartistic-proofs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines artistic proofs as arguments that the [[rhetor]] generates and creates on their own. Examples of these include  relationships, testimonies, and conjugates. He defines inartistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor quotes using information from a non-self-generated source. Examples of these include laws, contracts, and [[oath]]s.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"/&gt;

===Aristotle's rhetorical logos===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|Aristotle, 384–322 BC.]]
Following one of the other meanings of the word, [[Aristotle]] gave ''logos'' a different technical definition in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]]. The other two modes are ''[[pathos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθος|πᾰ́θος]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthos}}), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, "putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind";&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', in Patricia P. Matsen, Philip B. Rollinson, and Marion Sousa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3iLyz9zd7cC&amp;pg=PA120 Readings from Classical Rhetoric]'', SIU Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8093-1592-0}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[ethos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἦθος|ἦθος]]}}, {{transl|grc|êthos}}), persuasion through convincing listeners of one's "moral character".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt; According to Aristotle, ''logos'' relates to "the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html translation by W. Rhys Roberts], this reads "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself".&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Paul Rahe:

{{Quote|For Aristotle, ''logos'' is something more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it makes it possible for him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between what is advantageous and what is harmful, between what is just and what is unjust, and between what is good and what is evil.&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"&gt;Paul Anthony Rahe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&amp;pg=PA21 Republics Ancient and Modern: The Ancien Régime in Classical Greece]'', University of North Carolina Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-8078-4473-X}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'' can all be appropriate at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Garver, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoXnLHQ5mgwC&amp;pg=PA114 Aristotle's Rhetoric: An art of character]'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-226-28424-7}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that [[data]] are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument; and such arguments make the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing ''ethos''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through ''ethos''—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.&lt;ref&gt;Garver, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wardy]] suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of ''logos'' "is not emotional appeal [[Per se (Latin)|per se]], but rather emotional appeals that have no 'bearing on the issue', in that the ''pathē'' [{{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθη|πᾰ́θη]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthē}}] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an [[antisemitic]] audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners's reverential feelings for the politician's ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wardy, "Mighty Is the Truth and It Shall Prevail?", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QkIn37h_TMUC&amp;pg=PA64 Essays on Aristotle's Rhetoric]'', Amélie Rorty (ed), University of California Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-520-20228-7}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle comments on the three modes by stating: 
{{Quote|Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. ... Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. ... Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions. ... Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.{{whose translation}}|Aristotle|''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''|350&amp;nbsp;BC}}

===Stoics===
[[Stoic philosophy]] began with [[Zeno of Citium]] {{Circa|300&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}, in which the ''logos'' was the active [[reason]] pervading and animating the [[Universe]]. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with [[God]] or [[Nature]]. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal logos'' ("''[[logos spermatikos]]''"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos''.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics took all activity to imply a ''logos'' or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the ''logos'' was ''[[anima mundi]]'' to them, a concept which later influenced [[Philo of Alexandria]], although he derived the contents of the term from Plato.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUF15rypDscC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Anima+mundi+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jwl8TP_xI8KSjAfUm-jSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anima%20mundi%20logos&amp;f=false ''Studies in European Philosophy''], by James Lindsay, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4067-0173-4}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that "''Logos'' ... had long been one of the leading terms of [[Stoicism]], chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isocrates' logos===
Public discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle's appeals to ''logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'', while less attention has been directed to [[Isocrates]]' teachings about philosophy and ''logos'',&lt;ref name="David M 2010"&gt;David M. Timmerman and [[Edward Schiappa]], ''Classical Greek Rhetorical Theory and the Disciplining of Discourse'' (London: Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010): 43–66&lt;/ref&gt; and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful ''[[polis]]''. Isocrates does not provide a single definition of ''logos'' in his work, but Isocratean ''logos'' characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt; He was concerned with establishing the "common good" of [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of ''logos''.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt;

==In Hellenistic Judaism==
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
In the [[Septuagint]] the term ''logos'' is used for the word of God in the creation of heaven in Psalm 33:6, and in some related contexts.

===Philo of Alexandria===
[[Philo]] ({{Circa|20&amp;nbsp;BC|50&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}), a [[Hellenized Jew]], used the term Logos to mean an intermediary divine being or [[demiurge]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"/&gt; Philo followed the Platonic distinction between [[Hylic|imperfect matter]] and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"&gt;[[Frederick Copleston]], ''A History of Philosophy'', Volume 1, Continuum, 2003, pp. 458–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Logos'' was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo "the first-born of God".&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;
Philo also wrote that "the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''De Profugis'', cited in [https://archive.org/details/hellenismchristi00frieiala Gerald Friedlander, ''Hellenism and Christianity'', P. Vallentine, 1912, pp. 114–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato's Theory of Forms]] was located within the Logos, but the Logos also acted on behalf of God in the physical world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt; In particular, the [[Angel of the Lord]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Old Testament]]) was identified with the Logos by Philo, who also said that the Logos was God's instrument in the creation of the Universe.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}
[[File:Prologus Ioanni Vulgata Clementina.jpg|thumb|''In principio erat verbum'', [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for ''In the beginning was the Word'', from the [[Clementine Vulgate]], [[Gospel of John]], 1:1–18.]]
In [[Christology]], the ''Logos'' ({{lang-el|Λόγος|lit='Word", "Discourse", or "Reason'}})&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is a name or title of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], seen as the pre-existent second [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)#Christian_theology|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. The concept derives from [[John 1:1]], which in the [[Douay–Rheims]], [[King James Version|King James]], [[New International Version|New International]], and other versions of the [[Bible]], reads:
{{quote|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the translations, "Word" is used for Λόγος, although the term is often used [[transliterated]] but untranslated in theological discourse.
The Koine Greek reads, "Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν '''πρὸς τὸν θεόν''', '''καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος'''.(En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên ''pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos''.) The definite article is used with 'theos/god', making it 'God', and the second usage is indefinite (without an article), rendering it 'god'. Thus David Bentley Hart translates it as 'In the origin there was the Logos, and the Logos was present with GOD, and the Logos was god'.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart. ''The New Testament: A Translation''. Yale, 2017, ISBN 0-978-0-300-18609-3, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many ancient Greek scholars, including Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature) explains that concepts of definite articles in English and Koine Greek are not similar: "In the New World Translation the opening verse of the Gospel according to John is mistranslated as follows: “Originally the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” A footnote which is added to the first word, “Originally,” reads, “Literally, In (At) a beginning.” By using here the indefinite article “a” the translators have overlooked the well-known fact that in Greek grammar nouns may be definite for various reasons, whether or not the Greek definite article is present. A prepositional phrase, for example, where the definite article is not expressed, can be quite definite in Greek, [in Hebrew 10:31, "εις χειρας θεου ζωντος" is properly rendered (even by the New World Translation) with the definite article expressed twice, “into the hands of the living God.”] as in fact it is in John 1:1"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|date=April 1953|title=The Jehovah'S Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004057365301000110|journal=Theology Today|volume=10|pages=65-85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=729|title=WHAT GREEK SCHOLARS REALLY THINK!|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letusreason.org/jw38.htm|title=The dispute on Jn.1:1|last=|first=|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhema==
The word ''logos'' has been used in different senses along with ''[[rhema]]''. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] used the term ''logos'' along with ''rhema'' to refer to sentences and propositions.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P.

==Neoplatonism==
[[File:Plotinus and disciples.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Plotinus]] with his disciples.]]
[[Neoplatonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] ({{Circa|204/5|lk=on}}{{snd}}270&amp;nbsp;AD) used the term "Logos" in ways that drew on Plato and the [[Stoics]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Wagner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZJMzbtNFNsC&amp;pg=PA116 Neoplatonism and Nature: Studies in Plotinus' Enneads]'', Volume 8 of ''Studies in Neoplatonism'', SUNY Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7914-5271-9}}, pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term Logos was interpreted in different ways throughout Neoplatonism, and similarities to Philo's concept of Logos appear to be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Rist, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n49OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Plotinus: The road to reality]'', Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-06085-0}}, pp. 84–101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Logos was a key element in the [[meditation]]s of Plotinus&lt;ref&gt;''Between Physics and Nous: Logos as Principle of Meditation in Plotinus'', The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, 1999, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first Neoplatonist. Plotinus referred back to [[Heraclitus]] and as far back as [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Carlos Steel&lt;/ref&gt; in interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, existing as the interrelationship between the [[hypostases]]—the [[soul]], the intellect (''[[nous]]''), and the [[Monad (philosophy)|One]].&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, Institute of Global Cultural Studies, Binghamton University, 1999, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of "The One", the "Spirit", and "Soul". The comparison with the Christian [[Trinity]] is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and "The One" was at the highest level, with the "Soul" at the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcg83ynsJEwC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=plotinus+trinity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Is18TLriMt6U4gakq5CGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=plotinus%20trinity&amp;f=false] ''Ancient philosophy'' by Anthony Kenny 2007 {{ISBN|0-19-875272-5}} p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of Logos from the higher principle, and ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' (loving) upward from the lower principle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Enneads'' by Plotinus, [[Stephen MacKenna]], John M.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Logos (Islam)}}
The concept of the ''logos'' also exists in [[Islam]], where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical [[Sunni]] [[Sufism|mystics]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], as well as by certain [[Shi'a]] thinkers, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L., "Kalām", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., "ʿAḳl", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sunni Islam]], the concept of the ''logos'' has been given many different names by the denomination's [[metaphysician]]s, mystics, and philosophers, including ''ʿaql'' ("Intellect"), ''al-insān al-kāmil'' ("Universal Man"), ''kalimat Allāh'' ("Word of God"), ''haqīqa muḥammadiyya'' ("The Muhammadan Reality"), and ''nūr muḥammadī'' ("The Muhammadan Light").

===''ʿAql''===
One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is ''ʿaql'', which is the "Arabic equivalent to the Greek {{lang|grc|[[nous|νοῦς]]}} ('intellect')."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; In the writings of the Islamic [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers, such as [[al-Farabi]] ({{Circa|872|950&amp;nbsp;AD}}) and [[Avicenna]] (d. 1037),&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; the idea of the ''ʿaql'' was presented in a manner that both resembled "the late Greek doctrine" and, likewise, "corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

The concept of Logos in Sufism is used to relate the "Uncreated" (God) to the "Created" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the Logos. The Logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is "unique" within each region. [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] are seen as the personifications of the Logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism: love &amp; wisdom'' by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 {{ISBN|0-941532-75-5}} p. 242 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVt-EvXnEC4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BMNQNOHXKOMC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false ''Sufi essays''] by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973{{ ISBN|0-87395-233-2}} p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works ''The Ringstones of Wisdom'' (''Fusus al-Hikam'') and ''The Meccan Illuminations'' (''Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya''). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a Logos ([[Kalimah]]), as an aspect of the unique Divine Being. In his view the Divine Being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with Logos providing the link between man and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 39 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the Logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Frazee, "Ibn al-'Arabī and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century", ''Numen'' '''14''' (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229–40.&lt;/ref&gt; although (writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Little |first=John T. |last2= |first2= |date=January 1987 |title=AL-INSĀN AL-KĀMIL: THE PERFECT MAN ACCORDING TO IBN AL-'ARAB? |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x/abstract |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote="Ibn al-'Arabi uses no less than twenty-two different terms to describe the various aspects under which this single Logos may be viewed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobie  |first=Robert J. |date=17 November 2009 |title=Logos and Revelation: Ibn 'Arabi, Meister Eckhart, and Mystical Hermeneutics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWVwT3UpthUC&amp;pg=PA225 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Catholic University of America Press  |page=225 |isbn= 081321677X |quote="For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Henry Whinfield]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0vHUo0wnlgC&amp;pg=PR25 Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maulána Jalálu-'d-Dín Muhammad Rúmí]'', Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), {{ISBN|0-415-24531-1}}, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī]] introduced the ''Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man''. For al-Jīlī, the "perfect man" (associated with the Logos or the Holy Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 98 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jili&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (Logos-''Kalima'') in his ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'') in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, ''Sühan'' appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Betül Avcı, "Character of ''Sühan'' in Şeyh Gâlib’s Romance, ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'')" ''Archivum Ottomanicum'', 32 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2018}}

==Jung's analytical psychology==
[[File:Carl Jung (1912).png|thumb|150px|A 37-year-old [[Carl Jung]] in 1912.]]
[[Carl Jung]] contrasted the critical and rational faculties of logos with the emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements of ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;''C.G. Jung and the psychology of symbolic forms'' by Petteri Pietikäinen 2001 {{ISBN|951-41-0857-4}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's approach, logos vs eros can be represented as "science vs mysticism", or "reason vs imagination" or "conscious activity vs the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;''Mythos and logos in the thought of Carl Jung'' by Walter A. Shelburne 1988 {{ISBN|0-88706-693-3}} p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yV-ZE8pyZjkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jung, logos represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its female counterpart, ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]'':

{{Quote|Woman’s psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung attempted to equate logos and eros, his intuitive conceptions of masculine and feminine consciousness, with the [[alchemical]] Sol and Luna. Jung commented that in a man the lunar [[Anima and animus|anima]] and in a woman the solar [[Anima and animus|animus]] has the greatest influence on consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=jung+eros+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3CR5TLn_IqiM4gbNvYSUBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=jung%20eros%20logos&amp;f=false ''Aspects of the masculine'' by Carl Gustav Jung, John Beebe p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung often proceeded to analyze situations in terms of "paired opposites", e.g. by using the analogy with the eastern [[yin and yang]]&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Gustav Jung: critical assessments'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 1992 {{ISBN|0-415-04830-3}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and was also influenced by the Neoplatonists.&lt;ref&gt;See the Neoplatonic section above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' Jung made some important final remarks about anima and animus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In so far as the spirit is also a kind of "window on eternity"... it conveys to the soul a certain influx divinus... and the knowledge of a higher system of the world, wherein consists precisely its supposed animation of the soul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in this book Jung again emphasized that the animus compensates eros, while the anima compensates logos.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of Jungian psychology: theory, practice and applications'' by Renos K.

'''Manfred Rühl''' (born 1933, [[Nürnberg]]) is a German professor emeritus for [[communications]] at the [[University of Bamberg]], a leading communication theorist,&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Rühl (2008):  Kommunikationskulturen der Weltgesellschaft. Theorie der Kommunikationswissenschaft. Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften Wiesbaden, {{ISBN|978-3-531-14063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; an original and productive researcher in [[journalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Journalismustheorie]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[public relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz Ronneberger &amp; Manfred Rühl (1992): Theorie der Public Relations. Ein Entwurf. Westdeutscher Verlag Opladen, {{ISBN|3-531-12118-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

From 1956 onwards he studied [[economics]], communications, [[sociology]], [[political science]], and [[philosophy]] at the [[University]] of [[Erlangen]], [[Free University of Berlin]], and [[Nürnberg]] [[College]] of [[Economics]] and [[Social Sciences]]. In 1960, he graduated with a diploma in economics at the [[Nürnberg]] [[College]] of [[Economics]] and [[Social Sciences]]. In 1968, he received a doctorate in [[social sciences]], and in 1978, he qualified with a [[habilitation]] for communications, both at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]]

In 1964, Rühl started to work as an Assistant Professor at the [[Institute]] for [[Political]] and [[Communication Sciences]] of the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]]. From 1969 to 1970, with a postgraduate fellowship, he was Scholar in Residence at the  [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]]. He is or was Research Professor at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] (1971-1976), Associate Professor at the [[University of Hohenheim]] (1976-1983), and Full Professor at the [[University of Bamberg]] (since 1983), also frequently a visiting professor at the [[universities]] of [[Mainz]] and [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;* CV Manfred Rühl (http://www.uni-bamberg.de/kowi/personen-einrichtungen/manfred-ruehl-emeritus/)&lt;/ref&gt;

A founding member in 1963, Rühl served as President of the [[DGPuK - Deutsche Gesellschaft für Publizistik- und Kommunikationswissenschaft]] (1980-1982),&lt;ref&gt;*http://www.dgpuk.de/&lt;/ref&gt; and as a Member-at-Large at the Board of Directors, ICA - [[International Communication Association]] (1977-1980).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icahdq.org/&lt;/ref&gt; He reviewed for many institutions and journals from DFG - [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], [[AvH]] - [[Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung]], DAAD - [[Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst]], [[SNSF]] - [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] to [[Publizistik]], [[Medien &amp; Kommunikationswissenschaft]], [[Journalism Quarterly]], and [[Journal of Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;* CV Manfred Rühl (http://www.uni-bamberg.de/kowi/personen-einrichtungen/manfred-ruehl-emeritus/)&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Rühl's research interests span [[systems theory]], [[comparative]] [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]], [[communication theory]], communication policy, public communication, [[journalism]], [[public relations]], [[organizational communication]], and [[Market (economics)|market]] communication. [[Communication systems]] have become one of the most popular, "non-normative" and "non-linear" theoretical models in contemporary communications.&lt;ref&gt;Betteke van Ruler, Ana Tkalac Verčič and Dejan Verčič, eds. (2008): Public relations metrics: Research and evaluation. New York, London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Rühl's work marked a radical change in perspective, when he conducted since the 1960s [[empirical]] studies of [[journalism]] that focused on an organized social system instead of journalistic individuals, based on [[communication]] instead of action or behavior, but on communication as a reality that occurs within differing systems and environments. Within his reference theoretical framework, public]] [[communication]] is studied as applied [[organizational communication]], market communication, and [[societal]] [[communication]] as journalism, public relations, and other systems of persuasion and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]]. In the course of recent decades, many scholars, particularly in the German speaking countries adapted his approaches and developed them further.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Löffelholz and David Weaver (2008): Global Journalism Research.

'''Metanoia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μετάνοια}}, ''metanoia'', ''changing one's mind'') in the context of [[rhetoric]] is a device used to retract a statement just made, and then state it in a better way.&lt;ref name="meta1"&gt;Silva Rhetoricae (2006). [http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/metanoeia.htm Metanoeia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117043043/http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/metanoeia.htm |date=2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, metanoia is similar to correction. Metanoia is used in recalling a statement in two ways—-to weaken the prior declaration or to strengthen it.

Metanoia is later personified as a figure accompanying [[kairos]], sometimes as a hag and sometimes as a young lady. Ausonius' epigrams describe her thus: "I am a goddess to whom even Cicero himself did not give a name. I am the goddess who exacts punishment for what has and has not been done, so that people regret it. Hence my name is Metanoea." &lt;ref&gt; Qtd. in Myers, Kelly A. "Metanoia and the Transformation of Opportunity" RSA 41.1 pp1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weakening==

The use of metanoia to weaken a statement is effective because the original statement still stands, along with the qualifying statement.&lt;ref name="meta2"&gt;VirtualSalt.com (2006). [http://www.virtualsalt.com/rhetoric.htm#Metanoia A Handbook of Rhetorical Devices]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when one says, "I will murder you. You shall be punished," the force of the original statement ("I will murder you") remains, while a more realistic alternative has been put forward ("you shall be punished").

==Strengthening==

When it is used to strengthen a statement, metanoia works to ease the reader from a moderate statement to a more radical one, as in this quote from [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing
the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions (Book One);&lt;ref name="meta3"&gt;The Internet Classics Archive (2006). [http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.mb.txt The Meditations]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Aurelius utilizes metanoia to move from a mild idea ("not observing the admonitions of the gods") to a more intense one ("not observing... their direct instructions"); the clause "I may almost say" introduces the metanoia.

In art and [[iconography]], a '''motif''' {{Audio|en-us-motif.ogg|(pronunciation)}} is an element of an [[image]].  A motif may be repeated in a [[pattern]] or design, often many times, or may just occur once in a work.&lt;ref name=LatinArt&gt;{{cite web |title=Art glossary |url=http://www.latinart.com/glossary.cfm?sort=M |publisher=LatinArt.com |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of motif==

A motif may be an element in the iconography of a particular subject or type of subject that is seen in other works, or may form the main subject, as the [[Master of Animals]] motif in ancient art typically does. The related motif of [[confronted animals]] is often seen alone, but may also be repeated, for example in [[Byzantine silk]] and other ancient textiles.  Where the main subject of an artistic work such as a painting is a specific person, group, or moment in a narrative, that should be referred to as the "subject" of the work, not a motif, though the same thing may be a "motif" when part of another subject, or part of a work of [[decorative art]] such as a painting on a vase.

[[Ornament (art)|Ornament]]al or [[decorative art]] can usually be analysed into a number of different elements, which can be called motifs. These may often, as in [[Fiber art|textile art]], be repeated many times in a pattern. Important examples in Western art include [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]], [[egg and dart]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucy T. Shoe, ''Profiles of Greek Mouldings'' 1936, supplemented by Shoe, "Greek Mouldings of Kos and Rhodes", ''Hesperia'' '''19'''.4 (October - December 1950:338-369 and illustrations)&lt;/ref&gt; and various types of [[scrollwork]].

[[File:Elibelinde2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elibelinde]] [[kilim motifs]], symbolising [[fertility]]]]

Many designs in [[Islamic culture]] are motifs, including those of the sun, moon, animals such as horses and lions, flowers, and landscapes. Motifs can have emotional effects and be used for propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctc.usma.edu/pdf/CTC%20--%20Islamic%20Imagery%20Project.pdf Motifs in Jihadi Internet Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[kilim]] flatwoven carpets, [[kilim motifs|motifs]] such as the hands-on-hips [[elibelinde]] are woven in to the design to express the hopes and concerns of the weavers: the elibelinde symbolises the female principle and [[fertility]], including the desire for children.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A. S. Edition=1st |date=1998 |pages=4–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IntegrityBarnstar.png|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Dutch]] motif known as a [[hex sign]]]]
Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs are a familiar type of motif in the eastern portions of the United States. Their circular and symmetric design, and their use of brightly colored patterns from nature, such as stars, compass roses, doves, hearts, tulips, leaves, and feathers have made them quite popular. In some parts of Pennsylvania Dutch country, it is common to see these designs decorating barns and covered bridges.

The idea of a motif has become used more broadly in discussing [[literature]] and other narrative arts for [[Motif (narrative)|an element in the story]] that represents a [[theme (arts)|theme]].&lt;ref name="Grayson"&gt;James H.

'''Multi-disciplinary design optimization''' ('''MDO''') is a field of [[engineering]] that uses [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods to solve [[design]] problems incorporating a number of disciplines. It is also known as multidisciplinary optimization and multidisciplinary system design optimization (MSDO).

MDO allows designers to incorporate all relevant disciplines simultaneously.  The optimum of the simultaneous problem is superior to the design found by optimizing each discipline sequentially, since it can exploit the interactions between the disciplines.  However, including all disciplines simultaneously significantly increases the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of the problem.

These techniques have been used in a number of fields, including [[automobile]] design, [[naval architecture]], [[electronics]], [[architecture]], [[computer]]s, and [[electricity distribution]].  However, the largest number of applications have been in the field of [[aerospace engineering]], such as [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] design.  For example, the proposed [[Boeing]] [[blended wing body]] (BWB) aircraft concept has used MDO extensively in the conceptual and preliminary design stages.  The disciplines considered in the BWB design are [[aerodynamics]], [[structural analysis]], [[Air propulsion|propulsion]], [[control theory]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Traditionally engineering has normally been performed by teams, each with expertise in a specific discipline, such as aerodynamics or structures.  Each team would use its members' experience and judgement to develop a workable design, usually sequentially.  For example, the aerodynamics experts would outline the shape of the body, and the structural experts would be expected to fit their design within the shape specified.  The goals of the teams were generally performance-related, such as maximum speed, minimum [[drag (physics)|drag]], or minimum structural weight.

Between 1970 and 1990, two major developments in the aircraft industry changed the approach of aircraft design engineers to their design problems.  The first was [[computer-aided design]], which allowed designers to quickly modify and analyse their designs.  The second was changes in the procurement policy of most [[airline]]s and military organizations, particularly the [[military of the United States]], from a performance-centred approach to one that emphasized [[Product lifecycle management|lifecycle]] cost issues.  This led to an increased concentration on economic factors and the attributes known as the "[[ilities]]" including [[manufacturability]], [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]], [[maintainability]], etc.

Since 1990, the techniques have expanded to other industries.  Globalization has resulted in more distributed, decentralized design teams.  The high-performance [[personal computer]] has largely replaced the centralized [[supercomputer]] and the [[Internet]] and [[local area network]]s have facilitated sharing of design information. Disciplinary design software in many disciplines (such as [[OptiStruct]] or [[NASTRAN]], a [[finite element analysis]] program for structural design) have become very mature.  In addition, many optimization algorithms, in particular the population-based algorithms, have advanced significantly.

=== Origins in structural optimization ===
Whereas optimization methods are nearly as old as [[calculus]], dating back to [[Isaac Newton]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who used them to solve problems such as the shape of the [[catenary]] curve, numerical optimization reached prominence in the digital age. Its systematic application to structural design dates to its advocacy by Schmit in 1960. The success of structural optimization in the 1970s motivated the emergence of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) in the 1980s. Jaroslaw Sobieski championed decomposition methods specifically designed for MDO applications. The following synopsis focuses on optimization methods for MDO. First, the popular gradient-based methods used by the early structural optimization and MDO community are reviewed. Then those methods developed in the last dozen years are summarized.

=== Gradient-based methods ===
There were two schools of structural optimization practitioners using [[Gradient|gradient]]-based methods during the 1960s and 1970s: optimality criteria and [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]]. The optimality criteria school derived recursive formulas based on the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions]] for an optimal design. The KKT conditions were applied to classes of structural problems such as minimum weight design with constraints on stresses, displacements, buckling, or frequencies [Rozvany, Berke, Venkayya, Khot, et al.] to derive resizing expressions particular to each class. The mathematical programming school employed classical gradient-based methods to structural optimization problems. The method of usable feasible directions, Rosen’s gradient projection (generalized reduce gradient) method, sequential unconstrained minimization techniques, sequential linear programming and eventually sequential quadratic programming methods were common choices. Schittkowski et al. reviewed the methods current by the early 1990s.

The gradient methods unique to the MDO community derive from the combination of optimality criteria with math programming, first recognized in the seminal work of Fleury and Schmit who constructed a framework of approximation concepts for structural optimization. They recognized that optimality criteria were so successful for stress and displacement constraints, because that approach amounted to solving the dual problem for [[Lagrange multipliers]] using linear Taylor series approximations in the reciprocal design space. In combination with other techniques to improve efficiency, such as constraint deletion, regionalization, and design variable linking, they succeeded in uniting the work of both schools. This approximation concepts based approach forms the basis of the optimization modules in modern structural design software such as Altair – Optistruct, ASTROS, MSC.Nastran, PHX [[ModelCenter]], Genesis, iSight, and I-DEAS.

Approximations for structural optimization were initiated by the reciprocal approximation Schmit and Miura for stress and displacement response functions. Other intermediate variables were employed for plates. Combining linear and reciprocal variables, Starnes and Haftka developed a conservative approximation to improve buckling approximations. Fadel chose an appropriate intermediate design variable for each function based on a gradient matching condition for the previous point. Vanderplaats initiated a second generation of high quality approximations when he developed the force approximation as an intermediate response approximation to improve the approximation of stress constraints. Canfield developed a [[Rayleigh quotient]] approximation to improve the accuracy of eigenvalue approximations. Barthelemy and Haftka published a comprehensive review of approximations in 1993.

=== Non-gradient-based methods  ===
In recent years, non-gradient-based evolutionary methods including [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]], [[Simulated annealing|simulated annealing]], and [[Ant colony optimization algorithms|ant colony algorithms]] came into existence. At present, many researchers are striving to arrive at a consensus regarding the best modes and methods for complex problems like impact damage, dynamic failure, and [[Real-time analyzer|real-time analyses]]. For this purpose, researchers often employ multiobjective and multicriteria design methods.

=== Recent MDO methods ===
MDO practitioners have investigated [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods in several broad areas in the last dozen years. These include decomposition methods, [[approximation]] methods, [[evolutionary algorithm]]s, [[memetic algorithm]]s, [[response surface methodology]], reliability-based optimization, and [[multi-objective optimization]] approaches.

The exploration of decomposition methods has continued in the last dozen years with the development and comparison of a number of approaches, classified variously as hierarchic and non hierarchic, or collaborative and non collaborative. 
Approximation methods spanned a diverse set of approaches, including the development of approximations based on [[surrogate model]]s (often referred to as metamodels), variable fidelity models, and trust region management strategies. The development of multipoint approximations blurred the distinction with response surface methods. Some of the most popular methods include [[Kriging]] and the [[moving least squares]] method.

[[Response surface methodology]], developed extensively by the statistical community, received much attention in the MDO community in the last dozen years. A driving force for their use has been the development of massively parallel systems for high performance computing, which are naturally suited to distributing the function evaluations from multiple disciplines that are required for the construction of response surfaces. Distributed processing is particularly suited to the design process of complex systems in which analysis of different disciplines may be accomplished naturally on different computing platforms and even by different teams.

Evolutionary methods led the way in the exploration of non-gradient methods for MDO applications. They also have benefited from the availability of massively parallel high performance computers, since they inherently require many more function evaluations than gradient-based methods. Their primary benefit lies in their ability to handle discrete design variables and the potential to find globally optimal solutions.

Reliability-based optimization (RBO) is a growing area of interest in MDO. Like response surface methods and evolutionary algorithms, RBO benefits from parallel computation, because the numeric integration to calculate the probability of failure requires many function evaluations. One of the first approaches employed approximation concepts to integrate the probability of failure. The classical first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM) are still popular. Professor Ramana Grandhi used appropriate normalized variables about the most probable point of failure, found by a two-point adaptive nonlinear approximation to improve the accuracy and efficiency. [[Southwest Research Institute]] has figured prominently in the development of RBO, implementing state-of-the-art reliability methods in commercial software. RBO has reached sufficient maturity to appear in commercial structural analysis programs like Altair's [[OptiStruct|Optistruct]] and MSC's [[Nastran]].

Utility-based probability maximization (Bordley and Pollock, Operations Research, Sept, 2009, pg.1262) was developed in response to some logical concerns (e.g., Blau's Dilemma) with reliability-based design optimization. This approach focuses on maximizing the joint probability of both the objective function exceeding some value and of all the constraints being satisfied.  When there is no objective function, utility-based probability maximization reduces to a probability-maximization problem.   When there are no uncertainties in the constraints, it reduces to a constrained utility-maximization problem.  (This second equivalence arises because the utility of a function can always be written as the probability of that function exceeding some random variable.)   Because it changes the constrained optimization problem associated with reliability-based optimization into an unconstrained optimization problem, it often leads to computationally more tractable problem formulations.

In the marketing field there is a huge literature about optimal design for multiattribute products and services, based on experimental analysis to estimate models of consumers' utility functions. These methods are known as [[Conjoint analysis|Conjoint Analysis]]. Respondents are presented with alternative products, measuring preferences about the alternatives using a variety of scales and the utility function is estimated with different methods (varying from regression and surface response methods to choice models). The best design is formulated after estimating the model. The experimental design is usually optimized to minimize the variance of the estimators. These methods are widely used in practice.

==Problem formulation==

Problem formulation is normally the most difficult part of the process.  It is the selection of design variables, constraints, objectives, and models of the disciplines.  A further consideration is the strength and breadth of the interdisciplinary coupling in the problem.

===Design variables===

A design variable is a specification that is controllable from the point of view of the designer.  For instance, the thickness of a structural member can be considered a design variable.  Another might be the choice of material.  Design variables can be continuous (such as a wing span), discrete (such as the number of ribs in a wing), or boolean (such as whether to build a monoplane or a [[biplane]]).  Design problems with continuous variables are normally solved more easily.

Design variables are often bounded, that is, they often have maximum and minimum values.  Depending on the solution method, these bounds can be treated as constraints or separately.

One of the important variables that needs to be accounted is an uncertainty. Uncertainty, often referred to as epistemic uncertainty, arises due to lack of knowledge or incomplete information. Uncertainty is essentially unknown variable but it may causes the failure of system.

===Constraints===

A constraint is a condition that must be satisfied in order for the design to be feasible.  An example of a constraint in aircraft design is that the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by a wing must be equal to the weight of the aircraft.  In addition to physical laws, constraints can reflect resource limitations, user requirements, or bounds on the validity of the analysis models.  Constraints can be used explicitly by the solution algorithm or can be incorporated into the objective using [[Lagrange multiplier]]s.

===Objectives===

An objective is a numerical value that is to be maximized or minimized.  For example, a designer may wish to maximize profit or minimize weight.  Many solution methods work only with single objectives.  When using these methods, the designer normally weights the various objectives and sums them to form a single objective.  Other methods allow multiobjective optimization, such as the calculation of a [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto front]].

===Models===

The designer must also choose models to relate the constraints and the objectives to the design variables.  These models are dependent on the discipline involved.  They may be empirical models, such as a [[regression analysis]] of aircraft prices, theoretical models, such as from [[computational fluid dynamics]], or reduced-order models of either of these.  In choosing the models the designer must trade off fidelity with analysis time.

The multidisciplinary nature of most design problems complicates model choice and implementation.  Often several iterations are necessary between the disciplines in order to find the values of the objectives and constraints.  As an example, the aerodynamic loads on a wing affect the structural deformation of the wing.  The structural deformation in turn changes the shape of the wing and the aerodynamic loads.  Therefore, in analysing a wing, the aerodynamic and structural analyses must be run a number of times in turn until the loads and deformation converge.

===Standard form===

Once the design variables, constraints, objectives, and the relationships between them have been chosen, the problem can be expressed in the following form:

: find &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;  that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x})\leq\mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{lb}\leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{x}_{ub} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is an objective, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of design variables, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of inequality constraints, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of equality constraints, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{lb}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{ub}&lt;/math&gt; are vectors of lower and upper bounds on the design variables.  Maximization problems can be converted to minimization problems by multiplying the objective by -1.  Constraints can be reversed in a similar manner.  Equality constraints can be replaced by two inequality constraints.

==Problem solution==

The problem is normally solved using appropriate techniques from the field of optimization.  These include [[gradient]]-based algorithms, population-based algorithms, or others.  Very simple problems can sometimes be expressed linearly; in that case the techniques of [[linear programming]] are applicable.

===Gradient-based methods===
*[[Adjoint equation]]
*[[Newton's method]]
*[[Steepest descent]]
*[[Conjugate gradient]]
*[[Sequential quadratic programming]]

===Gradient-free methods===
* Hooke-Jeeves pattern search
* [[Nelder-Mead method]]

===Population-based methods===
*[[Genetic algorithm]]
*[[Memetic algorithm]]
*[[Particle swarm optimization]]
*[[Harmony search]]
*ODMA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-014-1536-x|title=ODMA: a novel swarm-evolutionary metaheuristic optimizer inspired by open source development model and communities|author1=Hossein Hajipour|author2=Hamed Behzadi Khormuji|author3=Habib Rostami|doi=10.1007/s00500-014-1536-x|journal=Soft Comput|year=2016|volume=20|page=727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===
*Random search
*[[Grid search]]
*[[Simulated annealing]]
*[[Brute-force search|Direct search]]
*[[IOSO]] (Indirect Optimization based on Self-Organization)

Most of these techniques require large numbers of evaluations of the objectives and the constraints.  The disciplinary models are often very complex and can take significant amounts of time for a single evaluation.  The solution can therefore be extremely time-consuming.  Many of the optimization techniques are adaptable to [[parallel computing]].  Much current research is focused on methods of decreasing the required time.

Also, no existing solution method is guaranteed to find the [[global optimization|global optimum]] of a general problem (see [[No free lunch in search and optimization]]). Gradient-based methods find local optima with high reliability but are normally unable to escape a local optimum.  Stochastic methods, like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, will find a good solution with high probability, but very little can be said about the mathematical properties of the solution.  It is not guaranteed to even be a local optimum.  These methods often find a different design each time they are run.

==Carlsberg display of restoration noses==
The [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] museum in Copenhagen has a nasothek collection that displays restored noses that were removed from portrait busts and statues after changes in the museum's [[art restoration]] policies.&lt;ref name=Huizing&gt;{{cite book|title=Klinik der menschlichen Sinne|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-76632-3|pages=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaOg_nkDQR0C|author=E.H.

[[File:Nasothek.JPG|thumb|left|Detail: A closer look at the Copenhagen Nasothek display shows wide variety in surface textures and style.]]The [[Marble#Sculpture|white marble]] favored by Classical sculptors is easily broken, and many antique statues have been damaged since their creation by accidents, [[iconoclasm]], or vandalism. During the 19th century, it was common practice for museums to exhibit such marble sculptures in a "restored" state, with damaged parts repaired or reconstructed to make the statue look as much as possible as it did when it was first created. The noses of antique statues are especially likely to be damaged or missing, so many Greek or Roman statues acquired new noses during this era. Modern exhibition practice may differ from museum to museum. The minimalist approach prescribes removing such 19th-century additions in the interest of authenticity, as has been done in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=Getty&gt;{{cite web|title=Getty Exhibition Spotlights Practices In Antiquities Conservation|url=http://www.getty.edu/news/press/center/hope_hygieia_release_040208.html|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ny Carlsberg museum, which has an extensive collection of Greek and Roman marble statues,  participated both in 19th-century restoration and in 20th-century "de-restoration." As a result, many Roman portrait heads are now noseless again, with their restored noses removed to the museum's nasothek.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

The museum display explains its contents in both Danish and English. The English description says, "The word ''nasothek'' means a collection of noses, in analogy with ''{{linktext|discotheque}}'', a collection of records."&lt;ref name=restor/&gt; The Danish explanation compares "nasotek" (Danish equivalent of "nasothek") to "{{linktext|bibliotek}}", a collection of books.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

The '''Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics''', or '''Nordita''' ({{lang-da|Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk (Atom)fysik}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/46/032/46032026.pdf Around the Laboratories], IAEA.org.&lt;/ref&gt;), is an international organisation for research in [[theoretical physics]]. It was established in 1957 by [[Niels Bohr]] and the Swedish physicist [[Torsten Gustafson]]. Nordita was originally located at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] ([[Denmark]]), but moved to the [[AlbaNova]] University Centre in [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]) on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main research areas at Nordita are [[astrophysics]], hard and soft [[condensed matter physics]], and [[high-energy physics]].

== Research ==
 
Since Nordita's establishment in 1957 the original focus on research in atomic and nuclear physics has been broadened. 
Research carried out by Nordita's academic staff presently includes [[astrophysics]], [[biological physics]], hard [[condensed matter physics]] and [[materials physics]], soft [[condensed matter physics]], [[cosmology]], [[statistical physics]] and [[complex systems]], [[high-energy physics]], and [[gravitational physics]] and [[cosmology]]. The in-house research forms the backbone of Nordita activities and complements the more service oriented functions. By mission, Nordita has the task of facilitating interactions between physicists in the Nordic countries as well as with the international community; therefore the comparably small institute has a large number of visitors, conferences and scientific programs that last several weeks. 

Notable former or present researchers at Nordita include [[Alexander V. Balatsky]], [[Holger Bech Nielsen]], Axel Brandenburg, [[Gerald E. Brown]], [[Paolo Di Vecchia]], [[James Hamilton (physicist)|James Hamilton]], John Hertz, Alan Luther, [[Ben Roy Mottelson]], Christopher J. Pethick, [[Leon Rosenfeld]], Kim Sneppen, John Wettlaufer, and Konstantin Zarembo.

== Organization ==

[[File:Nordita_Main_Building_Stockholm.png|thumb|right|The Nordita East building in Stockholm]] Nordita is governed by a board consisting of one representative and one alternate member from each Nordic country, headed by a chair person. The board appoints a number of research committees which evaluate proposals and advice the board on scientific and educational matters. 

The Nordita board nominates a director who is appointed by the president of [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] and the vice-chancellor of [[Stockholm University]]. The director, currently [[Thors Hans Hansson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

'''North American collegiate sustainability programs''' are institutions of higher education in the United States, Mexico, and Canada that have majors and/or minors dedicated to the subject of [[sustainability]]. Sustainability as a [[Bachelor's degree|major]] and [[minor (academic)|minor]] is spreading to more and more colleges as the need for humanity to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle becomes increasingly apparent with the onset of [[global warming]]. The majors and minors listed here cover a wide array of sustainability aspects from business to construction to agriculture to simply the study of sustainability itself.

==Canada==

===Acadia University===
[[Acadia University]] is located in [[Wolfville|Wolfville, Nova Scotia]], Canada and offers an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] major in Environmental and Sustainability Studies. This major gives students the skills they need to make the changes necessary to create a more "sustainable and just society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.acadiau.ca/about-us.html |title=Environmental &amp; Sustainability Studies ~ About Us |publisher=Environment.acadiau.ca |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four concentration areas (Sustainable Community Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Sustainability, Environmental Thought and Practice, and Environmental Advocacy, Education, and Activism) and two different degree options (a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a Bachelor of Recreation Management) offered within the major.

The '''Partnership for Peace Consortium''' is a network of over 800 defense academies and security studies institutes across 60 countries.  Founded in 1998 during the NATO Summit, the PfPC was chartered to promote defense institution building and foster regional stability through multinational education and research, which the PfPC accomplishes via a network of educators and researchers. It is based at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]] in [[Garmisch]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pfp-consortium.org Partnership for Peace Consortium (PfPC)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the PfPC Annual Report of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfpconsortium.com/#!annual-reports/cror Annual Report of 2012] Free download&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 eight hundred defense academies and security studies institutes in 59 countries worked with the PfPC in 69 defense education/defense institution building and policy-relevant events. The Consortium publishes an academic quarterly journal ''CONNECTIONS''&lt;ref&gt;[http://connections-qj.org/ Quarterly Journal ''[[Connections (journal)|CONNECTIONS]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; in English and Russian. The journal is run by an international Editorial Board of experts and is distributed to over 1,000 institutions in 54 countries.

==Background==
The PfPC was founded in 1998 in response to the speech by United States Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]],  "Toward a Cooperative Security Network for the 21st Century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/101726374/TOWARD-A-COOPERATIVE-SECURITY-NETWORK-FOR-THE-21ST-CENTURY Toward a Cooperative Security Network for the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was delivered during the 12 June 1998 meeting of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) defense ministers and similar sentiments were echoed in the concluding documents of the NATO and EAPC Summits on 24 and 25 April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-064e.htm NATO Summit 24-25 April, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; The PfPC was originally co-sponsored by the United States and Germany to work in the spirit of the [[Partnership for Peace]] Program "to strengthen defense and military education through enhanced national and institutional cooperation."  Since its founding, the PfPC’s sponsorship has expanded, with contributions from numerous partner states and organizations.  In the Canadian House of Commons in 2017, the PfPC's long contribution "in promoting stability, security, and democracy" was [https://openparliament.ca/debates/2017/12/7/wayne-easter-1/ noted] by the Honorable [[Wayne Easter]], Liberal MP for Malpeque.  

Upon its establishment, the PfPC was chartered with the following objectives:
*Strengthen defense, military, and security policy education through enhanced national and institutional cooperation
*Strengthen civilian and military leadership capabilities in national security and strategic-level military planning
*Enhance multinational education through collaborative approaches linking defense practitioners, scholars, researchers, and experts into activity-based networks that facilitate the sharing of knowledge
*Extend the scope of educational cooperation throughout the Euro-Atlantic region to include not only governmental defense academies and security studies institutes, but also other governmental, non-governmental, and private organizations whether they are institutes, agencies or universities
*Increase the scope of the multinational research on critical issues confronting partner nations{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Organization==
The PfPC is governed by a Senior Advisory Council (SAC), with high level government representatives from [[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[NATO]] International Staff, [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]].  SAC members can be permanent or rotational depending on the interests of the contributing state or organization. The most recent SAC additions are Poland&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.aon.edu.pl/en/cooperation/foreign Poland on Senior Advisory Council (SAC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218111601/http://www.adl.aon.edu.pl/en/cooperation/foreign |date=2014-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/nav-main-wwd-res-courses-pass-en/62-cat-english-en/cat-gcmc-pao-en/cat-gcmc-pao-news-en/1552-art-pao-news-10-31-14-en.html Sweden on Senior Advisory Council (SAC)]&lt;/ref&gt; The SAC meets annually to review the PfPC's activities, providing guidance to ensure activities match the PfPC's founding principles.

The PfPC organizes its activities through Working Groups and Study Groups, which address relevant topics in international security and related fields.  In total there are nine groups, each with a Chair, Co-Chair, and Technical Advisors, who contribute to the groups' activities voluntarily or otherwise.  The Chairs and Co-Chairs comprise the PfPC's Consortium Steering Committee (CSC).  The CSC meets annually to provide updates on their activities and to determine future activities, ensuring activities are aligned with SAC directions.

==Activity Groups==
Over 90 PfPC events per year across the US, Europe and Central Asia provide the activity groups with a forum for debate and exchange of ideas on contemporary security topics.  Such forums are designed to identify and facilitate options for nonviolent resolution to international differences, and to further defense education transformation goals in recipient countries.  The groups benefit from a multinational, multidisciplinary network of experts across defense, academia, industry, and civil society.

===Working Groups===

====[[Advanced Distributed Learning]]====
The Advanced Distributed Learning Working Group’s&lt;ref&gt;Synytsya, K., et al. "Learning on demand. ADL and the Future of e-Learning. Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative." (2010): 295-303.&lt;/ref&gt; mission is to strengthen e-learning-based defense and security policy education through international and institutional collaboration. The activities include the creation and sharing of interactive, widely needed e-learning courseware; providing access to interoperable, open-source e-learning technologies; and the exchange and dissemination of ADL-based best practices. A strategic goal is to contribute to the Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) and integrate interested Partner nations into the ADL community of practice. The Advanced Distributed Learning  Working Group coordinates and standardizes training and promotes innovation.

====Education Development====
The Education Development Working Group (EDWG) is designed to strengthen defense education in partner nations and consists of two core components:
*Reference Curriculum
*Faculty Development 
These two core components are facilitated by the multinational staffed Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP),.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_90086.htm Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm?mode=pressrelease NATO Wales Summit Declaration  - see Paragraph 81 on Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP)]&lt;/ref&gt; DEEP is central to EDWG activities, supporting foreign government defense learning institution efforts to: (1) enhance the quality and relevance of curriculum and to (2) promote faculty development and modern learning techniques within a framework of individually tailored multi-year action plans. As of December 2014, DEEP programs were underway in 13 nations: Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_114115.htm?selectedLocale=en Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Croatia, Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgia.usembassy.gov/news-events/emb_news2014t/21102014gori.html Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) in Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.

====Emerging Security Challenges====
The Emerging Security Challenges (ESC) Working Group aims to enhance the capacity of decision makers and policy shapers to identify and respond to emerging security challenges. Specifically, its goal is to identify and prioritize such challenges and discuss possible political frameworks and mechanisms to address them. “Emerging Security Challenges” has become a term used at NATO and in public debate to deal with potential, upcoming, non-traditional threats to our security. The working group does not have a defined set of issues for analysis - rather, it remains open to include new challenges as they arise.  Along with the EDWG, the Emerging Security Challenges working group under the leadership of [https://www.linkedin.com/in/seancostigan/ Sean Costigan]([[George C. Marshall Center for European Security Studies]]) and Michael Hennessy ([[Royal Military College of Canada]]) led the creation of the NATO/PFPC Cybersecurity Generic Reference Curriculum. The curriculum was endorsed by the [[Supreme Allied Commander Transformation|NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation]], and is currently available in four languages: [http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_10/1610-cybersecurity-curriculum.pdf English], [http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_10/20170719_1610-cybersecurity-curriculum-fr.pdf French], [http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_10/20170908_1610-cybersecurity-curriculum-ar.pdf Arabic] and [http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_10/20171004_1610-cybersecurity-curriculum-rus.pdf Russian].

====[[Security Sector Reform]]====
The Security Sector Reform Working Group (SSRWG) was formally established in 2001 and is financially supported by the Swiss [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport]]. Its stated objectives are “to enhance the exchange of ideas, insights, expertise, knowledge and best practices of security sector reform processes between consolidating and consolidated democracies in the Euro-Atlantic area”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfp-consortium.org/index.php/activities/security-sector-reform Partnership for Peace Consortium, "Security Sector Reform Working Group Factsheet" (2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010, the group began to focus more on [[human security]] issues and has taken a particular interest in how to improve [[gender equality]] through defence transformation. This led the group to identify teaching gender to the military as an area that warranted greater attention, resulting in a series of workshops organised in collaboration with the EDWG, starting in 2012. These have been attended by representatives from NATO and Partner countries specialising in military education, gender education and integrating gender in military operations. The SSRWG’s current activities are centred on the development of a handbook to document the findings of the workshop series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcaf.ch/Event/Authors-Workshop-Teaching-Gender-to-the-Military-Manual DCAF, Event: Authors’ Workshop: Teaching Gender to the Military Manual, 17 Dec 2014 - 19 Dec 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study Groups===

====Regional Security in Southeast Europe====
The Regional Stability in Southeast Europe Study Group contributes to peace and security in Southeast Europe. Its working principles include the following:
*Evaluate the situation and factors in the South East European region that promote regional stability through enhanced international co-operation, especially with institutions located in or close to the region of interest
*Carry out strategic research on an academic level supplementary to and stimulating the practical work done in the region
*Provide support for the improvement of networks in the field of security policy and help create a peaceful, strategic and stable community in the Southeast Europe region compatible to the broader Partnership for Peace network and beyond

====Regional Security in the South Caucasus====
The PfPC's Regional Security in the [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]] Study Group actively seeks to foster stability in the region through facilitating dialogue among diverse parties. The activities of the group serve to advise broader conflict resolution activities, such as the Geneva Talks and the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. The group pursues its goals by focusing on the following areas:
*Ensuring multinational participation, building on experts from all dimensions of the security-political spectrum of the three core countries Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia: This is paralleled by bringing in experts on regional stability issues from the main partner countries and institutions to the region, namely the European Union (Member States), the Russian Federation, Turkey, the United States, as well as NATO, the OSCE and the UN.
*Building a constructive network of academic and policy-making influence: This includes involving civil society, think-tanks and defense institutions in the group's work.
*Encouraging an alteration of the conflicting narrative in the region in order to progress conflict negotiation

==Products and Services==
Supported by the research and activities of the study/working groups, the PfPC offers the following services:
*Defense education curriculum development
*Education delivery methods (e.g. distributed computer-based learning)
*Foreign policy recommendation papers
*Information sharing, coordination of skills and assets

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8166">A '''periodic sentence ''' is a [[stylistic device]] employed at the sentence level, described as one that is not complete grammatically or semantically before the final clause or phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|authorlink=Cicero|editor=Stephen Ciraolo|title=Pro Caelio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=huar3SdjthAC&amp;pg=PA3|edition=2|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=978-0-86516-461-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The periodic sentence emphasizes its main idea by placing it at the end, following all the [[subordinate clauses]] and other [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]] that support the principal idea.&lt;ref name="Baldwin1909"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Charles Sears|title=Composition, Oral and Written|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3BLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=7 July 2011|year=1909|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|page=122}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence unfolds gradually, so that the thought contained in the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]/[[verb]] group only emerges at the sentence's conclusion.&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; Obviously artificial, it is used mostly in what in [[Eloquence|oratory]] is called the grand style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|authorlink=Cicero|editor=Harold C. Gotoff|title=Cicero's Caesarian speeches: a stylistic commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAokWH3m1aEC&amp;pg=PA279|year=1993|publisher=UNC Press|isbn=978-0-8078-4407-6|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the opposite of the [[loose sentence]], also continuous or running style, where the subject and verb are introduced at the beginning of the sentence.&lt;ref name=harmon&gt;{{cite book|last=Harmon|first=William|title=A handbook to literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyrzAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22periodic+sentence%22+snowflakes&amp;dq=%22periodic+sentence%22+snowflakes|edition=10|year=2006|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-134442-6|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic sentences often rely on [[hypotaxis]], whereas running sentences are typified by [[parataxis]].&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Ronald Carter (linguist)|last1=Carter|first1=Ronald|last2=McRae|first2=John|title=The Routledge history of literature in English: Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRR7nR8qOAMC&amp;pg=PA475|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-24317-9|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]] is generally considered to be the master of the periodic sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chevalier|first=Tracy|title=Encyclopedia of the essay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJtz0iWO4O4C&amp;pg=PA179|year=1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-884964-30-5|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
In English literature, the decline of the periodic sentence's popularity goes hand in hand with the development toward a less formal style, which some authors date to the beginning of the Romantic period, specifically the 1798 publication of the ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', and the prevalence in twentieth-century literature of spoken language over written language.&lt;ref name=routledge/&gt; In American literature, scholars note the explicit rejection by [[Henry David Thoreau]] of the formal style of his time, of which the periodic sentence was characteristic; in his journal, Thoreau criticized those sentences as the "weak and flowing periods of the politician and scholar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillman|first=Richard H.|editor=Richard Fleming, Michael Payne|title=New interpretations of American literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llypsBvOimUC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1988|publisher=Bucknell UP|isbn=978-0-8387-5127-5|page=93|chapter=Thoreau's Philosophy of Style}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical and literary usage==
According to [[William Harmon]], the periodic sentence is used "to arouse interest and curiosity, to hold an idea in suspense before its final revelation."&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; In the words of [[William Minto]], "the effect...is to keep the mind in a state of uniform or increasing tension until the ''dénouement''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minto|first=William|authorlink=William Minto|title=A manual of English prose literature: biographical and critical, designed mainly to show characteristics of style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=1895|publisher=Ginn|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ''Handbook to Literature'', Harmon offers an early example in American literature found in [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]’s "Snowflakes":&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt;

:Out of the bosom of the Air,
:Out of the cloud-folds of her garment shaken,
:Over the woodlands brown and bare, 
:Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
:Silent and soft, and slow,
:Descends the snow.

Starting with a succession of parallel adverbial phrases ("Out of the bosom," "Out of the cloud-folds," "Over the woodlands," "Over the harvest-fields"), each followed by parallel modification ("of the air," "of her garment shaken," "brown and bare," "forsaken"), the sentence is left grammatically incomplete until the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]/[[verb]] group "Descends the snow".&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; Other American examples cited include the opening lines of [[William Cullen Bryant]]'s "[[A Forest Hymn]]" and lines 9-16 of his "[[Thanatopsis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Alma|title=Intensive studies in American literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcMpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|year=1914|publisher=Macmillan|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly long example is the opening stanza (lines 1-22) of [[Walt Whitman]]'s "[[Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Alma|title=Intensive studies in American literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcMpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA277|year=1914|publisher=Macmillan|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "now-famous periodic sentence" occurs in [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s short story "[[The Overcoat]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarlin|first=Harold A.|year=1979|title='The Overcoat' As a Civil Service Episode|journal=[[Canadian-American Slavic Studies]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=235–53|doi=10.1163/221023979X00096}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Even at those hours when the gray Petersburg sky is completely overcast and the whole population of clerks have dined and eaten their fill, each as best he can, according to the salary he receives and his personal tastes; when they are all resting after the scratching of pens and bustle of the office, their own necessary work and other people's, and all the tasks that an overzealous man voluntarily sets himself even beyond what is necessary; when the clerks are hastening to devote what is left of their time to pleasure; some more enterprising are flying to the theater, others to the street to spend their leisure staring at women's hats, some to spend the evening paying compliments to some attractive girl, the star of a little official circle, while some—and this is the most frequent of all—go simply to a fellow clerk's apartment on the third or fourth story, two little rooms with a hall or a kitchen, with some pretensions to style, with a lamp or some such article that has cost many sacrifices of dinners and excursions—at the time when all the clerks are scattered about the apartments of their friends, playing a stormy game of whist, sipping tea out of glasses, eating cheap biscuits, sucking in smoke from long pipes, telling, as the cards are dealt, some scandal that has floated down from higher circles, a pleasure which the Russian do never by any possibility deny himself, or, when there is nothing better to talk about, repeating the everlasting anecdote of the commanding officer who was told that the tail had been cut off the horse on the Falconet monument—in short, even when everyone, was eagerly seeking entertainment, Akaky Akakievich did not indulge in any amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Sarah Lawall|title=The Norton Anthology of Western Literature|edition=8|volume=2|year=2006|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-92616-3|pages=1008–33|chapter=Nikolai Gogol: "The Overcoat"|display-editors=etal}} Quote on pp. 1016-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phytochemistry''' is the study of [[phytochemical]]s, which are chemicals derived from [[plant]]s. Those studying phytochemistry strive to describe the structures of the large number of secondary [[metabolic]] compounds found in plants, the functions of these compounds in human and plant biology, and the biosynthesis of these compounds. Plants synthesize phytochemicals for many reasons, including to protect themselves against [[insect]] attacks and [[plant disease]]s. Phytochemicals in food plants are often active in human biology, and in many cases have health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Phytochemistry of Medicinal Plants |author1=John T. Arnason |author2=Rachel Mata |author3=John T. Romeo |date = 2013-11-11 |publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn = 9781489917782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the [[alkaloid]]s, [[glycoside]]s, [[polyphenol]]s, and [[terpene]]s.

Phytochemistry can be considered sub-fields of [[botany]] or [[chemistry]]. Activities can be led in [[botanical garden]]s or in the wild with the aid of [[ethnobotany]]. The applications of the discipline can be for [[pharmacognosy]], or the discovery of new drugs, or as an aid for [[plant physiology]] studies.

== Techniques ==
Techniques commonly used in the field of phytochemistry are [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]], isolation, and [[structural elucidation]] ([[Mass spectrometry|MS]],1D and 2D NMR) of [[natural products]], as well as various [[chromatography]] techniques (MPLC, [[High performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]], and LC-MS).

== Constituent elements ==
The list of simple [[chemical element|elements]] of which plants are primarily constructed—[[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[hydrogen]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], etc.—is not different from similar lists for animals, fungi, or even [[bacteria]].  The fundamental atomic components of plants are the same as for all life; only the details of the way in which they are assembled differs.

== Eastern medicine ==
Phytochemistry is widely used in the field of [[Chinese medicine]] especially in the field of [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]].

Phytochemical technique mainly applies to the quality control of Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine(Indian traditional medicine) or herbal medicine of various chemical components, such as [[saponins]], [[alkaloids]], [[volatile oils]], [[flavonoids]] and [[anthraquinones]]. In the development of rapid and reproducible analytical techniques, the combination of [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] with different detectors, such as [[diode array detector]] (DAD), [[refractive index detector]] (RID), [[evaporative light scattering detector]] (ELSD) and [[mass spectrometric detector]] (MSD), has been widely developed.

In most cases, biologically active compounds in Chinese medicine, [[Ayurveda]], or herbal medicine have not been determined.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Therefore, it is important to use the phytochemical methods to screen and analyze bioactive components, not only for the quality control of crude [[drugs]], but also for the elucidation of their therapeutic mechanisms. Modern pharmacological studies indicate that binding to receptors or ion channels on [[cell membrane]]s is the first step of some drug actions. A new method in phytochemistry called biochromatography has been developed. This method combines human [[red blood cell|red cell]] membrane extraction and high performance [[liquid chromatography]] to screen potential active components in Chinese medicine.

==  Phytochemicals ==

Many plants produce chemical compounds [[Plant defense against herbivory|for defence against herbivores]]. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in medicinal plants is the scientific basis for their use. The major classes of pharmacologically active [[phytochemical]]s are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them.&lt;ref name="Angio"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Angiosperms: Division Magnoliophyta: General Features |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (volume 13, 15th edition) |year=1993 |page=609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human settlements are often surrounded by weeds useful as medicines, such as [[Urtica dioica|nettle]], [[dandelion]] and [[chickweed]].&lt;ref name="meskin-2002-p123"&gt;{{cite book |author=Meskin, Mark S. |title=Phytochemicals in Nutrition and Health |publisher=CRC Press|year=2002 |isbn=978-1-58716-083-7 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJHsMALUDj0C&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Springbob, Karen &amp; Kutchan, Toni M. |chapter=Introduction to the different classes of natural products|editor=Lanzotti, Virginia |title=Plant-Derived Natural Products: Synthesis, Function, and Application |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-387-85497-7 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8SpVXEng4QC&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elumalai"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elumalai |first1=A.|last2=Eswariah |first2=M.

'''Principled Distance''' is a new model of [[secularism]] given by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]]s and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]]. [[Rajeev Bhargava|He]] says that [[India]]n secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/rajeev-bhargava/states-religious-diversity-and-crisis-of-secularism-0&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by balancing the claims of individuals and religious communities, it never intended a bludgeoning privatization of religion. In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/events/rethinking-secularism-refining-the-concepts-of-public-religions-principled-distance-and-the-twin-tolerations?q=Jos%C3%A9%20Casanova&lt;/ref&gt; The western model of secularism is criticized in India for being an outdated concept as Rajeev argued that since Western model was developed when society was more homogeneous but since in the era of globalization, society is becoming more heterogeneous therefore a new concept, suitable for the present situation, is needed. He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="Rajeev"&gt;

The [[Haj subsidy]] is a subsidy given to [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] [[Hajj]] pilgrims by the Government of India.  The program has its origins in British colonial era.

'''Pseudocopulation''' describes behaviors similar to [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]] that serve a reproductive function for one or both participants but do not involve actual sexual union between the individuals. It is most generally applied to a [[pollinator]] attempting to copulate with a [[flower]]. Some flowers [[mimicry|mimic]] a potential female mate visually, but the key stimuli are often chemical and tactile.&lt;ref name=Orchid&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |first1=Leendert |last1=van der Pijl |first2=Calaway H. |last2=Dodson |title=Orchid Flowers: Their Pollination and Evolution |chapter=Chapter 11: Mimicry and Deception |publisher=[[University of Miami]] Press |location=Coral Gables |year=1966 |pages=129–141 |isbn=0-87024-069-2 |oclc=310489511 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[mimicry in plants]] is called '''Pouyannian mimicry'''.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 |title=A Classificatory Review of Mimicry Systems |year=1982 |last1=Pasteur |first1=G |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=13 |pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orchid]]s commonly achieve reproduction in this manner, secreting chemicals from glands (osmophores) in the [[sepal]]s, [[petal]]s, or [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]], that are indistinguishable from the insect's natural [[pheromone]]s. The pollinator then has a [[pollinium]] attached to its body, which it transfers to the stigma of another flower when it attempts another 'copulation'. Pollinators are often [[bee]]s,  and [[wasp]]s of the order [[Hymenoptera]], and [[fly|flies]].

The cost to the pollinating insects might be seen as negligible, but study of ''[[Cryptostylis]]'' (an Australian orchid) pollinators shows that they may waste large amounts of [[sperm]] by ejaculating onto the flower. Thus there could be antagonistic [[coevolution]] such that pollinators become better at identifying their own species correctly and orchids become better mimics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/587532 |title=Orchid Sexual Deceit Provokes Ejaculation |year=2008 |last1=Gaskett |first1=A.

Pseudocopulation is also used to describe close physical contact between mating animals which have their eggs [[external fertilization|externally fertilized]]. [[Frog]]s provide one such case, with the male releasing sperm as the female discharges her eggs, a process called [[amplexus]].&lt;ref&gt;pseudocopulation. (2007). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved October 19, 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061690&lt;/ref&gt; In some species of [[starfish]], a male and female may come together and form a pair. The male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to release his sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00391987| issn = 0025-3162| volume = 99| issue = 2| pages = 247–253|author1=Run, J. -Q. |author2=Chen, C. -P. |author3=Chang, K. -H. |author4=Chia, F. -S. | title = Mating behaviour and reproductive cycle of ''Archaster typicus'' (Echinodermata: Asteroidea)| journal = Marine Biology|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ripon College''' is a [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]], United States.  As of the 2017–18 academic year, Ripon College's student body stood at around 800, the majority of whom live on campus. Students come from 14 nations and 33 states, and 53% are female while 47% are male.

==Distinctions==
According to the [[Washington Monthly]] College Rankings, Ripon is #18 among national liberal arts colleges, and is #3 in the "best bang for the buck" category in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Monthly 2016 College Rankings, http://washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[US News and World Report]], Ripon ranks #113 among national liberal arts colleges, and #29 among the "best value schools".&lt;ref&gt;US News and World Report rankings, 2016, http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Smith Hall, Ripon College.jpg|thumb|300px|Smith Hall.]]
Ripon College was founded in 1851, although its first class of students did not enroll until 1853. Ripon's first class, four women, graduated in June 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/colleges/ripon-college/|title=Ripon College|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college was founded with ties to local churches, but early in its history the institution became secular.  In 1868 formal ties with [[Presbyterian]] and [[Congregational]] churches were cut, but Ripon would retain some ties to its religious past.  During the nineteenth century students were required to attend two church services each Sunday.  The first six presidents of Ripon College had clerical backgrounds, as did the previous president, David Joyce.  Today the school offers classes in world religions, but there are no required religious courses, and students are not required to attend religious services.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The college recognized social and academic Greek letter societies in 1924. The Ripon Chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] was started by Clark Kuebler, who served as president from 1944 to 1955.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The [[National Forensic League]], which is still located in Ripon, Wisconsin, was founded at the college in 1925.  Since that time communication has been important at the college, which today organizes its endeavors as part of a Communication Consortium that provides real-world experience to students, such as managing the campus newspaper, mentoring people within the broader community about communication, and participating in forensics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ripon.edu/communication-consortium/|title=Ripon Communication Consortium -  Ripon College|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
[[File:Harwood Memorial Union, Ripon College.jpg|thumb|300px|Harwood Memorial Union.]]
At Ripon College every student is expected to complete a [[Major (academic)|major]]; students also take five Catalyst courses that focus on solving real-world problems.  After completing the Catalyst, students receive a certificate in Applied Innovation.  This certificate is similar to a minor at other schools.  Ripon College provides a four-year graduation guarantee to all students who remain in good academic standing, declare a major course of study by the end of [[sophomore]] year, and follow an approved course plan.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Ripon has a student-to-faculty ratio of 11.5:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripon.edu/about/|title=About -  Ripon College|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College is on the [[Academic term#Collegiate calendars|semester system]] and has two optional three-week summer sessions known as Liberal Arts In Focus.  These In Focus programs include both on-campus offerings as well as travel courses to Italy, England, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripon.edu/academics/|title=Academics -  Ripon College|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may choose from 32 majors, a variety of pre-professional advising options and also opt to self-design a major. Off-campus study is highly encouraged; nearly one-third of all Ripon College students elect to spend a semester off-campus on a focused area of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripon.edu/academics/title=Ripon|accessdate=2012-05-15}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lane Library, Ripon College.jpg|thumb|300px|Lane Library.]]
Each incoming student is assigned a faculty mentor based on their area of interest. Together, faculty mentors and staff in the Office of Career Development work with students throughout their time on campus to help set goals and construct a course plan to reach those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ripon.edu/advising/|title=Advising &amp; Support {{!}}  Ripon College|website=www.ripon.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripon is a member of the  [[Associated Colleges of the Midwest]] (ACM), a grouping of private liberal arts schools that share expertise and collaborate on off-campus study programs. The College is also affiliated with the Annapolis Group of private liberal arts colleges and is a member of the [[Council of Independent Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.edu/|title=The Council of Independent Colleges|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program also hosts visiting musicians each semester, and performances are free to all students.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Theater===
The college's theater program produces three productions per year, with students from any major encouraged to act or be involved with set, costume, and makeup design.  Each theater major directs a one-act production their senior year, as part of a campus theater festival.  Students regularly participate in the Region III Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival.  All theatrical events are free to students and the public.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Sustainability and the environment==
Ripon College attempts to be a sustainable institution. It has a fleet of campus hybrid vehicles, a recycling program, and uses energy efficient light bulbs.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The college is home to the Ceresco Prairie Conservancy, consisting of {{convert|130|acre}} of native prairie, oak savanna, and wetland habitat in the making.  The Ceresco Prairie Conservancy is used by different classes in a number of different disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripon.edu/ripon-at-a-glance/|title=Ripon at a Glance -  Ripon College|author=|date=|website=www.ripon.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It tries to maintain a healthy population of bees in the area, by including them in the prairie area. Trails for walking and snowshoeing throughout this area connect to a municipally run nature park, the South Woods. A student group, EGOR: The Environmental Group of Ripon, focuses on awareness of these issues.  Students can major in environmental studies, which is an interdisciplinary program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripon.edu/sustainability/|title=Campus Sustainability -  Ripon College|publisher=|accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

===Clubs===
Over 60 student clubs on campus range from fraternities and sororities to special interest groups (focuses include the environment, sexual orientation, race, religion, etc.) to academics (art, anthropology, physics, sociology, music, theater, mathematics, and others) to service groups (Amnesty, animal welfare, etc.) to politics (Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, and Greens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripon.edu/clubs-organizations/ |title=Clubs &amp; Organizations |publisher=Ripon College |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
The college has seven residential dormitories with several sororities, including [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], and [[Kappa Delta]]. The college has four all-male fraternities including chapters of [[Sigma Chi]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], and a local fraternity, Phi Kappa Pi, (named Merriman for the college's founding president). Ripon College also has one local co-ed fraternity, [[Theta Sigma Tau]], founded in 1910, the oldest local fraternity on campus. It became co-ed in 1980 after severing ties with [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity. Students in all five fraternities live in dormitories on campus, following the recent removal of Phi Kappa Pi from Merriman House. Phi Kappa Pi was relocated to the Quad living area, with the other three fraternities, after the Merriman house was condemned and the board of Trustees determined that all students (unless exempted) should reside in residence halls. The three sororities live in one dorm, Johnson Hall, which includes independent and first year women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4718">'''Sander L. Gilman''' (born February 21, 1944) is an American [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[history of literature|literary historian]].&lt;ref name="psp"&gt;[http://www.psp.emory.edu/SanderGilman/index.html Emory.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his contributions to [[Jewish studies]] and the [[history of medicine]]. He is the author or editor of over ninety books.

Gilman's focus is on medicine and the echoes of its rhetoric in social and political discourse. In particular, Gilman investigates the constellations of medical, social, and political discourse that emerge at certain historical junctures.

==Academic career==

Gilman obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] from [[Tulane University]] in 1963, where he proceeded to gain his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree, also in German, in 1968. He was a Professor at [[Cornell University]] (1976–1995), then moving to the [[University of Chicago]] for six years (1994–2000). He was then at the [[University of Illinois]] at Chicago for four years, founding its Program in Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.emory.edu/SanderGilman/Dr.%20GilmanCV%20updated%20Dec%2008.pdf Emory.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he was appointed a distinguished professor of the Liberal Arts and Sciences at [[Emory University]], where he was the Director of the Program in Psychoanalysis as well as of Emory University’s Health Sciences Humanities Initiative.  During 2017-8 he was the Alliance Professor of History at the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich.

In 2007 he was appointed Professor, Institute in the Humanities, Birkbeck College (London) and a Visiting Fellow of the new Institute of Advanced Studies, Warwick University, UK. He was president of the [[Modern Language Association]] in 1995.  He has been awarded a Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) at the University of Toronto in 1997, elected an honorary professor of the Free University in Berlin (2000), made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 2008 and made a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2016).

==Writing==
His ''Stand Up Straight! A History of Posture'' appeared with Reaktion Press (London) in 2018; his most recent edited volume is ''Jews on the Move:  Modern Cosmopolitanist Thought and Its Others'' published in 2018.   He is the author of the basic study of the visual stereotyping of the mentally ill, ''Seeing the Insane'', published by John Wiley and Sons in 1982 (reprinted: 1996) as well as the standard study of ''[[Jewish Self-Hatred]]'', the title of his Johns Hopkins University Press monograph of 1986."&lt;ref name="psp"/&gt;

===Freud===

He has examined [[Sigmund Freud]], addressing the question of what role, if any, was played by Freud’s Jewish origins in his composition of the psychoanalytic corpus. Gilman’s thesis concerning this subject is that the prejudices of biology in the nineteenth century classified the Jew as being somehow [[Femininity|feminine]], a [[social stigma|stigma]] that Freud sought to escape by carving out a scientific niche of his own. Licensed by his own brand of science, Freud could simultaneously lay claim to the [[manhood]] that the Viennese scientific establishment of the nineteenth century threatened to deny him, and also to the neutrality that was the warrant of its authority.

To make the case that contemporaneous [[anti-Semitism]] shaped Freud’s thought, Gilman provides a catalogue of the most egregious anti-Semitic stereotypes of the time and place, including straightforward documentation of certain anti-Semitic prejudices, such as the belief in Jewish [[male menstruation]],&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Sander. ''Creating Beauty to Cure the Soul''. 1998, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as period depictions of anti-Semitic [[stereotypes]] in graphic media.

==Editorial board membership==
Gilman sits on the Honorary International Advisory Board of the [[Mens Sana Monographs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmonographs.org/aboutus.asp Member, Hon Int Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex manuals''' are [[book]]s which explain how to perform [[Human sexual activity|sexual practices]]; they also commonly feature advice on [[birth control]], and sometimes on [[safe sex]] and [[sexual relationship]]s.

== Early sex manuals ==
[[File:Kamasutra5.jpg|thumb|Artistic depiction of a [[sex position]]]]

In the Graeco-Roman era, a sex manual was written by
[[Philaenis|Philaenis of Samos]], possibly a [[hetaira]] ([[courtesan]]) of the [[Hellenistic period]] (3rd–1st century BC).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Erôs in Ancient Greece|last1=Sanders |first1=E.|last2=Thumiger |first2=C.|last3=Carey |first3=C. |last4=Lowe |first4=N.|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199605507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qt7JkvxScSkC|page=287|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preserved by a series of fragmentary  [[papyrus]]es which attest its popularity, it served as a source of inspiration for  [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', written around 3&amp;nbsp;BC, which is partially a sex manual, and partially a burlesque on the art of love.

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], believed to have been written in the 1st to 6th centuries, has a notorious reputation as a sex manual, although only a small part of its text is devoted to sex. It was compiled by the Indian sage Vatsyayana sometime between the second and fourth centuries CE. His work was based on earlier [[Kamashastra]]s or ''Rules of Love'' going back to at least the seventh century BCE, and is a compendium of the social norms and love-customs of patriarchal Northern India around the time he lived. Vatsyayana's ''Kama Sutra'' is valuable today for his psychological insights into the interactions and scenarios of love, and for his structured approach to the many diverse situations he describes. He defines different types of men and women, matching what he terms "equal" unions, and gives detailed descriptions of many love-postures.

The ''Kama Sutra'' was written for the wealthy male city-dweller. It is not, and was never intended to be, a lover's guide for the masses, nor is it a "Tantric love-manual". About three hundred years after the ''Kama Sutra'' became popular, some of the love-making positions described in it were reinterpreted in a Tantric way. Since Tantra is an all-encompassing sensual science, love-making positions are relevant to spiritual practice.

The earliest East Asian sex manual is the ''Su Nü Jing''. Probably written during the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC-220 AD), the work was long lost in China itself, but preserved in Japan as part of the medical anthology ''[[Ishinpō]]'' (984). It is a Daoist text purporting to describe how one might achieve long life and immortality by manipulating the [[yin and yang]] forces of the body through sexual techniques, which are described in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%B4%A0%E5%A5%B3%E7%BB%8F&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval sex manuals include the lost works of [[Elephantis]], by [[Constantine the African]]; ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'', a 12th-century collection of [[Hindu]] erotic works; and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]'', a 16th-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] work by [[Sheikh Nefzaoui]]. The fifteenth-century ''[[Speculum al foderi]]'' (The Mirror of Coitus) is the first medieval European work to discuss sexual positions. Constantine the African also penned a medical treatise on sexuality, known as ''Liber de coitu''. The medieval Jewish physician and writer [[Maimonides]] is author of a ''Treatise on Cohabitation.''

== Modern sex manuals ==
Despite the existence of ancient sex manuals in other cultures, sex manuals were banned in Western culture for many years. What sexual information was available was generally only available in the form of illicit [[pornography]] or medical books, which generally discussed either sexual physiology or sexual disorders. The authors of medical works went so far as to write the most sexually explicit parts of their texts in [[Latin]], so as to make them inaccessible to the general public (see [[Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' as an example).

A few translations of the ancient works were circulated privately, such as ''The Perfumed Garden''….

In the late 19th Century, [[Ida Craddock]] wrote many serious instructional tracts on human sexuality and appropriate, respectful sexual relations between married couples. Among her works were ''The Wedding Night'' and ''Right Marital Living''. In 1918 [[Marie Stopes]] published ''[[Married Love]]'', considered groundbreaking despite its limitations in details used to discuss sex acts.

[[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde]]'s book ''Het volkomen huwelijk'' ''(The Perfect Marriage)'', published in 1926, was well known in [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and [[Estonia]]. In Germany, ''Die vollkommene Ehe'' reached its 42nd printing in 1932 despite its being placed on the list of forbidden books, the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]], by the Roman Catholic Church. In Sweden, ''Det fulländade äktenskapet'' was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s. In English, [[Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique]] has 42 printings in its original 1930 edition, and was republished in new editions in 1965 and 2000.

David Reuben, M. D.'s book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'', published in 1969, was one of the first sex manuals that entered mainstream culture in the 1960s. Although it did not feature explicit images of sex acts, its descriptions of sex acts were  detailed, addressing common questions and misunderstandings Reuben had heard from his own patients. Most notably, Reuben dismissed popular medical-psychiatric notions of "vaginal" vs. "clitoral" orgasm, explaining exactly how female physiology works.

''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' by Dr. [[Alex Comfort]] was the first visually explicit sex manual to be published by a mainstream publisher. It was followed by ''[[The Joy of Gay Sex]]'' and ''[[The Joy of Lesbian Sex]]''. Its appearance in public bookstores in the 1970s opened the way to the widespread publication of sex manuals in the West. As a result, hundreds of sex manuals are now available in print.

Sex manuals and works of the sort became so popular during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1970s that even religious groups developed their own manuals.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeRogatis |first=A.  |title=What Would Jesus Do? Sexuality and Salvation in Protestant Evangelical Sex Manuals, 1950s to the Present |journal=Church History |volume=74 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=97–137 |doi=10.1017/S0009640700109679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the book ''[[The Act of Marriage]]'' by Christian Baptist authors Tim and Beverly LaHaye has sold over 2.5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaHaye |first=T. |last2=LaHaye |first2=B. |title=The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=Zondervan |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they began with the prerequisite of a heterosexual, complementarian relationship, the behavior they suggested went far beyond standard Christian teaching at that time.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis" /&gt; They suggested role play, experimentation with sex devices, masturbation to ensure climax and many other practices that were considered taboo up until the 1970s in protestant bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lahaye |first=T. F. |year=1978 |title=Act of Marriage |location= |publisher=Bantam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manuals such as Marabel Morgan's [[The Total Woman]] emphasized the importance of the female orgasm. While they all required marriage, heterosexuality and complementarianism, they did push the bounds of accepted practice within their respective spheres of influence.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis" /&gt; Today, Christian authors continue to produce similar manuals and guides to their constituents in search of appropriate, fulfilling behavior. Books such as Mark and Grace Driscoll's [[Real Marriage]] encourage Christians to experiment in the bedrooms with their spouses, even encouraging acts that have long been rejected by protestant tradition such as anal sex.

One of the currently most well known in America is ''[[The Guide to Getting it On]]!'' by Paul Joannides. Now in its seventh edition, it has won several prestigious awards and been translated into 12 foreign languages since appearing in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.goofyfootpress.com/index.clickthrough.html | first = P. | last = Joannides | title = The Guide To Getting It On | edition = fifth | publisher = Goofy Foot Press | place = Oregon, USA | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-885535-69-4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816182246/http://www.goofyfootpress.com/index.clickthrough.html | archivedate = 2007-08-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Statue of Hope''' is an [[allegorical figure]] that is typically a private [[memorial]] or [[monument]] displayed in a [[graveyard]] or [[cemetery]]. [[Hope]] is one of the [[Seven Virtues]] of the [[Christian religion]].

==History==

Most commonly used in the [[Victorian era]] and believed to be popularized by the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s dedication in 1886. Prior to this, other images such as [[Saint Philomena]] whose authorization of devotion began in 1837 &lt;ref&gt;''It is Time to Meet St. Philomena'' By Dr. Mark Miravalle 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s Goddess of Hope statue sculpted in 1817,&lt;ref&gt;''Kierkegaard and His Contemporaries'': Pages 375–405; Thorvaldsen: An Introduction to his Work 2003&lt;/ref&gt; displayed similar characteristics.

One of the earliest signed Statue of Hope memorials was carved by [[Odoardo Fantacchiotti]] in 1863 for the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] of Samuel Reginald Routh of [[England]] in the [[Protestant]] Cemetery of [[Florence]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunders of White Silence, the Protestant cemetery of Florence, Italy'', Julia Bolton Holloway 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation was completed in 1791. The [[Custom House, Dublin]] [[Ireland]] features a 16 foot (about 5 meter) tall statue of a female resting on an anchor atop the dome. This statue has been called both the Statue of Hope&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic World", The Catholic Publication House, New York, Page 831, Vol. XIX April–September 1874&lt;/ref&gt; and the Statue of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;"The Encyclopædia Britannica", The Sixth Edition, Page 367, Vol. VII, 1823&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

In the [[United States]], these statues were commonly carved out of limestone or [[marble]] and were usually unsigned. The Wilson memorial pictured on the right was sculpted using [[Indiana Limestone]] which was quarried nearby. Towards the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century, some were cast with [[zinc]], commonly referred to as [[White Bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;The Foundry Magazine, Vol.35 No. 5, January 1910, Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious symbolism==

A female, typically shown wearing [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stola]] and [[Palla (garment)|Palla]] garments, stands with one arm resting on or holding an [[anchor]]. This is often an [[Anchored cross]] meaning hope&lt;ref&gt;Keister, Douglas, ''Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography''. Layton, UT: Gibbs Smith Publishers, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and is the primary symbol of the statue. Further, the [[New Testament]], Hebrews 6:19 states ''Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William and Cheetam, Samuel, ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'', London, England: J. R Burr Publishing Co., Page 81, Vol.1, 1880&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the opposite arm is raised with the index finger of the hand pointing towards the sky. This symbolizes the pathway to heaven. A hand held over the heart symbolizes faith. Other key elements can be a broken chain attached to the anchor or sometimes hanging from the neck. This symbolizes the cessation of life. Many statues have a single [[five pointed star]] rather than a [[circle of stars]]. The [[Star (heraldry)|star]] is on the top of the forehead, usually on a [[Crown of Immortality]] or [[diadem]], and represents the immortal [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memorial Art, Ancient and Modern'', Harry A Bliss 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban economics''' is broadly the economic study of [[urban area]]s; as such, it involves using the tools of [[economics]] to analyze urban issues such as crime, education, public transit, housing, and local government finance. More narrowly, it is a branch of [[microeconomics]] that studies urban spatial structure and the location of households and firms {{Harvcol |Quigley|2008|}}.

Much urban economic analysis relies on a particular model of urban spatial structure, the monocentric city model pioneered in the 1960s by [[William Alonso]], [[Richard Muth]], and [[Edwin Mills (economist)|Edwin Mills]]. While most other forms of [[neoclassical economics]] do not account for spatial relationships between individuals and organizations, urban economics focuses on these spatial relationships to understand the economic motivations underlying the formation, functioning, and development of cities.

Since its formulation in 1964, [[Bid rent theory|Alonso's monocentric city model]] of a disc-shaped [[Central Business District]] (CBD) and surrounding residential region has served as a starting point for urban economic analysis. Monocentricity has weakened over time because of changes in technology, particularly, faster and cheaper transportation (which makes it possible for commuters to live farther from their jobs in the CBD) and communications (which allow back-office operations to move out of the CBD).

Additionally, recent research has sought to explain the polycentricity described in [[Joel Garreau]]'s [[Edge city|Edge City]]. Several explanations for polycentric expansion have been proposed and summarized in models that account for factors such as utility gains from lower average land rents and increasing (or constant returns) due to [[economies of agglomeration]] {{Harvcol |Strange|2008|}}.

==Introduction==
Urban economics is rooted in the location theories of [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen|von Thünen]], [[William Alonso|Alonso]], [[Walter Christaller|Christaller]], and [[August Lösch|Lösch]] that began the process of spatial economic analysis {{Harvcol |Capello|Nijkamp|2004| pp=3–4}}. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources, and as all economic phenomena take place within a geographical space, urban economics focuses on the allocation of resources across space in relation to urban areas {{Harvcol |Arnott|McMillen|2006| p=7}} {{Harvcol |McCann|2001|p=1}}. Other branches of economics ignore the spatial aspects of decision making but urban economics focuses not only on the location decisions of firms, but also of cities themselves as cities themselves represent centers of economic activity {{Harvcol |O'Sullivan|2003| p=1}}.

Many spatial economic topics can be analyzed within either an urban or regional economics framework as some economic phenomena primarily affect localized urban areas while others are felt over much larger regional areas {{Harvcol |McCann|2001|p=3 }}. Arthur O'Sullivan believes urban economics is divided into six related themes: market forces in the development of cities, land use within cities, urban transportation, urban problems and public policy, housing and public policy, and local government expenditures and taxes. {{Harvcol |O'Sullivan|2003| pp=13–14}}.

==Market forces in the development of cities==
Market forces in the development of cities relate to how the location decision of firms and households causes the development of cities. The nature and behavior of markets depends somewhat on their locations therefore market performance partly depends on geography.{{Harvcol |McCann|2001|p=1}}. If a firm locates in a geographically isolated region, their market performance will be different than a firm located in a concentrated region. The location decisions of both firms and households create cities that differ in size and economic structure. When industries cluster, like in the Silicon Valley in California, they create urban areas with dominant firms and distinct economies.

By looking at location decisions of firms and households, the urban economist is able to address why cities develop where they do, why some cities are large and others small, what causes economic growth and decline, and how local governments affect urban growth {{Harvcol |O'Sullivan|2003| p=14}}. Because urban economics is concerned with asking questions about the nature and workings of the economy of a city, models and techniques developed within the field are primarily designed to analyze phenomena that are confined within the limits of a single city {{Harvcol |McCann|2001|p=2}}.

==Land use==
Looking at land use within metropolitan areas, the urban economist seeks to analyze the spatial organization of activities within cities. In attempts to explain observed patterns of land use, the urban economist examines the intra-city location choices of firms and households. Considering the spatial organization of activities within cities, urban economics addresses questions in terms of what determines the price of land and why those prices vary across space, the economic forces that caused the spread of employment from the central core of cities outward, identifying land-use controls, such as zoning, and interpreting how such controls affect the urban economy {{Harvcol |O'Sullivan|2003| p=14}}.

==Economic policy==
Economic policy is often implemented at the urban level thus economic policy is often tied to urban policy {{Harvcol |McCann|2001| p=3}}. Urban problems and public policy tie into urban economics as the theme relates urban problems, such as poverty or crime, to economics by seeking to answer questions with economic guidance. For example, does the tendency for the poor to live close to one another make them even poorer? {{Harvcol |O'Sullivan|2003| p=15}}.

==Transportation and economics==
Urban transportation is a theme of urban economics because it affects land-use patterns as transportation affects the relative accessibility of different sites. Issues that tie urban transportation to urban economics include the deficit that most transit authorities have, and efficiency questions about proposed transportation developments such as light-rail {{Harvcol |O'Sullivan|2003| p=14}}. Megaprojects such as this have been shown to be synonymous with unexpected costs and questionable benefits.&lt;ref name="Bent Flyvbjerg"&gt;Bent Flyvbjerg, 2013, "Mega Delusional: The Curse of the Megaproject", New Scientist, December 2, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing and public policy==
Housing and public policy relate to urban economics as housing is a unique type of commodity. Because housing is immobile, when a household chooses a dwelling, it is also choosing a location. Urban economists analyze the location choices of households in conjunction with the market effects of housing policies {{Harvcol |O'Sullivan|2003| p=15}}.
In analyzing housing policies, we make use of market structures e.g., perfect market structure. There are however problems encountered in making this analysis such as funding, uncertainty, space, etc.

==Government expenditures and taxes==
The final theme of local government expenditures and taxes relates to urban economics as it analyzes the efficiency of the fragmented local governments presiding in metropolitan areas {{Harvcol |O'Sullivan|2003| p=15}}.

[[File:WAM pied girl.jpg|thumb|A woman who has been pied]]

'''Wet and messy fetish (WAM)''', also known as '''sploshing''', is a form of [[sexual fetishism]] whereby a person becomes aroused when copious amounts of a substance are applied to the naked skin, face, or to clothing.{{r|Gates (2000)}} Several dozen websites are dedicated to WAM.

Many people with WAM fetishes are drawn to the tactile sensations of wet or messy substances against their skin. Other individuals simply prefer the visual appeal of others getting wet or messy with products that have different textures, consistencies and colours. A subject will often be [[pieing|pelted with cream pies]] (sometimes using shaving foam rather than real cream pie filling), have slime dumped on them, or sit on cakes. Another common theme is the pouring of substances inside clothing while it is being worn; clothing chosen for this can vary from swimsuits or underwear to full outfits. Normal street clothes, either casual or office wear, are commonly featured in WAM productions, but many other types of outfits, from wedding attire to industrial overalls or more specialist fetishwear such as PVC, latex, or leather items may be used. White items are particularly popular with some fans of this fetish.

Messy substances most commonly focused on by WAM participants include whipped cream, raw eggs, milk, lotion (see [[lotion play]]), paint, oil, mud, pudding, chocolate sauce, fruit juice, beer, shaving foam, custard, baked beans, [[treacle]], ketchup, ice cream, peanut butter, [[gunge|slime]], and cake batter, among others.

A fetish for bodily fluids such as feces, urine, vomit, semen, and [[Female ejaculation|female ejaculate]] is not considered part of WAM. The former three are typically considered [[coprophilia]], [[urophilia]], and [[emetophilia]]; urophilia is somewhat commonly found in mainstream pornography.{{r|Gates (2000)}} The later two are also somewhat mainstream.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

WAM fetish videos (made by both fans and commercial producers) may include nudity and sexual acts, while others may only feature fully clothed participants. Videos can frequently be seen on public video hosting sites like YouTube. Some of these videos are flagged but most of them remain available despite the sexual undertones, mainly because a large majority of wet and messy videos posted publicly do not include nudity and are therefore considered suitable for all audiences to view. Indeed, not only is much WAM video content indistinguishable in any easily defined sense from the kind of [[slapstick]] featured in mainstream entertainment, but scenes of slimings or pieings from the mainstream media are often compiled and marketed by producers towards a WAM fetishist target audience.

==Crossover with other fetishes==
There is some crossover between the wet and messy fetish and clothing destruction fetishes. Some WAM productions will see models start out fully dressed, usually in quite smart outfits such as formal dresses or suits; they will then be covered in messy substances, after which their messy clothes are cut up, typically with scissors, leaving them naked or nearly so.

WAM is sometimes also combined with [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], where a subject is first restrained or chained up and then hosed down or messed up.  Wet and Messy fetishism lends itself well to domination/submission role-playing. 

"Cake Sitting" (the act of deliberately sitting on a large cake or gateaux, either clothed or nude) is often considered a sub-fetish in its own right, but may be linked to the [[crush fetish]].  While participants who sit on cakes for pleasure will do so for the tactile sensory experience, or as part of submissive role-playing, those who enjoy watching the act will often focus specifically on the crushing of the dessert as a visual stimulus for a sexual reaction.

==Psychology==
No conclusive research has been conducted into the psychology behind the fetish; however, it is not uncommon for fetishists to have had interest in the sensations of messy play since their formative years (age 3–4) with a sexual element manifesting with the onset of puberty. For many, the simple breaking of taboos—doing what one was told not to as a child—brings about a sense of personal liberation. In any form, the fetish is about sensual stimulation, whether visual, tactile, or otherwise.

One unproven theory is that individuals drawn to WAM have [[sensory processing disorder|low tactile sensitivity]], which is increased and intensified by wet substances acting as a lubricant under applied pressure or friction. "Messy play" is a common clinical therapy used in treating hypo-tactile patients (mostly pediatric cases) to give them an outlet and appropriate time and place to engage in mess-making.{{r|Kranowitz (2007)}}

Another aspect is the link to other fetishes, as some wet and messy play is done in a submissive or dominating way and has possible links to BDSM, the emphasis being on the humiliation of the victim, although this is often mitigated or negated by the victim taking it in good humour. The dominant partner inflicting the mess can also be an object of attraction as an assertive figure of playful mischief.

==In media==
The popular sex column ''[[Savage Love]]'' has mentioned WAM. In one article, there was a reply to a letter from the roommate of someone who masturbates with condiments, possibly for fetishistic purposes. [[Dan Savage|Daniel Savage]], the writer of ''Savage Love,'' did not condemn the use of condiments in that incident, but, instead, only chided the fetishist for using condiments that were later used by others.{{r|Savage (2004)}}

'''Where Do Teenagers Come From?''' was an American television teen comedy/documentary that aired as an ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' on March 5, 1980. The live action/animation  program was produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]] and was a sequel to the 1977 program ''[[My Mom's Having a Baby]].'' The special was notable for its signature song "Growing Up," written by Doug Goodwin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvmusicmuseum.com/documents/612.html From TV Music Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
When 12-year-old Kelly begins to experience changes in her body, she, along with Petey and Oscar,  once again visit Dr. Lendon Smith, who uses an animated film that explains in detail (via Smith's narraration) of how teenagers, especially young girls, experience adolescence and how her body changes.

==Critical reception==
As with the first outing, it also had its share of criticism for using a daytime program to showcase what was seen as [[sex education]]. However, this sequel was not as popular as the first outing.

==Cast==
*Shane Sinutko as Petey Evans
*Jarred Johnson as Oskar
*Rachael Longaker as Kelly
*[[Lendon Smith]] as himself
*Stephanie Steele as Julie

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15096">[[File:Zone of proximal development.svg|thumb|In the second circle, representing the zone of proximal development, students cannot complete tasks unaided, but can complete them with guidance.]]
The '''zone of proximal development''', often abbreviated as '''ZPD''', is the difference '''between''' what a learner can do without help, and what they can't do.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Zone of proximal development. (2009). In ''Penguin dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was introduced, but not fully developed, by psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896&amp;ndash;1934) during the last ten years of his life.&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2018). [https://www.routledge.com/Vygotsky-An-Intellectual-Biography/Yasnitsky/p/book/9781138806740 Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography]. London and New York: Routledge [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Yasnitsky_2018_Vygotsky_bookPreview.pdf BOOK PREVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky stated that a child follows an adult's example and gradually develops the ability to do certain tasks without help.&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Vygotsky: ''Mind in Society: Development of Higher Psychological Processes'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky and some other educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, L &amp; Winsler, A. (1995).  Vygotsky also felt that social interaction was very important when it came to learning. "Vygotsky: His life and works" and "Vygotsky's approach to development".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. Of Young Children. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934.jpg|thumb|Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934]]

The concept of the zone of proximal development was originally developed by Vygotsky to argue against the use of academic, knowledge-based tests as a means to gauge students' intelligence. He also created ZPD to further develop [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of children being lone learners.&lt;ref name="Scaffolding"&gt;''Zone of Proximal Development'' and ''Cultural Tools Scaffolding, Guided Participation'', 2006. In ''Key concepts in developmental psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference Database&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky spent a lot of time studying the impact of school instruction on children and noted that children grasp language concepts quite naturally, but that maths and writing don’t come naturally, that these are concepts taught in schools and tend to come along with some difficulty, while Piaget believed that there was a clear distinction between development and teaching. He said that development is a spontaneous process that is initiated and completed by the children, stemming from their own efforts. Piaget was a proponent of independent thinking and critical of the standard teacher-led instruction that was common practice in schools.&lt;ref name="Theories"&gt;Crain, W. (2010). Theories of development: Concepts and applications, 6th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Vygotsky saw natural, spontaneous development as important, but not all-important. He believed that children would not advance very far if they were left to discover everything on their own. It's crucial for a child's development that they are able to interact with more knowledgeable others. They would not be able to expand on what they know if this wasn't possible. He noted cultural experiences where children are greatly helped by knowledge and tools handed down from previous generations. Vygotsky noted that good teachers shouldn't present material that is too difficult and “pull the students along.”&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

Vygotsky argued that, rather than examining what a student knows to determine intelligence, it is better to examine their ability to solve problems independently and ability to solve problems with an adult's help.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, L &amp; Winsler, A. (1995).  "Vygotsky: His life and works" and "Vygotsky's approach to development".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. of Young Children. pp. 25&amp;ndash;34&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a question: "if two children perform the same on a test, are their levels of development the same?"

==Definition==
Since Vygotsky's original conception, the definition for the zone of proximal development has been expanded and modified. The zone of proximal development is an area of learning that occurs when a person is assisted by a teacher or peer with a higher skill set.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The person learning the skill set cannot complete it without the assistance of the teacher or peer. The teacher then helps the student attain the skill the student is trying to master, until the teacher is no longer needed for that task.&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, E. (2006). Zone of proximal development. In ''Encyclopaedic dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database&lt;/ref&gt;

Any function within the zone of proximal development matures within a particular internal context that includes not only the function’s actual level but also how susceptible the child is to types of help, the sequence in which these types of help are offered, the flexibility or rigidity of previously formed stereotypes, how willing the child is to collaborate, along with other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Bozhovich, E. D. (2009). Zone of Proximal Development: The Diagnostic Capabilities and Limitations of Indirect Collaboration. Journal of Russian &amp; East European Psychology, 47(6), 48-69. Retrieved from EBSCOHost Database&lt;/ref&gt; This context can impact the diagnosis of a function’s potential level of development.&lt;ref name="Zaretskii 2009" /&gt;

Vygotsky stated that we can’t just look at what students are capable of doing on their own; we have to look at what they are capable of doing in a social setting. In many cases students are able to complete a task within a group before they are able to complete it on their own. He notes that the teacher’s job is to move the child’s mind forward step-by-step (after all, teachers can’t teach complex chemical equations to first-graders). At the same time, teachers can’t teach all children equally; they must determine which students are ready for which lessons.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt; An example is the often-used [[Accelerated Reader|accelerated reading]] program in schools. Students are assessed and given a reading level and a range. Books rated below their level are easy to read, while books above their level challenge the student. Sometimes students are not even allowed to check out books from the school library that are outside their range. Vygotsky argued that a major shortcoming of [[standardized test]]s is that they only measure what students are capable of on their own, not in a group setting where their minds are being pushed by other students.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

In the context of [[Second-language acquisition|second language learning]], the ZPD can be useful to many adult users. Prompted by this fact as well as the finding that adult peers don't necessarily need to be more capable to provide assistance in the ZPD, Vygotsky’s definition has been adapted to better suit the adult L2 developmental context &lt;ref&gt;Fani, Tayebeh &amp; Ghaemi, Farid. (2011). Implications of Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) in Teacher Education: ZPTD and Self-scaffolding. Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences. 29. 1549-1554. 10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.11.396. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Scaffolding==

The concept of the ZPD is widely used to study children's mental development as it relates to education. The ZPD concept is seen as a [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], a structure of "support points" for performing an action.&lt;ref&gt;Obukhova, L. F., &amp; Korepanova, I. A. (2009). The Zone of Proximal Development: A Spatiotemporal Model. ''Journal of Russian &amp; East European Psychology'', 47(6), 25-47. {{doi|10.2753/RPO1061-0405470602}}&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the help or guidance received from an adult or more competent peer to permit the child to work within the ZPD.&lt;ref name="Morgan, A. 2009"&gt;Morgan, A. (2009, July 28). What is "Scaffolding" and the "ZPD"? Retrieved October 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Vygotsky himself never mentioned the term, scaffolding was first developed by [[Jerome Bruner]], David Wood, and Gail Ross, while applying Vygotsky's concept of ZPD to various educational contexts.&lt;ref name="Scaffolding"/&gt; According to Wass and Golding, giving students the hardest tasks they can do with scaffolding leads to the greatest learning gains.&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;Wass, R., &amp; Golding, C. (2014). Sharpening a tool for teaching: the zone of proximal development. ''Teaching in Higher Education'', 19(6), 671-684.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scaffolding is a process through which a teacher or a more competent peer helps a student in their ZPD as necessary and tapers off this aid as it becomes unnecessary—much as workers remove a scaffold from a building after they complete construction. "Scaffolding [is] the way the adult guides the child's learning via focused questions and positive interactions."&lt;ref&gt;Balaban, Nancy. (1995). "Seeing the Child, Knowing the Person." In Ayers, W. ''To Become a Teacher''. Teachers College Press. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been further developed by [[Mercedes Chaves Jaime]], [[Ann Brown]], among others. Several instructional programs were developed based on this interpretation of the ZPD, including [[reciprocal teaching]] and [[dynamic assessment]]. For scaffolding to be effective, one must start at the child's level of knowledge and build from there.&lt;ref name="Morgan, A. 2009"/&gt; 

One example of children using ZPD is when they are learning to speak. As their [[speech]] develops, it influences the way the child thinks, which in turn influences the child's manner of speaking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This process opens more doors for the child to expand their vocabulary. As they learn to convey their thoughts in a more effective way, they receive more sophisticated feedback, therefore increasing their vocabulary and their speaking skills. Wells gives the example of dancing: when a person is learning how to dance, they look to others around them on the dance floor and imitate their moves. A person does not copy the dance moves exactly, but takes what they can and adds their own personality to it.&lt;ref name="Wells 1999"&gt;Wells, G. (1999). ''Dialogic Inquiries in education: Building on the legacy of Vygotsky''. Cambridge University Press. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mathematics, proximal development uses [[mathematical exercise]]s for which students have seen one or more worked examples. In secondary school some scaffolding is provided, and generally much less at the tertiary level. Ultimately students must find library resources or a tutor when presented with challenges beyond the zone.

Another example of scaffolding is learning to drive. Parents and [[driving]] instructors guide driving students along the way by showing them the mechanics of how the car operates, the correct hand positions on the steering wheel, the technique of scanning the roadway, etc. As the student progresses, less and less instruction is needed, until they are ready to drive on their own.

The concept of scaffolding can be observed in various life situations and arguably in the basis of how everyone learns. One does not (normally) begin knowing everything that there is to know about a subject. The basics must be learned first so one can build on prior knowledge towards mastery of a particular subject or skill. 

== Implications for educators ==
Various investigations, using different approaches and research frameworks have proved collaborative learning to be effective in many kinds of settings and contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, P., Wineburg, S., &amp; Woolworth, S. (2001). Toward a theory of teacher community. ''[[Teachers College Record]]'', ''103''(6), 942-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should assign tasks that students cannot do on their own, but which they can do with assistance; they should provide just enough assistance so that students learn to complete the tasks independently and then provide an environment that enables students to do harder tasks than would otherwise be possible.&lt;ref name="Wass" /&gt; Teachers can also allow students with more knowledge to assist students who need more assistance. Especially in the context of collaborative learning, group members who have higher levels of understanding can help the less advanced members learn within their zone of proximal development. &lt;ref&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2012). Zone of proximal development. Retrieved from www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of adults, peers should challenge each other in order to support collaboration and success.&lt;ref&gt;Kuusisaari, H.
