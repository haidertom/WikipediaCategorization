'''AFLP-PCR''' or just '''AFLP''' is a [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR-based]] tool used in [[genetics]] research, [[DNA fingerprint]]ing, and in the practice of [[genetic engineering]]. Developed in the early 1990s by [[Keygene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Keygene.com | url = http://www.keygene.com | accessdate = 10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFLP uses [[restriction enzymes]] to digest [[Genome|genomic DNA]], followed by [[DNA ligase|ligation]] of [[adapter (genetics)|adaptors]] to the [[sticky ends]] of the [[restriction fragment]]s. A subset of the restriction fragments is then selected to be amplified. This selection is achieved by using [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]]s complementary to the adaptor sequence, the restriction site sequence and a few nucleotides inside the restriction site fragments (as described in detail below). The amplified fragments are separated and visualized on denaturing on [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] , either through [[autoradiography]] or [[fluorescence]] methodologies, or via automated capillary sequencing instruments.

Although AFLP is commonly referred to as "Amplified fragment length polymorphism", the resulting data are not scored as length polymorphisms, but instead as presence-absence polymorphisms.&lt;ref name="nar.oxfordjournals"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vos P, Hogers R, Bleeker M |title=AFLP: a new technique for DNA fingerprinting |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=23 |issue=21 |pages=4407–14 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7501463 |pmc=307397 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7501463 |doi=10.1093/nar/23.21.4407|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AFLP-PCR is a highly sensitive method for detecting [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s in [[DNA]]. The technique was originally described by Vos and Zabeau in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Zabeau, M and P. Vos. 1993. Selective restriction fragment amplification: a general method for DNA fingerprinting. European Patent Office, publication 0 534 858 A1, bulletin 93/13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nar.oxfordjournals" /&gt; In detail, the procedure of this technique is divided into three steps:

#Digestion of total cellular DNA with one or more [[restriction enzyme]]s and ligation of restriction half-site specific adaptors to all restriction fragments.
#Selective amplification of some of these fragments with two PCR primers that have corresponding adaptor and restriction site specific sequences.
#[[Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids|Electrophoretic separation]] of [[amplicon]]s on a gel matrix, followed by visualisation of the band pattern.

==Applications==
[[Image:AFLP Clustering Analysis.jpg|thumb|300px|AFLP phylogeny analysis using a [[dendrogram]]]]
The AFLP technology has the capability to detect various polymorphisms in different genomic regions simultaneously. It is also highly sensitive and reproducible. As a result, AFLP has become widely used for the identification of genetic variation in strains or closely related species of plants, fungi, animals, and bacteria. The AFLP technology has been used in criminal and paternity tests, also to determine slight differences within populations, and in linkage studies to generate maps for [[quantitative trait locus]] (QTL) analysis.

There are many advantages to AFLP when compared to other marker technologies including randomly amplified polymorphic DNA ([[RAPD]]), [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP), and [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s. AFLP not only has higher reproducibility, resolution, and sensitivity at the whole genome level compared to other techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mueller UG, Wolfenbarger LL |title=AFLP genotyping and fingerprinting |journal=Trends Ecol. Evol. |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=389–394 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10481200 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534799016596 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01659-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but it also has the capability to amplify between 50 and 100 fragments at one time. In addition, no prior sequence information is needed for amplification (Meudt &amp; Clarke 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meudt HM, Clarke AC |title=Almost forgotten or latest practice? AFLP applications, analyses and advances |journal=Trends Plant Sci. |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=106–17 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17303467 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2007.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, AFLP has become extremely beneficial in the study of taxa including bacteria, fungi, and plants, where much is still unknown about the genomic makeup of various organisms.

The AFLP technology is covered by patents and patent applications of Keygene N.V. AFLP is a registered trademark of Keygene N.V.

{{Political campaigning}}

In [[political campaign]]s, an '''attack ad''' is an [[advertisement]] whose message is designed to wage a personal attack against an opposing candidate or [[political party]] in order to gain support for the attacking candidate and attract voters. Attack ads often form part of [[negative campaigning]] or [[smear campaign]]s, and in large or well-financed campaigns, may be disseminated via [[mass media]].

An attack ad will generally unfairly criticize an opponent's [[party platform|political platform]], usually by pointing out its faults. Often the ad will simply make use of innuendo, based on [[opposition research]].

Televised attack ads rose to prominence in the United States in the 1960s, especially since [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations require over-the-air [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] TV stations with licenses issued by the FCC—effectively all regulated TV stations, since others would either be [[Public broadcasting|public television]] or be [[Pirate television|pirated]]—to air political ads by both parties, whether it be attack ads or more traditional political ads. Although [[cable television]] and the Internet are not required to air such ads, attack ads have become commonplace on both mediums as well.

==Examples==

===United States===
[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|300px|thumbtime=3|"Daisy" advertisement]]
One of the earliest and most famous television attack ads, known as "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]", was used by [[Lyndon Johnson]] against [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]]. The ad opened with a young girl innocently picking petals from a daisy, while a man's voice performed a countdown to zero. It then zoomed in to an extreme close-up to her eye, and cut to an image of a [[nuclear explosion]]. The ad was shocking and disturbing, but also very effective. It convinced many that Goldwater's more aggressive approach to fighting the [[Cold War]] could result in a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear conflict]].&lt;ref name="daisy"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er5h_TXun6o|title=Daisy Girl|medium=Television ad|people=Schwartz, Tony (director)|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attack ads were used again by the campaign of [[George H.W. Bush]] against Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]]. The two most famous were the "Willie Horton" and "Tank Ride" ads. The "Willie Horton" ad began with a statement of Vice President Bush's support of the death penalty. Then it described the case of [[Willie Horton]], who was convicted of murder. The ad state that Governor Dukakis's prison furlough program (unsupervised weekend passes from Massachusetts prison) released Horton ten times; in one of those furloughs, he kidnapped a young couple, stabbed the boy and repeatedly raped the girl. The ad ended with, "Weekend prison passes. Dukakis on crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTdUQ9SYhUw|chapter=Analysis of a "Willie Horton" ad from the 1988 campaign|title=Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story|publisher=InterPositive Media|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Tank Ride" ad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm10.html |title=Michael Dukakis, 1988 – Another Landmark Image |work=100 Photographs that Changed the World |publisher=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801060800/http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm10.html |archivedate=August 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1988 was an attack on Dukakis by the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presidentialcampaign2004.coas.missouri.edu/general/spots_analysis/bush88tank_movie.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202175405/http://presidentialcampaign2004.coas.missouri.edu/general/spots_analysis/bush88tank_movie.html|archivedate=2008-02-02|title=Presidential Campaign 2004 – Their Message and Their Analysis|publisher=TV Spot History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ad was inaccurate, it created a lasting negative impression and helped guarantee Dukakis' defeat. The ad suggested that Bush was more supportive of [[military spending]] and weapons programs than Dukakis. The footage, pulled from the news media, showed Dukakis riding a tank in his attempt to counter the claim that he was weak on defense. He wore a large, oversized helmet and a wide smile, which was used by the GOP to insinuate that he was a fool. The GOP also added gear sounds from an [[Semi-trailer truck|18-wheeler truck]] to imply that Dukakis could not run the tank smoothly – although tanks do not have gears that grind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geer, John G.|year=2006|title=In Defense of Negativity: attack ads in presidential campaigns|location=Chicago|publisher=the University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226284996|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primaries]] featured an ad by [[Hillary Clinton]] directed at her main rival at the time, [[Barack Obama]], which aired days before the [[Texas Democratic primary and caucuses, 2008|Texas primary]]. The ad began by showing children asleep in bed while phone rang in the background. A [[voice-over]] stated that it was 3 a.m., the phone was ringing in the [[White House]], and that "something’s happening in the world". The voice-over then asked voters if they wanted someone who "already knows the world’s leaders, knows the military" and is "tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world" to pick up the phone.&lt;ref name="oldref8"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yr7odFUARg|title=Hillary Clinton Ad – 3 AM White House Ringing Phone|year=2008|publisher=Hillary Clinton campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Obama was never mentioned by name, the implication was clear and the ad set off a firestorm of discussion and controversy, causing even Obama himself to respond and describe it as an ad that "play[ed] on people’s fears", predicting it would not work.&lt;ref name="oldref9"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/us/politics/01campaign.html?_r=1|author=Seelye, Katherine Q.|author2=Zeleny, Jeff.|date=March 1, 2008|title=Clinton Questions Role of Obama in Crisis|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the campaign, after Obama had become the Democratic nominee, Republican nominee [[John McCain]] echoed a similar sentiment. In a controversial ad called "Celebrity", McCain's campaign asked, "[Barack Obama] is the biggest celebrity in the world. But, is he ready to lead?" The ad juxtaposed Obama supporters with photos of [[Britney Spears]] and [[Paris Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McCain calls Obama the biggest celebrity in the world|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/07/30/mccain-ad-calls-obama-biggest-celebrity-in-the-world/|work=CNN Politics|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, attack ads had spread online as political candidates publish their ads on [[YouTube]]. [[Carly Fiorina]], a Republican candidate from California, released a video on YouTube depicting former Republican opponent [[Tom Campbell (California politician)|Tom Campbell]], as a "[[Fiscal conservative]] in name only”.&lt;ref name="oldref5"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/us/politics/21ads.html|author=Steinhauer, Jennifer|date=March 20, 2010|title=Dose of Venom for Candidates Turns Ads Viral|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
The first attack ads of the [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006 Mexican general election]] were launched by the conservative [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] against [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]]; the ad claimed that López Obrador's "populistic" proposals would drive Mexico further into economic crisis and bankruptcy. The [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] answered with attack ads against the current president [[Felipe Calderón]], claiming that he was partly culpable for the [[Mexican peso crisis|1994 economic crisis]]; since Calderón was running with a motto of "the president of employment", the ads closed with, "dirty hands, zero employments". After López Obrador alleged that Calderón was illegally patronizing his brother-in-law [[Hildebrando Zavala]], the tagline was changed to "dirty hands, one employment for his brother-in-law".

===Canada===
Although it has been found that [[Elections in Canada|Canadian elections]] are less likely to use attack ads than US elections, there is still remains a strong presence of negative ads in Canadian campaigns. Comparatively, Canadians were more likely to use acclaim ads- or ads that praise another individual- than Americans, as American campaigns are much more likely to use attack ads than Canadian campaigns. Overall, however, Canadian campaigns are more likely to use attack ads than acclaim ads, similarly to the US.&lt;ref&gt;Mahone, J. A. (2009). ''A comparative content analysis of televised political advertising in the United States and Canada in 2004 and 2008'' (Order No. 1478438). Available from ProQuest Central. (304874542). Retrieved from http://proxyau.wrlc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/304874542?accountid=8285&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political usage ===
Political attack ads across all types of media can have different strategic aims. Some are character attacks, trying to persuade the viewer to think differently about a candidates character in hopes that they will reconsider their perception of the candidate and who they are as a person. Another strategy is an attack on the candidates' policy or political ideas. This attempts to derail one's support for a candidate by persuading them that the candidate-under-attack's political ideas are illogical or will be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Elmelund-PrÃ¦stekÃ¦r, Christian. “Beyond American Negativity: toward a General Understanding of the Determinants of Negative Campaigning.” ''European Political Science Review'', vol. 2, no. 01, 2010, p. 137., [[doi:10.1017/s1755773909990269]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-political usage===
While attack ads have primarily been relegated for political usage, there have been some instances of private businesses running them. In 2013, [[Highmark]], a healthcare company associated with the [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]], and the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC) were unable to reach an agreement on whether Highmark's insurance would be accepted at UPMC. Highmark also entered into negotiations to acquire the struggling [[West Penn Allegheny Health System]]; Highmark and UPMC then started airing attack ads at each other. Both parties' ads accused the other of pushing patients with their respective health insurance plans to hospitals operated by their respective health insurance provider, as well as attacking each other's [[nonprofit]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/08/01/upmc-and-highmark-engage-in-tv-ad-war/|title=UPMC and Highmark Engage in TV Ad Wars|date=August 1, 2003|publisher=CBS Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/4481931-74/upmc-highmark-health#axzz2bXiuA6El|author=Pucko, Timothy|author2=Conti, David|title=UPMC sues Highmark over advertising campaign|date=August 5, 2013|publisher=TribeLive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/upmc-pittsburgh-stake-positions-for-court-fight-on-nonprofit-status-680393/|author=Hamill, Sean D.|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|title=UPMC, Pittsburgh stake positions for court fight on nonprofit status|date=March 22, 2013|publisher= PG Publishing Co., Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on voter turnout ==
Studies suggest that attack ads have no effect on [[Voter turnout]] in the United States. There is, in fact, a noted negative impact on voter turnout by some researches, but it has no bearing on the evidence as it is statistically insignificant. The only case in which evidence reveals a correlation between negative advertising and voter turnout is for "late" negativity. This is when two conditions exist for the voter: they have already selected their preferred candidate and the attack and the negativity is about their selected candidate. If these two conditions exist, there is a negative effect on voter turnout. In this case, a forty percent increase in "late" negative ads will decrease the likelihood of turnout by 0.087, and a sixty percent increase in late ads merits a 0.145 decrease in turnout. Thus, the only case in which attack ads have been found to effect on voter turn out is when the voter has already selected their candidate, as they realize that their candidate is potentially no better than the alternative options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krupnikov|first=Yanna|date=2011-10-01|title=When Does Negativity Demobilize? Tracing the Conditional Effect of Negative Campaigning on Voter Turnout|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00522.x/abstract|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=55|issue=4|pages=797–813|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00522.x|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Studies claim that 82% of Americans dislike attack ads, and 53% believe that the "ethics and values" of election campaigns have worsened since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipsitz|first=Keena|author2=Trost, Christine|author3= Grossmann, Matthew|author4= Sides, John|title=What Voters Want From Political Campaign Communication|journal=Political Communication|date=1 July 2005|volume=22|issue=3|pages=337–354|doi=10.1080/10584600591006609|url=http://home.gwu.edu/~jsides/polcomm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting public see attack ads as an element of smear campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gann Hall|first=M.|author2=Bonneau, C. W.|title=Attack Advertising, the White Decision, and Voter Participation in State Supreme Court Elections|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=January 20, 2012|volume=66|issue=1|pages=115–126|doi=10.1177/1065912911433296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates that voters are open to candidates attacking each other if the issues in question are "appropriate". In a 1999 survey of Virginia voters, 80.7% felt it is fair for a candidate to criticize an opponent for "talking one way and voting another", though but only 7.7% feel it is fair for a candidate to attack an opponent for the "behavior of his/her family members".&lt;ref name="freedman"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freedman, P.|author2=Lawton, D.|author3=Wood, W.|title=Do's and Don'ts of Negative Ads: What Voters Say|journal=Campaign Elections|volume=20|pages=20–25|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political operatives, however, have found attack ads to be useful, and [[social psychologist]]s claim that negative information has a tendency "to be more influential than equally extreme or equally likely positive information."&lt;ref name=Lau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lau|first=Richard R.|author2=Rovner, Ivy Brown|title=Negative Campaigning|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=June 1, 2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=285–306|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.071905.101448|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/lau/articles/Lau-Rovner_NegativeCampaigning.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Toronto]] professor Scott Hawkins "suggests that even a mention in the media that a candidate or party is planning to run negative advertisements can be beneficial, since it plants seeds of doubt in the voter's mind, especially early in the campaign when voters tend to be less involved.

In the United States, researchers have consistently found that negative advertising has positive effects. Negative advertising "is likely to stimulate voters by increasing the degree to which they care about the election's outcome or by increasing ties to their party’s nominee;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stevenfinkel.info/files/Finkel%20and%20Geer%201998.pdf|author=Finkel, Steven E.|author2=Geer, John G.|title=A Spot Check: Casting Doubt on the Demobilizing Effect of Attack Advertising|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=42|number=2|date=April 1998|pages=573–595|doi=10.2307/2991771}}&lt;/ref&gt; it makes the election seem more important, and thus increases [[voter turnout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Ken|author2=Freedman, Paul|title=Campaign Advertising and Voter Turnout: New Evidence for a Stimulation Effect|journal=The Journal of Politics|year=2002|volume=64|issue=3|doi=10.1111/0022-3816.00143|pages=721–740|jstor=1520110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found that negative advertisements only appeal to [[Partisan (political)|partisan voters]], and that it alienates independents, causing elections to be fought among partisan extremes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iyengar, Shanto|author2=Ansolabehere, Stephen|title=Going negative : how attack ads shrink and polarize the electorate|year=1996|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=9780684822846|edition=1st paperbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backfires===
If an ad is seen as going too far or being "too personal", voters may turn against the party that put the ad out. For example, in the Canada [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative (PC) Party]] attacked [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]] by implicitly [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|mocking his Bell's Palsy partial facial paralysis]]. Outrage followed, and the PC Party's image was badly damaged in the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=1993: Is this a prime minister?|work=Political Attack Ads|publisher=CBC News Online|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/who-attackads/|medium=Interactive graphic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election, when they created an attack ad suggesting that Conservative leader [[Stephen Harper]] would use armed Canadian soldiers to police major cities. Though [[2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads|the ads]] were never aired, they diminished the believability of other ads by the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canadavotes2006/national/2006/01/12/elxn-libs-research-military.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225113027/http://www.cbc.ca/story/canadavotes2006/national/2006/01/12/elxn-libs-research-military.html|archivedate=February 25, 2008|title=Martin says he only approved transcript of controversial 'soldiers ad|date=January 12, 2008|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leaked copy, broadcast on the news, offended many Canadians, particularly the [[Military of Canada|military]], some of whom were fighting in Afghanistan at the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the run up to and the [[2015 Canadian federal election]] itself, [[Justin Trudeau]], Leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and the son of Canadian Prime Minister, [[Pierre Trudeau]], was subjected to a sustained negative ad campaign by the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. However, the "Just Not Ready" campaign was judged by the public as unfair and mocking of the Liberal leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Bradley|title=Stephen Harper underestimated Justin Trudeau, but it was the mocking way he did it that cost him the election|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-20/stephen-harper-underestimated-justin-trudeau-it-was-mocking-way-he-did-it-cost|accessdate=October 21, 2015|work=PRI|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, the advertising campaign lowered public expectations of Trudeau's performance that even Conservative personnel noted that he would impress people if he showed any display of competence in public events such as the televised debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamilton|first1=Graeme|title=Graeme Hamilton: Justin Trudeau’s stunning victory for the Liberals should finally silence his doubters|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/graeme-hamilton-justin-trudeau-emerges-victorious-from-an-election-campaign-that-should-finally-silence-his-doubters|accessdate=October 21, 2015|work=National Post|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That proved to be the case, and Trudeau took advantage of the public's low expectations to impress the public with his articulate and passionate manner to garner support throughout the campaign until his party won a [[majority government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gagnon|first1=Michelle|title=Justin Trudeau's rise shows the benefits of being underestimated|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-justin-trudeau-michelle-gagnon-1.3259553|accessdate=October 21, 2015|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Republican challenger [[Paul R. Nelson]] campaigned against Democrat [[Ron Kind]] for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Nelson's ad stated, "Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money, he’d just rather spend it on sex," and, "Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|medium=Television ad|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKln7salIrg|title=Paul R. Nelsion Sex Studies Ad|publisher=Paul R. Nelson for Congress Committee|location=Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson’s challenge fell short, as Ron Kind was reelected, while the attack's outrageous presentation provoked an uproar from Republicans and Democrats alike.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A 1999 survey showed that challengers lose almost 3 points on the feeling thermometer (a 100-point scale used to assess survey-takers feelings on certain issues)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Survey Research Methods|title=Feeling Thermometer|editor-first=Paul J.|editor-last=Lavrakas|author=Nelson, Shannon C.|isbn=9781412918084|url=http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/encyclopedia-of-survey-research-methods/n183.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a candidate engages in [[mudslinging]].

== Front groups ==
Campaigns often establish or support [[front groups]] (organizations that appear to be independent [[voluntary association]]s or [[Charity organization|charity]]) to run counter-attack ads. This technique ties into the wider practice of [[astroturfing]]. Former political [[speechwriter]] [[Leonard Steinhorn]] points out that "issue ads" run by front groups use deceptive names to hide their true sponsors – such as the pharmaceutical industry–backed [[United Seniors Association]], which spent $17 million on ads during the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 US presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Leonard Steinhorn|author=Steinhorn, Leonard|year=2004|chapter=Ads Are Us: Political Advertising in a Mass Media Culture|title=Campaigns and Elections American Style|editor1-first=James A.|editor1-last=Thurber|editor2-first=Candice J.|editor2-last=Nelson|location=Boulder|publisher=Westview Press|page=121|isbn=9780813341811}}&lt;/ref&gt; As front ads are not controlled by the candidates they support, the candidates are insulated from criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Robert N.|title=Winning the War of Words: The "Front Group" Label in Contemporary Consumer Politics|journal=The Journal of American Culture|date=February 23, 2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=96–109|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2007.00467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic coupling occurs when two works [[citation|reference]] a common third work in their [[Bibliography|bibliographies]]. It is an indication that a probability exists that the two works treat a related subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martyn | first1 = J | year = 1964 | title = Bibliographic coupling | url = | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 20 | issue = 4| page = 236 | doi=10.1108/eb026352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two documents are ''bibliographically coupled'' if they both ''cite'' one or more documents in common. The "coupling strength" of two given documents is higher the more citations to other documents they share. The figure to the right illustrates the concept of bibliographic coupling. In the figure, documents A and B both cite documents C, D and E. Thus, documents A and B have a bibliographic coupling strength of 3 - the number of elements in the intersection of their two reference lists.

Similarly, two authors are ''bibliographically coupled'' if the cumulative reference lists of their respective oeuvres each contain a reference to a common document, and their coupling strength also increases with the citations to other documents that their share. If the cumulative reference list of an author's oeuvre is determined as the [[multiset]] union of the documents that the author has co-authored, then the ''author bibliographic coupling strength'' of two authors (or more precisely, of their oeuvres) is defined as the size of the multiset intersection of their cumulative reference lists, however.&lt;ref name="DOI: 10.1002/asi.20910"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = D. | last2 = Strotmann | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Evolution of research activities and intellectual influences in information science 1996–2005: Introducing author bibliographic-coupling analysis | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 59 | issue = 13| pages = 2070–2086 | doi = 10.1002/asi.20910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic coupling can be useful in a wide variety of fields, since it helps researchers find related research done in the past. On the other hand, two documents are '''[[Co-citation|co-cited]]''' if they are both independently ''cited by'' one or more documents.

==History==
The concept of '''bibliographic coupling''' was introduced by M. M. Kessler of [[MIT]] in a paper published in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;"Bibliographic coupling between scientific papers," ''American Documentation'' 24 (1963), pp. 123-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been embraced in the work of the information scientist [[Eugene Garfield]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Multiple Independent Discovery and Creativity in Science," ''Current Contents'', Nov. 3, 1980, pp. 5-10, reprinted in [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays.html Essays of an Information Scientist], vol. 4 (1979-80), pp. 660-665.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest citation analysis methods for document similarity computation and some have questioned its usefulness, pointing out that two works may reference completely unrelated subject matter in the third. Furthermore, bibliographic coupling is a retrospective similarity measure,&lt;ref&gt;Garfield Eugene, 2001.[http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/drexelbelvergriffith92001.pdf ''From Bibliographic Coupling to Co-Citation Analysis via Algorithmic Historio-Bibliography''] presented at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/ref&gt; meaning the information used to establish the similarity relationship between documents lies in the past and is static, i.e. bibliographic coupling strength cannot change over time, since outgoing citation counts are fixed.

The [[Co-citation|'''co-citation''' analysis]] approach introduced by Henry Small and published in 1973 addressed this shortcoming of bibliographic coupling by considering a document's incoming citations to assess similarity, a measure that can change over time. Additionally, the co-citation measure reflects the opinion of many authors and thus represents a better indicator of subject similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Small, 1973. [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf "Co-citation in the scientific literature: A new measure of the relationship between two documents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202085010/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf |date=2012-12-02 }}. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' (JASIS), volume 24(4), pp. 265-269. doi = 10.1002/asi.4630240406&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Robert Amsler published a paper&lt;ref&gt;Robert Amsler, Dec. 1972 [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL12801639W/Applications_of_citation-based_automatic_classification?v=2 "Applications of citation-based automatic classification"], Linguistics Research Center, University Texas at Austin, Technical Report 72-14.&lt;/ref&gt; describing a measure for determining subject similarity between two documents by fusing bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webla.sourceforge.net/javadocs/pt/tumba/links/Amsler.html Class Amsler] written by Bruno Martins and developed by the XLDB group of the ''Department of Informatics'' of the ''Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon'' in Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Howard White and Belver Griffith introduced author co-citation analysis (ACA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = Howard D. | last2 = Griffith | first2 = Belver C. | year = 1981 | title = Author Cocitation: A Literature Measure of Intellectual Structure | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 163–171 | doi = 10.1002/asi.4630320302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 2008 did Dangzhi Zhao and Andreas Strotmann combine their work and that of M. M. Kessler to define author bibliographic coupling analysis (ABCA), noting that as long as authors are active this metric is not static and that it is particularly useful when combined with ACA.&lt;ref name="DOI: 10.1002/asi.20910"/&gt;

More recently, in 2009, Gipp and Beel introduced a new approach termed [[Co-citation Proximity Analysis]] (CPA). CPA is based on the concept of co-citation, but represents a refinement to Small's measure in that CPA additionally considers the placement and proximity of citations within a document's full-text. The assumption is that citations in closer proximity are more likely to exhibit a stronger similarity relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel, 2009 [http://gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp09a.pdf Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) – ''A new approach for identifying related work based on Co-Citation Analysis''] in Proceedings of the 12th international conference on scientometrics and informetrics (issi’09), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), 2009, pp. 571-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, a chronological overview of citation analysis methods includes: 
* Bibliographic coupling (1963) 
* Co-citation analysis (published 1973) 
* Amsler measure (1972)
* Author co-citation analysis (1981)
* Author bibliographic coupling analysis (2008)
* Co-citation proximity analysis (CPA) (2009)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">In classical [[tragedies]], the '''catastasis''' (pl. ''catastases'') is the third part of an ancient [[drama]], in which the intrigue or action that was initiated in the [[epitasis]], is supported and heightened, until ready to be unravelled in the [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. It also refers to the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]], the '''catastasis''' is that part of a speech, usually the [[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], in which the orator sets forth the subject matter to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not a classical one; it was invented by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Scaliger]] in his ''Poetics'' (published posthumously in 1561).&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Walker, ''Shakespeare and the Classical Tradition: An Annotated Bibliography, 1961-1991'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002: {{ISBN|0-8240-6697-9}}), p. 639; Scaliger wrote: "catastasis est vigor ac status fabulae, in qua res miscetur in ea fortunae tempestate, in quam subducta est."&lt;/ref&gt; It "is more or less equivalent to the ''summa epitasis'' of Donatus and Latomus and to what Willichius sometimes called the ''extrema epitasis'',"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin T. Herrick, ''Comic Theory in the Sixteenth Century'' (University of Illinois Press, 1950), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used in 1616 in England.&lt;ref&gt;Frank N. Magill, ''Critical Survey of Literary Theory: Authors, A-Sw'' (Salem Press, 1987: {{ISBN|0-89356-393-5}}), p. 1284.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cultural artifact''', or '''cultural artefact''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|American and British English spelling differences]]), is a term used in the [[social sciences]], particularly [[anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4SIXk2bp5u8C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=The+pragmalinguistic+analysis+of+narrative+texts&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title = The pragmalinguistic analysis of narrative texts | author = Richard J. Watts | isbn=978-3-87808-443-3 | year=1981 | publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ethnology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;q=warrabarna+kaurna!&amp;btnG=Search+Books | title = Warrabarna Kaurna! | author = Rob Amery}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} for anything created by [[human]]s which gives information about the [[culture]] of its creator and users. &lt;!-- the article should be expanded, and this sentence would be a good start, but it just is not clear enough without rewriting or explanation. The artifact may change over time in what it represents, how it appears and how and why it is used as the culture changes over time.--&gt; ''Artifact'' is the spelling in [[North American English]]; ''artefact'' is usually preferred elsewhere.

Cultural artifact is a more generic term and should be considered with two words of similar, but narrower, nuance: it can include objects recovered from [[archaeological site]]s, i.e. [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]], but can also include objects of modern or early-modern society, or '''social artifacts'''. For example, in an anthropological context: a 17th-century [[lathe]], a piece of [[faience]], or a [[television]] each provides a wealth of information about the time in which they were manufactured and used.

Cultural artifacts, whether ancient or current, have a significance because they offer an insight into: technological processes, economic development and social structure, among other attributes.

The philosopher [[Marx W. Wartofsky]] categorised artifacts as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wartofsky, Marx W. (1979). Models: Representation and scientific understanding. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Reidel.&lt;/ref&gt;
* primary artifacts: used in production (such as a hammer, a fork, a lamp or a camera);
* secondary artifacts: relating to primary artifacts (such as a user-manual for a camera);
* tertiary artifacts: representations of secondary artifacts (such as a picture of a user-manual for a camera).

Social artifacts, unlike archaeological artifacts, do not need to have a physical form (for example [[virtual artifact]]), nor to be of historical value (items created seconds ago can be classified as social artifacts).

[[File:Public documents of the legislature of Connecticut, session (1882) (14763332785).jpg|thumb|alt=A drawing of the American Sign Language manual alphabet|[[Sign language]]s are an important part of Deaf culture. The American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet is shown here.]]

The '''Deaf rights movement''' encompasses a series of [[social movements]] within the [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]] and [[Cultural diversity|cultural diversity movements]] that encourages [[Deaf|deaf and hard of hearing]] to push society to adopt a position of equal respect for them. Acknowledging that those who were hearing impaired had rights to obtain the same things as those with no hearing impairments lead this movement. Establishing an educational system to teach those with hearing impairments was one of the first accomplishments of this movement. Sign language, as well as cochlear implants, has also had an extensive impact on the Deaf community. These have all been aspects that have paved the way for those with hearing impairments, which began with the Deaf Rights movement.  
== Deaf education ==
{{main article|Deaf education}}

===Oralism===
{{main article|Oralism}}
Oralism focuses on teaching deaf students through oral communicative means rather than sign languages.

There is strong opposition within Deaf communities to the [[Oralism|oralist]] method of teaching deaf children to speak and [[Lip reading|lip read]] with limited or no use of [[sign language]] in the classroom. The method is intended to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The use of [[sign language]] is also central to Deaf [[Cultural identity|identity]] and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.

=== Deaf schools ===
Parents of deaf children also have to opportunity to send their children to deaf schools, where the curriculum is taught in [[American Sign Language]]. The first school for the education of deaf individuals was the Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons, which opened on April 15, 1817.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was a coeducation insitiution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/dhm/edu/essay.html?id=38|title=Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb|last=Crowley|first=John|website=www.disabilitymuseum.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This school was later renamed the [[American School for the Deaf]], and was granted federal money to set up of deaf institutions around the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many teachers in these schools were women, because according to PBS and the research done for the film ''Through Deaf Eyes'', they were  better at instructing due to the patience it took to do something repetitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/deaflife/women.html|title=Oral Education and Women in the Classroom|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American School for the Deaf was set up based on a British model of education for deaf individuals with instruction in the subjects of reading, writing, history, math, and an advanced study of the Bible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gallaudet University]] is the only deaf university in the world, which instructs in American Sign Language, and promotes research and publications for the deaf community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/|title = Gallaudet University|website = www2.gallaudet.edu|access-date = 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet University is responsible for expanding services and education for deaf individuals in developing countries around the world, as well as in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Reviewing The Pioneering Roles Of Gallaudet University Alumni In Advancing Deaf Education And Services In Developing Countries: Insights And Challenges From Nigeria." ''American Annals Of The Deaf'' 2 (2015): 75. ''Project MUSE''. Web. 15 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many deaf individuals choose to be educated in a deaf environment for their college level education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Deaf President Now ===
{{main article|Deaf President Now}}

[[I. King Jordan]] had made history in 1988 for becoming the first deaf president of [[Gallaudet University]] after the protest, ''Deaf President Now'' Students, with the support of from many alumni, faculty, staff and friends, protested the Board of Trustees' continued appointments of  hearing presidents over highly qualified deaf candidates in an institution established to serve the deaf.

=== Historical figures===
{{Main articles|List of deaf people}}
There have been many individuals who have made advancements in the deaf community. These individuals have been both deaf or hearing. A few of the most recognizable names include:
[[Alexander Graham Bell]], who is known for the invention of the telephone but to the Deaf, is seen as a villain of sorts; 
[[Heather Whitestone]], the first deaf Miss-America; 
[[Marlee Matlin]], a well known deaf actress;
[[Laurent Clerc]], a well-known deaf professor; and 
[[Helen Keller]], the most commonly known deaf-blind woman.

However, this is only a small number of individuals who have made advancements in the deaf community.

== Public accommodations ==
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], also known as the ADA, has made a huge impact on the deaf community. In 1990 it was a landmark for people with disabilities. The ADA has been a great benefit for hard of hearing and deaf people to help them gain every aspect of life that a hearing person has. The ADA took the important principles in these laws and extended them to the broad mainstream of Americans public life. It prohibits discrimination in almost every aspect of society.(26)  Meaning you would have a legitimate reason to not hire someone with a disability.  The legislation provides legal protection in employment(Title I), access to state and local government and public transportation (title II), public accommodations (Title III)(they have to provide a translator), and telecommunications (title IV). (26) George H W Bush signed this into act, and there was no acclaimed retaliation from this. It didn’t solve the problem of discrimination but it gave those who had a disability protection.

In 1975 Congress found that more than eight million children were not receiving equal education. There was another bill passed to help solve this problem called the Individual with Disabilities Act (IDEA). The IDEA was made to "ensure that all children with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate, public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their needs and prepare them for employment and independent living. To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents are protected. To assist states, localities, educational service agencies, and federal agencies to pay for education for all children with disabilities. And finally to assess and ensure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities." (73)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National, A. O. T. D. (2015). Legal Rights, 6th Ed. : The Guide for Deaf and Hard of Hearing People. Washington, DC, US: Gallaudet University Press.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaf culture movement ==
{{main article|Deaf culture}}

Deaf culture is a culture defined by usage of sign language and many cultural and social norms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Cochlear implants===
Within the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]], there is strong opposition to the use of [[cochlear implants]] and sometimes also [[hearing aids]] and similar technologies. This is often justified in terms of a rejection of the view that [[deafness]], as a condition, is something that needs to be ''fixed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=Bonnie Poitras|title=Deaf Culture, Cochlear Implants, and Elective Disability|journal=Hastings Center Report|date=8 July 1998|volume=28|issue=4|pages=6-14|doi=10.2307/3528607|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3528607|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that this technology also threatens the continued existence of Deaf culture, but Kathryn Woodcock argues that it is a greater threat to [[Deaf culture]] ''to reject prospective members just because they used to hear, because their parents chose an implant for them, because they find environmental sound useful, etc''.&lt;ref name="woodcock1992"&gt;{{cite book | first=Kathryn | last=Woodcock | year=1992 | title=Cochlear Implants vs. Deaf Culture? In Mervin Garretson (ed.), ''Viewpoints on Deafness: A Deaf American Monograph''. Silver Spring, MD: National Association for the Deaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochlear implants may improve the perception of sound for suitable implantees, but they do not reverse [[deafness]], or create a normal perception of sounds. The Deaf community still insists that a child not be fitted with a cochlear implant until old enough to decide for themselves because the affects are irreversible and could cause a lifetime of pain, regret, and hatred/isolation.

'''Direct Benefit Transfer''' or '''DBT''' is an attempt to change the mechanism of transferring subsidies launched by [[Government of India]] on 1 January 2013. This program aims to transfer subsidies directly to the people through their bank accounts. It is hoped that crediting subsidies into bank accounts will reduce leakages, delays, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbtmis.planningcommission.nic.in/dbtentry/homepage.aspx|title=DBT(DIRECT BENEFIT TRANSFER)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Rejaul Karim Laskar|Laskar]]|first1=R.

== Structure ==
The primary aim of this Direct Benefit Transfer program is to bring transparency and terminate pilferage from distribution of funds sponsored by Central Government of India. In DBT, benefit or subsidy will be directly transferred to citizens living below poverty line.  [[Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System]] (CPSMS), being implemented by the Office of Controller General of Accounts, will act as the common platform for routing DBT. CPSMS can be used for the preparation of beneficiary list, digitally signing the same and processing of payments in the bank accounts of the beneficiary using the Aadhaar Payment Bridge of NPCI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpsms.nic.in/Users/LoginDetails/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fdefault.aspx Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System [CPSMS&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All relevant orders related with the DBT are available on the CPSMS website.

==History==
The program was launched in selected cities of India on 1 January 2013.&lt;ref name="The New Indian Express Direct Benefit Transfer to be launched today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Direct Benefit Transfer to be launctoday|url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/article1402701.ece|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15"&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15|url=http://business-standard.com/india/news/govt-to-review-benefits-transfer-projectjan-15/498105/|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 20 districts, covering scholarships and social security pensions initially.

Former Union [[Ministry of Rural Development (India)|Minister for Rural Development]] of India [[Jairam Ramesh]] and former [[Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh]] [[N. Kiran Kumar Reddy]] inaugurated the scheme at Gollaprolu in East Godavari district on 6 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Direct Benefit Transfer scheme finally gets going"&gt;{{cite news|title=Direct Benefit Transfer scheme finally gets going|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/direct-benefit-transfer-scheme-finally-gets-going/article4281371.ece|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has decided to review the progress on regular basis.&lt;ref name="Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15" /&gt;

The first review was scheduled to be undertaken on 15 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15" /&gt; According to [[P. Chidambaram]], former Union Minister of Finance of India, the scheme will be rolled out across 11 more districts by 1 February and 12 more districts by 1 March 2013.&lt;ref name="Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15" /&gt;

In April 2013 the government decided to extend the DBT scheme in 78 more districts of the country from July 1, 2013. The decision was taken by then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh after a review meeting.&lt;ref name="DBT scheme to be extended in 78 new districts from July 1, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=DBT scheme to be extended in 78 new districts from July 1, 2013|url=http://www.myaadhaarcard.in/direct-cash-transfer/dbt-scheme-to-be-extended-in-78-new-districts-from-july-1-2013/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 78 new districts will include 6 districts each from Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, 3 each from Bihar and Tamil Nadu, 2 from West Bengal and 4 each from Odisha and Gujarat.

In a review by the Prime Minister's Office on 5 August 2013, the minutes reported that two schemes dominated transfers through CPSMS - 83% of all transfers were for the [[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] and scholarships. Lack of computerized records for schemes to be linked to DBT was hindering rollout. The minutes show that out of 39.76 lakh beneficiaries who ought to have been covered under various schemes, only 56% had bank accounts, 25.3% had both bank accounts and aadhaar numbers, but only 9.62% have bank accounts seeded with aadhaar numbers.&lt;ref&gt;http://finmin.nic.in/dbt/record_dbt0508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs part of DBT==
* National Child Labour Project
* Student Scholarship
* LPG subsidy
On June 1, 2013, the minister of Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas, M [[Veerappa Moily]] formally launched the scheme direct benefit transfer for LPG (DBTL) Scheme in 20 high [[Aadhaar]] coverage districts. The subsidy on LPG cylinders will be credited directly to consumers' Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. All Aadhaar-linked domestic LPG consumers will get an advance in their bank account as soon as they book the first subsidized cylinder before delivery. On receiving the first subsidized cylinder subsidy for next will again get credited in their bank account, which can then be available for the purchase of the next cylinder at market rate until the cap of 12 cylinders per year is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-01/news/39675093_1_lpg-cylinders-aadhaar-number-domestic-lpg-consumers | work=The Times Of India | title=Moily launches Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme for LPG in Karnataka | date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modified Version of DBTL Scheme : (November 2014)
Government of India Introduced Modified Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG (DBTL) scheme in 54 districts in 11 states including all in Kerala starting November 15, 2014 whereby LPG consumers who have not yet availed the benefit will be able to get cash subsidy amount transferred into their accounts to buy Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders at market price.&lt;ref name="Pahal DBTL-nov-27-14"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pahaldbtlscheme.com/what-is-pahal-dbtl-scheme/ | title=Pahal 'DBTL' Scheme | publisher=www.pahaldbtlscheme.com/ | date=23 December 2014 | accessdate=23 December 2014 | author=pavan1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

74 Schemes of 17 ministries of central government were under DBT by 31 May 2016. As on Dec 2017,DBT has been implemented in 400 schemes from 46 ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Aadhaar law will ensure Direct Benefit Transfer reaches genuine beneficiaries: FM Jaitley |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-aadhaar-law-will-ensure-direct-benefit-transfer-reaches-genuine-beneficiaries-fm-jaitley-2234747 |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |date=15 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Discover Primary Science''' is a flagship [[project]] of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt05/developing/discover.html Forfás Annual Report 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120014325/http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt05/developing/discover.html |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It facilitates [[teacher training]] in general primary science and provides teachers with online resources and classroom activity packs which can also be used by parents and students.

In 2008, just over 3,100 [[primary school]]s and their teachers participated in activities which included hands-on induction days which were hosted throughout the country in [[college]]s of education, [[institute of technology]], [[universities]] and education centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishscientist.ie/2006/contents.asp?contentxml=06p14.xml&amp;contentxsl=is06pages.xsl Article on Discover Primary Science - Irish Scientist website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119235342/http://www.irishscientist.ie/2006/contents.asp?contentxml=06p14.xml&amp;contentxsl=is06pages.xsl |date=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards of Science Excellence ==

Discover Primary Science also manages the Awards of Science Excellence each year, as well as coordinating a series of Discover Science Centres across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sciencetoday/2008/0605/1212568972777.html Article on Discover Primary Science - The Irish Times newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/images-making-the-news-692435.html?ino=4 Picture on Discover Primary Science - Front of the Irish Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools registered on the Discover Primary Science project can opt to apply for an Award of Science Excellence after they have met certain criteria for science-related activities. In 2007 and 2008, more than 1,000 schools received awards nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/news/june07/061107_primary_school.html UCD Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sciencetoday/2008/0605/1212568972777.html Article on Discover Primary Science - Irish Times newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economic Cycle Research Institute''' ('''ECRI''') based in New York, is an independent institute formed in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hershey, Jr.|first1=Robert D.|title=Geoffrey H. Moore, 86, Dies; An Analyst of Business Cycles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/11/business/geoffrey-h-moore-86-dies-an-analyst-of-business-cycles.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Geoffrey H. Moore, Anirvan Banerji and Lakshman Achuthan.

==Purpose==
ECRI’s stated mission is to preserve and advance the tradition of [[business cycle]] research established by Dr. Moore at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and Center for International Business Cycle Research (CIBCR). In contrast to the NBER, ECRI sells cycle risk management services to the business community.

==International Business Cycle Chronologies==
Before there was a [[Reference date (United States business cycles)|Business Cycle Dating Committee]] to determine U.S. business cycle dates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html|website=National Bureau of Economic Research|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore determined them on the NBER's behalf from 1949 to 1978, and then served as the committee's senior member until he died in 2000. Using the same approach, ECRI has long determined recession start and end dates for over 20 other countries that are widely accepted by academics and major central banks as the definitive [https://www.businesscycle.com/ecri-business-cycles/international-business-cycle-dates-chronologies international business cycle chronologies].

==History==
ECRI today represents a third generation of cycle research, building on the work of ECRI's co-founder, Geoffrey H. Moore, and his mentors, [[Wesley Clair Mitchell|Wesley C. Mitchell]] and [http://www.federalreservehistory.org/People/DetailView/11 Arthur F. Burns].

1920, Wesley C. Mitchell and his colleagues established the [[National Bureau of Economic Research|National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)]], with a primary objective of investigating business cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web|url=http://www.nber.org/info.html|website=The National Bureau of Economic Research|publisher=The National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1927, Mitchell laid down the standard definition of business cycles: "Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic; in duration business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years; they are not divisible into shorter cycles of similar character with amplitudes approximating their own."

1929, with the start of the Great Depression, business cycle researchers had a practical emergency on their hands. With the economy back in recession, in the summer of 1937, U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/about/history/Pages/hmorgenthaujr.aspx|website=U.S. Department of the Treasury|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; requested Mitchell "to draw up a list of statistical series that would best indicate when the recession would come to an end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Geoffrey H.|title=Business Cycles, Inflation, and Forecasting|date=1983|publisher=Ballinger|isbn=0-884-10285-8|pages=369–400|edition=2nd|url=https://www.nber.org/books/moor83-1|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1938, Mitchell and Arthur F. Burns identified the first leading indicators of revival.

Also in 1938, Geoffrey H. Moore joined Mitchell and Burns at the NBER.

1946, Moore taught [[Alan Greenspan]], who served as Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States from 1987 to 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web|url=http://www.federalreservehistory.org/People/DetailView/6|website=Federal Reserve History|publisher=Federal Reserve History|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistics 1 at New York University.

1950, Moore developed the first-ever leading indicators of cyclical revival and recession.

1958 to 1967, Moore, working with Julius Shiskin, developed the original composite index method, and the composite indexes of leading, coincident, and lagging indicators of the U.S. economy.

1968, Moore gave over to the U.S. government the original composite leading, coincident and lagging indexes, which the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] adopted (and published regularly in Business Cycle Developments (BCD), soon renamed Business Conditions Digest), with the Index of Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) becoming its main forecasting gauge.

1969, Moore was appointed U.S. Commissioner of Labor Statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/history/commissioners/moore.htm|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took a four-year leave from the NBER. While Commissioner, he started the collection of additional statistics, including the Employment Cost Index.

1973, Moore and Philip A. Klein began developing international leading indexes.

1979, having retired from the NBER, Moore established the Center for International Business Cycle Research (CIBCR) at Rutgers University, moving it four years later to Columbia University.

February 1994, following a surprise rate hike, Chairman Greenspan testifies in Congress that "anything that Geoffrey Moore does I follow closely," to which a Congressman replies, "No kidding."

1995, Moore received the American Economic Association's Distinguished Fellow Award.

1996, Moore, with his protégés, Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, established the independent Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), which virtually all of their CIBCR colleagues then joined.

==ECRI's Approach==
Many economists claim that recessions cannot be predicted. A 63-country study of economists' predictions conducted by the [[International Monetary Fund]] concluded that their "record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loungani|first1=Prakash|title=How Accurate are Private Sector Forecasts? Cross-Country Evidence from Consensus Forecasts of Output Growth|journal=IMF Working Paper|date=April 2000|pages=1–32|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2000/wp0077.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''The Economist'' noted in 2005, that "[http://www.economist.com/node/3561492 ECRI is perhaps the only organisation to give advance warning of each of the past three recessions; just as impressive, it has never issued a false alarm]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divining the Future|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3561492|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But in 2011 ECRI saw a recession that did not materialize (see below).

==Recession and Recovery Calls==

2001 Recession Call

In March 2001 ECRI made a U.S. recession call&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Cyclical Outlook "Recession"|url=https://www.businesscycle.com/pdf/trackrecord/0103-USCO-websample.pdf|website=Economic Cycle Research Institute|publisher=Economic Cycle Research Institute|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2001 ECRI's Achuthan told ''The Wall Street Journal'' that "the economy has passed the point of no return, beyond which it is not possible to shift away from the recession track."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barta|first1=Patrick|title=Economic Indexes Disagree On Odds for a U.S. Recession|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB987627774145712293?cb=logged0.829117302027913|website=The Wall Stree Journal|publisher=The Wall Stree Journal|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


2007 - 2009 Recession and Recovery Calls

In March 2008 “the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a firm that focuses on identifying peaks and troughs in the business cycle, made its official call on Friday, stating that the U.S. economy had "unambiguously" entered a recession.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pedro Nicolaci|first1=da Costa|title=U.S. has entered "recession of choice," ECRI says|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-recession-idUSN2022052120080320?sp=true|website=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2009 ECRI said “The longest U.S. recession in more than a half-century will probably end before the summer is out.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pedro Nicolaci|first1=da Costa|title=U.S. recession likely over by end of summer: ECRI|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-recession-idUSTRE53T5BL20090430|website=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;


2011-12 Recession Forecast

In September 2011 ECRI forecast a U.S. recession that never happened. Growth did slow sharply and was “about as weak as it could be without falling into recession.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sommer|first1=Jeff|title=Scoping Out a Phantom Recession|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/your-money/scoping-out-a-phantom-recession.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECRI “had predicted that the final six months of 2012 would register contraction. The first estimate of GDP growth came in at 1 ½% (that is, at an annual rate of 1 ½%). The fifth revision to that initial estimate, unveiled in July, pushed down the measured rate of growth to a quarter of 1%, about as close to shrinkage as a positive growth figure can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroeconomic Sightings|url=https://www.businesscycle.com/ecri-news-events/news-details/economic-cycle-research-ecri-interview-with-grant-s-about-the-current-slowdown|website=Economic Cycle Research Institute|publisher=Grant's Interest Rate Observer|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2015

In October 2015, ECRI titled its international cyclical outlook "Broader Global Slowdown Ahead" &lt;ref&gt;International Cyclical Outlook Essentials, Vol. 10, No. 10, October 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;. Specifically, ECRI was predicting the "progressively poorer global growth" that materialized in early 2016.

'''Engineer reconnaissance''' is the [[reconnaissance]] operations performed by [[combat engineers]] to enable forward movement of own troops, in war usually over territory previously occupied by the enemy. The activity includes provision of reconnaissance instructions on the intended route for which a commander needs an [[engineer reconnaissance report]], identification of [[road symbols|road]] and [[bridge symbols]], posting of safe transit notices for identified [[Standard Bridge Capacity|bridge capacities]], estimation for time and materials required to effect [[route repair]], and performance of [[demolition reconnaissance]] to identify intended enemy demolitions.

'''Environmental communication''' refers to the study and practice of how individuals, institutions, societies, and cultures craft, distribute, receive, understand, and use messages about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and human interactions with the environment. This includes a wide range of possible interactions, from interpersonal communication to [[virtual communities]], participatory decision making, and environmental media coverage. And it also includes verbal communication.

From the perspective of practice, Alexander Flor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/181519/Environmental_Communication|title=Environmental Communication|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines environmental communication as the application of communication approaches, principles, strategies and techniques to environmental management and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander. (2004). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Flor/publication/276930253_Environmental_Communication_Principles_Approaches_and_Strategies_of_Communication_Applied_to_Environmental_Management/links/555c380908ae6aea081734c5/Environmental-Communication-Principles-Approaches-and-Strategies-of-Communication-Applied-to-Environmental-Management.pdf Environmental Communication]''.

== Academic field ==
As an academic field, environmental communication emerged from interdisciplinary work involving [[communication studies|communication]], [[environmental studies]], [[environmental science]], [[risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and management, [[sociology]], and [[political ecology]].

Flor (2004) considers it as a significant element in the environmental sciences, which he believes to be a [[transdisciplinary|transdicipline]]. He begins his textbook on environmental communication with a declarative statement, "Environmentalism as we know it today began with environmental communication. The environmental movement was ignited by a spark from a writer’s pen, or more specifically and accurately, [[Rachel Carson]]’s typewriter." According to Flor, environmental communication has six essentials: knowledge of ecological laws; sensitivity to the cultural dimension; ability to network effectively; efficiency in using media for social agenda setting; appreciation and practice of environmental ethics; and conflict resolution, mediation and arbitration (Ibid). In an earlier book, Flor and Gomez (1993) explore the development of an environmental communication curriculum from the perspectives of practitioners from the government, the private sector and the academe.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander, and Gomez, Ely D., eds. (1993). ''Environmental Communication: Considerations in Curriculum and Delivery Systems Development''. Los Banos, Laguna: University of the Philippines Los Banos - Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change communications has historically focused on [[news]] coverage and [[dissemination|disseminating]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbet|first1=M. C.|title=Communicating climate change:  Why frames matter for public engagement|journal=Environment|date=2009|volume=51|issue=2|pages=14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic fields such as [[psychology]], [[environmental sociology]], and [[risk communication]] have argued that public nonresponse to climate change is due to a lack of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norgaard|first1=K. M.|title=Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262015448}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life,'' Norgaard's (2011) study of Bygdaby (a fictional name used for a real city in Norway) found that non-response was much more complex than just a lack of information. In fact, too much information can do the exact opposite because people tend to neglect [[global warming]] once they realize there is no easy solution. When people understand the complexity of the issue, they can feel overwhelmed and helpless which can lead to [[apathy]] or [[skepticism]]. [[Environmental skepticism]] is an increasing challenge for environmental rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacques|first1=P.|title=Environmental Skepticism: Ecology, Power and Public Life|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0754671022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolic action ==
Environmental communication is also a type of symbolic action that serves two functions. Those functions are [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] and [[wikt:constitutive|constitutive]]. Environmental human communication is pragmatic because it helps individuals and organizations to accomplish goals and literally do things through communication. Examples of this include educating, alerting, persuading and collaborating. Environmental human communication is constitutive because it helps to shape people's understandings of environmental issues, themselves, and Nature; it shapes the meanings we hold of these things. Examples of this include values, attitudes, and ideologies vis-à-vis Nature and environmental issues and problems.Environmental nature communication happens when plants actually communicate,within ecosystems:"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112]&lt;/ref&gt; "When a leaf gets eaten, it warns other leaves by using some of the same signals as animals. Plant biologists are "starting to unravel a long-standing mystery about how different parts of a plant communicate with one another."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge the communication exists. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf,a leaf that becomes defensive as it's being consumed,"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses. Working in the model plant Arabidopsis, Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor–like ion channels (see the Perspective by Muday and Brown-Harding). The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf." &lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt; A leaf that communicates that it is being eaten); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.)are examples that sit inside the universal law that Everything living communicates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Scudder's thesis is aptly reinforced by General Systems Theory, which submits that one of the three critical functions of living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems (the other two being the exchange of materials and the exchange of energy). In his book, Flor (2004, page 4) extends this argument by forwarding that, "All living systems, from the simplest to the most complex, are equipped to perform these critical functions. They are called ''critical'' because they are necessary for the survival of the living system. Communication is nothing more than the exchange of information. Hence, at its broadest sense, environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system, be it an organism, an ecosystem, or (even) a social system."

== Areas of study and practice ==
According to J. Robert Cox, the field of environmental communication is composed of seven major areas of study and practice:

# Environmental [[rhetoric]] and [[discourse]]
# [[News media|Media]] and [[environmental journalism]]
# [[Public participation]] in environmental decision making
# [[Social marketing]] and [[advocacy|advocacy campaigns]]
# Environmental [[collaboration]] and [[conflict resolution]]

'''Evolution of cells''' refers to the evolutionary origin and subsequent evolutionary development of [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Cells first emerged at least 3.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Origin1"&gt;Schopf, JW, Kudryavtsev, AB, Czaja, AD, and Tripathi, AB. (2007). ''Evidence of Archean life: Stromatolites and microfossils.'' Precambrian Research 158:141-155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origin2"&gt;Schopf, JW (2006). ''Fossil evidence of Archaean life.''

==The first cells==
{{Life timeline}}{{main|Abiogenesis|Earliest known life forms}}
The origin of cells was the most important step in the evolutionary theory of life on Earth. The birth of the cell marked the passage from pre-biotic chemistry to partitioned units resembling modern cells. The final transition to living entities that fulfill all the definitions of modern cells depended on the ability to evolve effectively by natural selection. This transition has been called the [[Darwinian transition]].

If life is viewed from the point of view of [[DNA replication|replicator]] molecules, cells satisfy two fundamental conditions: protection from the outside environment and confinement of biochemical activity. The former condition is needed to keep complex molecules stable in a varying and sometimes aggressive environment; the latter is fundamental for the evolution of [[biocomplexity]]. If the freely floating molecules that code for [[enzyme]]s are not enclosed in cells, the enzymes will automatically benefit the neighbouring replicator molecules. The consequences of diffusion in non-partitioned life forms might be viewed as "[[parasitism]] by default." Therefore, the [[natural selection|selection pressure]] on replicator molecules will be lower, as the 'lucky' molecule that produces the better enzyme has no definitive advantage over its close neighbors. If the molecule is enclosed in a cell membrane, then the enzymes coded will be available only to the replicator molecule itself. That molecule will uniquely benefit from the enzymes it codes for, giving it a better chance to multiply.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Partitioning may have begun from cell-like spheroids formed by [[proteinoid]]s, which are observed by heating [[amino acid]]s with [[phosphoric acid]] as a catalyst. They bear much of the basic features provided by cell membranes. Proteinoid-based protocells enclosing RNA molecules could have been the first cellular life forms on Earth.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Another possibility is that the shores of the ancient coastal waters may have served as a mammoth laboratory, aiding in the countless experiments necessary to bring about the first cell. Waves breaking on the shore create a delicate foam composed of bubbles. Shallow coastal waters also tend to be warmer, further concentrating the molecules through [[evaporation]]. While bubbles made mostly of water tend to burst quickly, oily bubbles are much more stable, lending more time to the particular bubble to perform these crucial experiments. The [[phospholipid]] is a good example of a common oily compound prevalent in the prebiotic seas.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Phospholipids are composed of a [[hydrophilic]] head on one end, and a [[hydrophobic]] tail on the other. They possess an important characteristic for the construction of cell membranes; they can come together to form a [[Lipid bilayer|bilayer]] membrane. A lipid monolayer bubble can only contain oil, and is not conducive to harbouring water-soluble organic molecules, but a lipid bilayer bubble [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/P/Phospholipids.html] can contain water, and was a likely precursor to the modern cell membrane.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} If a protein came along that increased the integrity of its parent bubble, then that bubble had an advantage.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Primitive reproduction may have occurred when the bubbles burst, releasing the results of the experiment into the surrounding medium. Once enough of the right compounds were released into the medium, the development of the first [[prokaryotes]], [[eukaryotes]], and multi-cellular organisms could be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;This theory is expanded upon in ''The Cell: Evolution of the First Organism'' by Joseph Panno&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Community metabolism==
The common ancestor of the now existing cellular lineages (eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea) may have been a community of organisms that readily exchanged components and genes. It would have contained:
* [[Autotroph]]s that produced organic compounds from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, either photosynthetically or by inorganic chemical reactions;
* [[Heterotroph]]s that obtained organics by leakage from other organisms
* [[Saprotrophs]] that absorbed nutrients from decaying organisms
* [[Phagotrophs]] that were sufficiently complex to envelop and digest particulate nutrients, including other organisms.

The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a [[symbiosis|symbiotic community]] of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts are remnants of ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]], respectively, where at least part of the rest of the cell may have been derived from an ancestral [[archaea]]n prokaryote cell. This concept is often termed the [[endosymbiotic theory]]. There is still debate about whether organelles like the [[hydrogenosome]] predated the origin of [[mitochondria]], or ''vice versa'': see the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] for the origin of eukaryotic cells.

How the current lineages of microbes evolved from this postulated community is currently unsolved but subject to intense research by biologists, stimulated by the great flow of new discoveries in [[genomics|genome science]].&lt;ref name="Kurland CG 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1121674 | last1 = Kurland | first1 = CG | last2 = Collins | year = 2006 | first2 = LJ | last3 = Penny | first3 = D | title = Genomics and the irreducible nature of eukaryote cells | url = | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5776| pages = 1011–4 | pmid = 16709776 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1011K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic code and the RNA world==
Modern evidence suggests that early cellular evolution occurred in a biological realm radically distinct from modern biology. It is thought that in this ancient realm, the current genetic role of DNA was largely filled by RNA, and catalysis also was largely mediated by RNA (that is, by [[ribozyme]] counterparts of enzymes). This concept is known as the [[RNA world hypothesis]].

According to this hypothesis, the ancient RNA world transitioned into the modern cellular world via the evolution of protein synthesis, followed by replacement of many cellular ribozyme catalysts by protein-based enzymes. Proteins are much more flexible in catalysis than RNA due to the existence of diverse amino acid side chains with distinct chemical characteristics. The RNA record in existing cells appears to preserve some 'molecular fossils' from this RNA world. These RNA fossils include the ribosome itself (in which RNA catalyses peptide-bond formation), the modern ribozyme catalyst [[RNase P]], and tRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid9419221"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/PL00006275 |vauthors=Poole AM, Jeffares DC, Penny D |title=The path from the RNA world |journal=J Mol Evol |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |year=1998 |pmid=9419221|bibcode=1998JMolE..46....1P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9419222"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/PL00006280 |vauthors=Jeffares DC, Poole AM, Penny D |title=Relics from the RNA world |journal=J Mol Evol |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=18–36 |year=1998 |pmid=9419222|bibcode=1998JMolE..46...18J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15217990"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10409230490460765 |author=Orgel LE |title=Prebiotic chemistry and the origin of the RNA world |journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=99–123 |year= 2004|pmid=15217990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2476811"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.86.18.7054 |author=Benner SA, Ellington AD, Tauer A |title=Modern metabolism as a palimpsest of the RNA world |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=86 |issue=18 |pages=7054–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2476811 |pmc=297992|bibcode = 1989PNAS...86.7054B |last2=Ellington |last3=Tauer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearly universal [[genetic code]] preserves some evidence for the RNA world. For instance, recent studies of transfer RNAs, the enzymes that charge them with amino acids (the first step in protein synthesis) and the way these components recognise and exploit the genetic code, have been used to suggest that the universal genetic code emerged before the evolution of the modern amino acid activation method for protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="pmid9419221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9419222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17110438"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608762103 |author=Hohn MJ, Park HS, O'Donoghue P, Schnitzbauer M, Söll D |title=Emergence of the universal genetic code imprinted in an RNA record |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=103 |issue=48 |pages=18095–100 |year=2006 |pmid=17110438 |pmc=1838712|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10318095H |last2=Park |last3=O'Donoghue |last4=Schnitzbauer |last5=Soll }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14665676"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/MMBR.67.4.550-573.2003 |vauthors=O'Donoghue P, Luthey-Schulten Z |title=On the Evolution of Structure in Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=550–73 |year=2003 |pmid=14665676 |pmc=309052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gesteland, RF ''et al.'' eds.(2006) The RNA World: The Nature of Modern RNA Suggests a Prebiotic RNA (2006) (Cold Spring Harbor Lab Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY,).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical patterns==
Although the evolutionary origins of the major lineages of modern cells are disputed, the primary distinctions between the three major lineages of cellular life (called domains) are firmly established.

In each of these three domains, [[DNA replication]], [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]], and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] all display distinctive features. There are three versions of ribosomal RNAs, and generally three versions of each ribosomal protein, one for each domain of life. These three versions of the protein synthesis apparatus are called the ''canonical patterns'', and the existence of these canonical patterns provides the basis for a definition of the three domains - ''[[Bacteria]]'', ''[[Archaea]]'', and [[Eukaryote|''Eukarya'' (or ''Eukaryota'')]] - of currently existing cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80284-6 | last1 = Olsen | first1 = GJ | last2 = Woese | first2 = CR | last3 = Ibba | first3 = M. | last4 = Soll | first4 = D. | title = Archaeal genomics: an overview | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 7 | pages = 991–4 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9215619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using genomics to infer early lines of evolution==
Instead of relying a single gene such as the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene to reconstruct early evolution, or a few genes, scientific effort has shifted to analyzing complete genome sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Daubin |first1= V |last2= Moran |first2= NA |last3= Ochman |first3= H |title= Phylogenetics and the cohesion of bacterial genomes |journal= Science |volume= 301 |issue= 5634 |pages= 829–32 |year= 2003 |pmid= 12907801 |doi= 10.1126/science.1086568|bibcode = 2003Sci...301..829D }}

Evolutionary trees based only on SSU rRNA alone do not capture the events of early eukaryote evolution accurately, and the progenitors of the first nucleated cells are still uncertain. For instance, analysis of the complete genome of the eukaryote yeast shows that many of its genes are more closely related to bacterial genes than they are to archaea, and it is now clear that archaea were not the simple progenitors of the eukaryotes, in contradiction to earlier findings based on SSU rRNA and limited samples of other genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esser | first1 = C | last2 = Ahmadinejad | first2 = N | last3 = Wiegand | first3 = C | last4 = Rotte | first4 = C | last5 = Sebastiani | first5 = F | last6 = Gelius-Dietrich | first6 = G | last7 = Henze | first7 = K | last8 = Kretschmann | first8 = E | last9 = Richly | first9 = E | last10 = Leister | first10 = D | last11 = Bryant | first11 = D | last12 = Steel | first12 = M.

One hypothesis is that the first nucleated cell arose from two distinctly different ancient prokaryotic (non-nucleated) species that had formed a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with one another to carry out different aspects of metabolism. One partner of this symbiosis is proposed to be a bacterial cell, and the other an archaeal cell. It is postulated that this symbiotic partnership progressed via the cellular fusion of the partners to generate a [[chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] or hybrid cell with a membrane bound internal structure that was the forerunner of the nucleus. The next stage in this scheme was transfer of both partner genomes into the nucleus and their fusion with one another.

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The First Cell arose in the previously pre-biotic world with the coming together of several entities that gave a single vesicle the unique chance to carry out three essential and quite different life processes. These were: (a) to copy informational macromolecules, (b) to carry out specific catalytic functions, and (c) to couple energy from the environment into usable chemical forms. These would foster subsequent cellular evolution and metabolism. Each of these three essential processes probably originated and was lost many times prior to The First Cell, but only when these three occurred together was life jump-started and Darwinian evolution of organisms began."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The evolution of modern cells is arguably the most challenging and important problem the field of Biology has ever faced. In Darwin's day the problem could hardly be imagined. For much of the 20th century it was intractable. In any case, the problem lay buried in the catch-all rubric "origin of life"---where, because it is a biological not a (bio)chemical problem, it was effectively ignored. Scientific interest in cellular evolution started to pick up once the universal phylogenetic tree, the framework within which the problem had to be addressed, was determined . But it was not until microbial genomics arrived on the scene that biologists could actually do much about the problem of cellular evolution."

A '''foreign language''' is a [[language]] originally from another country than the speaker. However, there must a be defined distinction between foreign and second language. It is also a language not spoken in the native country of the person referred to, i.e., an [[English language|English]] speaker living in [[Spain]] can say that [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a foreign language to him or her. These two characterisations do not exhaust the possible definitions, however, and the label is occasionally applied in ways that are variously misleading or factually inaccurate. 

Some children learn more than one language from birth or from a very young age: they are [[bilingual]] or [[multilingualism|multilingual]]. These children can be said to have two, three or more mother tongues: neither language is foreign to that child, even if one language is a foreign language for the vast majority of people in the child's birth country. For example, a child learning English from his [[England|English]] father and Irish at school in Ireland can speak both English and Irish, but neither is a foreign language to him. This is common in countries such as [[India]], [[South Africa]], or [[Canada]] due to these countries having multiple official languages.

In general, it is believed that children have advantage to learning a foreign language over adults. However, there are studies which have shown adult students are better at foreign language learning than child students. It is because adults have pre-existing knowledge of how grammar works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merritt, Anne. "Are Children Really Better at Foreign Language Learning?"|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10315238/Are-children-really-better-at-foreign-language-learning.html|accessdate=2016-05-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511000800/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10315238/Are-children-really-better-at-foreign-language-learning.html|archivedate=2016-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a superior ability of memorizing vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Elisabet, et al.

==Foreign language education and ability==
:''See main article: [[Language education]]''
{{globalise/Europe|date=November 2010}}

Most schools around the world teach at least one foreign language and most colleges and high schools require foreign language before graduation.  By 1998 nearly all pupils in [[Europe]] studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only exception being [[Ireland]], where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both [[Irish language|Irish]] and English, but neither is considered a foreign language (although Irish pupils do study a third European language). On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, learners have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of [[primary school]] or the start of [[secondary school]]. In [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]] and [[Malta]], however, the first foreign language is studied at age six, and in [[Flemish Community|Flanders]] at age 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm#2.6 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112090730/http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm |date=2007-01-12 }} Children in the [[Flemish Community|Flemish Community of Belgium]] start learning [[French language|French]] at age 10, [[English language|English]] at 12 or 13 and, if chosen so, mostly [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at age 15 or 16, but with only the first two being obligatory. In the [[Brussels Capital Region]], however, French is taught starting at age 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wales]], all children are taught [[Welsh language|Welsh]] from the first year of primary school. The Welsh language is also compulsory up to the age of 16, although a formal [[GCSE]] qualification is optional.

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a minority/regional language community use partial [[language immersion|immersion]] to teach both the minority and the state language. This method is also highly used in Canada, wherein anglophone students spend all of most of their lessons learning the materials in French.

In 1995, the [[European Commission]]'s White Paper on Education and Training emphasised the importance of schoolchildren learning at least two foreign languages before upper secondary education. The [[Lisbon Summit]] of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a [[United Kingdom|British]] survey showed that only one in 10 [[United Kingdom|UK]] workers could speak a foreign language and less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language. In 2001, a European Commission survey found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Since the 1990s, the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] has tried to standardise the learning of languages across Europe.

An article from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' claims that only 1 percent of the adults within the American population consider themselves proficient in speaking a foreign language. This is in stark contrast to many other countries, where the percentage is much higher. Even though there are many benefits that come with learning a foreign language, schools across the United States continue to cut foreign language from their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Amelia (2015). America's Lacking Language Skills. 'The Atlantic'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruments for foreign language learning===
{{Main|Language education}}

In recent years, [[computer-assisted language learning]] has been integrated into foreign language education and computer programs with varying levels of interactional relationship between computer and the language learner have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Palmberg, R. (1989). Integrating CALL into Foreign-Language Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; Language learning aids such as [[foreign language writing aid]] and [[foreign language reading aid]], targeted at the specific language skills of foreign language learners, are also alternative instruments available for foreign language learners.

==Research into foreign language learning==
{{Main|Second language acquisition}}

In 2004, a report by the Michel Thomas Language Centre in the [[United Kingdom]] suggested that speaking a second language could increase an average worker's salary by £3000 (€3 300) a year, or £145 000 (€159 000) in a lifetime. Further results showed that nine out of 10 British companies thought their businesses could benefit from better language skills. Studies show that a person that is bilingual or multilingual, can make a greater salary than a computer programmer or engineer because they can use their abilities in foreign language to obtain success in a wide range of career paths. Also due to the increase of international population, a multilingual person can easily communicate and translate to perspective viewers.

Also in 2004, a study by [[University College London]] (UCL) examined the brains of 105 people who could speak more than one language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Health {{!}} Learning languages 'boosts brain'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126220802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who learned a second language when younger had denser [[grey matter]] than those who learned one later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Grey matter is an area of the brain where information is most efficiently processed, due to the function of specific nerve cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=Helen|date=2004-07-21|title=Grey matter matters for intellect|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news040719-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217224556/http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of experiments on more than 300 people from the U.S. and Korea found that thinking in a second language reduced deep-seated, misleading biases that unduly influence how risks and benefits are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|title=Thinking in a Foreign Language Makes Decisions More Rational|last=Keim|first=Brandon|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117001301/https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|archivedate=2017-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has shown that early exposure to a second language increases divergent thinking strategies,&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Diaz (1983). Thought and Two Languages: The Impact of Bilingualism on Cognitive Development. Review of Research in Education. Vol. 10, pp. 23-54.&lt;/ref&gt; helping not only in language-related tasks, but also in areas such as math.  Children early on have different ways of expressing themselves, such that they better understand there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.

==Foreign language ''versus'' second language==
{{underlinked|section|date=November 2012}}

There are no major differences in different definitions that different writers have provided about foreign language and second language, although not many of them differentiate these two terms. The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and [[TEFL]] (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows some attention of different researchers to the concepts of foreign language and second language.

Richards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide this information about second language:

"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's native language [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfils many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home)."

They also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).

Crystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).

Stern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after World War II in international organisations, such as UNESCO, in order to meet nationalist susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.
Fasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.

So, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).

A 'second language' usually has official status or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, Persian is a second language for Kurdish people, but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning Kurdish. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an Iranian person goes to USA, then English becomes a second language for him or her. Thus British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. In Kermanshah or Kurdistan, we can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.

The purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.

There are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. He or she can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.

Second language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.

[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.

The major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:

# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.
# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.
# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.
# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.
# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.

There are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.

There is often a distinction between acquisition and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.

The distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.

Nevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, immigrants to the US can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.

'''Fructose''', or '''fruit sugar''', is a simple [[Ketose|ketonic]] [[monosaccharide]] found in many plants, where it is often bonded to [[glucose]] to form the [[disaccharide]] [[sucrose]]. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and [[galactose]], that are absorbed directly into blood during [[digestion]]. Fructose was discovered by French chemist [[Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut]] in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Dubrunfaut (1847) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJ45AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sur une propriété analytique des fermentations alcoolique et lactique, et sur leur application à l’étude des sucres"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627013828/http://books.google.com/books?id=PJ45AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA169 |date=2014-06-27 }} (On an analytic property of alcoholic and lactic fermentations, and on their application to the study of sugars), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', '''21''' :  169–178.

Fructose is found in [[honey]], tree and vine fruits, flowers, [[Berry|berries]], and most [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]].

Commercially, fructose is derived from [[sugar cane]], [[sugar beet]]s, and [[maize]]. Crystalline fructose is the monosaccharide, dried, ground, and of high purity. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] is a [[mixture]] of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides. Sucrose is a [[Chemical compound|compound]] with one molecule of glucose covalently linked to one molecule of fructose. All forms of fructose, including fruits and juices, are commonly added to foods and drinks for [[palatability]] and [[taste]] enhancement, and for browning of some foods, such as baked goods. About 240,000 [[tonne]]s of crystalline fructose are produced annually.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Wach "Fructose" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.{{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a12_047.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "fructose" was coined in 1857 from the Latin for ''fructus'' (fruit) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars, ''[[-ose]]''.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fructose. Origin and meaning of fructose|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/fructose|date=2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225092022/https://www.etymonline.com/word/fructose|archivedate=25 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called fruit sugar and levulose.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

Fructose is a 6-carbon polyhydroxyketone. Crystalline fructose adopts a cyclic six-membered structure owing to the stability of its [[hemiketal]] and internal hydrogen-bonding. This form is formally called &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-fructopyranose. In solution, fructose exists as an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]]  mixture of 70% fructo[[pyranose]] and about 22% fructo[[furanose]], as well as small amounts of three other forms, including the acyclic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Institute of Organic Chemistry| url=http://www.oci.unizh.ch/edu/lectures/material/AC_BII/Kap14/kap14.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416050839/http://www.oci.unizh.ch/edu/lectures/material/AC_BII/Kap14/kap14.html| archivedate=2008-04-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions ===

==== Fructose and fermentation ====
Fructose may be anaerobically [[Ethanol fermentation|fermented]] by [[yeast]] or [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McWilliams | first=Margaret | title=Foods: Experimental Perspectives, 4th Edition | isbn=0-13-021282-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast enzymes convert sugar (glucose, or fructose) to [[ethanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. The carbon dioxide released during fermentation will remain dissolved in water, where it will reach equilibrium with carbonic acid, unless the fermentation chamber is left open to the air. The dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid produce the carbonation in bottled fermented beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keusch |first=P |title=Yeast and Sugar- the Chemistry must be right |url=http://www.chemie.uni-regensburg.de/Organische_Chemie/Didaktik/Keusch/D-fermentation_sugar-e.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220064304/http://www.chemie.uni-regensburg.de/Organische_Chemie/Didaktik/Keusch/D-fermentation_sugar-e.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fructose and Maillard reaction ====
Fructose undergoes the [[Maillard reaction]], non-enzymatic browning, with [[amino acids]]. Because fructose exists to a greater extent in the open-chain form than does glucose, the initial stages of the Maillard reaction occur more rapidly than with glucose. Therefore, fructose has potential to contribute to changes in food [[palatability]], as well as other nutritional effects, such as excessive browning, volume and tenderness reduction during cake preparation, and formation of [[mutagenic]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dills | first=WL | title=Protein fructosylation: Fructose and the Maillard reaction | year=1993 | journal=Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume=58 | pages=779–787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dehydration ====
Fructose readily dehydrates to give [[hydroxymethylfurfural]] ("HMF").
This process, in the future, may become part of a low-cost, carbon-neutral system to produce replacements for petrol and diesel from plants.&lt;ref&gt;Huber, G. W.; Iborra, S.; Corma, A. Chem.  Rev. 2006, 106, 4044 – 4098. {{DOI|10.1021/cr068360d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical and functional properties ==

=== Sweetness of fructose ===
{{See also|Sweetness#Examples of sweet substances}}
The primary reason that fructose is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative sweetness. It is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. The relative sweetness of fructose has been reported in the range of 1.2–1.8 times that of sucrose.&lt;ref name=Hanover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanover|first1=L. M.|last2=White|first2=J.

Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered ring form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Taste Chemistry| last=Shallenberger| first=R.S.| year=1994| publisher=Chapman and Hall | isbn=978-0-7514-0150-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the relative sweetness decreases with increasing temperature. However it has been observed that the absolute sweetness of fructose is identical at 5&amp;nbsp;°C as 50&amp;nbsp;°C and thus the relative sweetness to sucrose is not due to [[anomeric]] distribution but a decrease in the absolute sweetness of sucrose at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name="Kirk-Othmer"/&gt;

[[File:relativesweetness.png|thumb|center|400px|'''Figure 2:''' Relative sweetness of sugars and sweeteners]]

The sweetness of fructose is perceived earlier than that of sucrose or glucose, and the taste sensation reaches a peak (higher than that of sucrose) and diminishes more quickly than that of sucrose. Fructose can also enhance other flavors in the system.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirk-Othmer"/&gt;

Fructose exhibits a sweetness synergy effect when used in combination with other sweeteners. The relative sweetness of fructose blended with sucrose, aspartame, or saccharin is perceived to be greater than the sweetness calculated from individual components.&lt;ref name=Nabors&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nabors  | first=LO | title =American Sweeteners | year=2001 | pages=374–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirk-Othmer"/&gt;

=== Fructose solubility and crystallization ===
Fructose has higher solubility than other sugars as well as other sugar alcohols. Fructose is, therefore, difficult to crystallize from an aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt; Sugar mixes containing fructose, such as candies, are softer than those containing other sugars because of the greater solubility of fructose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Foods: Experimental Perspectives, 4th Edition| last=McWilliams| first=Margaret| year=2001| publisher=Upper Saddle River, NJ : Prentice Hall | isbn=0-13-021282-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fructose hygroscopicity and humectancy ===
Fructose is quicker to absorb moisture and slower to release it to the environment than sucrose, glucose, or other nutritive sweeteners.&lt;ref name=Nabors /&gt; Fructose is an excellent humectant and retains moisture for a long period of time even at low [[relative humidity]] (RH). Therefore, fructose can contribute a more palatable texture, and longer shelf life to the food products in which it is used.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt;

=== Freezing point ===
Fructose has a greater effect on freezing point depression than disaccharides or oligosaccharides, which may protect the integrity of cell walls of fruit by reducing ice crystal formation. However, this characteristic may be undesirable in soft-serve or hard-frozen dairy desserts.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt;

=== Fructose and starch functionality in food systems ===
Fructose increases starch viscosity more rapidly and achieves a higher final viscosity than sucrose because fructose lowers the temperature required during [[starch gelatinization|gelatinizing of starch]], causing a greater final viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=White | first=DC |author2=Lauer GN | title=Predicting gelatinization temperature of starch/sweetener system for cake formulation by differential scanning calorimetry I. Development of a model | year=1990 | journal=Cereal Foods World | volume=35 | pages=728–731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some artificial sweeteners are not suitable for home-baking, many traditional recipes use fructose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Good Food: Essential Ingredients for Cooking and Eating Well.

== Food sources ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Table fructose.JPG|thumb|Crystalline fructose]]

Natural sources of fructose include fruits, vegetables (including sugar cane), and honey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Park | first=KY |author2=Yetley AE | title=Intakes and food sources of fructose in the United States | year = 1993 | volume = 58 | issue=5 Suppl | pages = 737S–747S | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | pmid=8213605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fructose is often further concentrated from these sources. The highest dietary sources of fructose, besides pure crystalline fructose, are foods containing [[table sugar]] (sucrose), [[high-fructose corn syrup]], [[agave nectar]], [[honey]], [[molasses]], [[maple syrup]], fruit and fruit [[juice]]s, as these have the highest percentages of fructose (including fructose in sucrose) per serving compared to other common foods and ingredients. Fructose exists in foods either as a free [[monosaccharide]] or bound to glucose as [[sucrose]], a [[disaccharide]]. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose may all be present in a food; however, different foods will have varying levels of each of these three sugars.

The sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in Table 1. In general, in foods that contain free fructose, the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 1:1; that is, foods with fructose usually contain about an equal amount of free glucose. A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose, and below 1 a lower proportion. Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others. For example, [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s contain more than twice as much free fructose as glucose, while for [[apricot]]s the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose.

Apple and pear juices are of particular interest to [[pediatrics|pediatricians]] because the high concentrations of free fructose in these juices can cause [[diarrhea]] in children. The cells ([[enterocyte]]s) that line children's [[small intestine]]s have less affinity for fructose [[Small Intestine#Absorptions|absorption]] than for glucose and sucrose.&lt;ref name="AJCN fructose absorption"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riby|first=JE|author2=Fujisawa T |author3=Kretchmer N |title=Fructose absorption|year=1993|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=58|pages=748S–753S|pmid=8213606|issue=5 Suppl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unabsorbed fructose creates higher [[osmolarity]] in the small intestine, which draws water into the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in osmotic diarrhea. This phenomenon is discussed in greater detail in the [[#Potential health effects|Health Effects]] section.

Table 1 also shows the amount of sucrose found in common fruits and vegetables. [[Sugarcane]] and [[sugar beet]] have a high concentration of sucrose, and are used for commercial preparation of pure sucrose. Extracted cane or beet juice is clarified, removing impurities; and concentrated by removing excess water. The end-product is 99.9%-pure sucrose. Sucrose-containing sugars include common table [[sugar|white granulated sugar]] and [[powdered sugar]], as well as [[brown sugar]].&lt;ref name=Kretchmer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kretchmer|first=N|author2=Hollenbeck CB|title=Sugars and Sweeteners|year=1991|publisher=CRC Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cane and beet sugars have been used as the major sweetener in food manufacturing for centuries. However, with the development of HFCS, a significant shift occurred in the type of sweetener consumption in certain countries, particularly the United States.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19064536|year=2008|author1=White|first1=J.

Granulated sugar is 99.9%-pure sucrose, which means that it has equal ratio of fructose to glucose. The most commonly used forms of HFCS, HFCS-42, and HFCS-55, have a roughly equal ratio of fructose to glucose, with minor differences. HFCS has simply replaced sucrose as a sweetener. Therefore, despite the changes in the sweetener consumption, the ratio of glucose to fructose intake has remained relatively constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guthrie | first=FJ |author2=Morton FJ | title=Food sources of added sweeteners in the diets of Americans | year=2000 | journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume=100 | pages=43–51 | doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(00)00018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fructose digestion and absorption in humans ==
[[File:sucrase.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 4:''' Hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose by sucrase]]
[[File:fructosetransporter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 5:''' Intestinal sugar transport proteins]]
Fructose exists in foods either as a monosaccharide (free fructose) or as a unit of a disaccharide (sucrose). Free fructose is absorbed directly by the intestine. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed. After absorption, it enters the [[hepatic portal vein]] and is directed toward the liver.

The mechanism of fructose absorption in the small intestine is not completely understood. Some evidence suggests [[active transport]], because fructose uptake has been shown to occur against a concentration gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stipanuk | first=Marsha H | title=Biochemical, Physiological, and Molecular Aspects of Human Nutrition, 2nd Edition | publisher=W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of research supports the claim that fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via [[facilitated diffusion|facilitated transport]] involving [[GLUT5]] transport proteins. Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen, fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the [[enterocytes]], assisted by transport proteins. Fructose may be transported out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either [[GLUT2]] or GLUT5, although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose, and, therefore, the majority of fructose is transported out of the enterocyte through GLUT2.

=== Capacity and rate of absorption ===
The absorption capacity for fructose in monosaccharide form ranges from less than 5&amp;nbsp;g to 50&amp;nbsp;g (per individual serving) and adapts with changes in dietary fructose intake.&lt;ref name=fuji /&gt; Studies show the greatest absorption rate occurs when glucose and fructose are administered in equal quantities.&lt;ref name=fuji&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fujisawa | first=T |author2=Riby J |author3=Kretchmer N  | title=Intestinal absorption of fructose in the rat | year=1991 | journal=Gastroenterology | volume=101 | pages=360–367 | pmid=2065911 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When fructose is ingested as part of the disaccharide [[sucrose]], absorption capacity is much higher because fructose exists in a 1:1 ratio with glucose. It appears that the [[GLUT5]] transfer rate may be saturated at low levels, and absorption is increased through joint absorption with glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ushijima | first=K |author2=Fujisawa T |author3=Riby J |author4=Kretchmer N  | title= Absorption of fructose by isolated small intestine of rats is via a specific saturable carrier in the absence of glucose and by the disaccharidase-related transport system in the presence of glucose | year=1991 | journal= Journal of Nutrition | volume=125 | pages=2156–2164 | pmid=7643250 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is a glucose-dependent [[cotransport]] of fructose.
In addition, fructose transfer activity increases with dietary fructose intake. The presence of fructose in the lumen causes increased mRNA transcription of GLUT5, leading to increased transport proteins. High-fructose diets (&gt;2.4 g/kg body wt) increase transport proteins within three days of intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ferraris | first=R | title= Dietary and developmental regulation of intestinal sugar transport | year=2001 | journal= Journal of Biochemistry | volume=360 | pages=265–276 | pmid=11716754 | doi= 10.1042/0264-6021:3600265 | issue=Pt 2 | pmc=1222226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malabsorption ===
{{Main|Fructose malabsorption}}

When fructose is not absorbed in the small intestine, it is transported into the large intestine, where it is fermented by the colonic flora.

This hydrogen is transported to the lungs, where it is exchanged across the lungs and is measurable by the hydrogen breath test.

== Fructose metabolism ==

All three dietary monosaccharides are transported into the liver by the GLUT2 transporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R | last=Quezada-Calvillo | title=Carbohydrate Digestion and Absorption | place=Missouri | publisher=Saunders, Elsevier | year=2006 | isbn=1-4160-0209-X | pages=182–185 |author2=Robayo CC |author3=Nichols BL }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fructose and [[galactose]] are [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] in the liver by [[fructokinase]] (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;= 0.5 mM) and galactokinase (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.8 mM), respectively. By contrast, glucose tends to pass through the liver (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of hepatic glucokinase = 10 mM) and can be metabolised anywhere in the body. Uptake of fructose by the liver is not regulated by insulin. However, insulin is capable of increasing the abundance and functional activity of GLUT5 in skeletal muscle cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hajduch|author2=Litherland GJ |author3=Turban S |author4=Brot-Laroche E |author5=Hundal HS |title=Insulin regulates the expression of the GLUT5 transporter in L6 skeletal muscle cells|date=Aug 2003|pmid=12914929|first1=E|volume=549|issue=1–3|pages=77–82|journal=FEBS Letters|doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00773-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fructolysis ===
{{Main|Fructolysis}}

The initial [[catabolism]] of fructose is sometimes referred to as [[fructolysis]], in analogy with [[glycolysis]], the catabolism of [[glucose]]. In fructolysis, the enzyme [[fructokinase]] initially produces [[fructose 1-phosphate]], which is split by [[aldolase B]] to produce the [[triose]]s [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] (DHAP) and [[glyceraldehyde]] [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content-nw/full/76/5/911/F3]. Unlike [[glycolysis]], in fructolysis the triose [[glyceraldehyde]] lacks a [[phosphate group]]. A third enzyme, [[triokinase]], is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde, producing [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]]. The resulting trioses are identical to those obtained in glycolysis and can enter the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway for glucose or glycogen synthesis, or be further catabolized through the lower [[glycolytic]] pathway to [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]].

=== Metabolism of fructose to DHAP and glyceraldehyde ===
The first step in the metabolism of fructose is the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase, thus trapping fructose for metabolism in the liver. Fructose 1-phosphate then undergoes [[hydrolysis]] by [[aldolase B]] to form DHAP and glyceraldehydes; DHAP can either be [[isomerization|isomerized]] to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triosephosphate isomerase or undergo reduction to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The glyceraldehyde produced may also be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by glyceraldehyde kinase or further converted to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.  The metabolism of fructose at this point yields intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway leading to glycogen synthesis as well as fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis.

=== Synthesis of glycogen from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ===
The resultant glyceraldehyde formed by aldolase B then undergoes phosphorylation to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Increased concentrations of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the liver drive the gluconeogenic pathway toward glucose and subsequent glycogen synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=MA Parniak |author2=Kalant N | title= Enhancement of glycogen concentrations in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes exposed to glucose and fructose | year=1988 | journal=Biochemical Journal | volume=251 | pages=795–802 | pmid=3415647 | issue=3 | pmc=1149073 | doi=10.1042/bj2510795}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that fructose is a better substrate for glycogen synthesis than glucose and that glycogen replenishment takes precedence over triglyceride formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Once liver glycogen is replenished, the intermediates of fructose metabolism are primarily directed toward triglyceride synthesis.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[File:Fructose-glycogen.jpg|thumb|center|400px|'''Figure 6:''' Metabolic conversion of fructose to glycogen in the liver]]

=== Synthesis of triglyceride from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ===
Carbons from dietary fructose are found in both the [[free fatty acid]] and glycerol [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] of plasma triglycerides. High fructose consumption can lead to excess pyruvate production, causing a buildup of Krebs cycle intermediates.&lt;ref name=McGrane&gt;{{cite book | first=MM | last=McGrane | title=Carbohydrate metabolism: Synthesis and oxidation | place=Missouri | publisher=Saunders, Elsevier | year=2006 | isbn=1-4160-0209-X | pages=258–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accumulated citrate can be transported from the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] into the [[cytosol]] of [[hepatocytes]], converted to [[acetyl CoA]] by citrate lyase and directed toward fatty acid synthesis.&lt;ref name=McGrane /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sul&gt;{{cite book | first=HS | last=Sul | title=Metabolism of Fatty Acids, Acylglycerols, and Sphingolipids | place=Missouri | publisher=Saunders, Elsevier | year=2006 | isbn=1-4160-0209-X | pages=450–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, DHAP can be converted to glycerol 3-phosphate, providing the glycerol backbone for the triglyceride molecule.&lt;ref name=Sul /&gt; Triglycerides are incorporated into [[very-low-density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL), which are released from the liver destined toward peripheral tissues for storage in both fat and muscle cells.

== Potential health effects ==

=== Weight gain ===
In a [[meta-analysis]] of [[clinical trial]]s with controlled feeding — where test subjects were fed a fixed amount of energy rather than being allowed to choose the amount they ate — fructose was not an independent factor for weight gain; however, fructose consumption was associated with weight gain when the fructose provided excess calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sievenpiper JL, de Souza RJ, Mirrahimi A, Yu ME, Carleton AJ, Beyene J, Chiavaroli L, Di Buono M, Jenkins AL, Leiter LA, Wolever TM, Kendall CW, Jenkins DJ |title=Effect of Fructose on Body Weight in Controlled Feeding Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|journal=Ann Intern Med|date=Feb 21, 2012|volume=156 | issue = 4 |pages=291–304|pmid=22351714|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-156-4-201202210-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6675">The '''Gwyneddigion Society''' ({{lang-cy|'''Cymdeithas y Gwyneddigion'''}}) was a [[London]]-based [[Wales|Welsh]] literary and cultural society. The original society was founded in 1770 and wound up in 1843. It was briefly revived in 1978. Its proceedings were conducted through the medium of [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

==History==
The Gwyneddigion Society was founded in December 1770 by a group of expatriate Welshmen resident in London, its first formal meeting taking place on 4 February 1771. Foremost of the founders was [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owen Jones]] (known as Owain Myfyr), who became the society's first President. Originally from [[Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr]], Jones had moved to London as a young man and had earned his fortune as a furrier.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2008, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early members included [[Iolo Morganwg]] (Edward Williams), [[William Owen Pughe]], [[John Jones (Jac Glan-y-gors)|Jac Glan-y-gors]] (John Jones), [[John Edwards (1747–1792)|Siôn Ceiriog]] (John Edwards), [[Edward Jones (harpist)|Edward Jones]] ("Bardd y Brenin"), and [[Twm o'r Nant]] (Thomas Edwards). Although the society's name (meaning "Gwynedd scholars") suggests a particular link with the region of [[Gwynedd]], its affiliations were from the start with the whole of [[North Wales]], and later with all parts of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Leathart 1831, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies 346"&gt;Davies 2008, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It seems likely that the society was formed in part in reaction to the perceived social and intellectual elitism of the existing London Welsh societies, notably the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] (although there was in practice considerable overlap between the membership and the officials of the various societies). The emphasis in the early years was on sociability, music (including [[harp]]-playing and [[Cerdd Dant|penillion-singing]]), and pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2001, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The society's principal meeting-place was the Bull's Head Tavern in [[Walbrook]], and one member, [[David Samwell]], wrote:
:In Walbrook stands a famous Inn
:Near ancient Watling Street
:Well stored with brandy, beer and gin,
:Where Cambrians nightly meet.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under rules adopted in 1777, every member had to be Welsh-speaking, and had to avow a fondness for singing, or at least for hearing poetry sung to the harp.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the society rapidly adopted a more broadly cultural, and specifically a literary, role. When the Cymmrodorion Society was dissolved in 1787, its Presidential Chair was passed to the Gwyneddigion Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; One member described the Bull's Head between 1790 and 1815 as the "centre of Welsh literary life" ("''canolfan bywyd llenyddol ein gwlad''").&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2001, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society promoted annual [[eisteddfod]]au in Wales, the precursors of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] (the first being held at [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]] in 1789); but these experienced difficulties, and the experiment was abandoned after 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 123–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It had its own library, and maintained contact with scholars across Wales, such as [[William Jones (Welsh radical)|William Jones]], to aid them in their knowledge gathering. It also offered an annual prize for literature, in the form of a silver medal. Most significantly, the society (with the financial backing of Owen Jones) published important Welsh literary texts, including ''Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym'' (1789) and ''[[The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales]]'' (1801–07).&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

A noteworthy event in the society's early history was its funding in the 1790s of [[John Evans (explorer)|John Evans]]' exploration of North America in search of the legendary "Welsh Indians", the supposed descendants of [[Madoc|Madog ab Owain Gwynedd]].&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

From the beginning of the 19th century the society began a slow decline, and by the mid-1830s it had been effectively subsumed into the [[Cymreigyddion Society]] (founded in 1795). It was formally dissolved in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 127–8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Revival==
A new Gwyneddigion Society was formed in London in 1978, but it is not known to have survived.&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

Canters studied [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Groningen]]. She went on to study the philosophy of religion with feminist philosopher and theologian Professor [[Grace Jantzen]] at King's College, London University. Canters was awarded a Master of Arts degree. Following this Canters won a scholarship to study for a doctorate at the University of Sunderland under the supervision of Dr. [[Pamela Sue Anderson]] and others.

Her thesis was a study of the Belgian feminist philosopher and former Lacanian psychoanalyst [[Luce Irigaray]], in particular her book ''Elemental Passions''. Eventually, her thesis was supervised by Jantzen and successfully examined. Canters developed a terminal illness not long after and died in Leiden in September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canters|first1=Hanneke|last2=Jantzen|first2=Grace M.|title=Forever Fluid: A Reading of Luce Irigaray's Elemental Passions|date=2005|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719063800|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut9ceLkTCmYC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR|accessdate=18 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her thesis was published as a joint work by her former supervisor Professor Jantzen in 2006, who then died of cancer as well.&lt;ref Name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carrette|first=Jeremy|title=Grace Jantzen|work=Obituary|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|date=11 May 2006|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1772262,00.html|accessdate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Université de Nancy 001.jpg|thumb|UHP's Science and Technology Campus Library in [[Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy|Vandoeuvre]] ([[Nancy, France|Nancy]])]]

The '''Henri Poincaré University''', or '''Nancy 1''', nicknamed '''UHP''', was a [[Public university|public]] research university located in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]]. UHP was merged into [[University of Lorraine]] in 2012, and was previously a member of the [[Nancy-Université]] federation, belonging to the French Nancy-Metz [[Education in France|academy]].

==History==
The first University of [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] was created in 1572 by the Duke [[Charles III, Duke of Lorraine|Charles de Lorraine]] and the Cardinal [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles III]], in a city near [[Pont-à-Mousson]].

Nancy 1 merged with [[Nancy 2 University|Nancy-II]], [[Paul Verlaine University – Metz]], and the [[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine|INPL]] forming the [[University of Lorraine]]. The merger process started in 2009 with the creation of a "pôles de recherche et d'enseignement supérieur" or PRES and was completed 1 January 2012.

==International==
UHP figures in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] made by the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]. In the year 2007, UHP ranked 305th at a worldwide scale and 124th at European scale.

==Organization and administration==

===Components===
Uhp had five Faculties:
*Science and Technology
*Medical School
*Pharmacy
*Dentistry
*Sports

Three Engineering Schools:
*[[Telecom Nancy]]
*[[École Polytechnique de l'Université de Lorraine|Polytech Nancy]] (formerly named ESSTIN)
*ENSTIB

Three Institutes of Technology (IUT):
*Nancy-Brabois
*Longwy
*St Dié

And one Institute for Teacher Training ([[Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maîtres|IUFM]]).

==Research==
The University included a total of 44 laboratories, linked with the most important French research organizations : [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], [[Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale|INSERM]], [[Institut national de la recherche agronomique|INRA]] and [[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|INRIA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7574">'''Holeums''' are hypothetical stable, quantized gravitational bound states of [[Primordial black hole|primordial]] or [[micro black holes]]. Holeums were proposed by L. K. Chavda and Abhijit Chavda in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/19/11/311 Dark matter and stable bound states of primordial black holes]&lt;/ref&gt; They have all the properties associated with [[cold dark matter]]. Holeums are not [[black holes]], even though they are made up of black holes.

==Properties==

The [[binding energy]] &lt;math&gt;E_{n}&lt;/math&gt; of a holeum that consists of two identical micro black holes of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0308054 Dark matter and stable bound states of primordial black holes]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_{n}=-\frac{mc^{2}\alpha_{g}^{2}}{4n^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the principal [[quantum number]], &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,...,\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational counterpart of the [[fine structure constant]]. The latter is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{g}=\frac{m^{2}G}{\hbar c}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]] divided by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;;
: &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum;
: &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]].

The ''n''th excited state of a holeum then has a mass that is given by

: &lt;math&gt;m_{H}=2m+\frac{E_{n}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The holeum's atomic transitions cause it to emit [[gravitational radiation]].

The radius of the ''n''th excited state of a holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{n}=\left(  \frac{n^{2}R}{\alpha_{g}^{2}}\right)  \left(  \frac{\pi^{2}}{{8}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;R=\left(  \frac{2mG}{c^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the two identical micro black holes that constitute the holeum.

The holeum is a stable particle. It is the gravitational analogue of the [[hydrogen atom]]. It occupies space. Although it is made up of black holes, it itself is not a black hole. As the holeum is a purely gravitational system, it emits only gravitational radiation and no [[electromagnetic radiation]]. The holeum can therefore be considered to be a [[dark matter]] particle.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yu. Khlopov, [https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0801.0116 Primordial Black Holes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macro holeums and their properties==

A macro holeum is a quantized gravitational bound state of a large number of micro black holes. The energy eigenvalues of a macro holeum consisting of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; identical micro black holes of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are given by&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0703 Quantized Gravitational Radiation from Black Holes and other macro holeums in the Low Frequency Domain]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_{k}=-\frac{p^{2}mc^{2}}{2n_{k}^{2}}\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p=k\alpha_{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\gg2&lt;/math&gt;. The system is simplified by assuming that all the micro black holes in the core are in the same quantum state described by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and that the outermost, &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; micro black hole is in an arbitrary quantum state described by the principal quantum number &lt;math&gt;n_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''physical radius'' of the bound state is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{k}=\frac{\pi^{2}kRn_{k}^{2}}{16p^{2}\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The mass of the macro holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;M_{k}=mk\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The Schwarzschild radius of the macro holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;R_{k}=kR\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[entropy]] of the system is given by

: &lt;math&gt;S_{k}=k^{2}S\left( 1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy of the individual micro black holes that constitute the macro holeum.

== The ground state of macro holeums ==

The [[ground state]] of macro holeums is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The holeum has maximum binding energy, minimum physical radius, maximum Schwarzschild radius, maximum mass, and maximum entropy in this state.

Such a system can be thought of as consisting of a gas of &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; free (&lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt;) micro black holes that is bounded and therefore isolated from the outside world by a solitary outermost micro black hole whose principal quantum number is &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Stability ==

It can be seen from the above equations that the condition for the stability of holeums is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the relations &lt;math&gt;p=k\alpha _{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{g}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; into this inequality, the condition for the stability of holeums can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;m&lt;m_{P}\left( 6\right) ^{\frac{1}{4}}\left( \frac{n}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The ground state of holeums is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, which gives us &lt;math&gt;m&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the condition for stability. Thus, the ground state of holeums is guaranteed to be always stable.

== Black holeums ==

A holeum is a black hole if its physical radius is less than or equal to its Schwarzschild radius, i.e. if

:&lt;math&gt;r_{k}\leqslant R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Such holeums are termed black holeums. Substituting the expressions for &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and simplifying, we obtain the condition for a holeum to be a black holeum to be

:&lt;math&gt;m\geqslant \frac{m_{P}}{2}\left( \frac{\pi n_{k}}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the ground state, which is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;, this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;m\geqslant \frac{m_{P}}{2}\left( \frac{\pi}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Black holeums are an example of black holes with internal structure. Black holeums are quantum black holes whose internal structure can be fully predicted by means of the quantities &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Holeums and cosmology ==

Holeums are speculated to be the progenitors of a class of short duration [[gamma ray bursts]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Al Dallal, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AdSpR..40.1236A Holeums as potential candidates for some short-lived gamma ray bursts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Al Dallal, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AdSpR..46..468D Primordial black holes and holeums as progenitors of galactic diffuse gamma-ray background]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also speculated that holeums give rise to [[cosmic rays]] of all energies, including [[ultra-high-energy cosmic rays]].&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0454 Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from decays of holeums in Galactic Halos]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], a '''hop''' is a portion of a signal's journey from source to receiver. Examples include:
#The excursion of a [[radio wave]] from the [[Earth]] to the [[ionosphere]] and back to the Earth.  The number of hops indicates the number of reflections from the ionosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Standard 1037C]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#A similar excursion from an [[earth station]] to a [[communications satellite]] to another station, counted similarly except that if the return trip is not by satellite, then it's only a half hop.
#In [[routing]], a hop is the step from one [[Router (computing)|router]] to the next, on the path of a [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] on any communications network. On the [[Internet]] the hops a packet takes may be discovered with [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]s or [[traceroute]]s. The hop count is the total number of steps along the path from source to sink. In this context, the term "hop" is sometimes said to be an acronym for "hand-over point".

'''Human overpopulation''' (or '''population overshoot''') occurs when the [[ecological footprint]] of a human population in a specific geographical location exceeds the [[carrying capacity]] of the place occupied by that group. [[Overpopulation]] can further be viewed, in a long term perspective, as existing if a population cannot be maintained given the rapid depletion of [[non-renewable resources]] or given the degradation of the capacity of the environment to give support to the population. Changes in lifestyle could reverse overpopulated status without a large population reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrlich|first1=Paul R.

The term ''human overpopulation'' refers to the relationship between the [[world population|entire human population]] and its [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]: the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/31/climatechange.food Global food crisis looms as climate change and population growth strip fertile land] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429094959/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/31/climatechange.food |date=29 April 2016 }}". Guardian.co.uk (2007-08-31).&lt;/ref&gt; or to smaller geographical areas such as countries. Overpopulation can result from an increase in [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|births]], a decline in [[mortality rate]]s, an increase in [[immigration]], or an [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] [[biome]] and [[depletion of resources]]. It is possible for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meagre or non-existent capability to sustain life (e.g. a [[desert]]). Advocates of population moderation cite issues like [[quality of life]], [[carrying capacity]], and risk of [[starvation]] as a basis to argue for [[population decline]]. Scientists suggest that the [[human impact on the environment]] as a result of overpopulation, [[Overconsumption|profligate consumption]] and proliferation of technology has pushed the planet into a new geological [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] known as the [[Anthropocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-03-coping-anthropocene.html|title= Coping with the Anthropocene|first= |last= |date=17 March 2015|work=[[Phys.org]]|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/07/human-impact-has-pushed-earth-into-the-anthropocene-scientists-say|title=Human impact has pushed Earth into the Anthropocene, scientists say|first=Adam |last=Vaughan|date=7 January 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/09/140920-population-11billion-demographics-anthropocene/|title=As World’s Population Booms, Will Its Resources Be Enough for Us?|first=Dennis |last=Dimick|date=21 September 2014|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Human population]] has been rising continuously since the end of the [[Black Death]], around the year 1350,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220120404/http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the most significant increase has been since the 1950s, mainly due to [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advancements]] and increases in [[agricultural productivity]]. The rate of population growth has been declining since the 1980s, while the absolute total numbers are increasing. Recent rate increases in several countries previously enjoying steady declines are also apparently contributing to continued growth in total numbers. The [[United Nations]] has expressed concerns on continued population growth in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=BBC News – Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges |publisher=BBC |date=2013-05-22 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has demonstrated that those concerns are well grounded.&lt;ref name="cliodynamics.ru"&gt;Zinkina J., [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]] [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=360&amp;Itemid=1 Explosive Population Growth in Tropical Africa: Crucial Omission in Development Forecasts (Emerging Risks and Way Out).

The recent rapid increase in human population over the past three centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or future numbers of inhabitants. The [[IAP statement on population growth|InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth]], circa 1994, stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]], [[global warming]], and [[pollution]], are aggravated by the population expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=joint statement by fifty-eight of the world's scientific academies |url=http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210203604/http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547 |archivedate=10 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food, [[starvation]] and [[malnutrition]], consumption of natural resources (such as [[fossil fuels]]) faster than the rate of regeneration, and a deterioration in living conditions. Wealthy but highly populated territories like [[Great Britain|Britain]] rely on food imports from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WRIGHT|first1=OLIVER|title=Britain's food self-sufficiency at risk from reliance on overseas imports of fruit and vegetables that could be produced at home|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britains-food-selfsufficiency-at-risk-from-reliance-on-overseas-imports-of-fruit-and-vegetables-that-could-be-produced-at-home-9574238.html|website=www.independent.co.uk|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was severely felt during the [[World war#The World Wars|World Wars]] when, despite food efficiency initiatives like "[[Dig for victory#World War II|dig for victory]]" and [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], Britain needed to [[Battle of the Atlantic|fight to secure import routes]]. However, many believe that waste and [[over-consumption]], especially by wealthy nations, is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/consumption_dwarfs_population_as_main_environmental_threat/2140/ |title=Consumption Dwarfs Population as Main Environmental Threat|author=Fred Pearce|publisher=Yale University |date=2009-04-13|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of  concerns about overpopulation, widespread in developed countries, the number of people living in extreme poverty globally shows a stable decline (this has been disputed by some experts&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hickel (30 March 2015).

==History of concern==
[[File:Overpopulation in Hồ Chí Minh City, Vietnam.JPG|thumb|275px|Thousands of scooters make their way through [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]].]]
Concern about overpopulation is an ancient topic. [[Tertullian]] was a resident of the city of [[Carthage]] in the second century [[Common Era|CE]], when the population of the world was about 190 million (only 3–4% of what it is today). He notably said: "What most frequently meets our view (and occasions complaint) is our teeming population. Our numbers are burdensome to the world, which can hardly support us.... In very deed, pestilence, and famine, and wars, and earthquakes have to be regarded as a remedy for nations, as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race." Before that, [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and others broached the topic as well.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R.E. (1924).

Throughout recorded history, population growth has usually been slow despite high [[birth rates]], due to war, [[Plague (disease)|plagues]] and other diseases, and high [[infant mortality]]. During the 750 years before the [[Industrial Revolution]], the world's population increased very slowly, remaining under 250 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Moffet]], ''Critical Masses: The Global Population Challenge'' (1994): "[the world's population remained] capped by birth rates and death rates locked in a seemingly permanent equilibrium."&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 19th century, the world population had grown to a billion individuals, and intellectuals such as [[Thomas Malthus]] predicted that humankind would outgrow its available resources, because a finite amount of land would be incapable of supporting a population with a limitless potential for increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Essay on the Principle of Population|date=1798|publisher=J. Johnson,|location=London|chapter=VII, paragraph 10, lines 8–10|quote=The power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercantilism|Mercantillists]] argued that a large population was a form of wealth, which made it possible to create bigger markets and armies.

During the 19th century, Malthus's work was often interpreted in a way that blamed the poor alone for their condition and helping them was said to worsen conditions in the long run.&lt;ref name="Claeys"&gt;Gregory Claeys: The "Survival of the Fittest" and the Origins of Social Darwinism, in: Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 61, No. 2, 2002, p. 223–240&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted, for example, in the [[English poor laws]] of 1834&lt;ref name="Claeys"/&gt; and in a hesitating response to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Great Famine]] of 1845–52.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda: Famine. A Short History, Princeton University Press 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-691-12237-3}} (pp. 20, 203–206)&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN publication 'World population prospects' (2017) projects that the world population will reach 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. Human population is predicted to stabilise soon thereafter.

The human population has gone through a number of periods of growth since the dawn of [[civilization]] in the [[Holocene]] period, around 10,000 BCE. The beginning of civilization roughly coincides with the receding of [[glacial ice]] following the end of the [[last glacial period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muller.lbl.gov/pages/iceagebook/history_of_climate.html|title=A Brief Introduction to the History of Climate|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is estimated that between 1–5 million people, subsisting on hunting and [[foraging]], inhabited the Earth in the period before the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when human activity shifted away from [[Hunter gatherer#History|hunter-gathering]] and towards [[Oasis Theory|very primitive farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msh.councilforeconed.org/documents/978-1-56183-758-8-activity-lesson-03.pdf|title=The Neolithic Agricultural Revolution|page=46|publisher=Council For Economic Education|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 8000 BCE, at the [[Agriculture#History|dawn of agriculture]], the population of the world was approximately 5 million.&lt;ref name=worldometer&gt;"What was the population of the world in the past?", [http://www.worldometers.info/population/ World-o-meters]&lt;/ref&gt; The next several millennia saw a steady increase in the population, with very rapid growth beginning in 1000 BCE, and a peak of between 200 and 300 million people in 1 BCE.

The [[Plague of Justinian]] caused [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]] to drop by around 50% between 541 and the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-diseases/plague-article.html |title=Plague, Plague Information, Black Death Facts, News, Photos |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steady growth resumed in 800 CE.&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history]''".

Current United Nations predictions estimate that the world population will reach 9.0 billion around 2050, assuming a decrease in average [[fertility rate]] from 2.5 down to 2.0.&lt;ref name=UNPop&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Population Division|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/ | accessdate=6 March 2018}} {{specify|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2004|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf |title=WORLD POPULATION TO 2300|publisher=United Nations|format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Almost all growth will take place in the less developed regions, where today's 5.3 billion population of underdeveloped countries is expected to increase to 7.8 billion in 2050. By contrast, the population of the more developed regions will remain mostly unchanged, at 1.2 billion. An exception is the United States population, which is expected to increase by 44% from 2008 to 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ |title=US Census Bureau estimates and news release.of AUG. 14, 2008 |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2000–2005, the average world fertility was 2.65 children per woman, about half the level in 1950–1955 (5 children per woman). In the medium variant, global fertility is projected to decline further to 2.05 children per woman.
* During 2005–2050, nine countries are expected to account for half of the world's projected population increase: [[India]], [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Constable, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/a-disaster-in-the-making-pakistans-population-has-more-than-doubled-in-20-years/2017/09/08/4f434c58-926b-11e7-8482-8dc9a7af29f9_story.html ‘A disaster in the making’: Pakistan’s population surges to 207.7 million] (September 2017), ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigeria]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Uganda]], United States, [[Ethiopia]], and China, listed according to the size of their contribution to population growth. China would be higher still in this list were it not for its [[one-child policy]].
* Global life expectancy at birth is expected to continue rising from 65 years in 2000–2005 to 75 years in 2045–2050. In the more developed regions, the projection is to 82 years by 2050. Among the least developed countries, where life expectancy today is just under 50 years, it is expected to increase to 66 years by 2045–2050.
* The population of 51 countries or areas is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.
* During 2005–2050, the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be 98 million. Because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by 73 million during 2005–2050, population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration.
* In 2000–2005, net migration in 28 countries either prevented [[population decline]] or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase (births minus deaths) to population growth.
* [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|Birth rate]]s are now falling in a small percentage of [[developing country|developing countries]], while the actual populations in many [[developed country|developed countries]] would fall without immigration.&lt;ref name=UNPop/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Kathmandu street.jpg|thumb|Street in [[Kathmandu]]]]
From a historical perspective, [[technological revolution]]s have coincided with population expansion. There have been three major technological revolutions – the tool-making revolution, the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]], and the [[industrial revolution]] – all of which allowed humans more access to food, resulting in subsequent population explosions. For example, the use of tools, such as bow and arrow, allowed primitive hunters greater access to more high energy foods (e.g. animal meat). Similarly, the transition to farming about 10,000 years ago greatly increased the overall food supply, which was used to support more people. Food production further increased with the [[industrial revolution]] as machinery, [[fertilizer]]s, [[herbicide]]s, and [[pesticide]]s were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields. Today, starvation is caused by economic and political forces rather than a lack of the means to produce food.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], "Unintended Consequences of Industrial Agriculture", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada, pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won't Save Us Or the Environment By Michael Huesemann, Joyce Huesemann|publisher=New Society Publishers|page=73|quote=despite the fact that hunger and starvation may not be due to food shortages but rather the result of various economic and political factors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant increases in human population occur whenever the [[birth rate]] exceeds the [[death rate]] for extended periods of time. Traditionally, the fertility rate is strongly influenced by cultural and social norms that are rather stable and therefore slow to adapt to changes in the social, technological, or environmental conditions. For example, when death rates fell during the 19th and 20th century – as a result of improved sanitation, child immunizations, and other advances in medicine – allowing more newborns to survive, the fertility rate did not adjust downward, resulting in significant population growth. Until the 1700s, seven out of ten children died before reaching reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;McKeown, T. (1988). ''The Origins of Human Disease'', Basil Blackwell, Oxford, UK, pp.60.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, more than nine out of ten children born in industrialized nations reach adulthood.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

There is a strong correlation between overpopulation and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donellameadows.org/archives/poverty-causes-population-growth-causes-poverty/|title=Poverty Causes Population Growth Causes Poverty - The Donella Meadows Project|website=donellameadows.org|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the invention of the [[birth control pill]] and other modern methods of contraception resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of children per household in all but the very poorest countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/family/trendsContraceptiveUse2015Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agriculture]] has sustained human population growth. This dates back to prehistoric times, when agricultural methods were first developed, and continues to the present day, with fertilizers, agrochemicals, large-scale mechanization, genetic manipulation, and other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck12.org/earth-science/Agriculture-and-Human-Population-Growth/|title=Agriculture and Human Population Growth|publisher=CK-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have historically [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploited the environment]] using the easiest, most accessible resources first. The richest farmland was plowed and the richest mineral ore mined first. Ceballos, Ehrlich A and Ehrlich P said that overpopulation is demanding the use of ever more creative, expensive and/or environmentally destructive means in order to exploit ever more difficult to access and/or poorer quality natural resources to satisfy consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Ceballos, G.; Ehrlich, A. H.; Ehrlich, P. R. (2015). ''The Annihilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals''. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 146 {{ISBN|1421417189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic transition==
{{Main article|Demographic transition|Sub-replacement fertility}}
The theory of demographic transition held that, after the [[standard of living]] and [[life expectancy]] increase, [[family size]]s and [[birth rate]]s decline. However, as new data has become available, it has been observed that after a certain level of development ([[Human Development Index|HDI]] equal to 0.86 or higher) the fertility increases again and is often represented as a "J" shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Myrskylä | first1 = M. | last2 = Kohler | first2 = H. P. | last3 = Billari | first3 = F. C. | doi = 10.1038/nature08230 | title = Advances in development reverse fertility declines | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7256 | pages = 741–743 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19661915| pmc = | bibcode = 2009Natur.460..741M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that both the worry that the theory generated about aging populations and the complacency it bred regarding the future environmental impact of population growth could need reevaluation.

Factors cited in the old theory included such social factors as later ages of marriage, the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside [[child rearing]] and domestic work, and the decreased need for children in industrialized settings. The latter factor stems from the fact that children [[child labor|perform a great deal of work]] in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions.

Many countries have high population growth rates but lower [[total fertility rate]]s because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age, so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity.
"Demographic entrapment" is a concept developed by Maurice King, Honorary Research Fellow at the [[University of Leeds]], who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its carrying capacity, no possibility of migration, and exports too little to be able to import food. This will cause starvation. He claims that for example many sub-Saharan nations are or will become stuck in demographic entrapment, instead of having a demographic transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = M. | last2 = Elliott | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.313.7063.995 | title = Averting a world food shortage: Tighten your belts for CAIRO II | journal = BMJ | volume = 313 | issue = 7063 | pages = 995–997 | year = 1996 | pmid =  8892423| pmc =2352328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the world as a whole, the number of [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|children born per woman]] decreased from 5.02 to 2.65 between 1950 and 2005. A breakdown by region is as follows:

* Europe – 2.66 to 1.41
* North America – 3.47 to 1.99
* Oceania – 3.87 to 2.30
* Central America – 6.38 to 2.66
* South America – 5.75 to 2.49
* Asia (excluding Middle East) – 5.85 to 2.43
* Middle East &amp; North Africa – 6.99 to 3.37
* Sub-Saharan Africa – 6.7 to 5.53

Excluding the theoretical reversal in fertility decrease for high development, the projected world number of children born per woman for 2050 would be around 2.05. Only the Middle East &amp; North Africa (2.09) and Sub-Saharan Africa (2.61) would then have numbers greater than 2.05.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/searchable_db/results.php?years=1950-1955,1955-1960,1960-1965,1965-1970,1970-1975,1975-1980,1980-1985,1985-1990,1990-1995,1995-2000,2000-2005,2045-2050&amp;variable_ID=369&amp;theme=4&amp;cID=&amp;ccID=0,1,6,2,3,5,8,7,4 |title=World Resources Institute |publisher=Earthtrends.wri.org |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117215622/http://earthtrends.wri.org/searchable_db/results.php?years=1950-1955%2C1955-1960%2C1960-1965%2C1965-1970%2C1970-1975%2C1975-1980%2C1980-1985%2C1985-1990%2C1990-1995%2C1995-2000%2C2000-2005%2C2045-2050&amp;variable_ID=369&amp;theme=4&amp;cID=&amp;ccID=0%2C1%2C6%2C2%2C3%2C5%2C8%2C7%2C4 |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'s "[[Living Planet Report]]" stated that in order for all humans to live with the current consumption patterns of Europeans, we would be spending three times more than what the planet can renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/news_facts/publications/living_planet_report/index.cfm |title=WWF LIving planet report |publisher=Panda.org |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanity as a whole was using, by 2006, 40 percent more than what Earth can regenerate.&lt;ref&gt;Ecological Footprint Atlas 2009, Global Footprint Network, www.footprintnetwork.org/atlas&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Roger Martin (diplomat)|Roger Martin]] of [[Population Matters]] states the view: "the poor want to get rich, and I want them to get rich," with a later addition, "of course we have to change consumption habits,... but we've also got to stabilise our numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Roger|title=Stopping at two children is better for the planet|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9281866.stm|publisher=BBC HARDtalk|year=2010}} Interviewed by Carrie Gracie&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by the World Wildlife Fund in 2014 found that it would take the equivalent of 1.5 Earths of biocapacity to meet humanity's current levels of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carrington|first=Damian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/29/earth-lost-50-wildlife-in-40-years-wwf|title=Earth has lost half of its wildlife in the past 40 years, says WWF |publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 September 2014 |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But critics question the simplifications and statistical methods used in calculating Ecological Footprints.

* Less personal freedom and more restrictive laws. Laws regulate and shape politics, economics, history and society and serve as a mediator of relations and interactions between people.

Many of these problems are explored in the dystopic science fiction film ''[[Soylent Green]]'', where an overpopulated Earth suffers from food shortages, depleted resources and poverty and in the documentary "[[Aftermath (2010 TV series)#Population Overload|Aftermath: Population Overload]]".

[[David Attenborough]] described the level of human population on the planet as a multiplier of all other environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People and Planet speech|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=536&amp;v=fK0rXRmC4DQ|publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]]|ref=at 13mins,30secs into speech}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he described humanity as "a plague on the Earth" that needs to be controlled by limiting population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html David Attenborough – Humans are plague on Earth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120085247/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html |date=20 November 2016 }}.

Most biologists and sociologists see overpopulation as a serious threat to the quality of human life.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;Wilson, E.O. (2002).

The effects of overpopulation are compounded by [[overconsumption]]. According to [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rich western countries are now siphoning up the planet’s resources and destroying its ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. We want to build highways across the Serengeti to get more rare earth minerals for our cellphones. We grab all the fish from the sea, wreck the coral reefs and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We have triggered a major extinction event ... A world population of around a billion would have an overall pro-life effect. This could be supported for many millennia and sustain many more human lives in the long term compared with our current uncontrolled growth and prospect of sudden collapse ... If everyone consumed resources at the US level – which is what the world aspires to – you will need another four or five Earths. We are wrecking our planet’s [[Ecosystem services|life support systems]].&lt;ref&gt;McKie, Robin.

Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population, but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources. It also depends on how resources are managed and distributed throughout the population.

The resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include [[drinking water|clean water]], clean air, food, shelter, warmth, and other resources necessary to sustain life. If the quality of human life is addressed, there may be additional resources considered, such as medical care, education, proper [[sewage treatment]], [[waste disposal]] and energy supplies. Overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=growing-population-poses-malthusian-dilemma Another Inconvenient Truth: The World's Growing Population Poses a Malthusian Dilemma] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225120645/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=growing-population-poses-malthusian-dilemma |date=25 December 2013 }}".

Directly related to maintaining the health of the human population is water supply, and it is one of the resources that experience the biggest strain. With the global population at about 7.5 billion, and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water, there is a demand for 15 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living (United). Weather patterns, elevation, and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water. Without clean water, good health is not a viable option. Besides drinking, water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life. In addition to drinking water, water is also used for bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, a variety of cleaning methods, recreation, watering lawns, and farm irrigation.
Irrigation poses one of the largest problems, because without sufficient water to irrigate crops, the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation. In addition to water needed for crops and food, there is limited land area dedicated to food production, and not much more that is suitable to be added. Arable land, needed to sustain the growing population, is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply. There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population (Bashford 240). Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth. No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict. Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture, and there is not room for much more. Although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year, when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the plants may not be able to keep up (Biello). Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded. By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land, the soil becomes exhausted. Because the soil is exhausted, it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before, and is overall less productive. Therefore, by using resources beyond a sustainable level, the resource become nullified and ineffective, which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource. There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles.

[[David Pimentel]] has stated that "With the imbalance growing between population numbers and vital life sustaining resources, humans must actively conserve cropland, freshwater, energy, and biological resources. There is a need to develop renewable energy resources. Humans everywhere must understand that rapid population growth damages the Earth's resources and diminishes human well-being."&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, et al.

On the other hand, some [[cornucopian]] researchers, such as [[Julian Simon|Julian L. Simon]] and [[Bjørn Lomborg]] believe that resources exist for further population growth. In a 2010 study, they concluded that "there are not (and will never be) too many people for the planet to feed" according to [[The Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-the-population-timebomb-is-a-myth-2186968.html |title=Dominic Lawson: The population timebomb is a myth The doom-sayers are becoming more fashionable just as experts are coming to the view it has all been one giant false alarm |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics warn, this will be at a high cost to the Earth: "the technological optimists are probably correct in claiming that overall world food production can be increased substantially over the next few decades...[however] the environmental cost of what Paul R. and Anne H. Ehrlich describe as 'turning the Earth into a giant human feedlot' could be severe. A large expansion of agriculture to provide growing populations with improved diets is likely to lead to further [[deforestation]], loss of [[species]], [[soil erosion]], and pollution from pesticides and fertilizer runoff as farming intensifies and new land is brought into production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Post a Comment |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000F3D47-C6D2-1CEB-93F6809EC5880000&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;catID=2 |title=Misleading Math about the Earth: Scientific American |publisher=Sciam.com |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since we are intimately dependent upon the living systems of the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov/articles/2005/2005_mea.html |title=NASA Earth Science Data and Services: Checking Earth's Vital Signs |publisher=Nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104215208/http://nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov/articles/2005/2005_mea.html |archivedate=4 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/en/ecosystems/ |title=Ecosystem Change: Scientific Facts on Ecosystem Change |publisher=Greenfacts.org |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-349/ |title=USGS OFR 02-349: Human Impact on the Planet: An Earth Science Perspective and Ethical Considerations |publisher=Pubs.usgs.gov |date=2002-10-07 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; some scientists have questioned the wisdom of further expansion.

According to the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]], a four-year research effort by 1,360 of the world's prominent scientists commissioned to measure the actual value of natural resources to humans and the world, "The structure of the world's ecosystems changed more rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century than at any time in recorded human history, and virtually all of Earth's ecosystems have now been significantly transformed through human actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/en/ecosystems/millennium-assessment-3/1-ecosystem-change.htm#1p1 |title=1.

Another study was done by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) called the [[Global Environment Outlook]].

Although all resources, whether mineral or other, are limited on the planet, there is a degree of self-correction whenever a scarcity or high-demand for a particular kind is experienced. For example, in 1990 known reserves of many natural resources were higher, and their prices lower, than in 1970, despite higher demand and higher consumption. Whenever a price spike would occur, the market tended to correct itself whether by substituting an equivalent resource or switching to a new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=34|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential problems with dependence on desalination are reviewed below, however, the majority of the world's freshwater supply is contained in the polar icecaps, and underground river systems accessible through springs and wells.

Fresh water can be obtained from salt water by [[desalination]]. For example, [[Malta]] derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination. A number of [[nuclear power]]ed desalination plants exist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Desalination |url=http://www.uic.com.au/nip74.htm |website=https://web.archive.org/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208191547/http://www.uic.com.au/nip74.htm |archivedate=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford-cohen"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1119/1.13440 |url=http://www.sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf |title=Breeder reactors: A renewable energy source |author=Cohen, Bernard L. |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=75–76 |year=1983 |bibcode=1983AmJPh..51...75C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114062518/http://sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the high costs of desalination, especially for poor countries, make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020902/barlow |title=Who Owns Water? |publisher=Thenation.com |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of desalination varies; [[Israel]] is now desalinating water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter,&lt;ref name = "ejpress-water"/&gt; [[Singapore]] at 49 cents per cubic meter.&lt;ref name = "edie-distinct"/&gt; In the United States, the cost is 81 cents per cubic meter ($3.06 for 1,000 gallons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desalination gets a serious look|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/mar/21/desalination-gets-serious-look/|website=http://www.lasvegassun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2004 study by Zhou and Tol, "one needs to lift the water by 2000 m, or transport it over more than 1600&amp;nbsp;km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs. Desalinated water is expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high, such as [[Riyadh]] and [[Harare]]. In other places, the dominant cost is desalination, not transport. This leads to somewhat lower costs in places like Beijing, [[Bangkok]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and, of course, coastal cities like [[Tripoli]]." Thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans, it concludes that "Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions, but not for places that are poor, deep in the interior of a continent, or at high elevation. Unfortunately, that includes some of the places with biggest water problems."&lt;ref name="uni-hamburg.de"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=41|pages=W03003|year=2005|doi=10.1029/2004WR003749|title=Evaluating the costs of desalination and water transport|author1=Zhou, Yuan  |author2=Tol, Richard S. J.|bibcode=2005WRR....4103003Z|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Another potential problem with desalination is the byproduction of saline [[brine]], which can be a major cause of [[marine pollution]] when dumped back into the oceans at high temperatures."&lt;ref name="uni-hamburg.de"/&gt;

The world's largest desalination plant is the [[Jebel Ali]] Desalination Plant (Phase 2) in the [[United Arab Emirates]], which can produce 300 million cubic metres of water per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwater.org/data20062007/Table21.pdf |title=100 Largest Desalination Plants Planned, in Construction, or in Operation—1 January 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221231528/http://worldwater.org/data20062007/Table21.pdf |archivedate=21 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 2500 gallons per second. The largest desalination plant in the US is the one at [[Tampa Bay]], Florida, which began desalinating 25 million gallons (95000 m³) of water per day in December 2007. A 17 January 2008, article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' states, "Worldwide, 13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day, according to the International Desalination Association."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water, Water, Everywhere|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB120053698876396483?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB120053698876396483.html%3F|website=http://online.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being desalinated at [[Jubail]], Saudi Arabia, water is pumped {{convert|200|mi|km}} inland though a pipeline to the capital city of [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desalination is the Solution to Water Shortages |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1367352/desalination_is_the_solution_to_water_shortages|website=http://www.redorbit.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, new data originating from the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] experiments and isotopic testing done by the [[IAEA]] show that the [[Nubian aquifer]]—which is under the largest, driest part of the earth's surface, has enough water in it to provide for "at least several centuries". In addition to this, new and highly detailed maps of the earth's underground reservoirs will be soon created from these technologies that will further allow proper budgeting of cheap water.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Chelsea (2012-02-15).

Many countries rely heavily on imports. [[Egypt]] and [[Iran]] rely on imports for 40% of their grain supply. [[Yemen]] and [[Israel]] import more than 90%. And just 6 countries – [[Argentina]], Australia, Canada, France, [[Thailand]] and the USA – supply 90% of grain exports. In recent decades the US alone supplied almost half of world grain exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Out/Ote1_5.htm |title=Pushing Beyond the Earth's Limits The Japan Syndrome |publisher=Earth-policy.org |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708052346/http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Out/Ote1_5.htm |archivedate=8 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 United Nations report says population growth is "the main force driving increases in agricultural demand" but "most recent expert assessments are cautiously optimistic about the ability of global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future (that is to say, until approximately 2030 or 2050)", assuming declining population growth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=38|accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the observed figures for 2007 show an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world, 923 million in 2007 versus 832 million in 1995.;&lt;ref&gt;[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] Economic and Social Development Department.

[[File:Food production per capita.svg|thumb|Growth in food production has been greater than population growth.]]
The amounts of natural resources in this context are not necessarily fixed, and their distribution is not necessarily a [[zero-sum game]]. For example, due to the [[Green Revolution]] and the fact that more and more land is appropriated each year from wild lands for agricultural purposes, the worldwide production of food had steadily increased up until 1995. World food production per person was considerably higher in 2005 than 1961.

As world population doubled from 3 billion to 6 billion, daily [[calorie]] consumption in poor countries increased from 1,932 to 2,650, and the percentage of people in those countries who were malnourished fell from 45% to 18%. This suggests that Third World poverty and famine are caused by underdevelopment, not overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=718860 | work=The Economist | title=The truth about the environment | date=2001-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others question these statistics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/170_Pimm_Harvey_Nature.pdf|doi=10.1038/35102629|title=No need to worry about the future|year=2001|last1=Pimm|first1=Stuart|last2=Harvey|first2=Jeff|journal=Nature|volume=414|issue=6860|page=149|bibcode=2001Natur.414..149P|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610083807/http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/170_Pimm_Harvey_Nature.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950 to 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kindall, Henery W  |author2=Pimentel, David|title=Constraints on the Expansion of the Global Food Supply |journal=Ambio. |volume=23 |issue=3 |date=May 1994 |url= http://dieoff.org/page36.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world population has grown by about four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution and most believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]] than the UN presently documents.&lt;ref name="The limits of a Green Revolution" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/26/food.unitednations Feed the world?

[[File:Percentage population undernourished world map.PNG|thumb|left|Percentage of population suffering from malnutrition by country, according to United Nations statistics.]]
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations states in its report ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006'', that while the number of undernourished people in the developing countries has declined by about three million, a smaller proportion of the populations of developing countries is undernourished today than in 1990–92: 17% against 20%. Furthermore, FAO's projections suggest that the proportion of hungry people in developing countries could be halved from 1990–92 levels to 10% by 2015. The FAO also states "We have emphasized first and foremost that reducing hunger is no longer a question of means in the hands of the global community. The world is richer today than it was ten years ago. There is more food available and still more could be produced without excessive upward pressure on prices. The knowledge and resources to reduce hunger are there.

====Population as a function of food availability====

Thornhill,&lt;ref&gt;''Food Production &amp; Population Growth'', video with Daniel Quinn and Alan Thornhill&lt;/ref&gt; cultural critic and writer [[Daniel Quinn]],&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Daniel, ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'' Bantam/Turner, 1995, {{ISBN|0613080939}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[anarcho-primitivist]] [[John Zerzan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|title=On Modernity and the Technosphere|first=John|last=Zerzan|location=Binghamton University|date=2 April 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I9QJVNas5k|at=See 38:35 to 39:00.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—propose that, like all other animal populations, human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply, growing during an abundance of food and shrinking in times of scarcity.

Proponents of this theory argue that every time food production is increased, the population grows. Most human populations throughout history validate this theory, as does the overall current global population. Populations of [[hunter-gatherer]]s fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food. The world human population began increasing after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and its increased food supply. This was, subsequent to the [[Green Revolution]], followed by even more severely accelerated population growth, which continues today. Often, wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities; however, proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run. Peter Farb, for example, has commented on the paradox that "intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population."&lt;ref&gt;Farb, Peter: 1978, ''Humankind''. Boston, Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Quinn has also focused on this phenomenon, which he calls the "[[Food Race]]" (comparable, in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe, to the [[nuclear arms race]]).

Critics of this theory point out that, in the modern era, birth rates are lowest in the [[developed nation]]s, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply. The United Nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas, including Germany, Italy, Japan, and most of the states of the former Soviet Union, is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This shows that, limited to the scope of the population living within a single given political boundary, particular human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply. However, the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major ''exporters'' of food to poorer populations, so that, "it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas (Allaby, 1984; Pimentel et al., 1999) that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled."&lt;ref name = "Hopfenberg and Pimentel"/&gt;

Regardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability, the [[world population|human population]] is, on the global scale, undeniably increasing,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Quinn]] (1996). ''[[The Story of B]]'', pp. 304–305, Random House Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0553379011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as is the net quantity of human food produced — a pattern that has been true for roughly 10,000 years, since the human development of agriculture. The fact that some affluent countries demonstrate negative population growth fails to discredit the theory as whole, since the world has become a [[globalization|globalized system]] with food moving across national borders from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity. Hopfenberg and Pimentel's findings support both this&lt;ref name = "Hopfenberg and Pimentel"/&gt;  and Quinn's direct accusation that "First World farmers are fueling the Third World population explosion."&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Daniel: "The Question (ID Number 122)", Retrieved October 2014 from {{cite web|url=http://www.ishmael.org/Interaction/QandA/Detail.CFM?Record%3D122 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064622/http://ishmael.org/interaction/qanda/detail.cfm?record=122 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the hypothesis is not so simplistic as to be rejected by any single case study, as in Germany's recent population trends; clearly other factors are at work to limit the population in wealthier areas: [[contraceptive]] access, educational programs, cultural norms and, most influentially, differing economic realities from nation to nation.

====As a result of water deficits====
[[Water deficits]], which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as China or India, if technology is not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news – India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) owing to widespread [[overdrafting]] beyond [[sustainable]] yields. Other countries affected include Pakistan, [[Iran]], and Mexico. This overdrafting is already leading to [[water scarcity]] and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China has developed a grain deficit. This effect has contributed in driving grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]]. [[Desalination]] is also considered a viable and effective solution to the problem of water shortages.&lt;ref name="ejpress-water"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/4873 |title=EJP &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; France &amp;#124; French-run water plant launched in Israel |publisher=Ejpress.org |date=2005-12-28 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213050101/http://www.ejpress.org/article/4873 |archivedate=13 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edie-distinct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=11402&amp;channel=0 |title=Black &amp; Veatch-Designed Desalination Plant Wins Global Water Distinction |publisher=Edie.net |date=4 May 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324144203/http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=11402&amp;channel=0 |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High [[crop yield]] vegetables like potatoes and lettuce{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} &lt;!--Lettuce is high yield?--&gt; use less space on inedible plant parts, like stalks, husks, vines, and inedible leaves. New varieties of selectively bred and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] plants have larger edible parts (fruit, vegetable, grain) and smaller inedible parts; however, many of these gain of agricultural technology are now historic, and new advances are more difficult to achieve. With new technologies, it is possible to grow crops on some marginal land under certain conditions. [[Aquaculture]] could theoretically increase available area. [[Hydroponics]] and food from bacteria and fungi, like [[quorn (food product)|quorn]], may allow the growing of food without having to consider land quality, climate, or even available sunlight, although such a process may be very energy-intensive. Some argue that not all arable land will remain productive if used for agriculture because some [[marginal land]] can only be made to produce food by unsustainable practices like [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. Even with the modern techniques of agriculture, the sustainability of production is in question.

It examined the time frame for the occurrence of [[peak oil]], the necessary mitigating actions, and the likely impacts based on the timeliness of those actions. It concludes that world oil peaking is going to happen, and will likely be abrupt. Initiating a mitigation crash program 20 years before peaking appears to offer the possibility of avoiding a world liquid fuels shortfall for the forecast period.

Optimists counter that fossil fuels will be sufficient until the development and implementation of suitable replacement technologies—such as nuclear power or various sources of [[renewable energy]]—occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.about.com/cs/macroeconomics/a/run_out_of_oil.htm |title=We Will Never Run Out of Oil |publisher=Economics.about.com |date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of manufacturing fertilizers from garbage, [[sewage]], and agricultural waste by using [[thermal depolymerization]] have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemley |first=Brad |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ |title=Anything Into Oil &amp;#124; Alternative Energy |publisher=DISCOVER Magazine |date=1 May 2003 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemley |first=Brad |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/apr/anything-oil/ |title=Anything Into Oil &amp;#124; Alternative Energy |publisher=DISCOVER Magazine |date=2 April 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing awareness about [[global warming]], the question of peak oil has become less relevant. According to many studies, about 80% of the remaining fossil fuels must be left untouched because the bottleneck has shifted from resource availability to the resource of absorbing the generated greenhouse gases when burning fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Carrington 2015.

The UN [[Human Development Report]] of 1997 states: "During the last 15–20 years, more than 100 developing countries, and several Eastern European countries, have suffered from disastrous growth failures. The reductions in [[standard of living]] have been deeper and more long-lasting than what was seen in the industrialised countries during the [[Great depression|depression in the 1930s]]. As a result, the income for more than one billion people has fallen below the level that was reached 10, 20 or 30 years ago". Similarly, although the proportion of "starving" people in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] has decreased, the absolute number of starving people has increased due to population growth.

As of 2004, there were 108 countries in the world with more than five million people. All of these in which women have, on the average, more than 4 children in their lifetime, have a per capita GDP of less than $5000. Only in two countries with per capita GDP above ~$15,000 do women have, on the average, more than 2 children in their lifetime: these are Israel and Saudi Arabia, with average lifetime births per woman between 2 and 4.

Says Peter Raven, former President of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) in their seminal work [http://atlas.aaas.org/ AAAS Atlas of Population &amp; Environment], "Where do we stand in our efforts to achieve a sustainable world? Clearly, the past half century has been a traumatic one, as the collective impact of human numbers, affluence (consumption per individual) and our choices of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of the world's resources at an unsustainable rate. ... During a remarkably short period of time, we have lost a quarter of the world's [[topsoil]] and a fifth of its agricultural land, altered the composition of the [[atmosphere]] profoundly, and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural [[habitat]]s without replacing them. Worst of all, we have driven the rate of biological [[extinction]], the permanent loss of species, up several hundred times beyond its historical levels, and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century."

Further, even in countries which have both large population growth and major ecological problems, it is not necessarily true that curbing the population growth will make a major contribution towards resolving all environmental problems.&lt;ref name="UN World Population Report 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=31|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as developing countries with high populations become more industrialized, pollution and consumption will invariably increase.

The [[Worldwatch Institute]] said in 2006 that the booming economies of [[People's Republic of China|China]] and India are "planetary powers that are shaping the global biosphere". The report states:

BBC News (2006-01-12).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Warfare and conflict==

It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Champion |first=Tony |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Daniels |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Bradshaw |editor3-first=Denis |editor3-last=Shaw |editor4-first=James |editor4-last=Sidaway  |title=An Introduction to Human Geography Issues for the 21st Century Second edition|publisher=Pearson Education |year=2005 |pages=88–111 |chapter=Chapter 4: Demographic transformations |isbn=0-131-21766-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that overpopulation leads to increased levels of tensions both between and within countries. Modern usage of the term [[Lebensraum#Modern usage|"lebensraum"]] supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment (the [[War#Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]).

===Criticism of this hypothesis===
The [[hypothesis]] that population pressure causes increased [[warfare]] has been recently criticized on empirical grounds. Two studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. [[Andrey Korotayev]], in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;Turchin P., Korotayev A. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603173842/http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 |date=3 June 2016 }}. ''[[Social Evolution &amp; History]]'' 5/2 (2006): 112–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks).

Furthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

== Proposed solutions and mitigation measures ==
{{Cquote|quote=Given the current levels of violence by this culture against both humans and the natural world, however, it's not possible to speak of reductions in population and consumption that do not involve violence and privation, not because the reductions themselves would necessarily involve violence, but because violence and privation have become the default of our culture.|author=[[Derrick Jensen]]|source=''[[Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|Endgame]]'', 2006&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jensen|first=Derrick |date=2006 |title=Endgame, Vol. 1: The Problem of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSsfg3325iEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|page=129 |isbn=978-1583227305|author-link=Derrick Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several solutions and mitigation measures have the potential to reduce overpopulation. Some solutions are to be applied on a global planetary level (e.g., via [[United Nations|UN]] resolutions), while some on a country or state government organization level, and some on a family or an individual level. Some of the proposed mitigations aim to help implement new social, cultural, behavioral and political norms to replace or significantly modify current norms.

For example, in societies like China, the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple. Other societies have implemented social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects. "The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost. A variety of print materials (flyers, brochures, fact sheets, stickers) needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship, sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks (taxis / bus stands)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.community.peacecorpsconnect.org/view/514/utilizing-social-marking-and-social-norms-to-addresss-problems-in-the-gambia |title=Utilizing social marketing and social norms to address problems in gambia |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=12 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such prompts work to introduce the problem so that new or modified social norms are easier to implement. Certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods. An example of a country whose laws and norms are hindering the global effort to slow population growth is Afghanistan. "The approval by Afghan President Hamid Karzai of the Shia Personal Status Law in March 2009 effectively destroyed Shia women's rights and freedoms in Afghanistan. Under this law, women have no right to deny their husbands sex unless they are ill, and can be denied food if they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Scientists and technologists including e.g. Huesemann, Huesemann, Ehrlich and Ehrlich caution that science and technology, as currently practiced, cannot solve the serious problems global human society faces, and that a cultural-social-political shift is needed to reorient science and technology in a more socially responsible and environmentally sustainable direction.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H. and Huesemann, J.A.

[[Egypt]] announced a program to reduce its overpopulation by family planning education and putting [[women in the workforce]].

Several scientists (including e.g. [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul and Anne Ehrlich]] and [[Gretchen Daily]]) proposed that humanity should work at stabilizing its absolute numbers, as a starting point towards beginning the process of reducing the total numbers. They suggested the following solutions and policies: following a small-family-size socio-cultural-behavioral norm worldwide (especially one-child-per-family ethos), and providing contraception to all along with proper education on its use and benefits (while providing access to safe, legal abortion as a backup to contraception), combined with a significantly more equitable distribution of resources globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Business magnate [[Ted Turner]] proposed a "voluntary, non-imposed" one-child-per-family cultural norm.  A "[[Population Matters#Pledge two or fewer|pledge two or fewer]]" campaign is run by [[Population Matters]] (a UK population concern organisation), in which people are encouraged to limit themselves to small family size.

Population planning that is intended to reduce population size or growth rate may promote or enforce one or more of the following practices, although there are other methods as well:

* Greater and better access to [[contraception]]
* Reducing [[infant mortality]] so that parents do not need to have many children to ensure at least some survive to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Lifeblood: How to Change the World One Dead Mosquito at a Time, Alex Perry p9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improving the [[status of women]] in order to facilitate a departure from traditional sexual division of labour.
* [[One child policy|One-Child]] and [[Two child policy|Two-Child]] policies, and other policies restricting or discouraging births directly.
* [[Family planning]]&lt;ref name="Ryerson 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryerson|first1=William N.|title=The Post Carbon Reader: Managing the 21st Century's Sustainability Crises, "Ch.12: Population: The Multiplier of Everything Else"|date=2010|publisher=Watershed Media|location=Healdsburg, Calif.|isbn=978-0970950062|pages=153–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creating small family "role models"&lt;ref name="Ryerson 2010"/&gt;
* Tighter immigration restrictions

The method(s) chosen can be strongly influenced by the cultural and religious beliefs of community members.

==== Birth regulations ====

Overpopulation can be mitigated by [[birth control]]; some nations, like the People's Republic of China, use strict measures to reduce birth rates. Religious and ideological opposition to birth control has been cited as a factor contributing to overpopulation and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Sanjay Gandhi]], son of late Prime Minister of India [[Indira Gandhi]], implemented a forced [[compulsory sterilization|sterilization]] programme between 1975 and 1977. Officially, men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization, but there was a greater focus on sterilizing women than sterilizing men. Some unmarried young men and political opponents may also have been sterilized {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. This program is still remembered and criticized in India, and is blamed for creating a public aversion to [[family planning]], which hampered government programs for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Vinay Lal.

Urban designer [[Michael E. Arth]] has proposed a "choice-based, marketable birth license plan" he calls "[[birth credit]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/michael_e_arth/ |title=Interview: City Architect and Reconstructor Michael E. Arth by Alex Birch |publisher=Corrupt.org |date=22 May 2008 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105083809/http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/michael_e_arth |archivedate=5 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth credits would allow any woman to have as many children as she wants, as long as she buys a license for any children beyond an average allotment that would result in [[zero population growth]]. If that allotment was determined to be one child, for example, then the first child would be free, and the market would determine what the license fee for each additional child would cost. Extra credits would expire after a certain time, so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators. The actual cost of the credits would only be a fraction of the actual [[Cost of raising a child|cost of having and raising a child]], so the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society.&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010, pp. 352-362"&gt;Arth, Michael E., ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'', Golden Apples Media, 2010, Chapter 35: "Overpopulation" pp. 352–362&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Growthbydevelopedvslessdeveloped.jpg|thumb|left|350px]] Another choice-based approach, similar to Arth's birth credits, is financial compensation or other benefits (free goods and/or services) by the state (or state-owned companies) offered to people who voluntarily undergo [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]. Such compensation has been offered in the past by the government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13982031 Goods for sterilization] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083235/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13982031 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the United Nations estimated there is an 80% likelihood that the world's population will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion by 2100. Most of the world's expected population increase will be in Africa and southern Asia.  Africa's population is expected to rise from the current one billion to four billion by 2100, and Asia could add another billion in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzig, Robert, "A world with 11 billion people? New population projections shatter earlier estimates."

For countries with a wide base in their [[population pyramid]] it will take a generation for the people who are of child bearing age to have their families.&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010, pp. 352-362"/&gt;  An example of [[demographic momentum]] is China, which added perhaps 400,000 more people after its one-child policy was enacted. Arth has suggested that the focus should be on the developed countries and that some combination of birth credits and additional compensation supplied by the developed countries could rapidly lead to zero population growth while also quickly raising the standard of living in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010, pp. 352-362"/&gt;

===Extraterrestrial settlement===
{{Main article|Space colonization}}
{{See also | Space advocacy | Steady-state economy #Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space }}
Various scientists and [[science fiction]] authors have contemplated that overpopulation on Earth may be remedied in the future by the use of extraterrestrial settlements. In the 1970s, [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] suggested building [[space habitats]] that could support 30,000 times the carrying capacity of Earth using just the asteroid belt, and that the [[Solar System]] as a whole could sustain current population growth rates for a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;[[The High Frontier]] (1976, 2000) [[Gerard O'Neill]], Apogee Books {{ISBN|1-896522-67-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall Savage]] (1992, 1994) has projected a human population of five [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1018|quintillion]] (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;)
throughout the Solar System by 3000, with the majority in the [[asteroid belt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Savage]], (1992, 1994) ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]].'' Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-77163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freeman Dyson]] (1999) favours the [[Kuiper belt]] as the future home of humanity, suggesting this could happen within a few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], ''The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet'' (1999) Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets|Mining the Sky]]'', [[John&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]] suggests that the resources of the solar system could support 10 [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) people. In an interview, [[Stephen Hawking]] claimed that overpopulation is a threat to human existence and "our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth but to spread out into space."&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph. Stephen Hawking: mankind must move to outer space within a century. (August 2010) {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/7935505/Stephen-Hawking-mankind-must-move-to-outer-space-within-a-century.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025174153/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/7935505/Stephen-Hawking-mankind-must-move-to-outer-space-within-a-century.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K. Eric Drexler]], famous inventor of the futuristic concept of [[molecular nanotechnology]], has suggested in ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' that colonizing space will mean breaking the [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian limits]] to growth for the human species.

It may be possible for other parts of the Solar System to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future. [[Geoffrey A. Landis|Geoffrey Landis]] of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[Glenn Research Center]] in particular has pointed out that "[at] cloud-top level, Venus is the paradise planet", as one could construct [[aerostat]] habitats and [[Floating city (science fiction)|floating cities]] there easily, based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venusian atmosphere]]. [[Venus]] would, like also [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]], in the upper layers of their atmospheres, even afford a [[gravitation]] almost exactly as strong as [[g-force|that on Earth]] (''see'' [[colonization of Venus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/15570/colonizing-venus-with-floating-cities/ |title=Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities |author=Nancy Atkinson |date=16 July 2008 |work=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[science fiction]] authors, including [[Carl Sagan]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]],&lt;ref name = clarkebipeds&gt;''Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!'' (1999) [[Arthur C. Clarke]], Voyager {{ISBN|0-00-224698-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isaac Asimov]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Good Earth Is Dying'' (1971) [[Isaac Asimov]] (published in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that shipping any excess population into space is not a viable solution to human overpopulation. According to Clarke, "the population battle must be fought or won here on Earth".&lt;ref name = clarkebipeds/&gt; The problem for these authors is not the lack of resources in space (as shown in books such as ''Mining the Sky''&lt;ref&gt;[[Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets|Mining the Sky]] (1996) [[John&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]]. Addison Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-47959-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but the physical impracticality of shipping vast numbers of people into space to "solve" overpopulation on Earth. However, [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]'s calculations show that Earth could offload all new population growth with a launch services industry about the same size as the current airline industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=O'Neill, Gerard K.|year=1981|title=2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-44751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[StarTram]] concept, by [[James R. Powell]] (the co-inventor of [[maglev]] transport) and others, envisions a capability to send up to 4 million people a decade to space per facility.&lt;ref name=StarTram2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startram.com/resources|title=StarTram2010: Maglev Launch: Ultra Low Cost Ultra High Volume Access to Space for Cargo and Humans|publisher=startram.com|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;nbsp;hypothetical extraterrestrial colony could potentially grow by reproduction only (i.e., without any immigration), with all of the inhabitants being the direct descendants of the original colonists.

===Urbanization===
Despite the increase in population density within cities (and the emergence of megacities), [[UN Habitat]] states in its reports that urbanization may be the best compromise in the face of global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6244496.stm |title=UN Habitat calling urban living 'a good thing |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities concentrate human activity within limited areas, limiting the breadth of environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michellenijhuis.com/ |title=National Geographic Magazine; Special report 2008: Changing Climate (Village Green-article by Michelle Nijhuis) |publisher=Michellenijhuis.com |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this mitigating influence can only be achieved if [[urban planning]] is significantly improved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2523&amp;catid=5&amp;typeid=6&amp;subMenuId=0 |title=UN Habitat calling to rethink urban planning |publisher=Unhabitat.org |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807191706/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2523&amp;catid=5&amp;typeid=6&amp;subMenuId=0 |archivedate=7 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and city services are properly maintained.

The IBM 4765 data sheet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc/pdf/PCIe_Spec_Sheet.pdf|title=IBM 4765 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the coprocessor in detail.

IBM supplies two cryptographic-system implementations:
* The [[PKCS11|PKCS#11]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/|title=Cryptsoft|website=www.cryptsoft.com|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; implementation creates a high-security solution for application programs developed for this industry-standard API.
* The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) implementation provides many functions of special interest in the finance industry, extensive support for distributed key management, and a base on which custom processing and cryptographic functions can be added.
Toolkits for custom application development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc/custom_program.shtml|title=IBM 4765 custom programming - United States|date=2018-03-19|website=www.ibm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also available.

Applications may include financial PIN transactions, bank-to-clearing-house transactions, EMV transactions for integrated circuit (chip) based credit cards, and general-purpose cryptographic applications using [[symmetric key]] algorithms, [[Cryptographic hash function|hashing]] algorithms, and [[public key algorithm]]s.

The operational keys (symmetric or RSA private) are generated in the coprocessor and are then saved either in a keystore file or in application memory, encrypted under the master key of that coprocessor. Any coprocessor with an identical master key can use those keys.

== Supported Systems ==
IBM supports the 4765 on [[IBM Z]], [[IBM Power Systems|IBM POWER]] Systems, and IBM-approved x86 servers ([[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc/software.shtml|title=IBM PCIeCC software package - United States|date=2018-03-19|website=www.ibm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* IBM Z: Crypto Express4S (CEX4S) / Crypto Express3C (CEX3C) - feature code 0865
* IBM POWER systems: feature codes EJ27, EJ28, and EJ29 
* x86: Machine type-model 4765-001

== History ==
As of May 2011, the IBM 4765 superseded the [[IBM 4764]] that was discontinued.

The IBM 4765 has been discontinued on all platforms. The successor to the 4765, the IBM 4767, was introduced on each of the IBM server platforms:
* IBM Z, where it is called the Crypto Express5S and is available as feature code 0890
* IBM POWER systems, where it is available as feature codes EJ32 / EJ33
* x86 servers, where it is called the 4767-002

'''[[Insider threat]] management''' is the process of preventing, combating, detecting, and monitoring employees, remote vendors and contractors, to fortify an organization's data from theft, fraud and damage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Combating%20the%20Insider%20Threat_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
An insider is an individual who is employed by an agency and has access to facilities, sensitive information, organizational data, information systems, and other equipment.&lt;ref name="national insider"&gt;{{cite web|title=Insider Threats Incidents, Data Breaches, News, Examples - Could They Happen To Your Organization|url=http://www.nationalinsiderthreatsig.org/pdfs/Insider%20Threats%20Incidents-Could%20They%20Happen%20To%20Your%20Organization.pdf|website=www.NationalInsiderThreatSig.org|publisher=|access-date=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have accounts giving them legitimate access to computer systems, with this access originally having been given to them to serve in the performance of their duties; these permissions could be abused to harm the organization. Insiders are often familiar with the organization's data and intellectual property as well as the methods that are in place to protect them. This makes it easier for the insider to circumvent any security controls of which they are aware. Physical proximity to data means that the insider does not need to hack into the organizational network through the outer perimeter by traversing firewalls; rather they are in the building already, often with direct access to the organization's internal network. Insider threats are harder to defend against than attacks from outsiders since the insider already has legitimate access to the organization's information and assets.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/counterintelligence/the-insider-threat |title=FBI Counterintelligence: The Insider Threat. An introduction to detecting and deterring an insider spy |publisher=FBI.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210135443/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/counterintelligence/the-insider-threat |archivedate=2014-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insiders may comprise permanent and temporary employees, vendors, contractors, suppliers, or ex-employees. &lt;ref name="Dark" /&gt;Most common insiders are those that have elevated access where they can utilize sensitive information without drawing suspicion. However, anyone can be an insider threat to an organization if they do not dispose, secure, utilize sensitive information described in an agency's regulations. There have been cases where individuals are compromised by an opposing agency and exploited by the individual's financial status, threats on their life, or other factors in order to force the individual to comply with the opposing agencies demands.

==Criminal activity==
An insider may attempt to steal property or information for personal gain, or to benefit another organization or country.&lt;ref name = "FBI" /&gt; These attacks may range from information data being stolen to the destruction of business property. Insiders may perform the following threats against their organization:
* Espionage, criminal enterprise, fraud, theft and unauthorized disclosure of information (Classified information, sensitive information, intellectual property, trade secrets, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) )
* Information technology sabotage
* Any action that results in the loss or degradation of organization resources or capabilities and it's ability to accomplish its mission or business function.
* Acts of terrorism&lt;ref name="national insider"/&gt;

==Common insider identifiers==
Insiders have similar characteristics that can be compiled to in order to help determine possible threats. Most researchers have identified that insiders mainly show antisocial behavior that may include but not limited to: [[Machiavellianism]], [[narcissism]], and [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref name="Dark"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maasberg|first1=M|title=The Dark Side of the Insider: Detecting the Insider Threat through Examination of Dark Triad Personality Traits|journal=IEEE|date=2015|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2015.423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the information system side, there is the list of common behavioral indicators of known insiders:
* Downloading substantial amounts of data to external drives
* Accessing confidential data that is not relevant to a user's role
* Emailing sensitive information to a personal account
* Attempts to bypass security controls
* Requests for clearance or higher-level access without need;
*Frequently accessing the workspace outside of normal working hours;
*Irresponsible social media behaviors;
*Maintaining access to sensitive data after termination;
*Using unauthorized external storage devices;
*Visible disgruntlement toward employers or co-workers;
*Chronic violation of organization policies;
*Decline in work performance;
*Use of mobile devices to photograph  or otherwise record computer screens, common work areas or data centers;
*Excessive use of printers and scanners;
*Electronic communications containing excessive use of negative language;
*Installing unapproved software;
*Communication with high-risk current or former employees;
*Traveling to countries known for intellectual property (IP) theft or hosting competitors;
*Violation of corporate policies;
*Network crawling, data hoarding or copying from internal repositories;
*Anomalies in work hours;
*Attempts to access restricted areas;
*Indications of living beyond one's means
* Discussions of resigning or new business ventures; and
* Complaints of hostile, abnormal, unethical or illegal behaviors

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">The '''International Academy of Sex Research''' ('''IASR''') is a scientific society for researchers in [[sexology]].  According to [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]], retired director of the [[Kinsey Institute]], IASR "can claim...most of the field's leading researchers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25desire-t.html?_r=1&amp;hp The New York Times Magazine. (25 January 2009). ''What is female desire?'' by Daniel Bergner, p. 26.]&lt;/ref&gt;   IASR is unique among sexology organizations in that individuals must be elected to membership, which requires demonstration of substantial contribution to sexology, including the authorship of 10 or more professional publications.  Notable members have included Drs. [[Ray Blanchard]], [[Milton Diamond]], [[Kurt Freund]], [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]], [[Leonore Tiefer]], Judith Becker, and [[Ken Zucker]]. The official journal of IASR is the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]''.

==History==
IASR was founded on 1 August 1973. The 53 founding charter members were nominated by the board of the journal ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', which became the official publication of the IASR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">The '''International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures''' is a campaign group, which joins together various organizations around the world whose primary aim is to bring about the reunification of all the surviving [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Sculptures]] to [[Athens]], Greece.

The Association was founded in November 2005 at a meeting in Athens of twelve national reunification organisations organised by the Greek government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elginism.com/20051124/382/ Meeting in Athens of committees for the return of the Parthenon Sculptures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elginism.com/20051126/383/ An international reunification committee]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elginism.com/20051127/283/ New initiatives in support of the reunification of the Parthenon Marbles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder and current chair of the campaign, [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]], is also involved with some of the member organizations. At the founding meeting a declaration was released&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parthenoninternational.org/declaration Declaration on the Parthenon Sculptures]&lt;/ref&gt; which encapsulated the common goals of all the members.

The original twelve members of the Association were:
* [[Australians for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]] ('''Australia''')
* [[Belgium Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Belgium''')
* [[Cyprus Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''[[Cyprus]]''')
* [[German Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Germany''')
* [[British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''[[Great Britain]]''')
* [[Italian Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Italy''')
* [[International Organizing Committee - New Zealand - for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''New Zealand''')
* [[Russia Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Russia''')
* [[Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures, Serbia]] ('''[[Serbia]]''')
* [[Spain Committee for the Return of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Spain''')
* [[Swedish Parthenon Committee]] ('''Sweden''')
* [[The American Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures, Inc]] ('''United States''')

Other organisations joined later, bringing the total number of members to seventeen:
* [[Brazilian Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]] ('''[[Brazil]]''')
* [[Canadian Committee for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Canada''')
* [[Finnish Committee the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''[[Finland]]''')
* [[Marbles Reunited]] ('''[[Great Britain]]''')
* [[Swiss Committee the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles]] ('''Switzerland''')

The International Association of the Parthenon Sculptures is governed by a charter and only acts based on the unanimous agreement of its members. Each member organisation appoints a delegate from among their members to represent them on the committee.

The {{nihongo|'''Japan Atomic Energy Agency'''|日本原子力研究開発機構|Nihon genshiryoku kenkyū kaihatsu kikō|'''JAEA'''}} is an [[Independent Administrative Institution]] formed on October 1, 2005 by a merger of two previous semi-governmental organizations.  While it inherited the activities of both PNC and JAERI, it also inherited the nickname of JAERI, "Genken" 原研, an abbreviated word for "nuclear research".

On April 10, 2007, JAEA officially joined the [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership|GNEP]] alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2043547 Nuclear Engineering International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515185653/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2043547 |date=2011-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other members in the alliance are [[Areva]], [[Washington Group International]] and BWX.  It is expected that the experience gained from the Rokkasho centrifuge enrichment plant will be a key contribution from JAEA.

On April 1, 2016, JAEA transferred some of its laboratories to the [[National Institute of Radiological Sciences]] (NIRS), and the NIRS body was renamed to the National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST) which includes existing laboratories of the NIRS.

==Facts Overview==
*Establishment: October 2005
*Founding Law: The Japan Atomic energy Agency Law (日本原子力研究開発機構法)
*Headquarters: Tokai-mura
*Permanent Staff: 4386 people as of October 2005
*Board Chairman: 岡﨑俊雄 Inaugurated January 2007

==Locations and Facilities==
The following is an incomplete list of its activities, sorted by location:

===Tokai-mura Facilities===
JAEA has several facilities located in [[Tōkai, Ibaraki|Tōkai]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], which was the first center in Japan for nuclear research.  Currently, JAEA has expanded to several other sites in the [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] as well as all of Japan.
*Tokai R&amp;D Center (東海研究開発センター)
**Nuclear Science Research Institute (原子力科学研究所)
**Nuclear Fuel Cycle Engineering Laboratories (核燃料サイクル工学研究所)
*The Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (大強度陽子加速器計画 or [[J-PARC]] for short) houses many particle research facilities.

===Tsuruga Facilities===
JAEA has another head base in [[Tsuruga, Fukui|Tsuruga]], [[Fukui Prefecture]]. It is a [[fast breeder reactor]] center and a Research and Development (R&amp;D) center.

===Oarai R&amp;D Center (大洗研究開発センター)===
This center is located in [[Ōarai, Ibaraki|Ōarai]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], close to, but not at the same site as Tokai-mura.  It houses the [[Jōyō (nuclear reactor)|Jōyō]] reactor, the [[Japan Materials Testing Reactor]], the new [[High-temperature engineering test reactor]], an environmental reactivity monitoring center, and a children's museum.

&lt;!-- This Laboratory is transfered to QST(former NIRS) 
===Naka Fusion Institute (那珂核融合研究所)===
The NFI is located in [[Naka, Ibaraki]] and does work complimenting the [[ITER]] project.  Of notable significance is the [[JT-60]] large tokamak device.
--&gt;
===Ningyo-toge Environmental Engineering Center (人形峠環境技術センター)===
This is a small uranium refining and conversion plant, as well as a small centrifuge enrichment demonstration plant located in [[Kamisaibara, Okayama|Kamisaibara]], [[Okayama Prefecture]].  The center deals with front-end issues of the nuclear fuel cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.com.au/nip79.htm Nuclear power in Japan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aomori R&amp;D Center (青森研究開発センター)===
The Aomori Research and Development Center is spread out over [[Rokkasho, Aomori|Rokkasho]] , [[Aomori Prefecture]] and [[Mutsu, Aomori|Mutsu]], [[Aomori Prefecture]]. The Rokkasho site does work with fusion research, notably a fusion reactor design research institute, a particle accelerator, and a materials irradiation test facility.&lt;!-- This site works a great deal with the Naka Fusion Institute and it is hoped that it will someday be the location for the [[DEMO]] reactor.--&gt; The facilities in Mutsu include a museum, an ocean monitoring facility, and radioactive waste management.

JAEA also co-operates and provides support for the activities of [[Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited]] with their reprocessing facility and Uranium enrichment facility plans.

&lt;!-- These Laboratory is transfered to QST (former NIRS) 
===Kansai Photon Science Institute (関西光化学研究所)===
Abbreviated, KPSI, this is a collection of two separate locations.  [http://wwwapr.kansai.jaea.go.jp/jaea/e/index.html Official English Site]

====Kansai Science City====
JAEA runs the part of the Kansai Science Center in Umemidai Kizu-cho [[Kizugawa, Kyoto]] (京都府木津地区).It has Advanced [[Photon]] Research Center, [[Neutron]] [[Biology]] Research Center.

====Hyōgo Prefecture====
This location houses the [[SPring-8]] synchrotron radiation facility.

===Takasaki Advanced Radiation Research Institute (高崎量子応用研究所)===
This is located in [[Takasaki, Gunma]].  Its Department of Advanced Radiation Technology offers an ion irradiation facility with numerous particle accelerators, electron beam accelerators, an ion implanter and several [[cobalt-60]] sources.  In addition to this, a number of research groups operate here.  The facilities are open to a number of universities and research institutes.
--&gt;
===Horonobe Underground Research Center (幌延深地層研究センター)===
The Horonobe URL carries out research and development on geoscientific study and on geological disposal for high-level radioactive waste. It is expected that this site will become Japan's national [[Deep geological repository]] for nuclear waste.

The '''G. V. Kurdyumov Institute for Metal Physics (IMP) of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|Інститут металофізики ім. Г. В. Курдюмова Національної академії наук України}})  is one of the oldest research institutions of physical science within the Academy.

The research institute was established in 1945 as a laboratory of the Black Metallurgy ([[Ferrous metallurgy|Ferrous Metallurgy]]) Institute. In 1955 it was turned into a separate research institute.

Currently, the Institute employs more than 300 researchers (together with several Full Members and Corresponding Members of the NASU) and around 300 peoples of supporting personnel. It has more than 20 scientific units (including the state-of-the-art hardware) which are grouped around several research programs.

Traditionally, the Institute is focused on fundamental research. At the same time, applied research on metals, their [[alloy]]s, and related nanotechnologies strengthen the Institute's activities.

The IMP is consistently ranked at the top of national academic institutions ranking. Besides, international reputation of IOP is growing constantly as prominent scientists from the Institute expand their activity to leading foreign research centers and universities.

'''Kurt Löwenstein''' (18 May 1885 in [[Bleckede]] – 8 May 1939 in Paris) was a German [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]]/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician, Socialist reform pedagogue and one of the founders of [[Socialist Youth of Germany - Falcons]].

==Family and education==

Löwenstein's father, Bernhard Löwenstein, had a clothing shop, which brought the family a modest income. His mother Jeanette, born Blumenthal, died of [[cancer]] in 1892. In 1895 Kurt Löwenstein went to [[Judaism|Jewish]] private school in [[Hanover]]. In 1899 he went to high school where he earned tuition by delivering newspapers and holding after-classes where he helped school classmates with homework.

Between 1904 and 1907 Löwenstein studied [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] in [[Halberstadt]] and he was accepted into the orthodox Rabbi school in Berlin. At the same time he also attended Philosophical and Pedagogical courses at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelm University]]. In 1908 he was offered the position of the Rabbi in Hanover but refused it because of religious doubts.

On 29 April 1911 he married Mara Kerwel (1891-1969), a chemist. When they got married, they signed a following [[Prenuptial agreement|marriage contract]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fes.de/archiv/adsd_neu/inhalt/nachlass/nachlass_l/loewenstein-ku.htm source: FES Archiv]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a proof of their progressive thinking and acting concerning [[gender equality]]:

§1 On 1 April 1911 both of the contracties, out of free choice and based on love, agree to found the marriage upon equal rights and responsibilities.

§2 As long as the marriage will last, both contracties and their offspring will use the common name Kerlöw which derives from the marriage.

§3 To legalise the use of this name, state permission should be pursued. If this permission is not given, the contracties promise to use the name in all non administrative areas of life.

§4 To be lawfully wedded both of the contracties will also subject to the state marital contract. However, by a word of honour they declare that the responsibilities and rights, described in the state marital contract will not apply as they find them redundant.

In 1910 he finished his Ph.D thesis on [[Jean-Marie Guyau]]'s pedagogic concepts.

==Politics==
A [[Pacifism|pacifist]], Löwenstein applied to join the [[Red Cross]] in 1914 in [[Grodno]] ([[Belarus]]) where he took care of injured soldiers until 1918. In the meantime he joined ''Soldatenraete'', German Socialist soldier councils, and identified himself as a [[Socialism|Socialist]]. He joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (''Unabhängigen Sozialdemokratischen Partei Deutschlands'' - USPD) and became active especially in forming the positions on education and educational politics of the party.

In June 1920 he was elected as a member of the [[Bundestag|National Parliament]] until 1923 as a member of the USPD and from 1923 to 1933 as a Member of the SPD. In September 1920 he was elected an Educational Counselor of Berlin by Election Committee of the City Council. The Brunderburger president denied him of this position in 1920.

From 1921 Löwenstein was responsible for education in the City Council of Berlin – [[Neukölln]]. In this time he organised progressive school tuition fees, providing more school meals for children. He organised special preparation classes for graduation for working class children. Together with [[Fritz Karsen]] they founded the [[Chemnitz|Karl-Marx School]], the first non-religious school in Berlin.

From 1922 to 1934 Löwenstein was Vice-president and one of the co-founders of the [[International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International|Socialist Educational International]] (now the IFM-SEI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-sei.org/c/show/24 International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International Official Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 to 1934 he was the president of the International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International. From 1924 to 1933 he was the president of German Children's friend movement (ReichsArbeitsGemeinschaft der Kinderfreunde), now the [[Socialist Youth of Germany – Falcons]]. In 1933, when the organisation was forbidden, it united 130,000 children, 10,000 guides and 60,000 parents.

The '''lineage markers''' are characteristic molecules for [[cell lineage]]s, e.g. [[cell surface marker]]s, [[mRNA]]s, or internal [[protein]]s. Certain antibodies can be used to detect or purify cells with these markers by binding to their surface antigens. A standard cocktail of [[antibodies]] can be designed to remove or purify mature [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoietic cells]] or to detect [[Cluster of differentiation]] from a sample. Those antibodies are e.g. targeted to [[CD2]], [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]], [[CD4]], [[CD5 (protein)|CD5]], [[CD8]], [[NK1.1]], [[B220]], TER-119, and Gr-1 in mice and CD3 (T lymphocytes), [[CD14]] (Monocytes), [[CD16]] (NK cells, granulocytes), [[CD19]] (B lymphocytes), [[CD20]] (B lymphocytes), and [[CD56]] (NK cells) in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lineage Markers|url=http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=lineage%20markers|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76996">This '''list of protein subcellular localisation prediction tools''' includes software, databases, and web services that are used for [[protein subcellular localization prediction]].

Some tools are included that are commonly used to infer location through predicted structural properties, such as [[signal peptide]] or [[Transmembrane helix|transmembrane helices]], and these tools output predictions of these features rather than specific locations. These software related to [[protein structure prediction]] may also appear in [[List of protein structure prediction software|lists of protein structure prediction software]].

[[File:Marc Shapiro picture 5.jpg|thumb|Marc B. Shapiro]]
'''Marc B. Shapiro''' (Hebrew: מלך שפירא, born 1966) is a professor and the author of various books and articles on Jewish history, philosophy, theology, and rabbinic literature.

== Education and career ==
Shapiro received his BA at [[Brandeis University]] and his PhD at [[Harvard University]], where he was the last PhD student of Professor [[Isadore Twersky]]. He received rabbinical ordination from Rabbi [[Ephraim Greenblatt]]. Shapiro's father is [[Edward S. Shapiro]], who has published books on American history and American Jewish history.

Shapiro holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Judaic Studies at the [[University of Scranton]]. Shapiro is an on-line lecturer for Torah in Motion, for which he also leads Jewish history tours to Europe and Morocco. He often writes for the Seforim Blog.

Shapiro has been a resident of [[West Orange, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Johanna. [http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/060106/njLocalScholarOrganizes.html "Local scholar organizes conference on history of Modern Orthodoxy"], ''[[New Jersey Jewish News]]'', June 1, 2006. Accessed June 28, 2018. "A West Orange scholar is the co-organizer of the first-ever conference in America on the history of Modern Orthodoxy, to be held June 13–15 in Scranton, Pa. Marc B. Shapiro, who holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Jewish Studies at the University of Scranton, said the conference will take a historical view of the movement in order to explore its meaning for today."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Shapiro's writings often challenge the bounds of the conventional Orthodox understanding of Judaism using academic methodology while adhering to Modern Orthodox sensibilities. His book, ''Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy,'' a biography of [[Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg]], was a National Jewish Book Award finalist. His second book, ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology'', also a National Jewish Book Award finalist, argued against the conventional Orthodox belief that [[Maimonides]] Thirteen Principles of Faith are unquestionable dogma.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/6488/author-challenges-rambam-s-principles/|title=Author Challenges Rambam's Principles|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gidon Rothstein, writing in the Association for Jewish Studies Review, called the book's collection of sources "remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothstein|first=Gidon|date=2005-04-01|title=Marc B. Shapiro. The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised. The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. 221 pp.|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ajs-review/article/div-classtitlemarc-b-shapiro-span-classitalicthe-limits-of-orthodox-theology-maimonidesandapos-thirteen-principles-reappraisedspan-the-littman-library-of-jewish-civilization-oxford-oxford-university-press-2004-221-ppdiv/9C4EAB7E70036B57A425206932142CDC|journal=AJS Review|volume=29|issue=1|pages=169–171|doi=10.1017/S0364009405260099|issn=1475-4541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was criticized by some Hareidi Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Zev Leff]], an American [[Haredi Judaism|Hareidi]] rabbi, wrote that "I cannot recommend it to the general public, who can be easily misled by some of the questionable theses in this book."&lt;ref name="Leff"&gt;http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/ja/5767/summer67/76_79.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, his book ''Changing the Immutable: How Orthodox Judaism Rewrites Its History'' was released. The book documents the phenomenon of internal censorship in Orthodoxy. [[Adam Ferziger]] said the book "is the outstanding product of a master of rabbinic literature and an extraordinarily sharp-eyed and meticulous scholar."&lt;ref&gt;http://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/the-sagacious-scholar-and-the-censor-by-adam-ferziger/&lt;/ref&gt; Yair Hoffman, writing in the Hareidi online website [[Yeshiva World News]], criticized the book, saying that "there is a plethora of material that simply should not have been included in the book because it does not back up his thesis."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/313895/book-review-of-changing-the-immutble.html|title=Book Review: Marc Shapiro's "Changing the Immutable"|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra Glinter, writing in [[The Forward]], praised Shapiro's "evenhanded, evidence-heavy approach" and that he was not a "polemicist," but said "his argument could also have benefited from a more critical thrust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/culture/311651/orthodoxys-inconvenient-truths/|title=Orthodoxy's Inconvenient Truths|last=Glinter|first=Ezra|date=2015-07-13|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-03-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13037">The '''marginal value theorem''' ('''MVT''') is an [[optimality model]] that usually describes the behavior of an optimally foraging individual in a system where resources (often food) are located in discrete patches separated by areas with no resources. Due to the resource-free space, animals must spend time traveling between patches. The MVT can also be applied to other situations in which organisms face [[diminishing returns]].

The MVT was first proposed by [[Eric Charnov]] in 1976. In his original formulation: "The predator should leave the patch it is presently in when the marginal capture rate in the patch drops to the average capture rate for the habitat."&lt;ref name="Charnov 1976"&gt;[[Eric Charnov|Charnov, E. L.]] 1976. Optimal foraging: the marginal value theorem. Theoretical Population Biology 9:129–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
All animals must forage for food in order to meet their energetic needs, but doing so is energetically costly. It is assumed that evolution by natural selection results in animals utilizing the most economic and efficient strategy to balance energy gain and consumption.  The Marginal Value Theorem is an optimality model that describes the strategy that maximizes gain per unit time in systems where resources, and thus rate of returns, decrease with time.&lt;ref name="Parker 1991"&gt;Parker, G.A. “Marginal Value Theorem with Exploitation Time Costs: Diet, Sperm Reserves, and Optimal Copula Duration in Dung Flies” (1992) The American Naturalist 139(6):1237–1256&lt;/ref&gt; The model weighs benefits and costs and is used to predict giving up time and giving up density. Giving up time (GUT) is the interval of time between when the animal last feeds and when it leaves the patch. Giving up density (GUD) is the food density within a patch when the animal will choose to move on to other food patches.

When an animal is foraging in a system where food sources are patchily distributed, the MVT can be used to predict how much time an individual will spend searching for a particular patch before moving on to a new one. In general, individuals will stay longer if (1) patches are farther apart or (2) current patches are poor in resources. Both situations increase the ratio of travel cost to foraging benefit.

[[File:Marginalvaluetheorem.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The optimal time spent in a patch is given by the tangent to the resource intake curve that departs from the expected transit time value. Any other line crossing the resource intake curve has a shallower slope and thus a sub-optimal resource intake rate.]]

==Modeling==
As animals forage in patchy systems, they balance resource intake, traveling time, and foraging time. Resource intake within a patch diminishes with time, as shown by the solid curve in the graph to the right. The curve follows this pattern because resource intake is initially very fast, but slows as the resource is depleted. Traveling time is shown by the distance from the leftmost vertical dotted line to the y-axis. Optimal foraging time is modeled by connecting this point on the x-axis tangentially to the resource intake curve. Doing so maximizes the ratio between resource intake and time spent foraging and traveling.

At the extremes of the loading curve, animals spend too much time traveling for a small payoff, or they search too long in a given patch for an ineffective load. The MVT identifies the best possible intermediate between these extremes.

===Assumptions===
# The individual is assumed to control when it leaves the patch in order to maximize the ratio between resource intake and time.
# The consumer depletes the amount of resources in the patch where he/she is foraging; therefore, the rate of intake of food in that patch decreases as a function of time.
# If there is variation in the quality of patches, the MVT assumes that different patches are distributed randomly throughout the landscape.

==Examples==

===Humans===
A common illustration of the MVT is apple picking in humans. When one first arrives at a new apple tree, the number of apples picked per minute is high, but it rapidly decreases as the lowest-hanging fruits are depleted. Strategies in which too few apples are picked from each tree or where each tree is exhausted are suboptimal because they result, respectively, in time lost travelling among trees or picking the hard to find last few apples from a tree. The optimal time spent picking apples in each tree is thus a compromise between these two strategies, which can be quantitatively found using the MVT.

===Optimal foraging in great tits===
[[Great tit]]s are a species of bird found throughout Europe, northern Africa, and Asia. They are known to forage in “patchy” environments, and research has shown that their behavior can be modeled by [[Optimal foraging theory|optimal foraging models]], including the MVT. In a 1977 study by R.A. Cowie,&lt;ref name="Cowie 1977"&gt;Cowie, R. J. (1977) “Optimal foraging in great tits (Parus Major)” Nature 268:137–139&lt;/ref&gt; birds were deprived of food and then allowed to forage through patches in two different environments (the environments differed only in distance between patches). As predicted, in both cases birds spent more time in one area when the patches were farther away or yielded more benefits, regardless of the environment. In a similar experiment by Naef-Daenzer (1999),&lt;ref name="ND1999"&gt;Naef-Daenzer, Beat (1999) “Patch time allocation and patch sampling by foraging great and blue tits” Animal Behavior 59:989–999&lt;/ref&gt; great tits were shown to have a foraging efficiency 30% better than random foraging would yield. This is because great tits were specifically spending more time in resource-rich areas, as predicted by the MVT. This data supports the use of the MVT in predicting the foraging behavior of great tits.

===Feeding in hairy armadillos and guinea pigs===
Experimental evidence has shown that [[screaming hairy armadillo]]s and [[guinea pig]]s qualitatively follow MVT when foraging.&lt;ref name="Cassini 1990"&gt;Cassini, Marcelo H., Alejandro Kacelnik, and Enrique T. Segura (1990) “The tale of the screaming hairy armadillo, the guinea pig, and the marginal value theorem” Animal Behavior 39(6):1030–1050&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers ran several parallel experiments: one for each animal under consistent patch quality, and one for guinea pigs with varying patch quality. While the qualitative foraging trend was shown to follow MVT in each case, the quantitative analysis indicated that each patch was exploited further than expected.

===Plant root growth===
The MVT can be used to model foraging in plants as well as animals. Plants have been shown to preferentially place their roots, which are their foraging organs, in areas of higher resource concentration. Recall that the MVT predicts that animals will forage for longer in patches with higher resource quality. Plants increase root biomass in layers/areas of soil that are rich in nutrients and resources, and decrease root growth into areas of poor-quality soil. Thus, plants grow roots into patches of soil according to their wealth of resources in a manner consistent with the MVT.&lt;ref name="mcknickle"&gt;McNickle, Gordon G. and James F. Calhill Jr. “Plant root growth and the marginal value theorem” (2009) Proceedings of the National Academ of Sciences of the United States of America 106(12):4747–4751&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, plant roots grow more quickly through low-quality patches of soil than through high-quality patches of soil, just as foraging animals are predicted to spend less time in low-quality areas than high-quality areas.

===Copulation time in dung flies===
The MVT can be applied to situations other than foraging in which animals experience diminished returns. Consider, for example, the mating copulation duration of the [[Scathophaga stercoraria|yellow dung fly]]. In the dung fly mating system, males gather on fresh cow droppings and wait for females to arrive in smaller groups to lay their eggs. Males must compete with each other for the chance to mate with arriving females—sometimes one male will kick another male off of a female and take over mating with the female mid-copulation. In this instance, the second male fertilizes about 80% of the eggs.&lt;ref name="Parker and Stuart"&gt;Parker, G. A. and R. A. Stuart (1976) “Animal Behavior as a Strategy Optimizer: Evolution of Resource Assessment Strategies and Optimal Emigration Thresholds” The American Naturalist 110(976):1055–1076&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after a male has mated with a female he guards her so that no other males will have the opportunity to mate with her and displace his sperm before she lays her eggs. After the female lays her eggs, the male must take the time to search for another female before he is able to copulate again.

The question, then, is how long the dung fly should spend copulating with each female. On one hand, the longer a male dung fly copulates the more eggs he can fertilize. However, the benefits of extra copulation time diminish quickly, as the male loses the chance to find another female during long copulations. The MVT predicts that the optimal copulation time is just long enough to fertilize about 80% of the eggs; after this time, the rewards are much smaller and are not worth missing out on another mate.&lt;ref name="Parker and Stuart" /&gt; This predicted value for copulation time, 40 minutes, is very close to the average observed value, 36 minutes.

In dung flies, the observed values of copulation time and time searching for another mate vary with body weight. Heavier males have shorter search times and shorter copulation times. These shorter search times are likely due to increased cost of travel with increased body weight; shorter copulation times probably reflect that it is easier for heavier males to successfully take over females mid-copulation. Additionally, researchers have taken into account “patch quality,” i.e. the quality of females arriving on the various cowpats. Research also shows that males copulate for longer with the larger females who hold more eggs and have larger reproductive tract dimensions. Thus, males change their copulation time to maximize their fitness, but they are doing so in response to selection imposed by female morphology. Even with these variations, male dung flies do exhibit close-to-optimal copulation time relative to their body size, as predicted by the MVT.&lt;ref name ="Parker et al 1999"&gt;Parker, Geoffrey A., Leigh W. Simmons, Paula Stockley, Doreen M. McChristie, and Eric L. Charnov. (1999) “Optimal copula duration in yellow dung flies: effects of female size and egg content.” Animal Behavior 57:795–805&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many studies, such as the examples presented above, have shown good qualitative support for predictions generated by the Marginal Value Theorem. However, in some more quantitative studies, the predictions of the MVT haven’t been as successful, with the observed values substantially deviating from predictions. One proposed explanation for these deviations is that it is difficult to objectively measure payoff rates. For example, an animal in an unpredictable environment may need to spend extra time sampling, making it hard for researchers to determine foraging time.&lt;ref name="Nonacs"&gt;Nonacs, Peter. “State dependent behavior and the marginal value theorem.” (2001) Behavioral Ecology 12(1):71–83&lt;/ref&gt;
        
Beyond this imprecision, some researchers propose that there is something fundamental missing from the model. Namely, animals are probably doing more than just foraging, whether it be dealing with predation risks or searching for mating opportunities.&lt;ref name="Nonacs" /&gt; Natural selection is not the only force influencing the evolution of species. Sexual selection, for example, may alter foraging behaviors, making them less consistent with the MVT. These researchers point out that the marginal value theorem is a starting point, but complexity and nuances must be incorporated into models and tests for foraging and patch-use.

One other type of model that has been used in place of MVT in predicting foraging behavior is the state-dependent behavior model. Although state-dependent models have been viewed as a generalization of the MVT,&lt;ref name="Wajnberg et al 2000"&gt;Wajnberg Eric, Pierre Bernhard, Frederic Hamelin and Guy Boivin (2006). "Optimal patch time allocation for time-limited foragers." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 60, 1–10&lt;/ref&gt; they are unlikely to generate broadly applicable predictions like those from the MVT because they test predictions under a specific set of conditions. While the predictions of these models must be tested under precise conditions, they might offer valuable insights not available from broader models such as MVT.&lt;ref name="Nonacs" /&gt;

[[Image:oceanic spreading.svg|thumb|250px|right|Oceanic crust is formed at an oceanic ridge, while the lithosphere is subducted back into the asthenosphere at trenches.]]

'''Marine geology''' or '''geological oceanography''' is the study of the history and structure of the ocean floor. It involves [[geophysical]], [[geochemistry|geochemical]], [[sedimentology|sedimentological]] and [[paleontological]] investigations of the [[ocean floor]] and [[coastal zone]]. Marine geology has strong ties to [[geophysics]] and to [[physical oceanography]].

Marine geological studies were of extreme importance in providing the critical evidence for [[sea floor spreading]] and [[plate tectonics]] in the years following World War II. The deep ocean floor is the last essentially unexplored frontier and detailed mapping in support of both military (submarine) objectives and economic ([[petroleum]] and [[metal]] [[mining]]) objectives drives the research.

==Overview==
[[Image:Marianatrenchmap.png|thumb|left|A trench forms at the boundary where two tectonic plates meet]]

The [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] around the [[Pacific Ocean]] with its attendant intense [[volcanism]] and [[seismic]] activity poses a major threat for disastrous [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s and volcanic eruptions. Any ''early warning'' systems for these disastrous events will require a more detailed understanding of marine geology of coastal and [[island arc]] environments.

The study of [[littoral]] and deep sea sedimentation and the precipitation and dissolution rates of [[calcium carbonate]] in various marine environments has important implications for global [[climate change]].

The discovery and continued study of [[Mid-oceanic ridge|mid-ocean rift]] zone volcanism and [[hydrothermal vent]]s, first in the [[Red Sea]] and later along the [[East Pacific Rise]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] systems were and continue to be important areas of marine geological research. The [[extremophile]] organisms discovered living within and adjacent to those hydrothermal systems have had a pronounced impact on our understanding of life on Earth and potentially the [[origin of life]] within such an environment.

[[Oceanic trench]]es are hemispheric-scale long but narrow topographic depressions of the sea floor. They also are the deepest parts of the ocean floor.

The [[Mariana Trench]] (or Marianas Trench) is the deepest known submarine trench, and the deepest location in the Earth's crust itself. A [[subduction zone]] where the [[Pacific Plate]] is being subducted under the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. The bottom of the trench is further below sea level than [[Mount Everest]] is above sea level.

Through NIA’s University Research Program, faculty and students at NIA member universities collaborate with NASA research leaders in fundamental investigations in aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and systems engineering; materials science; applied mathematics, meteorology and other related fields.

NIA also collaborate with other research institutions worldwide, including universities, government laboratories, industry and other non-profit institutes to accomplish its research objectives. NIA conducts applied research with and for the aerospace industry. Through NIA, industrial partners can gain access to LaRC personnel, facilities and intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIA Research|url=http://nianet.org/resources/Research.aspx|publisher=nianet.org|accessdate=9 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714064943/http://nianet.org/resources/Research.aspx|archivedate=14 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research projects include:

*Boron nitride nano tubes (BNNT) research and development for aerospace and public safety applications. In collaboration with NASA Langley, and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, NIA has developed a neutron shielding material  using boron-containing nanomaterials, which include boron nanoparticles, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), and boron nitride nano-platelets, as well as the polymer composites thereof. This is proposed for advanced radiation shielding and for shielding against high kinetic energy penetrators (i.e. bulletproof vests, protection against micrometeoroids, etc.)&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://technologygateway.nasa.gov/docs/TOA_LARC107_Radiation4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Field research in the Republic of Tyva in Siberia to validate satellite studies that show longer periods of drought have strengthened the intensity of fires. Amber Soja, NIA Senior Research Scientist based at NASA’s Langley Researcher Center, conducted research that has shown that these more destructive fires have started to impair the growth of pine-dominated forests after fires and are causing some pine forest areas to transition to steppe that stores far less carbon from the atmosphere.  Likewise, the research shows that the burns cause more destruction when they occur. According to Soja, in other areas where precipitation is limited to begin with, such as the savannas of Australia, longer droughts might actually reduce the number of wildfires because less vegetation would be available to burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voiland|first=Adam|title=A Look Back at a Decade of Fires|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/fires/main/modis-10.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
NIA's graduate program offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the fields of aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, engineering mechanics, engineering physics, materials science and engineering, electrical engineering, ocean engineering and systems engineering.

The '''Network of International Business Schools''' ('''NIBS''') is an association of university-level [[business school|schools of business]] that promotes the incorporation of a strong international dimension into [[management]] training and [[Educational accreditation|accredits]] schools that offer internationally oriented business [[Curriculum|curricula]].  NIBS and its various member institutions advocate for the creation of business education programs that integrate internationalist skills and perspectives, including the practice of foreign languages, the study of comparative management techniques, and the experience of working and studying abroad.  They also facilitate cooperation between educational institutions in different countries, on the premise that this contributes to better relations between nations by deepening understanding of other cultures and social practices.  NIBS was formed in 1993 and currently has approximately 70 member institutions in over 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nibsweb.org/members.html |title= Member Schools |work= nibsweb.org |accessdate= April 11, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140946/http://www.nibsweb.org/members.html |archivedate= April 13, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of NIBS recognize each other’s qualifications, have a common goal of collaboration, and encourage participation in the following:

* Student exchanges/interactions 
* Faculty exchanges/interactions 
* Exchanges of ideas for teaching programs 
* Joint teaching and research programs

The current president of NIBS is Hans van Oudheusden, who also serves as Head of International Relations at the School of Financial Management, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. Previously, the position was held by Dr. David Gillingham, who served in the role from its inception in 1993 until 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= David Gillingham Award|url= http://www.nibsweb.org/david-gillingham-award.html|accessdate= 11 April 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141520/http://www.nibsweb.org/david-gillingham-award.html|archivedate= 13 April 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Ian Charles, who led the organization from 2012 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= IBA Associate Dean is the new NIBS President|url= http://uk.iba.dk/news/143-iba-associate-dean-is-the-new-nibs-president/#143|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==

Since 2008, a key function of the organization has been the accreditation of internationally oriented [[business school|schools of business]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nibsweb.org/accreditation/ |title=Accreditation|work= nibsweb.org |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NIBS accreditation is not intended to compete with long-established accreditation bodies, such as the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), the [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA), or the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS); rather, it focuses on the degree to which the business school has become international in all facets of its organization. The NIBS accreditation scheme is thus generally regarded as a supplement to other accreditations, as well as a signal that an institution is committed to "deep" internationalization.

Any full member school of NIBS may apply for accreditation, which consists of a three-step process: completion of a self-assessment questionnaire on internationalization; a visit by an accreditation team; and a decision by the NIBS Board of Directors.  As of March 2018, a total of 24 institutions have been accredited by NIBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nibsweb.org/about/member-schools/ |title=Member Schools|work= nibsweb.org |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

==Programs==
NIBS operates an annual business conference to present research findings and examine issues related to international business education. The 2017 event will be held in [[Leeds]], UK, and will focus on the role of business schools in preparing students for a rapidly changing global economy. NIBS is also publisher of the ''NIBS Journal'', a peer-reviewed academic journal focused on advancing business theory and practice with relevance to international managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://beacon.salisbury.edu/nibsjournal/aboutnibsjournal.htm |title= The NIBS Journal Mission |work= salisbury.edu |accessdate= April 16, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140416180857/http://beacon.salisbury.edu/nibsjournal/aboutnibsjournal.htm |archivedate= April 16, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization also sponsors two student competitions aimed at cultivating skills in international business and raising awareness of the importance of an international perspective to management: A business plan competition, and a business [[case competition]].

===NIBS Worldwide Case Competition===
[[File:Students present at the NIBS Worldwide Case Competition.jpg|thumb|Presentation at the 2012 NIBS Worldwide Case Competition in Rotterdam, Netherlands]]
Founded in 1996, the NIBS Worldwide Case Competition is among the longest-running undergraduate business case competitions in the world.  In the current format, adopted in 2013, the event begins with a qualifying round, consisting of a written case analysis conducted under controlled conditions at participating universities.  The results of this qualifying round are then used to select the 16 teams that will advance to the championship round, which is held in a host city that rotates from year to year.  Past hosts of the championship round include:

There are eight instances ("lunch plates") f''xyz'' of the problem, where ''x,'' ''y,'' and ''z'' indicate the goodness of a, b, and c, respectively. Procedure ("restaurant") A evaluates candidates in the order a, b, c, and B evaluates candidates in reverse that order, but each "charges" 1 evaluation in 5 cases, 2 evaluations in 2 cases, and 3 evaluations in 1 case.]]

In [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] and [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] the '''no free lunch theorem''' is a result that states that for certain types of mathematical problems, the [[computational cost]] of finding a solution, averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution method. No solution therefore offers a "short cut".  In computing, there are circumstances in which the outputs of all procedures solving a particular type of problem are statistically identical. A colourful way of describing such a circumstance, introduced by [[David Wolpert]] and [[William G. Macready]] in connection with the problems of search&lt;!--

--&gt;
is to say that  '''[[TANSTAAFL|there is no free lunch]]'''. Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for [[machine learning]] ([[statistical inference]]).&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Before Wolpert's article was published, Cullen Schaffer independently proved a restricted version of one of Wolpert's theorems and used it to critique the current state of machine learning research on the problem of induction.&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "no free lunch" [[metaphor]], each "restaurant" (problem-solving procedure) has a "menu" associating each "lunch plate" (problem) with a "price" (the performance of the procedure in solving the problem). The menus of restaurants are identical except in one regard – the prices are shuffled from one restaurant to the next. For an [[omnivore]] who is as likely to order each plate as any other, the average cost of lunch does not depend on the choice of restaurant. But a [[vegan]] who goes to lunch regularly with a [[carnivore]] who seeks economy might pay a high average cost for lunch. To methodically reduce the average cost, one must use advance knowledge of a) what one will order and b) what the order will cost at various restaurants. That is, improvement of performance in problem-solving hinges on using prior information to match procedures to problems.&lt;ref name=WM97/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schaffer94/&gt; 

In formal terms, there is no free lunch when the [[probability distribution]] on problem instances is such that all problem solvers have identically distributed results. In the case of [[search algorithm|search]], a problem instance is an [[objective function]], and a result is a [[sequence]] of values obtained in evaluation of [[candidate solutions]] in the [[function domain|domain]] of the function. For typical interpretations of results, search is an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] process. There is no free lunch in search if and only if the distribution on objective functions is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[permutation]] of the space of candidate solutions.&lt;!--

==Overview==

Some computational problems are solved by searching for good solutions in a space of [[candidate solution]]s. A description of how to repeatedly select candidate solutions for evaluation is called a [[search algorithm]]. On a particular problem, different search algorithms may obtain different results, but over all problems, they are indistinguishable. It follows that if an algorithm achieves superior results on some problems, it must pay with inferiority on other problems. In this sense there is [[no free lunch]] in search.&lt;ref name=WM95/&gt; Alternatively, following Schaffer,&lt;ref name=Schaffer94/&gt; search performance is [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]]. Usually search is interpreted as [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], and this leads to the observation that there is no free lunch in optimization.&lt;ref name=WM97/&gt;

"The 'no free lunch' theorem of Wolpert and Macready," as stated in plain language by Wolpert and Macready themselves, is that "any two algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems."&lt;ref name=WM-coev&gt;Wolpert, D.H., and Macready, W.G. (2005) "Coevolutionary free lunches," ''IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'', 9(6): 721–735&lt;/ref&gt; The "no free lunch" results indicate that matching algorithms to problems gives higher average performance than does applying a fixed algorithm to all.  Igel and Toussaint&lt;ref name=Igel/&gt; and English&lt;ref name=English2004/&gt; have established a general condition under which there is no free lunch. While it is physically possible, it does not hold precisely.&lt;ref name=Igel/&gt; Droste, Jansen, and Wegener have proved a theorem they interpret as indicating that there is "(almost) no free lunch" in practice.&lt;ref name=ANFL/&gt;

To make matters more concrete, consider an optimization practitioner confronted with a problem. Given some knowledge of how the problem arose, the practitioner may be able to exploit the knowledge in selection of an algorithm that will perform well in solving the problem. If the practitioner does not understand how to exploit the knowledge, or simply has no knowledge, then he or she faces the question of whether some algorithm generally outperforms others on real-world problems. The authors of the "(almost) no free lunch" theorem say that the answer is essentially no, but admit some reservations as to whether the theorem addresses practice.&lt;ref name=ANFL/&gt;

==No free lunch (NFL)==

A "problem" is, more formally, an [[objective function]] that associates [[candidate solution]]s with goodness values. A [[search algorithm]] takes an objective function as input and evaluates candidate solutions one-by-one. The output of the algorithm is the [[sequence]] of observed goodness values.&lt;ref&gt;A search algorithm also outputs the sequence of candidate solutions evaluated, but that output is unused in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=English2000&gt;English, T. M. 2000. "Optimization Is Easy and Learning Is Hard in the Typical Function," ''Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation: CEC00'', pp. 924–931. http://www.BoundedTheoretics.com/cec2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolpert and Macready stipulate that an algorithm never reevaluates a candidate solution, and that algorithm performance is measured on outputs.&lt;ref name=WM97/&gt;  For simplicity, we disallow randomness in algorithms. Under these conditions, when a search algorithm is run on every possible input, it generates each possible output exactly once.&lt;ref name=English2004/&gt; Because performance is measured on the outputs, the algorithms are indistinguishable in how often they achieve particular levels of performance.

Some measures of performance indicate how well search algorithms do at [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] of the objective function. Indeed, there seems to be no interesting application of search algorithms in the class under consideration but to optimization problems. A common performance measure is the least index of the least value in the output sequence. This is the number of evaluations required to minimize the objective function. For some algorithms, the time required to find the minimum is proportional to the number of evaluations.&lt;ref name=English2004/&gt;

The original no free lunch (NFL) theorems assume that all objective functions are equally likely to be input to search algorithms.&lt;ref name=WM97/&gt; It has since been established that there is NFL if and only if, loosely speaking, "shuffling" objective functions has no impact on their probabilities.&lt;ref name=Igel/&gt;&lt;ref name=English2004/&gt; Although this condition for NFL is physically possible, it has been argued that it certainly does not hold precisely.&lt;ref name=Igel/&gt;

The obvious interpretation of "not NFL" is "free lunch," but this is misleading. NFL is a matter of degree, not an all-or-nothing proposition. If the condition for NFL holds approximately, then all algorithms yield approximately the same results over all objective functions.&lt;ref name=English2004/&gt; Note also that "not NFL" implies only that algorithms are inequivalent overall by ''some'' measure of performance. For a performance measure of interest, algorithms may remain equivalent, or nearly so.&lt;ref name=English2004/&gt;

===NFL and Kolmogorov randomness===

Almost all elements of the set of all possible functions (in the set-theoretic sense of "function") are [[Kolmogorov randomness | Kolmogorov random]], and hence the NFL theorems apply to a set of functions almost all of which cannot be expressed more compactly than as a lookup table that contains a distinct (and random) entry for each point in the search space. Functions that can be expressed more compactly (for example, by a mathematical expression of reasonable size) are by definition not Kolmogorov random.

Further, within the set of all possible objective functions, levels of goodness are equally represented among candidate solutions, hence good solutions are scattered throughout the space of candidates. Accordingly, a search algorithm will rarely evaluate more than a small fraction of the candidates before locating a very good solution.&lt;ref name=English2000/&gt;

Almost all objective functions are of such high [[Kolmogorov complexity]] that they cannot arise.&lt;ref name=Streeter/&gt;&lt;ref name=English2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=English2000/&gt; There is more information in the typical objective function or algorithm than [[Seth Lloyd]] estimates the observable universe is capable of registering.&lt;ref name=Lloyd2002&gt;Lloyd, S. (2002) "Computational capacity of the universe," ''Physical Review Letters'' '''88''', pp. 237901–237904. https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110141&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if each candidate solution is encoded as a sequence of 300 0's and 1's, and the goodness values are 0 and 1, then most objective functions have Kolmogorov complexity of at least 2&lt;sup&gt;300&lt;/sup&gt; bits,&lt;ref name=LV&gt;Li, M., and Vitányi, P. (1997) ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications'' (2nd ed.), New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and this is greater than Lloyd's bound of 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 2&lt;sup&gt;299&lt;/sup&gt; bits. It follows that not all of "no free lunch" theory applies to physical reality. In a practical sense, algorithms "small enough" for application in physical reality are superior in performance to those that are not. It has also been shown that NFL results apply to incomputable functions &lt;ref&gt;
"Woodward, John R; ",Computable and incomputable functions and search algorithms,"Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems, 2009. ICIS 2009. IEEE International Conference on",1,,871-875,2009,IEEE&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal synopsis of NFL==

&lt;math&gt;Y^X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[objective function]]s ''f'':''X''→''Y'', where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a finite [[solution space]] and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a finite [[poset]]. The set of all [[permutation]]s of ''X'' is ''J''. A [[random variable]] ''F'' is distributed on &lt;math&gt;Y^X&lt;/math&gt;. For all ''j'' in ''J'', ''F'' o ''j'' is a random variable distributed on &lt;math&gt;Y^X&lt;/math&gt;, with P(''F'' o ''j'' = ''f'') = P(''F'' = ''f'' o ''j''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for all ''f'' in &lt;math&gt;Y^X&lt;/math&gt;.

Let ''a''(''f'') denote the output of search algorithm ''a'' on input ''f''. If ''a''(''F'') and ''b''(''F'') are identically distributed for all search algorithms ''a'' and ''b'', then ''F'' has an ''NFL distribution''. This condition holds if and only if ''F'' and ''F'' o ''j'' are identically distributed for all ''j'' in ''J''.&lt;ref name=Igel/&gt;&lt;ref name=English2004/&gt; In other words, there is no free lunch for search algorithms if and only if the distribution of objective functions is invariant under permutation of the solution space.  

The "only if" part was first published by C. Schumacher in his PhD dissertation "Black Box Search – Framework and Methods" (The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (2000)).
Set-theoretic NFL theorems have recently been generalized to arbitrary cardinality &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Rowe&gt;Rowe, Vose, and Wright, "Reinterpreting No Free Lunch," ''Evolutionary Computation'' 17(1): 117–129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original NFL theorems==

Wolpert and Macready give two principal NFL theorems, the first regarding objective functions that do not change while search is in progress, and the second regarding objective functions that may change.&lt;ref name=WM97/&gt; 

:''Theorem 1'': For any pair of algorithms ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_f P(d_m^y | f, m, a_1) = \sum_f P(d_m^y | f, m, a_2),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d_m^y&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ordered set of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of the cost values &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; associated to input values &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt; is the function being optimized and &lt;math&gt;P(d_m^y | f, m, a)&lt;/math&gt; is the conditional probability of obtaining a given sequence of cost values from algorithm &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; run &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times on function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

In essence, this says that when all functions ''f'' are equally likely, the probability of observing an arbitrary sequence of ''m'' values in the course of search does not depend upon the search algorithm. Theorem 1 establishes a "more subtle" NFL result for time-varying objective functions.

==Interpretations of NFL results==

A conventional, but not entirely accurate, interpretation of the NFL results is that "a general-purpose universal optimization strategy is theoretically impossible, and the only way one strategy can outperform another is if it is specialized to the specific problem under consideration".&lt;ref&gt;Ho, Y.C., Pepyne, D.L. (2002), "Simple Explanation of the No-Free-Lunch Theorem and Its Implications," ''Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications'' '''115''', 549-570.&lt;/ref&gt; Several comments are in order:

:''A general-purpose almost-universal optimizer exists theoretically.'' Each search algorithm performs well on almost all objective functions.&lt;ref name=English2000/&gt;

:''An algorithm may outperform another on a problem when neither is specialized to the problem.'' It may be that both algorithms are among the worst for the problem. Wolpert and Macready have developed a measure of the degree of "match" between an algorithm and a problem.&lt;ref name=WM97/&gt; To say that one algorithm matches a problem better than another is not to say that either is specialized to the problem. &lt;!-- The term should be "alignment," perhaps. Mention inner product? --&gt;

:''In practice, some algorithms reevaluate candidate solutions.'' The superiority of an algorithm that never reevaluates candidates over another that does on a particular problem may have nothing to do with specialization to the problem.

:''For almost all objective functions, specialization is essentially accidental.'' Incompressible, or [[Kolmogorov randomness|Kolmogorov random]], objective functions have no regularity for an algorithm to exploit. Given an incompressible objective function, there is no basis for choosing one algorithm over another. If a chosen algorithm performs better than most, the result is happenstance.&lt;ref name=English2000&gt;English, T. M. 2000. "Optimization Is Easy and Learning Is Hard in the Typical Function," ''Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation: CEC00'', pp. 924–931. http://www.BoundedTheoretics.com/cec2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that a Kolmogorov random function has no representation smaller than a lookup table that contains a (random) value corresponding to each point in the search space; ''any'' function that can be expressed more compactly is, by definition, not Kolmogorov random.

In practice, only highly compressible (far from random) objective functions fit in the storage of computers, and it is not the case that each algorithm performs well on almost all compressible functions. There is generally a performance advantage in incorporating prior knowledge of the problem into the algorithm. While the NFL results constitute, in a strict sense, [[full employment theorem]]s for optimization professionals, it is important not to take the term literally. For one thing, humans often have little prior knowledge to work with. For another, incorporating prior knowledge does not give much of a performance gain on some problems. Finally, human time is very expensive relative to computer time. There are many cases in which a company would choose to optimize a function slowly with an unmodified computer program rather than rapidly with a human-modified program.

The NFL results do not indicate that it is futile to take "pot shots" at problems with unspecialized algorithms. No one has determined the fraction of practical problems for which an algorithm yields good results rapidly. And there is a practical free lunch, not at all in conflict with theory. Running an implementation of an algorithm on a computer costs very little relative to the cost of human time and the benefit of a good solution. If an algorithm succeeds in finding a satisfactory solution in an acceptable amount of time, a small investment has yielded a big payoff. If the algorithm fails, then little is lost.

==Coevolutionary free lunches==

Wolpert and Macready have proved that there are [[free lunch]]es in [[coevolution]]ary optimization.&lt;ref name=WM-coev&gt;Wolpert, D.H., and Macready, W.G. (2005) "Coevolutionary free lunches," ''IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'', 9(6): 721–735&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis "covers 'self-play' problems. In these problems, the set of players work together to produce a champion, who then engages one or more antagonists in a subsequent multiplayer game."&lt;ref name=WM-coev/&gt; That is, the objective is to obtain a good player, but without an objective function. The goodness of each player (candidate solution) is assessed by observing how well it plays against others. An algorithm attempts to use players and their quality of play to obtain better players. The player deemed best of all by the algorithm is the champion. Wolpert and Macready have demonstrated that some coevolutionary algorithms are generally superior to other algorithms in quality of champions obtained. Generating a champion through self-play is of interest in [[evolutionary computation]] and [[game theory]]. The results are inapplicable to coevolution of biological species, which does not yield champions.&lt;ref name=WM-coev/&gt;

The concept of noise-based logic and its name was created by [[Laszlo B. Kish]]. In its foundation paper&lt;ref name =first/&gt;  it is noted that the idea was inspired by the stochasticity of [[brain]] signals and by the unconventional noise-based communication schemes, such as the [[Laszlo_B._Kish|Kish]] cypher.

==The noise-based logic space and hyperspace==
The logic values are represented by [[multi-dimensional]] "[[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s" ([[orthogonal functions]]) and their [[Superposition principle|superposition]], where the [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] are independent noises. By the proper combination (products or [[Intersection (set theory)|set-theoretical products]]) of basis-noises, which are called ''noise-bit'', a logic hyperspace can be constructed with  {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} number of [[dimension]]s, where ''N'' is the number of noise-bits. Thus ''N'' noise-bits in a single wire correspond to a system of {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} classical bits that can express {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} different logic values. Independent realizations of a stochastic process of zero mean have zero [[cross-correlation]] with each other and with other stochastic processes of zero mean. Thus the basis noise vectors are orthogonal not only to each other but they and all the noise-based logic states (superpositions) are orthogonal also to any background noises in the hardware. Therefore, the noise-based logic concept is robust against background noises, which is a property that can potentially offer a high energy-efficiency.

==The types of signals used in noise-based logic==
In the paper,&lt;ref name =first/&gt; where noise-based logic was first introduced, generic stochastic-processes with zero mean were proposed and a system of orthogonal sinusoidal signals were also proposed as a deterministic-signal version of the logic system. The mathematical analysis about statistical errors and signal energy was limited to the cases of [[Gaussian process|Gaussian noises]] and superpositions as logic signals in the basic logic space and their products and superpositions of their products in the logic hyperspace (see also.&lt;ref name =second/&gt; In the subsequent brain logic scheme,&lt;ref name =third/&gt; the logic signals were (similarly to neural signals) unipolar spike sequences generated by a [[Poisson process]], and set-theoretical unifications (superpositions) and intersections (products) of different spike sequences. Later, in the instantaneous noise-based logic schemes&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt;  and computation works,&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; random telegraph waves (periodic time, bipolar, with fixed absolute value of amplitude) were also utilized as one of the simplest stochastic processes available for NBL. With choosing unit amplitude and symmetric probabilities, the resulting random-telegraph wave has 0.5 probability to be in the +1 or in the -1 state which is held over the whole clock period.

==The noise-based logic gates==
Noise-based logic [[Logic gate|gates]] can be classified according to the method the input identifies the logic value at the input. The first gates&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =second/&gt; analyzed the statistical correlations between the input signal and the reference noises. The advantage of these is the robustness against background noise. The disadvantage is the slow speed and higher hardware complexity. The instantaneous logic gates&lt;ref name =third/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; are fast, they have low complexity but they are not robust against background noises. With either neural spike type signals or with [[Bipolar signal|bipolar]] random-telegraph waves of unity absolute amplitude, and randomness only in the sign of the amplitude offer very simple instantaneous logic gates. Then linear or analog devices unnecessary and the scheme can operate in the digital domain. However, whenever instantaneous logic must be interfaced with classical logic schemes, the interface must use [[Correlation function|correlator]]-based logic gates for an error-free signal.&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;

==Universality of noise-based logic==
All the noise-based logic schemes listed above have been proven universal.&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; The papers typically produce the [[Inverter (logic gate)|NOT]] and the [[AND gate|AND]] gates to prove universality, because having both of them is a satisfactory condition for the universality of a [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean logic]].

==Computation by noise-based logic==
The string verification work&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; over a slow communication channel shows a powerful computing application where the methods is inherently based on calculating the [[hash function]]. The scheme is based on random telegraph waves and it is mentioned in the paper&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; that the authors intuitively conclude that the ''[[intelligence]]'' of the brain is using similar operations to make a reasonably good decision based on a limited amount of information. The superposition of the first {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} integer numbers can be produced with only 2''N'' operations, which the authors call "Achilles ankle operation" in the paper.&lt;ref name =second/&gt;

==Computer chip realization of noise-based logic==
Preliminary schemes have already been published&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt; to utilize noise-based logic in practical computers. However, it is obvious from these papers that this young field has yet a long way to go before it will be seen in everyday applications.

The term "'''Old World'''" is used commonly in the West to refer to [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] ([[Afro-Eurasia]] or the World Island), regarded collectively as the part of the [[world]] known to its population before contact with the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] (the "[[New World]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old-world?show=2&amp;t=1417643287 |title=Old World |work=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the context of, and contrasts with, the [[New World]] (the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/new%20world |title=New world |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the context of [[archaeology]] and [[world history]], the term "Old World" includes those parts of the world which were in (indirect) cultural contact from the [[Bronze Age]] onwards, resulting in the parallel development of the early [[civilization]]s, mostly in the [[temperate]] zone between roughly the [[45th parallel north|45th]] and [[25th parallel north|25th]] parallels, in the area of the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iranian plateau|Persian plateau]], [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[History of China#Ancient China|China]].

These regions were connected via the [[Silk Road]] trade route, and they have a pronounced [[Iron Age]] period following the Bronze Age. In cultural terms, the Iron Age was accompanied by the so-called [[Axial Age]], referring to cultural, philosophical and religious developments eventually leading to the emergence of the historical [[Western world|Western]] ([[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]], "[[classics|classical]]"), Near Eastern ([[Zoroastrian]] and [[Abrahamic]]) and Far Eastern ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]]) cultural spheres.

==History==
The concept of the three [[continent]]s in the Old World, viz. [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]], goes back to [[classical antiquity]]. Their boundaries as defined by [[Ptolemy]] and other geographers of antiquity were drawn along the [[Nile]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] rivers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This definition remained influential throughout the Middle Ages (see [[T and O map]]) and the [[Early Modern period]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Other names==
The [[mainland]] of [[Afro-Eurasia]] (excluding [[island]]s such as the [[British Isles]], [[Japan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Malay Archipelago]]) has been referred to as the ''[[World Island]]''.  The term may have been coined by Sir [[Halford John Mackinder]] in ''[[The Geographical Pivot of History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Francis P. Sempa, [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_14/sempa_mac2.html "Mackinder's World."]  ''American Diplomacy'' (UNC.edu).  Retrieved 2018-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent of the Old World had names in some of its ancient cultures, including [[Midgard]] in Germanic cosmology, and [[Oikoumene]] among the Greeks.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2014}}

'''''One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw''''' is a book published in 2000 by Canadian [[architecture|architect]], professor and writer [[Witold Rybczynski]].

The idea for the book came in 1999 when an editor at ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' asked Rybczynski to write a short essay on the best and most useful common tool of the previous 1000 years. Rybczynski took the assignment, but as he researched the history of the items in his workshop – hammers and saws, [[spirit level|levels]] and [[plane (tool)|planes]] – he found that most dated well back into antiquity. At the point of giving up, he asked his wife for ideas. She answered: "You always need a screwdriver for something."

Rybczynski discovered that the screwdriver is a relatively new addition to the toolbox, an [[invention]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]] in Europe and the only major mechanical device not independently invented by the Chinese. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was there at the start, designing a number of screw-cutting machines with interchangeable gears. Nevertheless, it took generations for the screw (and with it, the screwdriver and [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]) to come into general use, and it was not until modern times that improvements such as slotted screws came into being. Rybczynski spends some time discussing the Canadian invention, the [[Robertson screwdriver]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Penguin Composition Rules''' were the guidelines written by typographer [[Jan Tschichold]] for use in composing the pages and typography of [[Penguin Books]]. The rules were embodied in a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. The booklet includes headings for various aspects of composition: Text Composition; Indenting of Paragraphs; Punctuation Marks and Spelling; Capitals, Small Capitals, and Italics; References and Footnotes; Folios; The Printing of Plays; The Printing of Poetry; Make-up.

Beyond this specific set of guidelines, Tschichold made further changes to Penguin's graphic standards. Penguin is well known for its standardized book covers and formats, as well as the diversity of the standards.&lt;ref&gt;The seeming contradiction between standardization and diversity is explained by the vast numbers of books produced by Penguin over many years.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jan Tschichold and Penguin==
Penguin Books was founded by Allen Lane in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152710/http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic look of Penguin was established before Lane brought Tschichold to Penguin in the late 1940s as head of typography and production. Tschichold was in England at Penguin between 1947 and 1949 before returning to Switzerland.

Tschichold's standardization of Penguin covers essentially took existing elements and refined them visually and refined their arrangement. Under Tschichold the covers included the use of [[Eric Gill|Eric Gill's]] [[Gill Sans]] typeface, which he was careful to have spaced evenly. According to Tschichold establishing this quality was not immediately embraced by the compositors; “Every day I had to wade through miles of corrections (often ten books daily). I had a rubber stamp made: ‘Equalize letter-spaces according to their visual value.’ It was totally ignored; the hand compositors continued to space out the capitals on title-pages (where optical spacing is essential) with spaces of equal thickness.”&lt;ref name="doubleday"&gt;Richard Doubleday, "[http://www.dis.uia.mx/conference/2005/HTMs-PDFs/PenguinBooks.pdf Jan Tschichold at Penguin Books: A Resurgance [sic&amp;#93; of Classical Book Design]" (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Gill Sans, Tschichold made use of Monotype [[Bembo]], Monotype [[Centaur (typeface)|Centaur]] (by [[Bruce Rogers (typographer)|Bruce Rogers]]) and Gill's [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typeface.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

The covers conformed to the golden ratio (4⅜" × 7⅛", 111mm × 181mm). For Penguin's distinctive orange color, Tschichold replaced it with a warmer tone.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

The '''solar luminosity''', {{Solar luminosity}}, is a unit of [[radiant flux]] ([[Power (physics)|power]] emitted in the form of [[photon]]s) conventionally used by [[astronomer]]s to measure the [[luminosity]] of [[star]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and other celestial objects in terms of the output of the [[Sun]].

== Determination ==
Solar luminosity is related to [[Irradiance|solar irradiance]] (the [[solar constant]]). Solar irradiance is responsible for the [[orbital forcing]] that causes the [[Milankovitch cycles]], which determine Earthly glacial cycles. The mean irradiance at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is sometimes known as the [[solar constant]], ''I''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;. Irradiance is defined as power per unit area, so the solar luminosity (total power emitted by the Sun) is the irradiance received at the Earth (solar constant) multiplied by the area of the sphere whose radius is the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\odot = 4\pi kI_\odot A^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is the [[Astronomical unit|unit distance]] (the value of the [[astronomical unit]] in [[metre]]s) and ''k'' is a constant (whose value is very close to one) that reflects the fact that the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun is not exactly one [[astronomical unit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2447">'''Symphorophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] in which [[sexual arousal]] involves staging and watching a [[tragedy]], such as a [[fire]] or a [[traffic accident]].

The term was coined by [[John Money]] in his 1984 paper ''Paraphilias: Phenomenology and classification'', formed from the Greek root "συμφορά" ("symphora", ''event, misfortune''):&lt;ref name = Money1984&gt;{{cite journal | last = Money | first = J | year = 1984 | title = Paraphilias: Phenomenology and classification  | authorlink = John Money | pmid = 6234812 | journal = [[American Journal of Psychotherapy]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A special form of sacrificial paraphilia, for which a suitable name is symphorophilia (being erotically turned on by accidents or catastrophes), culminates in an arranged disaster, such as an automobile crash. Like a game of Russian roulette, it may end in death &amp;mdash; alone or with the partner. However, flirting with disaster, rather than suicide and murder is the trigger responsible for autoerotic arousal and excitement. Being the daredevil who will live to risk a love-death again is an essential part of this paraphilia.

As a photographic print is the positive made from its negative, so also the positive of self-crashing is arranging for a disaster to occur on the highway, and then watching the carnage from a preselected observation post. Disasters other than on the highway may be arranged &amp;mdash; catastrophic fires, for example. For those members of the general public who have a touch of sadomasochism in them, disaster as an unrehearsed event is often a large part of the appeal of entertainment stunts and sports, from the circus to stock-car racing.}}

Although it does not use the term, a 1960 study in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' describes a man aroused by being injured by "an automobile operated by a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Keeler, M. H. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14405114 "An unusual perversion: the desire to be injured by an automobile operated by a woman."] ''Am J Psychiatry''. 1960 May;116:1032.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The main characters in the 1973 novel ''[[Crash (1973 novel)|Crash]]'' by [[J. G. Ballard]] and in the subsequent 1996 [[Crash (1996 film)|film adaptation]] are car-crash fetishists.

The '''tree of life''' is a widespread myth ([[mytheme]]) or [[archetype]] in the world's [[mythology|mythologies]], related to the concept of ''[[sacred tree]]'' more generally,&lt;ref name="GIOVINO-29"&gt;Giovino, Mariana (2007). ''The Assyrian Sacred Tree: A History of Interpretations'', page 129. Saint-Paul. {{ISBN|9783727816024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence in [[religion|religious]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] tradition.

The [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge]], connecting to [[heaven]] and the [[underworld]], and the tree of life, connecting all forms of creation, are both forms of the [[world tree]] or cosmic tree,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648638/world-tree World tree] in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and are portrayed in various religions and philosophies as the same tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EW2Qdu0awZgC&amp;pg=PA5#v=snippet&amp;q=%22tree%20of%20life%22%20same&amp;f=false |author=Tryggve N.

==Religion and mythology==
{{Main article|Trees in mythology}}
Various trees of life are recounted in [[folklore]], [[culture]] and [[fiction]], often relating to [[immortality]] or [[fertility]]. They had their origin in religious symbolism.

===Ancient Iran===
[[File:Detail of a rhyton from Marlik, Iran, 1000 BC.jpg|thumb|Tree of life on a rhyton from [[Marlik]], Iran, currently at the [[National Museum of Iran]].]]

In the [[Avestan]] literature and [[Iranian mythology]], there are several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, like: [[Amesha Spenta]] [[Amordad]] (guardian of plants, goddess of trees and immortality), [[Gaokerena]] (or white [[Haoma]], a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe), Bas tokhmak (a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow), [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]] (parents of the human race in Iranian myths), [[Barsom]] (copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz or [[Haoma]] that Zoroastrians use in their rituals), [[Haoma]] (a plant, unknown today, that was source of sacred potable), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_36319.html |title = Plant of life, in Ancient Iran, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt |date = 2013|publisher = Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2, p. 15. |last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaokerena]] is a large, sacred [[Haoma]] planted by [[Ahura Mazda]]. [[Ahriman]] (Ahreman, Angremainyu) created a frog to invade the tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, [[Ahura Mazda]] created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react to it. Because [[Ahriman]] is responsible for all evil including death, while [[Ahura Mazda]] is responsible for all good (including life).

[[haoma]] is another sacred plant due to the drink made from it. The preparation of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities—health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds.

Haoma is the Avestan form of the Sanskrit ''soma''. The near identity of the two in ritual significance is considered by scholars to point to a salient feature of an Indo-Iranian religion antedating Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254670/haoma |title=haoma (Zoroastrianism) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haoma-i |title=HAOMA i. BOTANY – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related issue in ancient mythology of [[Iran]] is the myth of [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]], two trees who were the ancestors of all living beings. This myth can be considered as a prototype for the [[creation myth]] where living beings are created by Gods (who have a human form).

===Ancient Mesopotamia and Urartu===
[[File:Rilievi in alabastro da palazzo di ashurnasirpal II a nimrud, albero sacro, 883-859 ac ca. 01.JPG|thumb|upright|Assyrian tree of life, from [[Nimrud]] panels.]]
The [[Assyria]]n tree of life was represented by a series of nodes and criss-crossing lines. It was apparently an important religious symbol, often attended to in [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] by human or eagle-headed [[winged genie]]s, or the King, and blessed or fertilized with [[bucket and cone]]. [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]] have not reached consensus as to the meaning of this symbol. The name "Tree of Life" has been attributed to it by modern scholarship; it is not used in the Assyrian sources. In fact, no textual evidence pertaining to the symbol is known to exist.
[[File:Urartu Helmet Fragment 2~.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Urartu|Urartian]] tree of life]]

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' is a similar quest for immortality. In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], Etana searches for a 'plant of birth' to provide him with a son. This has a solid provenance of antiquity, being found in [[cylinder seal]]s from [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] (2390–2249 [[Common Era|BCE]]).

In ancient [[Urartu]], the tree of life was a religious symbol and was drawn on walls of fortresses and carved on the armor of warriors. The branches of the tree were equally divided on the right and left sides of the stem, with each branch having one leaf, and one leaf on the apex of the tree. Servants stood on each side of the tree with one of their hands up as if they are taking care of the tree.

===Baha'i Faith===
{{see also|Sidrat al-Muntaha}}
The concept of the tree of life appears in the writings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], where it can refer to the [[Manifestation of God]], a great teacher who appears to humanity from age to age.  An example of this can be found in the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = Adib |authorlink = Adib Taherzadeh |year = 1976 |title = The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher = George Ronald |place = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-270-8 |url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V1/Cover.html |pages = 80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazemi, Farshid (2009). ''[http://bahai-library.com/kazemi_mysteries_alast Mysteries of Alast: The Realm of Subtle Entities and the Primordial Covenant in the Babi-Bahá'í Writings]''. Bahá'í Studies Review 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|"Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn, when in those hallowed and blessed surroundings ye were all gathered in My presence beneath the shade of the tree of life, which is planted in the all-glorious paradise? Awestruck ye listened as I gave utterance to these three most holy words: O friends! Prefer not your will to Mine, never desire that which I have not desired for you, and approach Me not with lifeless hearts, defiled with worldly desires and cravings. Would ye but sanctify your souls, ye would at this present hour recall that place and those surroundings, and the truth of My utterance should be made evident unto all of you."}}

Also, in the ''[[Tablet of Ahmad (Arabic)|Tablet of Ahmad]]'' of Bahá'u'lláh: "Verily He is the Tree of Life, that bringeth forth the fruits of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tablet of Ahmad |url=http://www.bahaiprayers.org/ahmad.htm |website=www.bahaiprayers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh refers to his male descendants as branches ({{lang-ar|ﺍﻏﺼﺎﻥ}} [[Aghsán|''ʾaghṣān'']]) &lt;ref name="Smith-aghsan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Aghsán |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calls women leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Liya, Sally (2004). [http://bahai-library.com/liya_trees_symbols_religions The Use of Trees as Symbols in the World Religions] in: Solas, 4. Donegal, Ireland. Association for Baha'i Studies English-Speaking Europe. P. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction has been made between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The latter represents the physical world with its opposites, such as good and evil and light and dark. In a different context from the one above, the tree of life represents the spiritual realm, where this duality does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
The ''Bo'' tree, also called ''[[Bodhi]]'' tree,  according to Buddhist tradition, is the pipal ([[Ficus religiosa]]) under which the Buddha sat when he attained Enlightenment (Bodhi) at Bodh Gaya (near Gaya, west-central Bihar state, India). A living pipal at Anuradhapura, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), is said to have grown from a cutting from the Bo tree sent to that city by King Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70648/Bo-tree |title=Bo tree (tree) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tibetan tradition when Buddha went to the holy Lake Manasorovar along with 500 monks, he took with him the energy of Prayaga Raj. Upon his arrival, he installed the energy of Prayaga Raj near Lake Manasorovar, at a place now known as Prayang. Then he planted the seed of this eternal banyan tree next to Mt. Kailash on a mountain known as the "Palace of Medicine Buddha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kmt.himalayaninstitute.org/pointsarchive.asp?dt=1/12/2001 |title=The Kumbha Mela Times |publisher=Kmt.himalayaninstitute.org |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207041420/http://kmt.himalayaninstitute.org/pointsarchive.asp?dt=1%2F12%2F2001 |archivedate=December 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:Ⅰ号大型青铜神树.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze Tree with birds, flowers, and ornaments from [[Sanxingdui]]]]
{{see also|Fusang}}
In [[Chinese mythology]], a carving of a tree of life depicts a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] and a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]; the dragon often represents immortality.  A [[Taoism|Taoist]] story tells of a tree that produces a [[peaches of immortality|peach of immortality]] every three thousand years, and anyone who eats the fruit receives immortality.

An [[archaeological]] discovery in the 1990s was of a sacrificial pit at [[Sanxingdui]] in [[Sichuan]], [[China]]. Dating from about 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]], it contained three [[bronze]] trees, one of them 4 meters high.  At the base was a dragon, and fruit hanging from the lower branches.  At the top is a bird-like (Phoenix) creature with claws.  Also found in Sichuan, from the late [[Han dynasty]] (c 25 – 220 CE), is another tree of life. The [[ceramic]] base is guarded by a horned beast with wings.  The leaves of the tree represent coins and people.  At the apex is a bird with coins and the [[Sun]].

===Christianity===
{{See also|Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of the knowledge of good and evil#Christianity}}
The tree of life first appears in Genesis 2:9 and 3:22-24 as the source of [[Immortality|eternal life]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], from which access is revoked when man is driven from the garden. It then reappears in the last book of the Bible, the [[Book of Revelation]], and most predominantly in the last chapter of that book (Chapter 22) as a part of the new garden of paradise. Access is then no longer forbidden, for those who "wash their robes" (or as the textual variant in the King James Version has it, "they that do his commandments") "have right to the tree of life" (v.14). A similar statement appears in Rev 2:7, where the tree of life is promised as a reward to those who overcome. Revelation 22 begins with a reference to the "pure river of water of life" which proceeds "out of the throne of God". The river seems to feed two trees of life, one "on either side of the river" which "bear twelve manner of fruits" "and the leaves of the tree were for healing of the nations" (v.1-2).&lt;ref&gt;The Bible (King James version), The Revelation of St. John, chapter &amp; verses as noted.&lt;/ref&gt; Or this may indicate that the tree of life is a vine that grows on both sides of the river, as John 15:1 would hint at.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] has said that "the Cross is the true tree of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Pope-tells-WYD-youth:-the-Cross-of-Jesus-is-the-real-tree-of-life-5864.html |title=Pope tells WYD youth: the Cross of Jesus is the real tree of life |publisher= AsiaNews.it |date= March 20, 2005 |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonaventure|Saint Bonaventure]] taught that the medicinal fruit of the tree of life is Christ himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/speculum/1v-tree-of-life.html |title=The Tree of Life |publisher= [[Yale University]] |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albertus Magnus|Saint Albert the Great]] taught that the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], the Body and Blood of Christ, is the Fruit of the Tree of Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossroadsinitiative.com/library_article/994/Fruit_of_the_Tree_of_Life_Albert_the_Great.html |title=The Eucharist as the Fruit of the Tree of Life &amp;#124; Saint Albert the Great |publisher=CrossroadsInitiative.com  |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Augustine|Augustine of Hippo]] said that the tree of life is Christ:
{{quote|All these things stood for something other than what they were, but all the same they were themselves bodily realities. And when the narrator mentioned them he was not employing figurative language, but giving an explicit account of things which had a forward reference that was figurative. So then the tree of life also was Christ... and indeed God did not wish the man to live in Paradise without the mysteries of spiritual things being presented to him in bodily form. So then in the other trees he was provided with nourishment, in this one with a sacrament... He is rightly called whatever came before him in order to signify him.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, The Literal Meaning of Genesis, VIII, 4, 8 (On Genesis, New City Press, p. 351-353)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Eastern Christianity the tree of life is the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Isaac the Syrian says that "Paradise is the love of God, in which the bliss of all the beatitudes is contained," and that "the tree of life is the love of God" (Homily 72).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{main article|Tree of life vision}}
The tree of life vision is a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] described and discussed in the [[Book of Mormon]]. According to the Book of Mormon, the vision was received in a [[dream]] by the prophet [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], and later in vision by his son [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], who wrote about it in the [[First Book of Nephi]]. The vision includes a path leading to a tree symbolizing [[salvation]], with an iron rod along the path whereby followers of [[Jesus]] may hold to the rod and avoid wandering off the path into pits or waters symbolizing the ways of sin. The vision also includes a large building wherein the wicked look down at the righteous and mock them.

The vision is said to symbolize the spiritual plight of humanity and is a well known and cited story within [[Mormonism]]. A Mormon commentator reflected a common Mormon belief that the vision is "one of the richest, most flexible, and far-reaching pieces of symbolic prophecy contained in the standard works [scriptures]."&lt;ref&gt;Corbin T. Volluz, "Lehi's Dream of the Tree of Life: Springboard to Prophecy," JBMS 2/2 (1993): 38. - as quoted in  Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life: Understanding the Dream as Visionary Literature, Charles Swift, Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute, 2005. P. 52–63 - online version at [https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/JBMRS/article/viewFile/19705/18272]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[File:Husaby Church 2013 11th century Tree of Life sculpture.jpg|thumb|upright|11th century tree of life sculpture at an ancient [[Sweden|Swedish]] church]]
In ''Dictionnaire Mytho-Hermetique'' (Paris, 1737), [[Antoine-Joseph Pernety]], a famous [[alchemy|alchemist]], identified the tree of life with the [[Elixir of life]] and the [[Philosopher's Stone]].

In ''[[Stephen Oppenheimer#Eden in the East|Eden in the East]]'' (1998), [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] suggests that a tree-worshipping culture arose in [[Indonesia]] and was diffused by the so-called "Younger Dryas" event of c. 10,900 BCE or 12,900 BP, after which the sea level rose. This culture reached China (Szechuan), then [[India]] and the [[Middle East]]. Finally the Finno-Ugric strand of this diffusion spread through [[Russia]] to [[Finland]] where the Norse myth of [[Yggdrasil]] took root.

===Georgia===
The [[Borjgali]] ({{lang-ka|ბორჯღალი}}) is an ancient [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] tree of life symbol.

===Germanic paganism and Norse mythology===
In [[Germanic paganism]], trees played (and, in the form of reconstructive Heathenry and [[Germanic Neopaganism]], continue to play) a prominent role, appearing in various aspects of surviving texts and possibly in the name of gods.

The tree of life appears in [[Norse mythology|Norse religion]] as ''[[Yggdrasil]]'', the world tree, a massive tree (sometimes considered a [[European yew|yew]] or [[ash tree]]) with extensive lore surrounding it.  Perhaps related to Yggdrasil, accounts have survived of [[Germanic people|Germanic Tribes]]' honouring sacred trees within their societies.  Examples include [[Thor's Oak]], [[sacred grove]]s, the [[Sacred tree at Uppsala]], and the wooden [[Irminsul]] pillar. In [[Norse Mythology]], the apples from [[Iðunn]]'s ash box provide immortality for the gods.

{{main article|Tree of life (Quran)|l1=Quranic tree of life}}
{{see also|Sidrat al-Muntaha}}
The "Tree of Immortality" (Arabic: شجرة الخلود) is the tree of life motif as it appears in the [[Quran]]. It is also alluded to in hadiths and tafsir. Unlike the [[Tree of life (biblical)|biblical account]], the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, also called the tree of immortality, which Allah specifically forbade to Adam and Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheeler |first=Brannon |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo9jAavEHdIC&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tree+in+the+shade%22&amp;f=false |title=Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis |edition=annotated |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0826449566 |page=24 |quote=''Abu Hurayrah'': The Prophet Muhammad said: "In Paradise is a tree in the shade of which the stars course 100 years without cutting it: the Tree of Immortality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Oliver Leaman |year=2006 |editor-link=Oliver Leaman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=%22special%20tree%20in%20Eden%22&amp;f=false |title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415326391 |page=11 |quote=Unlike the biblical account of Eden, the Qur'an mentions only one special tree in Eden, the Tree of Immortality, from which Adam and Eve were prohibited.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satan repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, thus disobeying Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Three Translations of the Koran (Al-Qur'an) Side by Side {{cite quran|20|120|s=ns}}, "Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away? S: But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to him; he said: O Adam! Shall I guide you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which decays not? "&lt;/ref&gt; The hadiths also speak about other trees in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Muhammad Ali (2011) ''Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur'an'' "This in itself gives an indication that it is the well-known tree of evil, for both good and evil are compared to two trees in {{cite quran|14|24|e=25|s=ns|b=n}} and elsewhere. This is further corroborated by the devil's description of it as “the tree of immortality” ({{cite quran|20|120|s=ns|b=n}}), ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the Indian [[Ahmadiyya]] movement founded in 1889, Quranic reference to the tree is symbolic; eating of the forbidden tree signifies that Adam disobeyed God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/original_sin.html | title=Quran, Adam and Original Sin | publisher=Al Islam | author=Bilal Khalid | accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=87&amp;region=E1&amp;CR=EN,E2 | title=The Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary Volume 1 | page=86 | publisher=Islam International Publications | accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish sources===
{{main article|Etz Chaim|Tree of life (biblical)|l2=Biblical tree of life}}
''[[Etz Chaim]]'', Hebrew for "tree of life," is a common term used in Judaism. The expression, found in the [[Book of Proverbs]], is figuratively applied to the [[Torah]] itself.  ''Etz Chaim'' is also a common name for [[yeshiva]]s and [[synagogue]]s as well as for works of [[Rabbinic literature]]. It is also used to describe each of the wooden poles to which the parchment of a [[Sefer Torah]] is attached.

The tree of life is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]]; it is distinct from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. After [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] disobeyed God by eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were driven out of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Remaining in the garden, however, was the tree of life. To prevent their access to this tree in the future, [[cherubs|Cherubim]] with a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22-24|9}})

In the Book of Proverbs, the tree of life is associated with [[wisdom]]: "[Wisdom] is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy ''[is every one]'' that retaineth her." ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|3:13-18|9}}) In {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|15:4|HE}} the tree of life is associated with calmness: "A soothing tongue is a tree of life; but perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;For other direct references to the tree of life in the Jewish biblical canon, see also {{bibleverse||Proverbs|11:30|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|13:12|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Enoch]], generally considered [[biblical canon|non-canonical]], states that in the time of the great judgment God will give all those whose names are in the [[Book of Life]] fruit to eat from the tree of life.&lt;!-- where in Enoch? --&gt;

====Kabbalah====
{{Main article|Tree of life (Kabbalah)}}
[[File:Sefiroticky strom.jpg|thumb|upright|Judaic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Kabbalah tree of life]] 10 ''[[Sefirot]]'', through which the ''[[Ein Sof]]'' unknowable divine manifests Creation. The configuration relates to [[Adam Kadmon|man]]]]
Jewish [[mysticism]] depicts the tree of life in the form of ten interconnected nodes, as the central symbol of the [[Kabbalah]]. It comprises the ten ''[[Sefirot]]'' powers in the divine realm. The [[panentheistic]] and [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|anthropomorphic]] emphasis of this [[Emanationism|emanationist]] theology interpreted the Torah, Jewish observance, and the purpose of Creation as the symbolic esoteric drama of unification in the ''Sefirot'', restoring harmony to Creation. From the time of the [[Renaissance]] onwards, Jewish Kabbalah became incorporated as an important tradition in non-Jewish Western culture, first through its adoption by [[Christian Kabbalah]], and continuing in [[Western esotericism]] occult [[Hermetic Qabalah]]. These adapted the Judaic Kabbalah tree of life [[Syncretism|syncretically]] by associating it with other religious traditions, esoteric theologies, and magical practices.

===Mesoamerica===
{{Main article|Mesoamerican world tree}}
The concept of world trees is a prevalent motif in [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Religious cosmology|cosmologies]] and [[iconography]]. World trees embodied the four [[cardinal directions]], which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic ''[[axis mundi]]'' connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.&lt;ref name="MiTa186"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Mary |authorlink=Mary Miller (art historian) |author2=[[Karl Taube]] |year=1993 |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=978-0-500-05068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and mythological traditions of cultures such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Izapa]]n, [[Mixtec]], [[Olmec]], and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a ''[[ceiba]]'' tree, and is known variously as a ''wacah chan'' or ''yax imix che'', depending on the [[Mayan language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finley |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=Raising the sky: The Maya creation myth and the Milky Way|work=The Real Maya Prophecies: Astronomy in the Inscriptions and Codices |url=http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/creation.html |publisher=Maya Astronomy |accessdate=9 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106021734/http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/creation.html |archivedate=6 January 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright [[caiman]], whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.&lt;ref name="MiTa186"/&gt;

Directional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in [[Mesoamerican calendars]], and the directional colors and deities. [[Mesoamerican codices]] which have this association outlined include the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Codex Borgia|Borgia]] and [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer]] [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref name="MiTa186"/&gt; It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.

World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a "water-monster," symbolic of the underworld). The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freidel, David A. |author2=[[Linda Schele]] |author3=Joy Parker |year=1993 |title=Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path |publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-688-10081-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In a myth passed down among the [[Iroquois]], ''The World on the Turtle's Back'', explains the origin of the land in which a tree of life is described. According to the myth, it is found in the heavens, where the first humans lived, until a pregnant woman fell and landed in an endless sea. Saved by a giant turtle from drowning, she formed the world on its back by planting bark taken from the tree.

The tree of life motif is present in the traditional [[Ojibway]] cosmology and traditions. It is sometimes described as Grandmother Cedar, or ''Nookomis Giizhig'' in [[Anishinaabemowin]].

In the book [[Black Elk Speaks]], [[Black Elk]], an Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Sioux) ''wičháša wakȟáŋ'' ([[medicine man]] and holy man), describes his vision in which after dancing around a dying tree that has never bloomed he is transported to the other world (spirit world) where he meets wise elders, 12 men and 12 women.  The elders tell Black Elk that they will bring him to meet "Our Father, the two-legged chief" and bring him to the [[Axis mundi|center of a hoop]] where he sees the tree in full leaf and bloom and the "chief" standing against the tree. Coming out of his trance he hopes to see that the earthly tree has bloomed, but it is dead.&lt;ref name="First People"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/Black-Elk-Speaks/Black-Elk-Speaks-Visions-of-the-Other-World.html | title=Black Elk Speaks | publisher=First People of America and Canada - Turtle Island. | work=Visions of the Other World | accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serer religion ===
In [[Serer religion]], the tree of life as a religious concept forms the basis of [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]]. Trees were the first things created on Earth by the supreme being [[Roog]] (or [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]). In the competing versions of the [[Serer people|Serer]] creation myth, the ''Somb'' (''[[Prosopis africana]]'') and the ''Saas'' tree ([[Faidherbia albida|acacia albida]]) are both viewed as trees of life.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt; However, the prevailing view is that, the ''Somb'' was the first tree on Earth and the progenitor of [[plant species|plant life]].&lt;ref name="Serer"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La Civilisation [[Serer people|Sereer]] - ''Pangool''", vol. 2., Les Nouvelles Editions [[Africa]]ines du [[Senegal]] (1990), pp 125–6, 199–200, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} &amp; {{en icon}} Niangoran-Bouah, Georges, "L'univers Akan des poids à peser l'or : les poids dans la société", Les nouvelles éditions africaines - MLB, (1987), p 25, {{ISBN|2723614034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Somb'' was also used in the [[Serer ancient history|Serer tumuli and burial chambers]], many of which had survived for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt; Thus, ''Somb'' is not only the tree of life in Serer society, but the symbol of immortality.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt;

===Turkic===

The World Tree or tree of life is a central symbol in [[Turkic mythology]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It is a common [[kilim motifs|motif in carpets]]. In 2009 it was introduced as the main design of the common [[Turkish lira]] sub-unit 5 [[kuruş]].

===Hinduism===

In the sacred books of Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma), Puranas mention divine tree Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). This divine tree is guarded by Gandharvas in the garden of Amaravati, city under the control of Indra, King of gods. Popular story goes like this, for a very long time, gods and demi-gods who are believed to be fathered by Kashyapa Prajapati and have different mothers. After a long time frequent battles between the two half-brother clans, both groups decided to churn the milky ocean to obtain Amrutam (అమృతం, अमृत ) and share equally. During the churning, along with many other mythical items emerged the Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). It is gold in colour. It has mesmerizing aura. It can be pleased with chanting and offers. When it is pleased, it grants every wish. 

==Popular culture==
Austrian [[symbolist]] artist [[Gustav Klimt]] portrayed his version of the tree of life in his painting, ''[[The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze]]''.  This iconic painting later inspired the external facade of the "New Residence Hall" (also called the "Tree House"), a colorful 21-story student residence hall at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Masco&gt;{{cite web|title=MassArt Residence Story: This is the house that collaboration built|url=http://www.masco.org/news/sp-house-collaboration-built|work=MASCO: Medical Academic and Scientific Community Organization|publisher=MASCO, Inc.|accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Herbert]]'s poem ''[[s:The Sacrifice|The Sacrifice]]'' (part of ''[[George Herbert#Works|The Temple]]'', 1633), the tree of life is the [[rood]] on which Jesus Christ was crucified. In [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', the tree of life plays a role, especially in the sixth published book (the first in the in-world chronology) ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]''.

[[Alex Proyas]]' 2009 film ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' ends with the two young protagonists directed towards the tree of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.tvguide.com/knowing/review/296881 | title=''Knowing'': Review | first=Cammila | last=Albertson | newspaper=[[TV Guide]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | year=2009| accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Supernatural (season 13)|season 13]] of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', fruit from the tree of life is an important ingredient in a spell to open a portal to an alternate reality. The angel [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]] is able to find the tree in [[Syria]] and returns from a mission with the fruit in ''[[Scoobynatural]]''. The fruit is used in subsequent episodes as part of the spell to open the portal between the worlds.

The '''USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies''' ('''WIES''') is an environmental research and education facility run by the [[University of Southern California]].  It is an organized research unit that encompasses a wide range of faculty and topics across the university as well as operating a marine laboratory at the edge of [[Two Harbors, California]] on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] approximately 22 miles (35 km) south-southwest of [[Los Angeles]].  

The USC Wrigley Institute has specialized programs in environmental microbiology, geobiology, ocean biogeochemistry, living marine resources (including fisheries and aquaculture), climate change, coastal environmental quality and the urban ocean.  The Institute is also home to the USC Sea Grant Program, part of the [[National Sea Grant Program]] through the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

The mission of the Wrigley Institute is to encourage responsible and creative decisions in society by providing an objective source of [[environmental science]], and to foster an understanding of the natural world among people of all ages.  The faculty conduct academic research that is both good basic science and directly relevant to the needs of society.  The Institute operates a "K-gray" educational program with extensive outreach into the major student populations of greater Los Angeles.  It also creates real linkages between the academic scholarship and decision-making in society.

The Catalina Island facility centers around the Philip K. Wrigley Marine Science Center (WMSC).  This {{convert|14|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus on Catalina Island includes, a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} laboratory building, a dormitory and cottage-style housing, a cafeteria, a [[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy|hyperbaric chamber]], and a large waterfront staging area complete with dock, pier, helipad, moorings, boats and diving lockers.  The Institute lies adjacent to Big Fisherman's Cove, a no-take protected refuge.&lt;ref name="Protect our Oceans"&gt;[http://dornsife.usc.edu/enst-320a/water-and-soil/?p=342 Protect Our Oceans], Description of Big Fisherman's Cove MPA status.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to facilities for researchers and graduate students, the campus is home of USC's Catalina Semester, a 15-week intensive program in marine and environmental studies, as well as educational programs for pre-college students, families, executives and senior citizens.  It is one of a handful of marine laboratories in the United States that is specifically open to students and faculty from other institutions.

USC opened its first facility on the island in 1965 after a grant of more than {{convert|14|acre|m2}} of land to USC by the [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company|Wrigley]] family.  The Science Center is named after [[Philip K. Wrigley]], the son of the founder of the famous gum company.  The Wrigley Institute was founded in 1995 after a donation by [[William Wrigley III|William and Julie Wrigley]].

In the summer 2007, USC began work on installing six pre-built 48-ton, {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|-1|sing=on}} Tuscan-style houses to the island to house prominent scientists and corporate executives so they would not be placed in the standard dormitories.&lt;ref name=LAT080307&gt;Louis Sahagun, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-catalina3aug03,1,5242952.story Homes readied to set sail], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The homes would add over 20 rooms, and transportation to the remote campus involved both barges to transport them across the {{convert|22|mi|km|0|sing=on}} ocean channel and heavy cranes to pull the houses up the hill to their final location.&lt;ref name=LAT080307&gt;Louis Sahagun, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-catalina3aug03,1,5242952.story Homes readied to set sail], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  

USC provides regular semi-weekly boat transportation to the facility from the [[Southern California Marine Institute]] on [[Terminal Island]].&lt;ref name="Transportation Information"&gt;[http://dornsife.usc.edu/wrigley/transportation/ Transportation Information], WMSC Site.&lt;/ref&gt;
