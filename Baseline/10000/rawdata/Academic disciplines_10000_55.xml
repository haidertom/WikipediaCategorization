'''''A History of English Medieval Architecture''''' is a book published in three volumes in 1912, re-published in two volumes in 1921 and one volume in 1931, by architect and artist [[Cyril Edward Power]]. It features 424 of his drawings and illustrations and was published by Talbot Press.

On July 5, 1912, ''Building News'' stated: "While the ordinary reader will scan the book with pleasurable interest, the architectural student of Mediaeval architecture who believes - some still believe it, we suppose even in these days - that structural integrity was the raison d'être of Gothic art, will follow Mr Power's intelligent exposition with profit, and find stimulation to further study."

Power states that the purpose of the book is to "make the various stages of early life in these islands intelligible."

These books were the outcome of a series of lectures Power gave in 1907 at [[Goldsmiths College]] New Cross. The books were renowned for their intricate detail and exhaustive research. Shortly after their publication, Powers began lecturing in architecture at [[The Grosvenor School of Modern Art]].

The '''American University of Malta''' ('''AUM''') is a [[private university|private]], American-style [[liberal arts college]] in [[Cospicua]], [[Malta]]. The establishment of the educational institution was announced in May 2015, and the project is meant to regenerate the South of Malta and give said area an economic and social boost.&lt;ref name=opm-presentation/&gt; Since the proposal was announced, Dock 1 in Cospicua was chosen for the head campus, while extensions are being planned for other sites in Cospicua and Żonqor, [[Marsaskala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muscat|first1=Caroline|title=Mounting opposition to use of ODZ land|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150514/local/mounting-opposition-to-use-of-odz-land.568095|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=14 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220233523/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150514/local/mounting-opposition-to-use-of-odz-land.568095|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially established on 16 September 2016,&lt;ref name="ourbeginnings"/&gt; and it opened in September 2017.&lt;ref name="maltachamber"/&gt;

==Planning and Opening==
On 5 May 2015, the [[Jordan]]ian contracting company Sadeen Group and the [[Government of Malta]] signed an agreement at [[Auberge de Castille]] for the former to set up a private educational institution called the American University of Malta (AUM). The university was planned to be set up in [[Spain]], but Prime Minister of Malta [[Joseph Muscat]] persuaded the chairman of Sadeen, Hani Salah, to set it up in Malta. The university is to accommodate 4000 students, primarily from the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150503/local/heads-of-agreement-for-4000-student-american-university-expected-on.566504|title=Heads of agreement for 4,000-student American university expected on Tuesday - timesofmalta.com|date=2015-09-12|access-date=2018-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912200657/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150503/local/heads-of-agreement-for-4000-student-american-university-expected-on.566504|archivedate=2015-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time all campuses are complete, it is to have schools of business, architecture and design, engineering, arts, sciences, and information technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|title=AUM - American University of Malta|date=2018-01-06|access-date=2018-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106002945/http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|archivedate=2018-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original curricula of the AUM are provided by the [[DePaul University]]. The latter did not commit any financial resources for the construction of the AUM, and it was not involved in any discussions with the Government of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DePaul University denies involvement in site selection for proposed American University of Malta|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150508/local/depaul-university-denies-involvement-in-site-selection-for-proposed.567368|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=8 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913161255/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150508/local/depaul-university-denies-involvement-in-site-selection-for-proposed.567368|archivedate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mathews|first1=Kristin Claes|title=Faculty create curricula for American University of Malta|url=http://www.depaulnewsline.com/features/faculty-create-curricula-american-university-malta|work=DePaul Newsline|date=13 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520003229/http://www.depaulnewsline.com/features/faculty-create-curricula-american-university-malta|archivedate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed university is meant to create a social and economic boost to localities in the [[South Eastern Region]] of Malta, which is regarded as being less developed than the rest of the island.&lt;ref name=opm-presentation&gt;{{cite web|title=Investiment għan-naħa t'isfel ta' Malta – American University of Malta|url=https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/AUM%20PRESENTATION.pdf|website=[[Government of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213220/https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/AUM%20PRESENTATION.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estimation of the Contribution to the Maltese Economy of the Development and Operation of an International Higher Academic Institution: Update Based on a Project Proposal Spread Over Two Sites|url=https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/AUM-EIA.pdf|website=[[Government of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703110407/https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/AUM-EIA.pdf|archivedate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has an investment of over €115 million, and it is to create around 400&lt;ref name="opm-presentation" /&gt; to 750 jobs.&lt;ref name="MT0516"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/64924/american_university_of_malta_campus_to_take_three_years_to_complete#.V3jwKfl961s|title='American University of Malta' campus to take three years to complete|last1=Dalli|first1=Miriam|date=6 May 2016|work=[[Malta Today]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604130547/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/64924/american_university_of_malta_campus_to_take_three_years_to_complete|archivedate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's estimated economic output rests at about €48 to €85 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160921/local/sadeens-five-year-licence-dictated-by-law.625667|title=Sadeen’s five-year licence 'dictated by law'|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|date=21 September 2016|work=[[Times of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922140626/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160921/local/sadeens-five-year-licence-dictated-by-law.625667|archivedate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ripple effects of these changes are already being felt. As of September 2016, demand for property in Cospicua has reportedly increased as a result of the university project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartolo|first1=Janice|title=Xhieda li l-American University of Malta bdiet tagħti spinta lin-naħa t'isfel ta' Malta|url=http://www.one.com.mt/news/xhieda-li-l-american-university-of-malta-bdiet-taghti-spinta-lin-naha-tisfel-ta-malta/|work=[[One Productions|One]]|date=27 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019133208/http://www.one.com.mt/news/xhieda-li-l-american-university-of-malta-bdiet-taghti-spinta-lin-naha-tisfel-ta-malta/|archivedate=19 October 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university originally planned to take in its first students in October 2016, with lectures at [[SmartCity Malta]] until the head campus was completed.&lt;ref name=times2015-08-20/&gt; The beginning of the first academic year was later moved to 28 August 2017, with lectures held at the Dock No. 1 campus in Cospicua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=Lectures at AUM to start on August 28|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160925/local/lectures-at-aum-to-start-on-august-28.625991|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=25 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926154655/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160925/local/lectures-at-aum-to-start-on-august-28.625991|archivedate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, [[John Ryder (scholar)|John Ryder]] was named as the head of the American Institute of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Baku university rector to head 'American Institute of Malta'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160127/local/former-baku-university-rector-to-head-american-institute-of-malta.600270|work=Times of Malta|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of campus and use of ODZ land===
[[File:Site for the future American Institute of Malta.jpeg|thumb|Żonqor Point, where part of the university campus is to be built]]

When the university project was announced in May 2015, the government offered the Sadeen Group {{convert|90000|m2|abbr=on}} of Outside Development Zone (ODZ) land near Żonqor Point in [[Marsaskala]] on which to build the university. A natural park, partially funded by the university, would be set up nearby. The proposal to use ODZ land raised concerns among environmentalists, including the NGOs [[Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar]], [[Friends of the Earth]] Malta, Ramblers Association, [[Din l-Art Ħelwa]], NatureTrust Malta, [[Birdlife]] Malta, Malta Organic Agriculture Movement and Greenhouse. The Malta Developers Association also stated that a better site should be found,&lt;ref name=times2015-05-05&gt;{{cite news|title=Fort San Leonardo may be incorporated in new university campus|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150505/local/update-3-fort-san-leonardo-may-be-incorporated-in-new-university.566883|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=5 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928173056/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150505/local/update-3-fort-san-leonardo-may-be-incorporated-in-new-university.566883|archivedate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Church criticized the process used to select the land for the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muscat|first1=Caroline|title=Church slams government’s handling of university bid|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150521/local/church-slams-governments-handling-of-university-bid.569018|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=21 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220213628/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150521/local/church-slams-governments-handling-of-university-bid.569018|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, residents of Marsaskala and southern Malta supported the university project by signing a petition in its favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tan-nofsinhar jiġbru petizzjoni favur il-proġett tal-università|url=http://www.inewsmalta.com/dart/20150615-tan-nofsinhar-ji-bru-petizzjoni-favur-il-pro-ett-tal-universit|work=iNews Malta|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618014128/http://www.inewsmalta.com/dart/20150615-tan-nofsinhar-ji-bru-petizzjoni-favur-il-pro-ett-tal-universit|archivedate=18 June 2015|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government initially planned to include the 19th-century [[Fort Leonardo]] within the university campus. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat also stated that constructing the university in Marsaskala would pressure the owners of the former [[Jerma Palace Hotel]] to redevelop the site, which has fallen into disrepair since being closed down in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalli|first1=Kim|title=University plan ‘puts pressure on Jerma site’|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150506/local/university-plan-puts-pressure-on-jerma-site.566951|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=6 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929031031/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150506/local/university-plan-puts-pressure-on-jerma-site.566951|archivedate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscat responded to the environmentalists' criticism by stating that the [[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] would consider other sites as long as they are located in the southern part of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Ivan|title=‘University will generate €25m a year’|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150504/local/university-will-generate-25m-a-year.566645|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=4 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220195817/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150504/local/university-will-generate-25m-a-year.566645|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public consultation process was subsequently made in order to select an alternative site for the university campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American University of Malta – Preliminary Alternative Sites Evaluation Report|url=https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/Preliminary%20Alternative%20Sites%20Evaluation%20Report.pdf|website=[[Government of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304214404/https://opm.gov.mt/en/Documents/AUM/Preliminary%20Alternative%20Sites%20Evaluation%20Report.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2015, the Front Ħarsien ODZ ([[Maltese language|Maltese]] for ''Front for the Protection of ODZ'') was set up in response to the proposed development at Żonqor Point. The group aims to protect all ODZ land in Malta, and it includes then-[[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour]] MP, turned Democratic Party (PD) members, [[Marlene Farrugia]], [[Whip (politics)|government whip]] Godfrey Farrugia and former [[Alternattiva Demokratika]] politician, turned Nationalist Party (PN) member, [[Michael Briguglio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Neil|title=Godfrey, Marlene Farrugia join 'Front Harsien ODZ,' group says Zonqor project can be stopped|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-23/local-news/Front-Harsien-ODZ-launched-not-just-against-Zonqor-university-but-all-other-ODZ-developments-6736136030|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=23 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811133750/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-23/local-news/Front-Harsien-ODZ-launched-not-just-against-Zonqor-university-but-all-other-ODZ-developments-6736136030|archivedate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June, the front held a protest in [[Valletta]] against the development, and it was attended by 3000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government announces reduced university plans for Zonqor|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/56337/government_announces_reduced_university_plans_for_zonqor_#.VncO4PkrLIV|work=[[Malta Today]]|date=20 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010090820/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/56337/government_announces_reduced_university_plans_for_zonqor_|archivedate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August, Muscat announced that the government had reached an agreement with the Sadeen Group that the campus be split between the former [[Malta Dockyard|Dock No. 1]] in [[Cospicua]] and a reduced site at Żonqor Point. The campus at Żonqor is much smaller than the one originally planned, and it will occupy the site of the water polo pitch and {{convert|18000|m2|abbr=on}} of adjoining ODZ fields. This campus is to consist of three faculties and student dormitories, with a maximum height of five stories. A new water polo pitch is also to be built to replace the one that will be demolished to make way for the university. The campus at Cospicua will occupy two former [[warehouse]]s at Dock No. 1 which were built during [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitaller]] and [[British Empire|British]] rule.

[[File:Malta - Cospicua - Fuq San l-Inkurunazzjoni - Dock no1 11 ies.jpg|thumb|The British Building at Dock No. 1 in Cospicua]]

On 25 August 2016, the Planning Authority approved the restoration of the British Building at Dock No. 1, and its conversion into a campus to house part of the AUM. Parts of the building which were destroyed during [[World War II]] will be rebuilt, while an intermediate level and a new second floor with a [[Contemporary architecture|contemporary]] glass-and-steel design will be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University in Cospicua granted permit|url=http://www.pa.org.mt/news-details?id=1137|website=Planning Authority|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828114710/http://www.pa.org.mt/news-details?id=1137|archivedate=28 August 2016|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation of the building is entrusted to the architect Edwin Mintoff, and it is expected to be completed by April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saliba|first1=Norma|title=American University buildings will reflect the past historic appearance of Cospicua Wharf|url=http://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/il-binjiet-tal-uaameamerican-university-buildings-will-reflect-the-past-historic-appearance-of-cospicua-wharfrican-university-buildings-will-reflect-the-past-historic-appearance-of-cospicua-wharfm-se/|work=[[TVM (Malta)|TVM]]|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plans to restore the Knights' Building at Dock No. 1 and convert it into part of the campus, and this renovation is planned to be completed by 2017–18. The Marsaskala campus is to be ready by 2019–20.&lt;ref name="times2016-09-25"/&gt;

===Accreditation and licensing===
In December 2015, Leader of the Opposition [[Simon Busuttil]] stated that since the AUM applied for the licence of a "Higher Education Institution", its marketing of itself as a "University" is illegal.&lt;ref name=times2015-12-15/&gt; In January 2016, the National Commission for Further and Higher Education announced that Sadeen Education Investment Ltd had been given a licence to operate a Higher Education Institution under the name ''American Institute of Malta''. This was the first step in the process to acquire a university licence.&lt;ref name=times2016-01-26&gt;{{cite news|title=American University of Malta formally becomes American Institute of Malta, process to acquire university licence in process|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160126/local/american-university-of-malta-formally-becomes-american-institute-of.600155|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126174313/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160126/local/american-university-of-malta-formally-becomes-american-institute-of.600155|archivedate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission has stated that a degree issued by the American Institute would have the same value as one issued by the University of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Ivan|title=American Institute's degree 'equivalent to university's'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160201/local/american-institutes-degree-equivalent-to-universitys.600851|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=1 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201174356/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160201/local/american-institutes-degree-equivalent-to-universitys.600851|archivedate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 11 March 2016, Sadeen Education Investment Ltd was notified by a judicial letter that licensed higher education institutions are prohibited from using the word "university" in their advertising and publicity, unless they have been granted that status formally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vella|first1=Matthew|title=Watchdog fines Sadeen for marketing unlicensed 'university'|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/63682/watchdog_fines_sadeen_over_aum_logo|work=Malta Today|date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 2016, Economy Minister [[Christian Cardona]] said that he had "no doubt that this will be a University and not an institute.

The National Commission for Higher Education officially accredited the AUM on 30 June 2016, after a 14-month process which included financial and academic evaluations. The commission imposed a number of conditions on the AUM, including an annual audit by the [[Clemson University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American University of Malta gets accreditation at last|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160630/local/american-university-of-malta-gets-accreditation-at-last.617262|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=30 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701130607/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160630/local/american-university-of-malta-gets-accreditation-at-last.617262|archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=Conditions imposed on Sadeen Group for university licence 'are not negotiable'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160703/local/conditions-imposed-on-sadeen-group-for-university-licence-are-not.617495|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=3 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703105715/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160703/local/conditions-imposed-on-sadeen-group-for-university-licence-are-not.617495|archivedate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadeen asked for a compromise on these conditions, but the commission insisted that they were not negotiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=No university licence for Sadeen, one month before 'first student intake'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160910/local/no-university-licence-for-sadeen-one-month-before-first-student-intake.624564|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=10 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910171108/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160910/local/no-university-licence-for-sadeen-one-month-before-first-student-intake.624564|archivedate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the conditions were accepted, the commission issued a 5-year university licence on 16 September 2016.&lt;ref name="ourbeginnings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Beginnings|url=http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|website=American University of Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106002945/http://aum.edu.mt/en/article/5/Our-Beginnings|archivedate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sadeen granted 5-year licence to run American University of Malta|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160919/local/sadeen-granted-5-year-licence-to-run-american-university-of-malta.625569|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=19 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920185425/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160919/local/sadeen-granted-5-year-licence-to-run-american-university-of-malta.625569|archivedate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Some questions have been raised by Maltese media about whether AUM is actually American. This is especially due to the company behind the project being Jordanian. In response to this, AUM's provost John Ryder stated that the university is "not a brand or offshoot, or run by any American university ... [but it is] American in curriculum and organisation."&lt;ref name="times2016-09-25"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=AUM owner aspires for 'higher education diamond in the Mediterranean'|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160925/local/diamond-waiting-to-shine.625996|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=25 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926161256/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160925/local/diamond-waiting-to-shine.625996|archivedate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curricula are officially provided by DePaul University, Chicago. A spokesperson for DePaul University issued a statement, qualifying the officiality of AUM’s curricula, saying that; "Faculty designed degree programs in areas that were requested, with the dual goals of being academically well-designed and meeting regulatory requirements in Malta. Individual faculty members were selected with the help of teams -- composed of associate deans, school directors and department chairs -- in the relevant colleges. Faculty then were asked to design the curriculum, and they were compensated for their work," also adding; "[t]he right to use our name (DePaul University) is specifically in connection to the curriculum. While specifics of any DePaul contract are proprietary, I can tell you that it went through the usual, internal multi-step review process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/11/questions-raised-about-whether-american-u-malta-really-american|title=Questions raised about whether American U. of Malta is really American {{!}} Inside Higher Ed|date=2015-10-16|access-date=2018-03-06|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016055439/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/11/questions-raised-about-whether-american-u-malta-really-american|archivedate=2015-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AUM has also generated controversy with regard to the practicality of having another university in the small country of Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayo|first1=Peter|title=Of Universities, Monopolies, and Public Goods|journal=Think|url=http://www.um.edu.mt/think/of-universities-monopolies-and-public-goods/|publisher=[[University of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220183841/http://www.um.edu.mt/think/of-universities-monopolies-and-public-goods/|archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government stated that the AUM would end the monopoly that the [[University of Malta]] has on higher education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsay|first1=David|title=Government seeking to end University of Malta’s ‘monopoly’|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-03/local-news/Government-seeking-to-end-University-of-Malta-s-monopoly-6736134834|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=3 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807015710/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-03/local-news/Government-seeking-to-end-University-of-Malta-s-monopoly-6736134834|archivedate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, lecturers at the University of Malta disagreed with the use of the term "monopoly", stating that the university already competes with other institutions such as [[MCAST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lecturers rubbish PM's claim of university monopoly|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150520/local/lecturers-rubbish-pms-claim-of-university-monopoly.568972|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=20 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522183824/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150520/local/lecturers-rubbish-pms-claim-of-university-monopoly.568972|archivedate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The AUM's early phase, low student intake and initial refusals to release the official enrollment figures became flashpoints of controversy. An early promotional video presented the new university's plan to admit 1,000 students in its first year, eventually reaching a total enrollment of 4,000 students by its fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=Y01mF8p13tk|title=AUM Promo Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AUM officially began offering classes on Tuesday September 12, 2017, rather than Monday September 11, to avoid association with the [[September 11 attacks]] anniversary.&lt;ref name="maltachamber"&gt;{{cite news|title=AUM Opens its Doors to the First Batch of Students|url=http://www.maltachamber.org.mt/page.aspx?rid=8697&amp;preview=1&amp;c=95493AB4B36E9D8D6637317593DB929F7C5700C8&amp;k=-534249962|work=maltachamber.org.mt|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how many students the AUM admitted for the Fall semester, Provost John Ryder would only say that student recruitment was “proving to be challenging." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Ivan|title=AUM student enrolment is 'proving challenging', provost says|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170906/local/aum-student-enrolment-is-proving-challenging-provost-says.657269|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the [[Times of Malta]] reported that the AUM's revised plan was to enroll 330 students in its first semester, but the "university managed to attract 15 students"&lt;ref name="timesofmalta1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camilleri|first1=Ivan|title=AUM firing staff after failing to attract students|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171112/local/aum-firing-staff-after-failing-to-attract-students.662834|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was denied by university officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schembri Orland|first1=Kevin|title=AUM says it has more than 15 students, but still doesn't divulge number|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-11-19/local-news/AUM-says-it-has-more-than-15-students-but-still-doesn-t-divulge-number-6736181619|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Ryder acknowledged in a [[Television Malta]] interview that the AUM student body numbered 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AUM rector says original targets were not realistic but is confident for the future|url=https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/aum-rector-says-original-targets-were-not-realistic-but-is-confident-for-the-future/|work=[[Television Malta]]|date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUM personnel decisions have also generated controversy, raising concerns about the legality of the new institution's employment policies and practices. Within a period of 7 months, 10 university employees were terminated, either by [[dismissal (employment)|dismissal]] or resignation: (1) Deputy (Construction Project) Manager (dismissal), (2) Admissions Director (dismissal), (3) Marketing and Public Relations Director (dismissal), (4) Vice President for Administrative Affairs (dismissal), (5) IT Technician (dismissal), (6) Webmaster (resignation), (7) Admissions Counselor (resignation), (8) Human Resources Director (dismissal), (9) Professor of Finance (dismissal) and (10) Dean of Student Affairs (resignation).&lt;ref name="timesofmalta1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diacono|first1=Tim|title=This is What the American University of Malta Looks Like Two Years Later|url=https://lovinmalta.com/news/news-breaking/this-is-what-the-american-university-of-malta-looks-like-two-years-later|work=lovinmalta.com|date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dismissed deputy manager filed a judicial protest against Sadeen Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American University of Malta deputy manager says claims against him were fabricated|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170523/local/american-university-deputy-manager-says-claims-against-him-were.648810|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former admissions director sued the university for unfair dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Couple file judicial protest claiming unfair dismissal by Sadeen Education Investment Ltd|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-10-20/local-news/Couple-file-judicial-protest-claiming-unfair-dismissal-by-Sadeen-Education-Investment-Ltd-6736180457|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2018, Provost John Ryder informed the twelve remaining AUM faculty members by e-mail that their employment with the university had been terminated without cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diacono|first1=Tim|title=BREAKING: American University of Malta Has Sacked All Its Faculty|url=https://lovinmalta.com/news/news-breaking-american-university-of-malta-has-sacked-it's-faculty|work=lovinmalta.com|date=4 January 2018}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Attard|first1=Rachel|title=AUM full time lecturers said to have been 'dismissed by email'|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-01-04/local-news/AUM-full-time-lectures-said-to-have-been-dismissed-by-email-6736183231|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5785">'''Anneliese Bulling''' (born April 21, 1900 in Ellwürden, Wesermarch (today known as [[Lower Saxony]]), died February 9, 2004 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]), also known as '''Anneliese Gutkind''', was a German&amp;ndash;American art historian specializing in [[Chinese art]] and [[Chinese architecture|architecture]].

== Life ==
Anneliese Bulling came from a wealthy, long-established and well-educated German landowning family. She lived with her father, Henry Bulling (1858&amp;ndash;1940), a banker, and her mother, Anna Umbsen (1867&amp;ndash;1955).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwzonline.de/wesermarsch/kultur/zeitgeschichte-mit-ganz-persoenlicher-note_a_1,0,478925174.html|title = Time history with a personal touch, Historian Vonderach written documentation "from Ellwürden to Hampstead"|date = May 14, 2009|accessdate = May 23, 2014|website = Nordwest Zeitung (NWZ Online)|publisher = |last = Hartfil|first = Norbert|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, she had a short-lived marriage to a farmer that was soon declared invalid.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwzonline.de/politik/niedersachsen/deutsch-englische-erlebnisse_a_1,0,604194649.html|title = German-English experiences, Anneliese Bulling|date = June 18, 2011|accessdate = May 23, 2014|website = Nordwest Zietung (NWZ Online)|publisher = |last = Welp|first = Jörgen}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her failed first marriage, Bulling went off to study Art History and Chinese Studies in [[Berlin]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] (now [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) under [[Erich Haenisch]] and Brinkmann.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1935 she graduated with a degree in Chinese Architecture, and in the same year emigrated to [[London]] with her partner, the Jewish architect [[Erwin Gutkind]].{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}}

In 1946 she found work as a research scholar at the [[Universities’ China Committee in London|Universities China Committee]] and then in 1947 in Cambridge at [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]], where she received a PhD, the subject of her dissertation being ''Representational Art in the [[Han period|Han Period]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/14-4/Bulling.pdf|title = Archaeological Excavation in China 1946-1966|last = |first = |date = Summer 1972|journal = UPENN Expedition Magazine|accessdate = May 23, 2014|doi = |volume=14 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulling's research focus was Chinese art history, especially architecture and arts and crafts. She developed a theory that the Chinese characters are the result of prehistoric ([[Neolithic]]) astronomical calendar symbols.{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}}

In 1956, Bulling and Gutkind married and emigrated to the United States for his professorship at the University of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1964 she joined Dr. Stackler's translation project, translating many Chinese books, and in 1966 she was promoted to Research Associate for Chinese Art and Archaeology at [[Columbia University]] in New York.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her husband died in 1968.

Bulling died in 2004 at the age of 103 years. She had left the [[Oldenburg Municipal Museum]] an extensive collection of letters of correspondence from 1928&amp;ndash;1946 (around 4,200 letters and postcards), was the inspiration for the 2009 book, ''From Ellwürden to Hampstead. The letters of the Oldenburg emigrant Anneliese Bulling. A contribution to the history of mentalities of the Oldenburg bourgeoisie in the period of National Socialism'' by Andreas Vonderach.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The relationship between '''biology and sexual orientation''' is a subject of research. While scientists do not know the exact cause of [[sexual orientation]], they theorize that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and social factors determine it.&lt;ref name="Frankowski"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.113.6.1827 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/113/6/1827?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=%22Sexual+orientation+and+adolescents%22&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT |author=Frankowski BL |author2=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence|title=Sexual orientation and adolescents |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=113|issue=6 |pages=1827–32 |date=June 2004|pmid=15173519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamanna"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Ann Lamanna|author2=Agnes Riedmann|author3=Susan D Stewart|title=Marriages, Families, and Relationships: Making Choices in a Diverse Society|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1305176898|year=2014|page=82|accessdate=February 11, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fofaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|quote=The reason some individuals develop a gay sexual identity has not been definitively established &amp;nbsp;– nor do we yet understand the development of heterosexuality.

Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are favored by scientists&lt;ref name="Frankowski"/&gt; and involve a complex interplay of genetic factors, the early uterine environment and brain structure.&lt;ref name="rcp2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/workinpsychiatry/specialinterestgroups/gaylesbian/submissiontothecofe.aspx |title=Submission to the Church of England's Listening Exercise on Human Sexuality |publisher=The Royal College of Psychiatrists |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors, which may be related to the development of a [[heterosexual]], [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]], or [[asexuality|asexual]] orientation, include [[gene]]s, [[Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation|prenatal hormones]], and [[Human brain|brain]] structure.

==Empirical studies==
===Twin studies===
A number of [[twin study|twin studies]] have attempted to compare the relative importance of genetics and environment in the determination of sexual orientation. In a 1991 study, Bailey and Pillard conducted a study of male twins recruited from "homophile publications", and found that 52% of [[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|monozygotic (MZ)]] brothers (of whom 59 were questioned) and 22% of the [[Twin#Fraternal (sororal; dizygotic) twins|dizygotic (DZ)]] twins were [[Concordance (genetics)|concordant]] for homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Pillard, RC |title=A Genetic Study of Male Sexual Orientation |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=1089–96 |year=1991 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1991.01810360053008 |pmid=1845227}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'MZ' indicates identical twins with the same sets of genes and 'DZ' indicates fraternal twins where genes are mixed to an extent similar to that of non-twin siblings. In a study of 61 pairs of twins, researchers found among their mostly male subjects a concordance rate for homosexuality of 66% among monozygotic twins and a 30% one among dizygotic twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homosexual orientation in twins: a report on 61 pairs and three triplet sets|year=1993|journal=Arch. Sex. Behav.|volume=22|issue=3|pages=187–206|author=Whitam FL|displayauthors=etal|doi=10.1007/bf01541765|pmid=8494487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Bailey, Dunne and Martin studied a larger sample of 4,901 Australian twins but reported less than half the level of concordance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bailey JM, Dunne MP, Martin NG |title=Genetic and environmental influences on sexual orientation and its correlates in an Australian twin sample |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=524–36 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10743878 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.3.524 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/78/3/524}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found 20% concordance in the male identical or MZ twins and 24% concordance for the female identical or MZ twins. Self reported [[zygosity]], sexual attraction, fantasy and behaviours were assessed by questionnaire and zygosity was [[Serology|serologically]] checked when in doubt. Other researchers support biological causes for both men and women's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Hershberger, Scott L. 2001. Biological Factors in the Development of Sexual Orientation. Pp. 27–51 in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identities and Youth: Psychological Perspectives, edited by Anthony R. D’Augelli and Charlotte J. Patterson. Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press. Quoted in Bearman and Bruckner, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bearman and Brückner (2002) criticized early studies concentrating on small, select samples&lt;ref name=Bearman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bearman P. S. |author2=Bruckner H. |year=2002 |title=Opposite-sex twins and adolescent same-sex attraction |url=http://iserp.columbia.edu/content/opposite-sex-twins-and-adolescent-same-sex-attraction |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=1179–1205 |doi=10.1086/341906 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175100/http://iserp.columbia.edu/content/opposite-sex-twins-and-adolescent-same-sex-attraction |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.483.4722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-representative selection of their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;While inconsistent with modern findings, the first relatively large-scale twin study on sexual orientation was reported by [[Franz Josef Kallmann|Kallman]] in 1952. (''See:'' {{cite journal |author=Kallmann FJ |title=Comparative twin study on the genetic aspects of male homosexuality |journal=J. Nerv. Ment. Dis. |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=283–97 |date=April 1952 |pmid=14918012 |doi= |url=}}). Examining only male twin pairs, he found a 100% concordance rate for homosexuality among 37 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, compared to a 12%–42% concordance rate among 26 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, depending on definition. In other words, every identical twin of a homosexual subject was also homosexual, while this was not the case for non-identical twins. This study was criticized for its vaguely described method of recruiting twins and for a high rate of [[mental illness|psychiatric disorders]] among its subjects. (''See'' Rosenthal, D., "Genetic Theory and Abnormal Behavior" 1970, New York: McGraw-Hill.)&lt;/ref&gt; They studied 289 pairs of identical twins (monozygotic, or from one fertilized egg) and 495 pairs of fraternal twins (dizygotic, or from two fertilized eggs) and found [[Concordance (genetics)|concordance rates]] for same-sex attraction of only 7.7% for male identical twins and 5.3% for females, a pattern which they say "does not suggest genetic influence independent of social context".&lt;ref name=Bearman/&gt;

A 2010 study of all adult twins in Sweden (more than 7,600 twins)&lt;ref name="karolinska"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Långström N, Rahman Q, Carlström E, Lichtenstein P |title=Genetic and environmental effects on same-sex sexual behavior: a population study of twins in Sweden |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=75–80 |date=February 2010 |pmid=18536986 |doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9386-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that same-sex behavior was explained by both heritable factors and individual-specific environmental sources (such as prenatal environment, experience with illness and trauma, as well as peer groups, and sexual experiences), while influences of shared-environment variables such as familial environment and social attitudes had a weaker, but significant effect.  Women showed a statistically non-significant trend to weaker influence of hereditary effects, while men showed no effect of shared environmental effects.  The use of all adult twins in Sweden was designed to address the criticism of volunteer studies, in which a potential bias towards participation by gay twins may influence the results;

{{quote|text=Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34–.39 of the variance [of sexual orientation], the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61–.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18–.19 for genetic factors, .16–.17 for shared environmental, and .64–.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="karolinska"/&gt;}}

====Criticisms====
Twin studies have received a number of criticisms including [[self-selection bias]] where homosexuals with gay siblings are more likely to volunteer for studies. Nonetheless, it is possible to conclude that, given the difference in sexuality in so many sets of identical twins, sexual orientation cannot be attributed solely to genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel L. |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel Todd |last3=Wegner |first3=Daniel M. |title=Psychology |date=2011 |publisher=New York, NY Worth Publishers |isbn=978-1429237192 |page=435 |edition= 2nd |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/35310322 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is the finding that even monozygotic twins can be different and there is a mechanism which might account for monozygotic twins being discordant for homosexuality. Gringas and Chen (2001) describe a number of mechanisms which can lead to differences between [[Twin#chorionicity|monozygotic twins]], the most relevant here being chorionicity and amniocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-3782(01)00171-2 |last1=Gringas |first1=P. |last2=Chen |first2=W. |year=2001 |title=Mechanisms for difference in monozygous twins |url= |journal=Early Human Development |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=105–117 |pmid=11440823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dichorionic twins]] potentially have different hormonal environments because they receive maternal blood from separate placenta, and this could result in different levels of brain masculinisation. Monoamniotic twins share a hormonal environment, but can suffer from the 'twin to twin transfusion syndrome' in which one twin is "relatively stuffed with blood and the other exsanguinated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grant |first1=Seth G. N. |title=Michael Rutter: Genes and behavior: nature-nurture interplay explained |journal=Genes, Brain and Behavior |date=April 2006 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=303 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-183x.2006.00219.x |language=en |issn=1601-1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromosome linkage studies===
Chromosome linkage studies of sexual orientation have indicated the presence of multiple contributing genetic factors throughout the genome. In 1993 [[Dean Hamer]] and colleagues published findings from a linkage analysis of a sample of 76 gay brothers and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamer DH, Hu S, Magnuson VL, Hu N, Pattatucci AM |title=A linkage between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation |journal=Science |volume=261 |issue=5119 |pages=321–7 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8332896 |doi=10.1126/science.8332896 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8332896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamer et al. found that the gay men had more gay male uncles and cousins on the maternal side of the family than on the paternal side. Gay brothers who showed this maternal pedigree were then tested for X chromosome linkage, using twenty-two markers on the X chromosome to test for similar alleles. In another finding, thirty-three of the forty sibling pairs tested were found to have similar alleles in the distal region of [[Xq28]], which was significantly higher than the expected rates of 50% for fraternal brothers. This was popularly dubbed the "'''gay gene'''" in the media, causing significant controversy.  Sanders et al. in 1998 reported on their similar study, in which they found that 13% of uncles of gay brothers on the maternal side were homosexual, compared with 6% on the paternal side.&lt;ref name= "Born gay321"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Glenn |last2=Rahman |first2=Qazi |title=Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Owen Publishers |isbn=9780720613094 |edition= 2nd |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later analysis by Hu et al. replicated and refined the earlier findings.  This study revealed that 67% of gay brothers in a new saturated sample shared a marker on the X chromosome at Xq28.&lt;ref name=Huetal95&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu S, Pattatucci AM, Patterson C |title=Linkage between sexual orientation and chromosome Xq28 in males but not in females |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=248–56 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7581447 |doi=10.1038/ng1195-248 |display-authors=etal|type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other studies (Bailey et al., 1999; McKnight and Malcolm, 2000) failed to find a preponderance of gay relatives in the maternal line of homosexual men.&lt;ref name= "Born gay321"/&gt; One study by Rice et al. in 1999 failed to replicate the Xq28 linkage results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vilain E |title=Genetics of sexual development |journal=Annu Rev Sex Res |volume=11 |issue= |pages=1–25 |year=2000 |pmid=11351829 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meta-analysis of all available linkage data indicates a significant link to Xq28, but also indicates that additional genes must be present to account for the full heritability of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="HamerRiceSciencemeta"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hamer DH |author2=Rice G |author3=Risch N |author4=Ebers G |title=Genetics and Male Sexual Orientation |journal=Science |date=1999 |volume=285 |issue=5429 |page=803 |doi=10.1126/science.285.5429.803a |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/285/5429/803.full |accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mustanski et al. (2005) performed a full-genome scan (instead of just an X chromosome scan) on individuals and families previously reported on in Hamer et al. (1993) and Hu et al.

In the full sample they did not find linkage to Xq28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mustanski BS, Dupree MG, Nievergelt CM, Bocklandt S, Schork NJ, Hamer DH |title=A genomewide scan of male sexual orientation |journal=Hum.

Results from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012.&lt;ref name=camb20141117&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sanders AR, Martin ER, Beecham GW, Guo S, Dawood K, Rieger G, Badner JA, Gershon ES, Krishnappa RS, Kolundzija AB, Duan J, Gejman PV, Bailey JM |date = November 2014 |title = Genome-wide scan demonstrates significant linkage for male sexual orientation |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0033291714002451 |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume = 45 |issue = 7 |pages = 1379–88 |doi = 10.1017/S0033291714002451 |pmid = 25399360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] markers.

Significant linkage was also detected in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8, overlapping with one of the regions detected in the Hamer lab's previous genomewide study.  The authors concluded that "our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation".

In addition to [[allosome|sex chromosomal]] contribution, a potential [[autosomal]] genetic contribution to the development of homosexual orientation has also been suggested. In a study population composed of more than 7000 participants, Ellis et al. (2008) found a statistically significant difference in the frequency of blood type A between homosexuals and heterosexuals. They also found that "unusually high" proportions of homosexual males and homosexual females were [[Rh factor|Rh negative]] in comparison to heterosexuals. As both blood type and Rh factor are genetically inherited traits controlled by [[alleles]] located on chromosome 9 and chromosome 1 respectively, the study indicates a potential link between genes on autosomes and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ellis L |author2=Ficek C |author3=Burke D |author4=Das S |title=Eye Color, Hair Color, Blood Type, and the Rhesus Factor: Exploring Possible Genetic Links to Sexual Orientation |journal=Arch.

The biology of sexual orientation has been studied in detail in several animal model systems.  In the common fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the complete pathway of sexual differentiation of the brain and the behaviors it controls is well established in both males and females, providing a concise model of biologically controlled courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pavlou HJ, Goodwin SF |title=Courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster: towards a 'courtship connectome' |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=76–83 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23021897 |pmc=3563961 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2012.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mammals, a group of geneticists at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology altered the sexual preferences of female mice by removing a single gene linked to reproductive behavior. Without the gene, the mice exhibited masculine sexual behavior and attraction toward urine of other female mice. Those mice who retained the gene fucose mutarotase (FucM) were attracted to male mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20609214 |year=2010 |last1=Park |first1=D |last2=Choi |first2=D |last3=Lee |first3=J |last4=Lim |first4=DS |last5=Park |first5=C |title=Male-like sexual behavior of female mouse lacking fucose mutarotase |volume=11 |pages=62 |doi=10.1186/1471-2156-11-62 |pmc=2912782 |journal=BMC Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In interviews to the press, researchers have pointed that the evidence of genetic influences should not be equated with genetic determinism. According to Dean Hamer and Michael Bailey, genetic aspects are only one of the multiple causes of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-gay-gene-is-back-on-the-scene-1536770.html |title=The 'gay gene' is back on the scene |first=Steve |last=Connor |date=31 October 1995 |website=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10637532/Being-homosexual-is-only-partly-due-to-gay-gene-research-finds.html |title=Being homosexual is only partly due to gay gene, research finds |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |date=13 February 2014 |website=The Telegraph |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published an article with a [[genome wide association study]] on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. A gene named '''SLITRK6''' on [[chromosome 13]] was identified, and contains an area or DNA sequence which is different for gay men than for heterosexual men.&lt;ref name="Nature21"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanders |first1=Alan R. |last2=Beecham |first2=Gary W. |last3=Guo |first3=Shengru |last4=Dawood |first4=Khytam |last5=Rieger |first5=Gerulf |last6=Badner |first6=Judith A. |last7=Gershon |first7=Elliot S. |last8=Krishnappa |first8=Ritesha S. |last9=Kolundzija |first9=Alana B. |last10=Duan |first10=Jubao |last11=Gejman |first11=Pablo V. |last12=Bailey |first12=J.

===Epigenetics studies===
{{Main|Epigenetic theories of homosexuality}}
A study suggests linkage between a mother's genetic make-up and homosexuality of her sons. Women have two X chromosomes, one of which is "switched off". The inactivation of the X chromosome occurs randomly throughout the embryo, resulting in cells that are mosaic with respect to which chromosome is active. In some cases though, it appears that this switching off can occur in a non-random fashion. Bocklandt et al. (2006) reported that, in mothers of homosexual men, the number of women with extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation is significantly higher than in mothers without gay sons.  13% of mothers with one gay son, and 23% of mothers with two gay sons, showed extreme skewing, compared to 4% of mothers without gay sons.&lt;ref name="Bocklandt et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocklandt S, Horvath S, Vilain E, Hamer DH |title=Extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation in mothers of homosexual men |journal=Hum.

===Birth order===
{{Main|Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation}}
Blanchard and Klassen (1997) reported that each additional older brother increases the odds of a man being gay by 33%.&lt;ref name="Blanchard and Klassen 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Klassen P |title=H-Y antigen and homosexuality in men |journal=J.

Biol. |volume=185 |issue=3 |pages=373–8 |date=April 1997 |pmid=9156085 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1996.0315 |url=http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/sex/H-Y%20anitgen.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.602.8423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/health/10gene.html |title=Pas de Deux of Sexuality Is Written in the Genes |date=10 April 2007 |newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Wade |first1=Nicholas }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now "one of the most reliable epidemiological variables ever identified in the study of sexual orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Birth order and sibling sex ratio in homosexual versus heterosexual males and females |journal=Annu Rev Sex Res |volume=8 |issue= |pages=27–67 |year=1997 |pmid=10051890 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this finding, it has been proposed that male fetuses provoke a maternal immune reaction that becomes stronger with each successive male fetus.
This maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH) begins when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth.&lt;ref name="Anthony2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Anthony F. Bogaert]] |author2=[[Malvina Skorska]] |last-author-amp=yes |title=Sexual orientation, fraternal birth order, and the maternal immune hypothesis: a review |journal=[[Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=247–254 |date=April 2011 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.004 |pmid=21315103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which are "almost certainly involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates".
These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, increasing the likelihood that the exposed son will be more attracted to men than women.&lt;ref name="Anthony2011"/&gt;
It is this antigen which maternal H-Y antibodies are proposed to both react to and 'remember'. Successive male fetuses are then attacked by H-Y antibodies which somehow decrease the ability of H-Y antigens to perform their usual function in brain masculinisation.&lt;ref name="Blanchard and Klassen 1997"/&gt;

However, the maternal immune hypothesis has been criticized because the prevalence of the type of immune attack proposed is rare compared with the prevalence of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitehead NE |title=An antiboy antibody? Re-examination of the maternal immune hypothesis |journal=J Biosocial Sci |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=905–921 |year=2007 |pmid=17316469 |doi=10.1017/S0021932007001903|citeseerx=10.1.1.573.5483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fraternal birth order effect" however, cannot account for between 71-85% of male homosexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Blanchard, Paterson, &amp; Bogaert, 2002; Blanchard &amp; Bogaert, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it does not explain instances where a firstborn child displays male homosexual preference (MHP).&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, 2011; Rieger et al., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, researchers discovered a biological mechanism of gay people who tend to have older brothers. They think [[Neuroligin 4 Y-linked]] protein is responsible for a later son being gay. They found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. The result also indicates that number of pregnancies, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bogaert |first1=Anthony F. |last2=Skorska |first2=Malvina N. |last3=Wang |first3=Chao |last4=Gabrie |first4=José |last5=MacNeil |first5=Adam J. |last6=Hoffarth |first6=Mark R. |last7=VanderLaan |first7=Doug P. |last8=Zucker |first8=Kenneth J. |last9=Blanchard |first9=Ray |title=Male homosexuality and maternal immune responsivity to the Y-linked protein NLGN4Y |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=9 January 2018 |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=302–306 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1705895114 |pmid=29229842 |pmc=5777026 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/302 |language=en |issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female fertility===
In 2004, Italian researchers conducted a study of about 4,600 people who were the relatives of 98 homosexual and 100 heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men tended to have more offspring than those of the heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men on their mother's side tended to have more offspring than those on the father's side. The researchers concluded that there was genetic material being passed down on the X chromosome which both promotes fertility in the mother and homosexuality in her male offspring. The connections discovered would explain about 20% of the cases studied, indicating that this is a highly significant but not the sole genetic factor determining sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Camperio-Ciani A, Corna F, Capiluppi C |title=Evidence for maternally inherited factors favouring male homosexuality and promoting female fecundity |journal=Proc.

The research showed that when both heterosexual women and gay men are exposed to a testosterone derivative found in men's sweat, a region in the hypothalamus is activated. Heterosexual men, on the other hand, have a similar response to an estrogen-like compound found in women's urine.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Nicholas. (May 9, 2005). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/science/09cnd-smell.html Gay Men Are Found to Have Different Scent of Attraction]." ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion is that sexual attraction, whether same-sex or opposite-sex oriented, operates similarly on a biological level. Researchers have suggested that this possibility could be further explored by studying young subjects to see if similar responses in the hypothalamus are found and then correlating these data with adult sexual orientation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Studies of brain structure===
A number of sections of the [[Human brain|brain]] have been reported to be sexually dimorphic; that is, they vary between men and women. There have also been reports of variations in brain structure corresponding to sexual orientation. In 1990, [[Dick Swaab]] and Michel A. Hofman reported a difference in the size of the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] between homosexual and heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swaab DF, Hofman MA |title=An enlarged suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men |journal=Brain Res. |volume=537 |issue=1–2 |pages=141–8 |date=December 1990 |pmid=2085769 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90350-K |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-8993(90)90350-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Allen and Gorski reported a difference related to sexual orientation in the size of the [[anterior commissure]],&lt;ref name="pmid1496013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=L.

Research on the physiologic differences between male and female brains are based on the idea that people have male or a female brain, and this mirrors the behavioral differences between the two sexes. Some researchers state that solid scientific support for this is lacking. Although consistent differences have been identified, including the size of the brain and of specific brain regions, male and female brains are very similar.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, 2006; Lenroot and Giedd, 2010; McCarthy et al., 2009; Sakuma, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum and Beltz, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexually dimorphic nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus====
[[Simon LeVay]], too, conducted some of these early researches. He studied four groups of [[neuron]]s in the [[hypothalamus]] called INAH1, INAH2, INAH3 and INAH4. This was a relevant area of the brain to study, because of evidence that it played a role in the regulation of [[sexual behaviour in animals]], and because INAH2 and INAH3 had previously been reported to differ in size between men and women.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=LeVay |first=Simon |title=A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men |journal=Science |issn=0036-8075 |volume=253 |issue=5023 |year=1991 |pages=1034–1037 |doi=10.1126/science.1887219 |pmid=1887219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained brains from 41 deceased hospital patients. The subjects were classified into three groups. The first group comprised 19 gay men who had died of [[AIDS]]-related illnesses. The second group comprised 16 men whose sexual orientation was unknown, but whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. Six of these men had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The third group was of six women whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. One of the women had died of an AIDS-related illness.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"/&gt;

The [[HIV-positive people]] in the presumably heterosexual patient groups were all identified from medical records as either [[intravenous drug abuse]]rs or recipients of [[blood transfusion]]s. Two of the men who identified as heterosexual specifically denied ever engaging in a homosexual sex act. The records of the remaining heterosexual subjects contained no information about their sexual orientation; they were assumed to have been primarily or exclusively heterosexual "on the basis of the numerical preponderance of heterosexual men in the population".&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"/&gt;

LeVay found no evidence for a difference between the groups in the size of INAH1, INAH2 or INAH4. However, the INAH3 group appeared to be twice as big in the heterosexual male group as in the gay male group; the difference was highly significant, and remained significant when only the six AIDS patients were included in the heterosexual group. The size of INAH3 in the homosexual men's brains was comparable to the size of INAH3 in the heterosexual women's brains.

However, other studies have shown that the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area, which include the INAH3, are of similar size in homosexual males who died of AIDS to heterosexual males, and therefore larger than female. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus. Furthermore, the SCN of homosexual males is extremely large (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted Dörner hypothesis that homosexual males have a "female hypothalamus" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the "male brain from originally female brain" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.hiim.unizg.hr/images/knjiga/CNS41.pdf |last1=Judaš |first1=Miloš |last2=Kostović |first2=Ivica |title=Temelji Neuroznanosti: Sadržaj Poglavlja |chapter=Neurobiologija emocija i spolnosti |page=408 |language=hr |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://webcitation.org/query?date=2016-03-23&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hiim.unizg.hr%2Fimages%2Fknjiga%2FCNS41.pdf |chapter-format=PDF |archive-date=23 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1292983 |volume=38 Suppl 2 |issue=2 |title=Gender and sexual orientation in relation to hypothalamic structures |year=1992 |journal=Horm Res |pages=51–61 |doi=10.1159/000182597 |author1=Swaab |first1=D.

William Byne and colleagues attempted to identify the size differences reported in INAH 1–4 by replicating the experiment using brain sample from other subjects: 14 HIV-positive homosexual males, 34 presumed heterosexual males (10 HIV-positive), and 34 presumed heterosexual females (9 HIV-positive). The researchers found a significant difference in INAH3 size between heterosexual men and heterosexual women. The INAH3 size of the homosexual men was apparently smaller than that of the heterosexual men, and larger than that of the heterosexual women, though neither difference quite reached statistical significance.&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Byne W, Tobet S, Mattiace LA |title=The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and HIV status |journal=Horm Behav |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11534967 |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1680 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byne and colleagues also weighed and counted numbers of neurons in INAH3 tests not carried out by LeVay. The results for INAH3 weight were similar to those for INAH3 size; that is, the INAH3 weight for the heterosexual male brains was significantly larger than for the heterosexual female brains, while the results for the gay male group were between those of the other two groups but not quite significantly different from either. The neuron count also found a male-female difference in INAH3, but found no trend related to sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"/&gt;

A 2010 study, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab asserted that "the fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells, or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge. In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Garcia-Falgueras A, Swaab DF |title=Sexual Hormones and the Brain: An Essential Alliance for Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation |journal=Endocr Dev |volume=17 |issue= |pages=22–35 |year=2010 |pmid=19955753 |doi=10.1159/000262525 |series=Endocrine Development |isbn=978-3-8055-9302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ovine model====
The [[domestic ram]] is used as an experimental model to study early programming of the neural mechanisms which underlie homosexuality, developing from the observation that approximately 8% of domestic rams are sexually attracted to other rams (male-oriented) when compared to the majority of rams which are female-oriented. In many species, a prominent feature of sexual differentiation is the presence of a sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus, which is larger in males than in females.

Roselli et al. discovered an ovine SDN (oSDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus that is smaller in male-oriented rams than in female-oriented rams, but similar in size to the oSDN of females. Neurons of the oSDN show [[aromatase]] expression which is also smaller in male-oriented rams versus female-oriented rams, suggesting that sexual orientation is neurologically hard-wired and may be influenced by hormones. However, results failed to associate the role of neural aromatase in the sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in the sheep, due to the lack of defeminization of adult sexual partner preference or oSDN volume as a result of aromatase activity in the brain of the fetuses during the critical period. Having said this, it is more likely that oSDN morphology and homosexuality may be programmed through an androgen receptor that does not involve [[aromatisation]]. Most of the data suggests that homosexual rams, like female-oriented rams, are masculinized and defeminized with respect to mounting, receptivity, and gonadotrophin secretion, but are not defeminized for sexual partner preferences, also suggesting that such behaviors may be programmed differently. Although the exact function of the oSDN is not fully known, its volume, length, and cell number seem to correlate with sexual orientation, and a dimorphism in its volume and of cells could bias the processing cues involved in partner selection. More research is needed in order to understand the requirements and timing of the development of the oSDN and how prenatal programming effects the expression of mate choice in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[C.

==Biological theories of cause of sexual orientation==

===Early fixation hypothesis===
{{Main|Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation}}
The early fixation hypothesis includes research into prenatal development and the environmental factors that control masculinization of the brain. Some studies have seen pre-natal hormone exposures as the primary factor involved in determining sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., Sexual Hormones and the Brain: An Essential Alliance for Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation, in Endocrine Development, vol. 17, pp. 22–35 (2010) ({{ISSN|1421-7082}}) (authors are of Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, of Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences) (author contact is 2d author) (vol. 17 is Sandro Loche, Marco Cappa, Lucia Ghizzoni, Mohamad Maghnie, &amp; Martin O. Savage, eds., Pediatric Neuroendocrinology).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. &amp; Rahman, Q (2005) Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation, Peter Owen, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4808435 |volume=131 |issue=1 |title=Plasma testosterone levels in heterosexual and homosexual men |date=January 1974 |journal=Am J Psychiatry |pages=82–3 |vauthors=Brodie HK, Gartrell N, Doering C, Rhue T |doi=10.1176/ajp.131.1.82}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is supported by both the observed differences in brain structure and cognitive processing between homosexual and heterosexual men. One explanation for these differences is the idea that differential exposure to hormone levels in the womb during fetal development may change the masculinization of the brain in homosexual men. The concentrations of these chemicals is thought to be influenced by fetal and maternal immune systems, maternal consumption of certain drugs, maternal stress, and direct injection. This hypothesis is also connected to the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order research]].

===Exotic becomes erotic===&lt;!--Linked from 'Daryl Bem'--&gt;
[[Daryl Bem]], a social psychologist at [[Cornell University]], has theorized that the influence of biological factors on sexual orientation may be mediated by experiences in childhood. A child's temperament predisposes the child to prefer certain activities over others. Because of their temperament, which is influenced by biological variables such as genetic factors, some children will be attracted to activities that are commonly enjoyed by other children of the same gender. Others will prefer activities that are typical of another gender. This will make a gender-conforming child feel different from opposite-gender children, while gender-nonconforming children will feel different from children of their own gender. According to Bem, this feeling of difference will evoke psychological arousal when the child is near members of the gender which it considers as being 'different'. Bem theorizes that this psychological arousal will later be transformed into sexual arousal: children will become sexually attracted to the gender which they see as different ("exotic"). This proposal is known as the "exotic becomes erotic" theory.&lt;ref name="Bem"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bem DJ, Herdt G, McClintock M |title=Exotic becomes erotic: interpreting the biological correlates of sexual orientation |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=531–48 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11100261 |doi=10.1023/A:1002050303320 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0004-0002&amp;volume=29&amp;page=531}} [http://dbem.ws/Exotic%20Becomes%20Erotic.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual orientation and evolution==
===General===
Sexual practices that significantly reduce the frequency of heterosexual intercourse also significantly decrease the chances of successful reproduction, and for this reason, they would appear to be [[adaptation|maladaptive]] in an [[evolution]]ary context following a simple Darwinian model (competition amongst individuals) of natural selection—on the assumption that homosexuality would reduce this frequency.  Several theories have been advanced to explain this contradiction, and new experimental evidence has demonstrated their feasibility.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre F, Estep KW 1993 223-33"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0303-2647(93)90051-D |vauthors=MacIntyre F, Estep KW |title=Sperm competition and the persistence of genes for male homosexuality |journal=BioSystems |volume=31 |issue=2–3 |pages=223–33 |year=1993 |pmid=8155854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars&lt;ref name="MacIntyre F, Estep KW 1993 223-33"/&gt; have suggested that homosexuality is indirectly adaptive, by conferring a reproductive advantage in a non-obvious way on heterosexual siblings or their children. By way of analogy, the [[allele]] (a particular version of a gene) which causes [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anemia]] when two copies are present, also confers resistance to [[malaria]] with a lesser form of [[anemia]] when one copy is present (this is called [[heterozygous advantage]]).&lt;ref name="swars"&gt;Baker, Robin (1996) Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex, p.241 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have also pointed out that Darwin himself described [[kin selection]] in [[The Origin of Species]], so under a Darwinian model of evolution, not only individuals, but family groups (bloodlines) can compete for selection.

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295 |title=Gender bending |journal=The Economist|date=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them". Their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zietsch, B. |author2=Morley, K. |author3=Shekar, S. |author4=Verweij, K. |author5=Keller, M. |author6=Macgregor, S. |date=November 2008 |title=Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=424–433 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.07.002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the same study, the authors noted that "nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing "social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way" (and thus seek out a greater number of sexual partners) as an example of one alternative explanation. Also, the authors of the study acknowledge that a large number of sexual partners may not lead to greater reproductive success, specifically noting there is an "absence of evidence relating the number of sexual partners and actual reproductive success, either in the present or in our evolutionary past".

The heterosexual advantage hypothesis was given strong support by the 2004 Italian study demonstrating increased [[fecundity]] in the female matrilineal relatives of gay men.&lt;ref name="Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="camperio08"/&gt;  As originally pointed out by Hamer,&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, D., Copeland, P. The Science of Desire: The Search for the Gay Gene and the Biology of Behavior (Simon and Schuster, 1994) {{ISBN|0-684-80446-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; even a modest increase in reproductive capacity in females carrying a "gay gene" could easily account for its maintenance at high levels in the population.&lt;ref name="camperio08"/&gt;

===Gay uncle hypothesis===
The "gay uncle hypothesis" posits that people who themselves do not have children may nonetheless increase the prevalence of their family's genes in future generations by providing resources (e.g., food, supervision, defense, shelter) to the offspring of their closest relatives.

This hypothesis is an extension of the theory of [[kin selection]], which was originally developed to explain apparent altruistic acts which seemed to be maladaptive. The initial concept was suggested by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1932 and later elaborated by many others including [[John Maynard Smith]], [[W. D. Hamilton]] and [[Mary Jane West-Eberhard]].&lt;ref name="Mayr 1982"&gt;Mayr, E. (1982). ''The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p 598.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was also used to explain the patterns of certain social insects where most of the members are non-reproductive.

Vasey and VanderLaan (2010) tested the theory on the Pacific island of Samoa, where they studied women, straight men, and the fa'afafine, men who prefer other men as sexual partners and are accepted within the culture as a distinct third gender category. Vasey and VanderLaan found that the fa'afafine said they were significantly more willing to help kin, yet much less interested in helping children who aren't family, providing the first evidence to support the kin selection hypothesis.&lt;ref name="uleth.ca"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/handle/10133/3159 | title=The development and evolution of male androphilia in Samoan fa'afafine| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2010/02/05/study-supports-gay-super-uncles-theory | title=Study Supports Gay Super Uncles Theory| date=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis is consistent with other studies on homosexuality, which show that it is more prevalent amongst both siblings and twins.&lt;ref name="uleth.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} Since both twins and non-twin siblings share genes and therefore have a higher factor of genetic redundancy, there is less genetic familial risk if the strategy is expressed. It is speculated that environmental and hormonal stress factors (linked to resource feedbacks) may act as triggers.

Since the hypothesis solves the problem of why homosexuality has not been selected out over thousands of years, despite it being antithetical to reproduction, many scientists consider it the best explanatory model for non-heterosexual behaviour such as homosexuality and bisexuality. The natural bell curve variation that occurs in biology and sociology everywhere, explains the variable spectrum of expression.

Vasal and VanderLaan (2011) provides evidence that if an adaptively designed avuncular male androphilic phenotype exists and its development is contingent on a particular social environment, then a collectivistic cultural context is insufficient, in and of itself, for the expression of such a phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s10508-011-9763-z|pmid = 21656333|title = Sexual Orientation in Men and Avuncularity in Japan: Implications for the Kin Selection Hypothesis|journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume = 41|issue = 1|pages = 209–215|year = 2011|last1 = Vasey|first1 = Paul L|last2 = Vanderlaan|first2 = Doug P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the study caution that any interpretation of this finding must take into account that the group difference in brain activation between heterosexual men and homosexual men in the amygdala region is not large and that the most robust finding is that both heterosexual and homosexual men used the same areas when they reacted to sexually preferred stimuli. "For the most part, homosexual and heterosexual men showed very similar patterns of activation (albeit to different erotic stimuli). One possible exception was the amygdala, in which homosexual men showed greater activational differences between preferred and nonpreferred erotic stimuli compared with heterosexual men. However, this difference was not hypothesized a priori, was not large, and was the only group difference found out of many tested. Thus, this finding needs replication."(Debra A.

==Political aspects==
{{Main|LGBT social movements|LGBT rights opposition}}
Whether genetic or other physiological determinants form the basis of sexual orientation is a highly politicized issue. ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', a U.S. gay and lesbian newsmagazine, reported in 1996 that 61% of its readers believed that "it would mostly help gay and lesbian rights if homosexuality were found to be biologically determined".&lt;ref&gt;The Advocate (1996, February 6). Advocate Poll Results. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-national study in the [[United States]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Sweden]] found that those who believed that "homosexuals are born that way" held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuality than those who believed that "homosexuals choose to be that way" or "learn to be that way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ernulf KE, Innala SM, Whitam FL |title=Biological explanation, psychological explanation, and tolerance of homosexuals: a cross-national analysis of beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychol Rep |volume=65 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=1003–10 |date=December 1989 |pmid=2608821 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1989.65.3.1003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitley B. E.

[[Equal Protection Clause|Equal protection]] analysis in U.S. law determines when government requirements create a “suspect classification" of groups and therefore eligible for heightened [[strict scrutiny|scrutiny]] based on several factors, one of which is [[Immutable characteristic|immutability]].

Evidence that sexual orientation is biologically determined (and therefore perhaps immutable in the legal sense) would strengthen the legal case for heightened scrutiny of laws discriminating on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;Balog, Kari (2005–2006) "Equal Protection for Homosexuals: Why the Immutability Argument is Necessary and How it is Met.", Cleveland St. L. Rev. 545–573.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Is Sexuality Immutable?", Margaret Talbot, The New Yorker, January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0125/Prop.-8-trial-defenders-of-gay-marriage-ban-make-their-case |title=Prop. 8 trial: defenders of gay-marriage ban make their case |journal=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=27 January 2010 |date=2010-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived causes of sexual orientation have a significant bearing on the status of sexual minorities in the eyes of social conservatives. The [[Family Research Council]], a [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] [[think tank]] in Washington, D.C., argues in the book ''Getting It Straight'' that finding people are born gay "would advance the idea that sexual orientation is an innate characteristic, like race; that homosexuals, like African-Americans, should be legally protected against 'discrimination;' and that disapproval of homosexuality should be as socially stigmatized as racism. However, it is not true." On the other hand, some [[social conservatives]] such as Reverend Robert Schenck have argued that people can accept any scientific evidence while still morally opposing homosexuality.&lt;ref name=neil&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/14/what_makes_people_gay/ What Makes People Gay?] By Neil Swidey. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. Published August 14, 2005. Accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Organization for Marriage]] board member and fiction writer [[Orson Scott Card]] has supported biological research on homosexuality, writing that "our scientific efforts in regard to homosexuality should be to identify genetic and uterine causes... so that the incidence of this dysfunction can be minimized.... [However, this should not be seen] as an attack on homosexuals, a desire to 'commit genocide' against the homosexual community.... There is no 'cure' for homosexuality because it is not a disease. There are, however, different ways of living with homosexual desires."&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mormontimes.com/content/single/10235 |title=Science on gays falls short |publisher=[[Deseret Morning News]] |date=August 7, 2008 |last=Card |first=Orson Scott |accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advocates for the rights of sexual minorities resist linking that cause with the concept that sexuality is biologically determined or fixed at birth. They argue that sexual orientation can shift over the course of a person's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queerbychoice.com/myths.html Myths About Queer by Choice People]. [http://www.queerbychoice.com/ Queer by Choice]. Accessed March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, others resist any attempts to pathologise or medicalise 'deviant' sexuality, and choose to fight for acceptance in a moral or social realm.&lt;ref name=neil/&gt; [[Chandler Burr]] has stated that "[s]ome, recalling earlier psychiatric "treatments" for homosexuality, discern in the biological quest the seeds of genocide. They conjure up the specter of the surgical or chemical "rewiring" of gay people, or of abortions of fetal homosexuals who have been hunted down in the womb."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199706/homosexuality-biology/4 Homosexuality and Biology]. By Chandler Burr. ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; LeVay has said in response to letters from gays and lesbians making such criticisms that the research "has contributed to the status of gay people in society".&lt;ref name=neil/&gt;

The '''campaign for the neologism "santorum"''' started with a contest held in May 2003 by [[Dan Savage]], a sex columnist and [[LGBT rights]] activist. Savage asked his readers to create a definition for the word "santorum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = And Then There's This: How Stories Live and Die in Viral Culture| last=Wasik| first=Bill| publisher = Viking Adult; First Edition|year = 2009| page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cLCHP91oR_MC&amp;pg=PT64&amp;dq=Dan+Savage+creates+Santorum+contest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6U5MT5KnEJLZiAKO4JSCDw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Dan%20Savage%20creates%20Santorum%20contest&amp;f=false]| isbn=978-0-670-02084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sl031503/&gt; in response to then-U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality]], and comments about [[same sex marriage]]. In his comments, Santorum had stated that "[i]n every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be."&lt;ref name="Corvino2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corvino|first=John|title=What's Wrong with Homosexuality?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjJPBF7sm5EC&amp;pg=PP120|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=2013-01-04|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199323913|pages=120–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage announced the winning entry, which defined "santorum" as "the frothy mixture of [[Personal lubricant|lube]] and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex". He created a web site, ''spreadingsantorum.com'' (and ''santorum.com''), to promote the definition, which became a top internet search result, displacing the senator's official website on many [[Web search engines|search engines]], including [[Google]], [[Yahoo!

In 2010 Savage said he would take the site down if Santorum donated US$5 million plus interest to [[Freedom to Marry]], a group advocating legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]]s.&lt;ref name="MotherJones" /&gt; In September 2011 Santorum asked [[Google]] to remove the definition from its search engine index. Google refused, responding that the company does not remove content from search results [[Censorship by Google|except in very limited circumstances]].&lt;ref name="Burns" /&gt;

==Santorum's comments on homosexuality==
{{main|Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality}}
In an interview with the Associated Press on {{#formatdate:April 7, 2003}}, Santorum said there is a relationship between the [[Catholic Church sex abuse scandal]] and [[liberalism]] and [[relativism]]. He argued that [[moral relativism]] involves accepting any adult consensual behavior in the privacy of people's homes, even if the behavior might otherwise be considered deviant. Santorum believes this attitude leads to an unhealthy culture.&lt;ref name=USATodayApril232003/&gt;

Santorum said that, while he had no problem with homosexuality, he did have a problem with homosexual acts, "as I would with acts of other, what I would consider to be, acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships. And that includes a variety of different acts, not just homosexual." He continued: &lt;blockquote&gt;We have laws in states, like the [[Lawrence v Texas|one at the Supreme Court right now]], that has [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]] and they were there for a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family.

Santorum said he was arguing against any relationship other than marriage between a man and a woman, the basis in his view of a stable society: "That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be."&lt;ref name=USATodayApril232003/&gt;

On {{#formatdate:April 25, 2003}}, in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[op-ed]], Savage responded to Santorum's comments, arguing that the remarks amounted to an overt [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] appeal to [[homophobia|homophobic]] voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Savage |first=Dan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/25/opinion/gop-hypocrisy.html |title=G.O.P.

Savage set up a website, ''spreadingsantorum.com'', to spread awareness of the term;&lt;ref name=Brewer/&gt; the site features the definition over a brown splattered stain on an otherwise-white page. Savage also set up another website, ''santorum.com'', that displays the same content. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported in July 2006 that the site appeared at the top of a Google search for Santorum's name. When asked whether he was concerned about the effect on Santorum's children, Savage responded that gays and lesbians also have children, who are required to listen to comparisons of gay relationships to [[incest]] and [[Zoophilia|bestiality]]. He also said, "The only people who come at me wringing their hands about Santorum's children are idiot [[Left-wing politics|lefties]] who don't get how serious the [[Right-wing politics|right]] is about destroying us."&lt;ref name=Spikol&gt;{{cite news |last=Spikol |first=Liz |url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/38419699.html |title=Savage Politics |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Weekly]] |date=October 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131145524/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/38419699.html |archivedate=January 31, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage offered in May 2010 to remove the site if Santorum donated $5 million to Freedom to Marry, an advocacy group for [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name=MotherJones&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mencimer |first=Stephanie |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/08/rick-santorum-google-problem-dan-savage |title=Rick Santorum's Anal Sex Problem |journal=Mother Jones |issn=0362-8841 |date=September–October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephanie Mencimer wrote in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' in 2010 that "some observers even suggested [the neologism] may have contributed to" Santorum's 2006 defeat by [[Bob Casey, Jr.|Bob Casey]].&lt;ref name=MotherJones/&gt; Savage had attempted to contribute $2,100 to Casey's campaign, but the donation was returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Budoff |first=Carrie |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/15130708.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906031529/http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/15130708.htm |archivedate=September 6, 2006 |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |title=No thanks, Casey donor told |date=July 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noam Cohen of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the situation as a [[page hijacking|hijacking]] of online identity.

|issn=0362-4331 |date=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue resurfaced during the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 presidential primaries]] in which Santorum was a candidate. A commentary in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' suggested a difficulty in avoiding [[double entendre]]s when writing about Santorum because of Savage's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heer |first=Jeet |title=Can Rick Santorum become U.S. president if his name isn’t even safe for kids to Google? |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/can-rick-santorum-become-us-president-if-his-name-isnt-even-safe-for-kids-to-google/article2294581/ |accessdate=January 7, 2012 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=January 6, 2012 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santorum's reaction===
Santorum discussed the issue in a February 2011 interview with ''[[Roll Call]]'': "It's one guy. You know who it is. The Internet allows for this type of vulgarity to circulate. It's unfortunate that we have someone who obviously has some issues.

After announcing he might stand for the 2012 presidential nomination, he told ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' in April 2011 that he had not hired anyone to help move Savage's website lower in search results, but hoped his possible run for president would shift his own site to the top organically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moody |first=Chris |url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/04/28/santorum-says-he-has-no-plans-to-fix-his-google-problem |title=Santorum says he has no plans to fix his 'Google problem' |work=[[The Daily Caller]] |date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 2011 interview, Santorum said, "There are foul people out there who do horrible things. It's unfortunate some people thought it would be a big joke to make fun of my name. That comes with the territory."&lt;ref name="RawStory06-09-11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rawstory.com/rawreplay/2011/06/santorum-hopes-google-will-do-something-about-filth-on-the-internet/ |title=Santorum hopes Google will do something about 'filth on the Internet' |author=David Edwards |date=June 9, 2011 |publisher=[[The Raw Story]] |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Google-bombing==
''The New York Times'' reported in 2004 that people had tried to use [[Google bomb]]s to link the names of several American politicians, including George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Rick Santorum, to what it called "unprintable phrases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNichol |first=Tom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/22/technology/circuits/22goog.html |title=Your Message Here |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloggers linking to ''Spreading Santorum'' caused it to rise in Google's rankings.&lt;ref name=MotherJones/&gt;

In 2010, Michael Fertik of [[ReputationDefender]] (now ''Reputation.com''), a company to help people influence their Web presence, described the search engine issue as "devastating" and said it was "one of the more creative and salient Google issues" he had ever seen.&lt;ref name=MotherJones/&gt; Mark Skidmore of [[Blue State Digital]] said Santorum would find it difficult to shift Savage's site, because Savage had over 13,000 inbound links against 5,000 for Santorum's own site.&lt;ref name=MotherJones/&gt; Chris Wilson in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described the situation as a "classic 'Google bomb'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Wilson |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2298206/ |title=Lube Job: Should Google associate Rick Santorum's name with anal sex? |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santorum's request for intervention by Google===
When asked in June 2011 whether [[Google]] should step in to prevent the definition appearing so prominently under searches for his name, Santorum said they should intervene only if they would normally do so in this kind of circumstance.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rick Santorum"/&gt; In September 2011 Santorum asked Google to intervene by altering the indexing of the content, saying, "If you're a responsible business, you don't let things like that happen in your business that have an impact on the country...To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle but I suspect that's not true."&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63952.html |title=Rick Santorum contacted Google, says company spreads 'filth' |first=Alexander |last=Burns |work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Santorum's request, a Google spokesperson asserted that Google does not "remove content from our search results, except in very limited cases such as illegal content and violations of our webmaster guidelines."&lt;ref name="Burns" /&gt;

According to [[Talking Points Memo]] (TPM), "Google did crack down" on google-bombing in the past.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; In an interview with TPM, search engine expert [[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]] stated that Santorum mischaracterized the campaign as a "Google bomb", when it was actually a relevant use of the search query ''santorum'' to create "a new definition for the word".&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; Sullivan argued that, in a Google bomb, pranksters persuade Google's algorithm to send the wrong results for a certain term (e.g., when pranksters caused the search term "[[miserable failure]]" to point to the Bush [[White House]] website's [[George W.

In Santorum's case, on the other hand, the term "santorum" still points to a web page about a "santorum"—which happens to be Savage's neologism instead of the Senator from Pennsylvania.

A '''catena''' (from Latin ''catena'', a chain) is a form of biblical commentary, verse by verse, made up entirely of excerpts from earlier [[Biblical commentator]]s, each introduced with the name of the author, and with such minor adjustments of words to allow the whole to form a continuous commentary.

The texts are mainly compiled from mainstream authors, but they often contain fragments of certain [[patristic]] writings now otherwise lost.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). [[Cf.]] Holl, Fragmente vornikänischer Kirchenväter, Leipzig, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been asserted by [[Faulhaber]] that half of all the commentaries on scripture composed by the church Fathers are now extant only in this form.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). See Catholic Encyclopedia article's bibliography listed in the reference section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest Greek catena is ascribed to [[Procopius of Gaza]], in the first part of the sixth century.  Between the seventh and the tenth centuries [[Andreas Presbyter]] and [[Johannes Drungarius]] are the compilers of catenas to various Books of Scripture.  Towards the end of the eleventh century [[Nicetas of Heraclea]] produces a great number of catenae. Both before and after, however, the makers of catenae were numerous in the Greek Orient, mostly anonymous, and offering no other indication of their personality than the manuscripts of their excerpts. Similar compilations were also made in the Syriac and Coptic Churches.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Wright, de Lagarde, Martin, in Krumbacher, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, [[Primasius of Adrumentum]] in the former Roman province of Africa in the sixth century compiled the first catena from Latin commentators. He was imitated by [[Rhabanus Maurus]] (d. 865), [[Paschasius Radbertus]], and [[Walafrid Strabo]], later by [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (d. 900), and by [[Lanfranc of Canterbury]] (d. 1089). The Western catenae have had less importance attached to them. The most famous of the medieval Latin compilations of this kind is that of [[Thomas Aquinas]], generally known as the ''Catena aurea'' (Golden chain) and containing excerpts from some eighty Greek and Latin commentators on the Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Ed. J. Nicolai, Paris, 1869, 3 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas composed the parts of his ''Catena aurea'' treating the gospels of Mark, Luke, and John while directing the Roman ''studium'' of the [[Dominican Order]] at the convent of [[Santa Sabina]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].&lt;ref&gt;Torrell, 161 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar collections of Greek patristic utterances were constructed for dogmatic purposes. They were used at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, at the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth General Council]] in 553, also apropos of [[Iconoclasm]] in the [[Seventh General Council]] in 787; and among the Greeks such compilations, like the exegetical catenae, did not cease until late in the Middle Ages. The oldest of these dogmatic compilations, attributed to the latter part of the seventh century, is the "Antiquorum Patrum doctrina de Verbi incarnatione".&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Edited by [[Cardinal Mai]] in Scriptor. Vet. nova collectio, Rome, 1833, VII, i, 1-73; cf. [[Loofs]], Leontius von Byzanz, Leipzig, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, in response to homiletic and practical needs, there appeared, previous to the tenth century, a number of collections of moral sentences and paraenetic fragments, partly from Scripture and partly from the more famous ecclesiastical writers; sometimes one writer (e.g. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Basil the Great]], especially [[John Chrysostom]] whom all the catenae-makers pillage freely) furnishes the material. Such collections are not so numerous as the Scriptural or even the dogmatic catenae. They seem all to depend on an ancient Christian "Florilegium" of the sixth century, that treated, in three books, of God, Man, the Virtues and Vices, and was known as τα ιερά (Sacred Things). Before long its material was recast in strict alphabetical order; took the name of τα ιερά parállela, "Sacra Parallela" (because in the third book a virtue and a vice had been regularly opposed to one another); and was attributed widely to [[John Damascene]],&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Migne, ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', XCV, 1040-1586; XCVI, 9-544.&lt;/ref&gt; whose authority was defended (against Loofs, [[Paul Wendland|Wendland]], and Cohn) by [[K. Holl]] in the above-mentioned "Fragmente vornikänischer Kirchenväter" (Leipzig, 1899), though the Damascene probably based his work on the "Capita theologica" of [[Maximus Confessor]]. The text of these ancient compilations is often in a dubious state, and the authors of most of them are unknown; one of the principal difficulties in their use is the uncertainty concerning the correctness of the names to which the excerpts are attributed. The carelessness of copyists, the use of "[[sigla]]", contractions for proper names, and the frequency of transcription, led naturally to much confusion.

==Printed editions==

From the sixteenth century to the nineteenth, various catenas were published.  However no modern editions exist, and there are severe textual problems in editing them.

Among the editors of Greek catenae was the Jesuit [[Balthasar Cordier]], who published (1628–47) collections of Greek patristic commentaries on St. John and St. Luke and, in conjunction with his confrère [[Possin]], on St. Matthew; the latter scholar edited also (1673) similar collections of patristic excerpts on St. Mark and Job. The voluminous catenae known as ''Biblia Magna'' (Paris, 1643) and ''Biblia Maxima'' (Paris, 1660), edited by [[J. de la Haye]], were followed by the nine volumes of ''[[Critici Sacri|Critici Sacri, sive clarissimorum virorum annotationes atque tractatus in biblia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Edited by Pearson, London, 1660; Amsterdam, 1695-1701&lt;/ref&gt; containing selections, not only from Catholic but also from Protestant commentators. 

An important collection of the Greek catenae on the New Testament is that of [[J. A. Cramer]] (Oxford, 1838–44), online at archive.org. See also the twenty-eight volumes of the [[Migne]] commentary in his "Scripturae sacrae cursus completus" (Paris, 1840–45).

For the Byzantine collections of ethical sentences and proverbs of ([[Stobaeus]] Maximus Confessor, [[Antonius Melissa]], [[Johannes Georgides]], [[Macarius]], [[Michael Apostolios]]) partly from Christian and partly from pagan sources, see [[Krumbacher]], pp.&amp;nbsp;600–4, also {{cite|last=[[Anton Elter|Elter]]|first=E.|title=De Gnomologiorum Graecorum historii atque origine|place=Bonn|year=1893}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13032">The '''Center for Research, Evaluation and Awareness of Dyslexia''' ('''''Center for READing''''') is a university-based program at [[Pittsburg State University]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas]]. It was established in 1996 to:

* develop strategies for the prevention and remediation of reading disabilities
* search for strategies that will lead to the improvement of remedial processes
* provide educators and parents with current and appropriate knowledge regarding reading/learning disabilities
* provide interdisciplinary evaluations of readers of all ages
* promote the concerns relevant to reading disabilities
* educate the general public regarding issues pertaining to reading/learning disabilities

== Programs offered at the ''Center for READing'' ==
===Identification and Intervention Program===
The Identification and Intervention Program (IIP) is based on two decades worth of research and is the oldest of the programs offered at the ''CARRD''.  The purpose of the IIP is to identify children who are at-risk of developing a [[reading disability]], also referred to as [[dyslexia]], as soon as possible and then to provide those children with an appropriate remediation that will help them gain the fundamental skills needed to become competent readers. 

The IIP is used in school systems. It identifies students in the beginning of first grade who are at-risk of developing [[Reading (process)|reading]] difficulties and then provides them with a research-based reading tutoring program.

===After School and Summer Program===
The After School and Summer Program (ASSP) provides individuals with one-on-one remedial phonological and reading instruction. The ASSP serves individuals from four years of age through adult.

The first step of the ASSP is assessment. The individual is assessed in order to determine specific strengths and weaknesses in regards to basic phonological processing skills. Attentional abilities are also assessed in order to determine if attentional difficulties may be compounding the issue. Once the assessment is complete and the results are analyzed by the CARRD, a training program is constructed to aid the individual in improving deficient skills. The training program typically involves twice weekly tutoring sessions.

For school-aged children, utilizing the ASSP during the summer can be a great opportunity for the student to enhance phonological processing and reading skills during a time that students typically make minimal academic gains. 

One of the main goals of the ASSP is to help individuals gain [[phonological awareness]]. The program aims to close the gap between students who are weak in phonological processing and reading skills and those who are excellent readers. In addition to one-on-one tutoring through the ASSP, parents are encouraged to assist their children at home by practicing skill-building exercises together.

===On-line Reading Screening===
The '''Reading Screening''' is a web-based evaluation used to identify children between the ages of 5 and 12 years who are at-risk for developing or are currently experiencing reading difficulties. The [http://www.readingscreening.org Reading Screening] has been used in school systems for the past 15 years and is now available online to parents, teachers, and other professionals. With 15-20% of our nation's children experiencing reading problems or dyslexia, the best way to help is to begin to understand the nature of the individual’s reading difficulties. The '''Reading Screening''' provides understanding by identifying the child’s strengths and weaknesses with regard to reading. Once the  assessment has been completed, the website generates a ''Summary of Assessment'', which outlines the areas of reading that are creating the most difficulties for the child. The ''Summary of Assessment'' report can be shared with school personnel to plan an appropriate intervention, if intervention is necessary.

==Problem, Impact and Philosophy==
===Problem===
Estimates show that approximately 15 to 20% of our nation's children have reading difficulties. These children have the ability to learn to read, but have a specific skill deficit that prevents them from accomplishing this important task. Research indicates that most reading disabled children have a deficiency in phonological processing skills. The IIP was designed to identify and remediate this deficit before it handicaps the child's ability to learn to read.

===Impact===
The IIP is geared toward children who have the intellectual ability to learn to read, but find the process very difficult or impossible. Children with reading difficulties are at-risk for dropping out of school, parental abuse, poor self-esteem, and are more likely to find their way into the welfare and criminal justice systems. The future of a child with reading difficulties seems to be fairly bleak in our service-oriented society. To be successful in our society, one must not only know how to read, but also do it fairly well. 

The vast majority of children with [[learning disabilities]] have reading disabilities as their major deficiency. In fact, many children who are considered learning disabled because of other obstacles also have reading difficulties. In addition, as a member of our ever increasingly complex society, a society in which employment requires literacy, a student who does not graduate from high school, and who has poor reading skills, is likely to be doomed to extremely poor economic realities. 

The eventual cost to society for what might be a preventable difficulty is high. It is imperative that we begin using scientifically generated programs to remediate educational problems. Through the Center for READing, beginning first graders in the Pittsburg, Kansas area are assessed with the 'IIP' and are then provided with the intervention designed to eliminate the barriers that are preventing them from becoming good readers. The impact of the 'IIP' on improving the phonological processing skills of children at-risk for reading disabilities is far reaching. It may be possible to prevent thousands of children from ever experiencing learning and reading disabilities. Although the prevention of learning and reading disabilities is important in its own right, several social problems mentioned above may also be prevented in the process.

===Philosophy===
As mentioned above, individuals who use the ''ASSP'' are initially provided with an assessment. This assessment includes the ''Reading Screening'', an assessment of intelligence ([[IQ test]]), an attentional assessment (including both a parent check-list and the [[TOVA]] test), an auditory screening, and information concerning the individual's medical, developmental, and educational history. When assessing reading difficulties, it is ''imperative'' that the individual receive evaluation in not only reading skills, but also attentional abilities. An individual who is experiencing reading difficultis may be hampered by an attentional difficulty ([[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]]; ADHD). It is also true that an individual who displays behaviors consistent with ADHD might actually be experiencing reading difficulties.

As an example, a student learning to read must use considerable cognitive resources and effort to decode print. If that child has poor phonological processing skills and is deficient in decoding, their behavior might look like ADHD when they in fact have reading difficulties. On the other hand, a student with ADHD might not be able to use cognitive resources to decode print due to ADHD. As a result, their behavior might resemble reading difficulties when the true deficiency is ADHD. An individual being assessed at the ''CARRD'' is assessed on several dimensions to gain complete understanding of the individual's strengths and weaknesses.

'''Closed-loop communication''' is a [[communication]] technique used to avoid misunderstandings. When the sender gives a message, the receiver repeats this back. The sender then confirms the message; thereby common is using the word “''yes''”. When the receiver incorrectly repeats the message back, the sender will say “negative” (or something similar) and then repeat the correct message. If the sender (person giving the message) does not get a reply back, she must repeat it until the receiver starts closing the loop. To get the attention of the receiver, the sender can use the receiver's name or functional position, touch his or her shoulder, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5080">'''Confidence weighting (CW)''' is concerned with measuring two variables: (1) what a respondent believes is a correct answer to a question and (2) what degree of certainty the respondent has toward the correctness of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebel|first=R. L.|title=Confidence Weighting and Test Reliability|journal=Journal of Educational Measurement|year=1965|volume=2|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1965.tb00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Confidence weighting'' when applied to a specific answer selection for a particular test or exam question is referred to in the literature from [[cognitive psychology]] as item-specific confidence, a term typically used by researchers who investigate metamemory or [[metacognition]], comprehension monitoring, or feeling-of-knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lundeberg|first=M.|author2=Fox, P. W. |author3=Puncochaf, J. |title=Highly Confident but Wrong: Gender Differences and Similarities in Confidence Judgments|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1994|volume=86|issue=1|pages=114–121|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.86.1.114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Item-specific confidence is defined as calibrating the relationship between an objective performance of accuracy (e.g., a test answer selection) with the subjective measure of confidence, (e.g., a numeric value assigned to the selection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=D. J.|title=Handbook of Metacognition in Education|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=222–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on self-confidence and metacognition during test taking (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleitman|first=S.|author2=Stankov, L.|title=Ecological and Person-Oriented Aspects of Metacognitive Processes in Test-Taking|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2005|volume=15|issue=3|pages=321–341|doi=10.1002/acp.705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleitman|first=S.|author2=Stankov, L.|title=Self-confidence and metacognitive processes|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=17|issue=2|pages=161–173|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2007.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have used item-specific confidence as a way to assess the accuracy and confidence underlying knowledge judgments.

Researchers outside of the field of cognitive psychology have used confidence weighting as applied to item-specific judgments in assessing alternative conceptions of difficult concepts in high school biology and physics (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odom|first=A. L.|author2=Barrow, L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8334">'''Counterurbanization''', or '''de-urbanization''', is a [[demographic]] and [[social]] process whereby people move from [[urban area]]s to [[rural area]]s. It is, like [[suburbanization]], inversely related to [[urbanization]]. It first occurred as a reaction to inner-city deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/451/1/13 | doi=10.1177/000271628045100103| title=Urbanization and Counterurbanization in the United States| journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science| volume=451| pages=13–20| year=1980| last1=Berry| first1=Brian J.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has documented the social and political drivers of counterurbanization and its impacts in developing countries such as China, which are currently undergoing the process of mass urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen and Malcolm Chapman. (2010) 'Chinese Consumers: The Romantic Reappraisal’. Ethnography, Sept 2010, 11, 331-357.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the causes that can lead to [[shrinking cities]].

Counterurbanization is the process by which people migrate from urban to rural communities, the opposite of [[urbanization]]. People have moved from urban to rural communities for various reasons, including job opportunities and simpler licensed. In recent years, due to technology, this process has been occurring in reverse. With new communications technology, people from rural communities can [[work from home]] because they can connect with each other via [[rural Internet]], which means some employment opportunities no longer require moving to an urban community.&lt;ref name="Science Daily"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090924093553.htm Science Daily]&lt;/ref&gt; Counterurbanization is about people being able to explore alternatives to living in the city, creating changes in living location preferences.&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Counterurbanization"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nefedova|first1=T.G.|title=Urbanization, Counterurbanization, and Rural-Urban Communities Facing Growing Horizontal Mobility|journal=Sociological Research|date=May 2016|volume=55|issue=3|page=195 |doi=10.1080/10610154.2016.1245570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In past years, a multi-corporation business would use [[outsourcing]] by hiring workers in poorer countries for cheap labor. In more recent years, corporations have been using "rural sourcing which involves using small to medium sized town as a source of labor.  This creates jobs in the country and also for rural communities so they do not need to move their entire family to a whole new setting and also reduces unnecessary expense for the companies. Most of the workers in these rural settings get paid less but have an option of either working from home or an office. If they were in an urban setting, the company would spend more money on an entirely new office for the urban based employees to work at.&lt;ref name="Science Daily"/&gt;

In the past, the general migration trend in the [[United States]] has been from the east to the west. Art Hall, an executive director of the Centre for Applied Economics at the [[University of Kansas School of Business]] states "[[California]] has been losing people for at least a decade ... two patterns of migration are under way in [[California]]. People are leaving the coast and moving to the Northern interior. When they leave, they tend to go places like Arizona and Nevada. So it's not a far move. And they also are going up north to [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. Part of the answer there is that it's just very expensive to live on the California coast."&lt;ref name="phys.org"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://phys.org/news172991755.html | title=Study uncovers 'de-urbanization' of America (w/ Video)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hall, people have been influenced to move because of factors like climate, jobs, and tax rates. Hall also found that people who are not a part of a more stable family will tend to move more.&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt; People choosing to live in rural areas have found it more beneficial because of cleaner air, peace and quiet, and lots of space. Smaller towns have also been proven to be convenient for the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Science Daily"/&gt;

Recent data by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) shows that people are moving from big cities with populations over 4 million to much smaller cities with around 1-2 million people.&lt;ref name="Science Daily"/&gt;

The reasons that people are leaving cities for smaller cities is not the same across the globe. For Russia, jobs have not always moved to rural areas to accommodate those who want to leave the city. Rather, people find themselves having two homes, one in the city during work days and one in rural areas for days off. There is a weak infrastructure outside of cities to accommodate people who wish to completely relocate. In 2010, it was found that two-thirds of small towns are depressed, meaning that it has a large working-age population that is unemployed, and businesses are not profitable.&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Counterurbanization"/&gt;

Counterurbanization is different around the globe because there is no universal definition. All definitions vary, but revolve around the central idea of physical movement from a populated location to a less populated location. Clare J.A. Mitchell, an associate professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Waterloo, published that in Europe, counterurbanization is the process of deconcentration of one area to another that is beyond suburbanization or metro decentralization. Australia views counterurbanization as the net migration downwards in a hierarchy.[6] Though many definitions exist, Mitchell states that counterurbanization is a descriptive term that describes a type of migration. Mitchell believes this phenomenon of counterurbanization to be reflective of values and ideology in people’s preferred living style thus taking into consideration not only distance traveled from the urban area but the motive. Mitchel uses the term “exurbanization” that is used in reference to those who reside in the outside perimeters of an urban city who remain closely involved through their social networks and jobs. Exurbanites typically still enjoy the benefits of modern infrastructure. Another term concerning differing motives for traveling or moving away from the city is people who are forced out of the city due to factors such as: the inability to find work, the increased cost of living, or dissatisfaction and/or conflicts with the [[culture]] of urban society. This phenomenon is “displaced urbanization”. Finally, there are those who participate in “antiurbanization”. Typically these people are motivated by a sort of rejection concerning the urban lifestyle and consumer culture. Antiurbanization is an escape for those to choose to leave and forgo the lifestyle and culture of the city. The decisive decision to move away from the city for this type of counterurbanization is usually a step toward spiritual growth and rejection of materialism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nefedova, Pokrovskii, Treivish|first=T.G., N.E., A.I.|title=Urbanization, Counterurbanization, and Rural–Urban Communities Facing Growing Horizontal Mobility|journal=Sociological Research|volume=55|issue=3|pages=195–210|doi=10.1080/10610154.2016.1245570|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical data studies''' is the systematic study of data and its criticisms. The field was named by scholars [[Craig Dalton]] and [[Jim Thatcher]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalton|first1=Craig|last2=Thatcher|first2=Jim|title=What does a Critical Data Studies look like and why do we care?|url=http://societyandspace.org/2014/05/12/what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care-craig-dalton-and-jim-thatcher/#|website=Society + Space|date=12 May 2014|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its naming, significant interest in critical data studies was generated by [[danah boyd]] and [[Kate Crawford]], who posed a set of research questions for the critical study of [[big data]] and its impacts on society and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=boyd|first1=danah|last2=Crawford|first2=Kate|title=Critical questions for Big Data|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|date=10 May 2012|volume=15|issue=5|pages=662–679|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name implies, critical data studies draws heavily on the influence of [[critical theory]] which it applies to the study of [[data]]. Subsequently, others have worked to further solidify a field called critical data studies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iliadis|first=Andrew|last2=Russo|first2=Federica|date=2016-10-17|title=Critical data studies: An introduction|journal=Big Data &amp; Society|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=205395171667423|doi=10.1177/2053951716674238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other key scholars in this discipline include [[Rob Kitchin]] and [[Tracey P. Lauriault]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitchin, Rob, and Tracey P. Lauriault, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kitchin, Rob, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have attempted to make sense of data through different theoretical frameworks, some of which include analyzing data technically, ethically, politically/economically, temporally/spatially, and philosophically.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some of the key academic journals related to critical data studies include the ''[[Journal of Big Data]]'' and ''[[Big Data and Society]]''.

==Motivation==

In their article in which they coin the term 'critical data studies,' Dalton and Thatcher also provide several justifications as to why data studies is a discipline worthy of a critical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Craig, and Jim Thatcher, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, 'big data' is an important aspect of twenty-first century society, and the analysis of 'big data' allows for a deeper understanding of what is happening and for what reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, big data as a technological tool and the information that it yields are not neutral, according to Dalton and Thatcher, making it worthy of critical analysis in order to identify and address its biases. Building off this idea, another justification for a critical approach is that the relationship between big data and society is an important one, and therefore worthy of study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Dalton and Thatcher stress how the relationship is not an example of [[technological determinism]], but rather how big data can shape the lives of individuals. Big data technology can cause significant changes in society's structure and in the everyday lives of people,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and being a product of society, big data technology is worthy of sociological investigation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, data sets are almost never completely raw, that is to say without any influences. Rather, data are shaped by the vision or goals of a research team, and during the data collection process, certain things are quantified, stored, sorted and even discarded by the research team.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Mike|last2=Lupton|first2=Deborah|date=2015-10-13|title=Toward a manifesto for the 'public understanding of big data'|journal=Public Understanding of Science|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=104–116|doi=10.1177/0963662515609005|pmid=26468128|url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/researchrepository/items/0649f4e2-e43e-4e60-b8f7-a5f12801ebcd/1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical approach is thus necessary in order to understand and reveal the intent behind the information being presented.

==Issues and concerns for critical data scholars==

The use of data in modern society brings about new ways of understanding and measuring the world, but also brings with it certain concerns or issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Data scholars attempt to bring some of these issues to light in their quest to be critical of data. Rob Kitchin identifies both technical and organizational issues of data, as well as some normative and ethical questions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Technical and organization issues concerning data range from the scope of datasets, access to the data, the quality of the data, the integration of the data, the application of analytics and ecological fallacies, as well as the skills and organizational capabilities of the research team.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some of the normative and ethical concerns addressed by Kitchin include surveillance through one's data ([[dataveillance]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), the privacy of one's data, the ownership of one's data, the security of one's data, anticipatory or corporate governance, and profiling individuals by their data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All of these concerns must be taken into account by scholars of data in their objective to be critical.

Following in the tradition of critical urban studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brenner | first1 = Neil| title = What is critical urban theory? | journal = City | volume = 13| issue = 2–3| pages = 198–207| doi = 10.1080/13604810902996466 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have raised similar concerns around data and digital information technologies in the urban context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Joe Shaw and Mark Graham | title = Our Digital Rights to the City | url = http://meatspacepress.org/ | website = meatspacepress.org | publisher = Meatspace Press | date = 15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Kate|last2=Finn|first2=Megan|date=2015-08-01|title=The limits of crisis data: analytical and ethical challenges of using social and mobile data to understand disasters|journal=GeoJournal|language=en|volume=80|issue=4|pages=491–502|doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z|issn=0343-2521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickren|first=Graham|date=2016-10-12|title=The global assemblage of digital flow|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=42|issue=2|pages=225–243|language=en|doi=10.1177/0309132516673241}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Joe Shaw and Mark Graham have examined these in light of [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s '[[right to the city]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Joe|last2=Graham|first2=Mark|date=February 2017|title=An Informational Right to the City?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76557">'''Cultivation theory''' examines the long-term effects of [[television]]. "The primary proposition of cultivation theory states that the more time people spend 'living' in the television world, the more likely they are to believe social reality aligns with reality portrayed on television."&lt;ref name="Karyn Riddle"&gt;{{cite conference|author=Riddle, K.|year=2009|title=Cultivation Theory Revisited: The Impact of Childhood Television Viewing Levels on Social Reality Beliefs and Construct Accessibility in Adulthood|type=Conference Papers|publisher=[[International Communication Association]]|pp=1–29|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/9/9/4/5/p299457_index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images and [[ideological]] messages transmitted through popular television media heavily influence perceptions of the real world.

Cultivation theory was founded by [[George Gerbner]] and is [[positivistic]], meaning it assumes the existence of objective reality and value-neutral research.&lt;ref name="wrtl"/&gt; A study conducted by Jennings Bryant and Dorina Miron in 2004, which surveyed almost 2,000 articles published in three top [[mass communication|mass-communication]] journals since 1956, found that Cultivation Theory was the third-most frequently utilized [[theory]], showing that it continues to be one of the most popular theories in mass-communication research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=J.|last2=Mirion|first2=D.|authorlink1=Jennings Bryant|year=2004|title=Theory and research in mass communication|url=|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=54|issue=|pages=662–704|doi=10.1093/joc/54.4.662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Cultivation theory suggests that exposure to media, over time, subtly "cultivates" viewers' perceptions of reality. Gerbner and Gross assert: "Television is a medium of the socialization of most people into standardized roles and behaviors. Its function is in a word, [[enculturation]]".&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt; Within his analysis of cultivation, Gerbner draws attention to three entities—institutions, messages, and publics.&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan"/&gt;

Though most researchers tend to focus on television as it is the most common form of media consumption in the world, Cultivation Theory has been shown to encompass many different forms of media, such as newspapers, film, and even photographs.  This can apply anytime social observation occurs in any form outside a natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, F. (2010). Cultivation effects of a newspaper on reality estimates and explicit and implicit attitudes. Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, And Applications, 22(4), 147-159&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial research on the theory establishes that concern regarding the effects of television on audiences stem from the unprecedented centrality of television in [[American culture]].&lt;ref name="Karyn Riddle"/&gt; Gerbner posited that television as a [[mass medium]] of communication had formed into a common symbolic environment that bound diverse communities together, [[socializing]] people into standardized roles and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Griffin, E.|year=2012|title=Communication Communication Communication|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pp=(8), 366–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thus compared the power of television to that of [[religion]], stating television was to modern society what religion once was in earlier times. Thus, Gerbner's research focused on the larger meaning of heavy [[television consumption]] instead of the meaning behind specific messages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Background==
===Cultural Indicators Project===
Developed by [[George Gerbner]] and Larry Gross in 1976, cultivation theory derived from several large-scale research projects in a comprehensive project entitled Cultural Indicators. The Cultural Indicators Project began as a stand-alone study commissioned by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] for the [[National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence]].&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt; The commission was formed to address issues of violence in American culture; one specific area of interest for the Johnson administration was the effects of [[television violence]] on audiences. Gerbner subsequently began work on the federally funded Cultural Indicators Project at the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School of Communications]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Congress then facilitated the creation of the Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory Committee on Television and Social Behavior in 1972. This new committee funded a number of studies on the effects of television: Gerbner's Cultural Indicators was one of those chosen. Through Gerbner's involvement with Cultural Indicators, he began to produce the Violence Index, a yearly content analysis of prime-time television that would show how violence was portrayed on television, from season to season. This allowed viewers the access to data regarding the frequency of violence in television shows but also raised questions regarding the accuracy of the study and the research hypotheses used. While the Violence Index received criticism, Gerbner and his team updated the Index to make sure that the data being produced was accurately composed, and addressed any criticisms posted. Gerbner's research found that violence was portrayed in prime time more frequently compared to violence in the real world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=West|first=Richard|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|year=2014|isbn=978-0-07-353428-2|location=New York, NY|pages=420–436|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerbner's project came about during an increasing divide between political conservatives and private commercial investors in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Man Who Counts the Killings|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/05/the-man-who-counts-the-killings/376850/|website=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing the task of middleman, Gerbner and his team acted as impartial researchers, examining the effects and implications of television consumption without having any vested political or financial interest in its outcome. This standpoint allotted Gerbner access to a number of grants that continued to fund the Cultural Indicators Project throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt;

==Assumptions==
Cultivation theory holds three core assumptions. The first assumption highlights the medium, the second, the audience, and the final assumption deals with the function of the medium on audiences and their ability to react to it. 
*'''Television is fundamentally different from other forms of [[mass media]].'''&lt;ref name="Gerbner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerbner|first1=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Jackson-Beeck|first3=M.|last4=Jeffries-Fox|first4=S.|last5=Signorielli|first5=N.|year=1978|title=Cultural indicators violence profile no. 9|url=|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=28|issue=3|pages=176–207|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1978.tb01646.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:This first assumption lists the differences between television and other forms of mass media. Television is visual and auditory, and therefore doesn't require viewers to be [[literate]]. It has the potential to be free, aside from the initial cost of obtaining a television (although free access to television is generally quite limited). There are multiple added costs for television viewing, including the necessity of a converter box to access most local television broadcasting and the high monthly fees required for accessing cable television. These costs may prohibit poor and low-income families from viewing television. However, television is still ageless in the sense that anyone from any walk of life can use it, and most importantly, anyone is able to comprehend the content that is broadcast through television. Television programming uses storytelling and engaging narratives to capture people's attention.
:Gerbner, Gross, Morgan, &amp; Signorielli argued that while religion or education had previously been greater influences on social trends, now "[t]elevision is the source of the most broadly shared images and messages in history ...Television cultivates from infancy the very predispositions and preferences that used to be acquired from other primary sources ... The repetitive pattern of television's [[mass-produced]] messages and images forms the mainstream of a common symbolic environment."&lt;ref name="Living"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerbner, G.|author2=Gross, L.|author3=Morgan, M.|author4=Signorielli, N.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1986|chapter=Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process|editor=[[Jennings Bryant|J. Bryant]]|editor2=D. Zillman|title=Perspectives on media effects|pp=17–40|location=Hilldale, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|chapterurl=http://web.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Television has a lower threshold for consumption than print media (because of the need for literacy) and film (because it requires a level of financial capability).&lt;ref name="wrtl" /&gt; According to Gerbner, television has become the "central cultural arm of our society."&lt;ref name="Gerbner" /&gt;

*'''Television shapes the way individuals within society think and relate to each other.'''

:Gerbner and Gross write that "the substance of the consciousness cultivated by TV is not so much specific attitudes and opinions as more basic assumptions about the [[fact]]s of life and standards of judgment on which conclusions are based."&lt;ref name="Living1"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=[[George Gerbner|Gerbner, G.]]|author2=Gross, L.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1972|title= Living with television: The violence profile|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=173–199|pmid=932235|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1976.tb01397.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, the realities created by television are not based on real facts but on speculation. 
:Gerbner observed that television reaches people, on average, more than seven hours a day. Television offers "a centralized system of story-telling".&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cultivation Analysis: An Overview|year=1998|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=1|issue=3–4|pages=175–194|doi=10.1080/15205436.1998.9677855|author1=Gerbner, G.|url=http://web.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerbner asserts that television's major cultural function is to stabilize [[social structure|social patterns]] and to cultivate [[resistance to change]]. We live in terms of the stories we tell and television tells these stories through news, [[drama]], and [[advertising]] to almost everybody most of the time.&lt;ref name="Gerbner" /&gt;
:Cultivation Theory doesn't predict what we will do after watching a violent television program, but rather posits a connection between our worry and fear about a violence-filled world and exposure to violent programming on television.

*'''Television's effects are limited.'''

:Assumption three paradoxically asserts that television is a part of a larger sociocultural system. Therefore, although the effects of watching television may be increased or decrease at any point in time, its effect is consistently present.&lt;ref name="Gerbner" /&gt;
:Gerbner's [[ice age]] analogy states that "just as an average temperature shift of a few degrees can lead to an ice age or the outcomes of elections can be determined by slight margins, so too can a relatively small but pervasive influence make a crucial difference. The size of an effect is far less critical than the direction of its steady contribution."&lt;ref name="Mainstreaming"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerbner|first1=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Morgan|first3=M.|last4=Signorielli|first4=N.|authorlink1=George Gerbner|year=1980|title=The "Mainstreaming" of America: Violence Profile No. 11|url=|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=30|issue=3|pages=10–29|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1980.tb01987.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than focus on the total impact of violent television, this analogy focuses more on the fact that there ''once was or is'' an impact to viewers just through exposure. Gerbner argues that watching television doesn't cause a particular behavior, but instead watching television over time adds up to our perception of the world around us.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Research strategy analyzing the role of the media==
Cultivation differential is the final step in a four-part process that looks at the effects of television on [[society]].&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shanahan|first2=J.|year=2010|title=The State of Cultivation|url=|journal=[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]|volume=54|issue=2|pages=337–355|doi=10.1080/08838151003735018|last1=Morgan|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two steps include institutional process analysis and message system analysis. While cultivation theory focuses on macrosystems of television's influence on society as a whole, the first two steps deal with the creation of media messages and how these messages are portrayed in front of an audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Analysis of Cultivation Theory|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12128/abstract|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|date=1 December 2014|issn=1460-2466|pages=1015–1036|volume=64|issue=6|doi=10.1111/jcom.12128|first=W. James|last=Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Step 1: message system analysis===
The first part of this strategy is known as message system analysis, which has been used since 1967 to track the most stable and recurrent images in media content. Described by Gerbner, Gross, Morgan and Signorielli as a "tool for making systematic, reliable, and cumulative observations about television content", it not only tracks the perceived awareness of an individual about what he or she is viewing on television, but also represents the ongoing collective messages shown on television that shape larger community impressions over an extended period of time. Although information provided through media channels is not always reliable, message system analysis provides a method for characterizing the messages transmitted through television.&lt;ref name="Living"/&gt;

"Based on message system analyses, cultivation researchers develop hypotheses about what people would think about various aspects of ''[[reality]]'' if everything they knew about some issue or [[phenomenon]] were derived from television's dominant portrayals."&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan" /&gt; This step entails creating a detailed content analysis on the consistent images, themes, and messages in any one particular show.

Another facet of the message-system analysis Gerbner discovered was something Griffin called "equal violence, unequal risk." The research Gerbner conducted showed that the amount of [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|violence portrayed in media]] stayed consistent, but the distribution of that violence was never equal. The children and the elderly, for example, are more common recipients of violence than young or middle-aged adults. Gerbner often discovered trends in violence toward minority groups, with [[African American]]s and [[Hispanic]]s being the recipients of violence more often than [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]; two other [[demographics]] that experienced similar inequality were women and "[[blue-collar]]" workers. Griffin wrote: "The ironic result of this tendency is that the demographics shown, inaccurately, to be more in danger of violence than the rest are the demographics that will walk away from the media more afraid of violence.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

===Step 2: questions regarding viewers' social realities===
The second part of this process focuses on people's feelings about their day-to-day lives to gain a larger understanding of how they perceive their realities. Findings from the message system analysis process guide researchers to formulate questions about social reality for the subjects of a study (in this case, television viewers).&lt;ref name="Living1"/&gt;

===Step 3: surveying the audience===

The third part of this process brings Step 2 into action: asking audience participants questions about their understanding of their lives, and surveying [[television consumption]] levels. After questions are formulated based on social reality, Gerbner and Gross explain that, "To each of these questions there is a "television answer", which is like the way things appear in the world of television, and another and different answer which is biased in the opposite direction, closer to the way things are in the observable world".&lt;ref name="Living1"/&gt; These questions are then used to evaluate detailed characteristics of the participants under evaluation. Measurement items include the breadth of television consumption, habitual characteristics relating to television, and the social, economic, and political makeup of the participants.

===Step 4: cultivation differential===
The final part of this process is Cultivation Differential. This is described as "the percentage of difference in response between light and heavy television viewers."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Certain measures are evaluated including, "...sex, age, education, and other characteristics. The margin of heavy viewers over light viewers giving the "television answers" within and across groups is the "cultivation differential" indicating conceptions about social reality that viewing tends to cultivate."&lt;ref name="Living1"/&gt; According to Griffin: "Cultivation deals with how TV's content might affect viewers—particularly the viewers who spend lots of time glued to the tube. This is where most of the action takes place in the theory."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Gerbner found that the effect of television on its viewers is not unidirectional, that the "use of the term cultivation for television's contribution to conception of social reality... (does not) necessarily imply a one-way, monolithic process. The effects of a pervasive medium upon the composition and structure of the symbolic environment are subtle, complex, and intermingled with other influences. This perspective, therefore, assumes an interaction between the medium and its publics."&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt;

This cultivation differential is what Gerbner sought to discover in his research. Griffin defines this as "the difference in the percentage giving the television answer within comparable groups of light and heavy TV viewers."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Gerbner wanted to find how often individuals who watched a significant amount of television were influenced by what they saw in the media. Gerbner believed there was no before-television stage in a person's life. He alleged the media influences a person the moment they are born.

There are four attitudes that Gerbner focused on: (1) the chances of involvement with violence, (2) fear of walking alone at night, (3) perceived activity of police, and (4) general mistrust of people.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; When a person watches more television, that person is more likely to think he or she has a higher chance of being involved violence and is more mistrustful of others. See also the description of [[mean world syndrome]] below.

==Perceptions of violence==
Gerbner's initial work specifically looked at the effects of [[television violence]] on American audiences.&lt;ref name="Gwalker"&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/comm321/gwalker/effectsmedia.htm "Media Effects Theories"]. Oregon State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence underscored the larger part of Gerbner's work on cultivation theory, as he and his team speculated that violence had an effect on the way Americans perceive safety, crime, and general lawlessness in both their immediate communities and the greater population. Therefore, they measured dramatic violence, which Gerbner defines as "the overt expression or threat of physical force as part of the plot."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Gerbner's research also focuses on the impact of television viewing on high-use television users and their interpretation of the prevalence of crime on television versus real life. He argues that since a high percentage of television programs include violent or crime-related content, viewers who spend a lot of time watching television are inevitably exposed to high levels of crime and violence portrayed. Thus, increased exposure causes viewers to judge the world around them as more violent and crime-filled than it may actually be in reality.&lt;ref name="Hughes"/&gt;

In 1968, Gerbner conducted a survey to demonstrate this theory. From his results he placed television viewers into three categories; "light viewers" (less than 2 hours a day), "medium viewers" (2–4 hours a day) and "heavy viewers" (more than 4 hours a day). He found that heavy viewers held beliefs and opinions similar to those portrayed on television rather than ones based in real-world circumstances, which demonstrates the compound effect of media influence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those whom Gerbner classified as heavy viewers experience shyness, loneliness, and depression much more than those who do not watch television or who do not watch television nearly as much.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammermeister|first=Joe|author2=Barbara Brock|author3=David Winterstein|author4=Randy Page|title=Life Without TV? Cultivation Theory and Psychosocial Characteristics of Television-Free Individuals and Their Television-Viewing Counterparts|journal=Health Communication|year=2005|volume=17|issue=4|pages=253–264|url=http://cultivationanalysisrtvf173.pbworks.com/f/Cultivat1.pdf|doi=10.1207/s15327027hc1703_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this study, Gerbner also began working on what would become his [[Mean world syndrome|Mean World Index]], which subscribes to the notion that heavy consumption of violence-related television content leads the viewer to believe the world is more dangerous than it actually is.

===Positive correlation between TV viewing and fear of criminal victimization===
"In most of the surveys Gerbner conducted, the results reveal a small but statistically significant relationship between TV consumption and fear about becoming the victim of a crime. The question at the start of the chapter is illustrative: Those with light viewing habits predict their weekly odds of being a victim are 1 out of 100; those with heavy viewing habits fear the risk 1 out of 10. Actual crime statistics indicate that 1 out of 10,000 is more realistic."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

Supporting this finding is a survey done with college students that showed a significant correlation between the attention paid to local crime and fear. This survey also showed a significant correlation between fears of crime and violence and the number of times the respondents viewed television per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=Bryan H.|author2=Yuhmim Chang|title=Assessing cultivation theory and public health model for crime reporting|journal=Newspaper Research Journal|date=1 September 2000|volume=21|issue=4|pages=99–112|url=http://sb6nw2tx4e.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Assessing+cultivation+theory+and+public+health+model+for+crime+reporting&amp;rft.jtitle=Newspaper+Research+Journal&amp;rft.au=Bryan+H+Reber&amp;rft.au=Yuhmiin+Chang&amp;rft.date=2000-11-01&amp;rft.issn=0739-5329&amp;rft.volume=21&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=99&amp;rft.externalDBID=INRS&amp;rft.externalDocID=73957882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Local television]] news also plays a role in influencing viewers' perception of high criminal activity due to events reported on the news. While news agencies boast their allegiance to report factual, timely news, they rely "heavily on sensational coverage of crime and other mayhem with particular emphasis on homicide and violence" (Hamilton, 1998; Klite, Bardwell, &amp; Salzman, 1995, 1997). Thus, viewers are more likely to develop a heightened sense of fear of crime because of the nature of information spread by local news outlets.

===Perceived activity of the police===

"People with heavy viewing habits believe that 5 percent of society is involved in [[law enforcement]]. Their video world is peopled with police officers, judges, and government agents. People with light viewing habits estimates a more realistic 1 percent."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

===General mistrust of people===
"Those with heavy viewing habits are suspicious of other people's motives. They subscribe to statements that warn people to expect the worst." These people would be likely to believe statements such as: "Most people are just looking out for themselves"; "In dealing with others, you can't be too careful"; and "Do unto others before they do unto You." This mindset is what Griffin calls the mean world syndrome.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

Gerbner's original analysis shows that heavy viewers are much more likely to be afraid of walking alone at night. The reluctance of these individuals has also been seen on a more global scale because heavy viewers in the United States are much more likely to believe they, as a nation, should stay out of world affairs.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Michael|title=The Fruits of Cultivation Analysis: A Reexamination of Some Effects of Television Watching|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1980|pages=287–302|url=http://sb6nw2tx4e.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=M&amp;aulast=Hughes&amp;atitle=The+fruits+of+cultivation+analysis:+A+reexamination+of+some+effects+of+television+watching&amp;id=doi:10.1086/268597&amp;title=Public+opinion+quarterly&amp;volume=44&amp;issue=3&amp;date=1980&amp;spage=287&amp;issn=0033-362X|doi=10.1086/268597|volume=44|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key terms in cultivation analysis==
===Mainstreaming===
"Mainstreaming is the blurring, blending, and bending process by which heavy TV viewers from disparate groups develop a common outlook on the world through constant exposure to the same images and labels on TV."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Mainstreaming through television plays a central role in society. There are many people that do not have access to television, but the reach of television is so expansive that it has become the primary channel responsible for shaping what is [[mainstream]] in our culture.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; The mainstream is more than the sum of all cross-currents and sub-currents; it represents the broadest range of shared meanings and assumptions in the most general, functional and stable way.&lt;ref name="Growing"/&gt; Heavy television viewing may override individual differences and perspectives, creating more of an American (and increasingly global) "melting pot" of social, cultural and political ideologies.&lt;ref name="Growing" /&gt;

Gerbner found that ideas and opinions commonly held by heavy viewers as a result of mainstreaming have to do with politics and economics. According to Griffin, Gerbner's research led to the conclusion that heavy viewers tend to label themselves as middle class citizens who are politically moderate. Gerbner also found people who labeled themselves as either liberal or conservative among those who mainly watched TV occasionally. However, he also found that "cultural indicators noted that their positions on social issues are decidedly conservative."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

===Resonance===
Resonance occurs when things viewed on television are congruent with the actual lived realities of viewers. Gerbner writes that this provides a double dose of messages that resonate and amplify cultivation.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; Additionally, Gerbner et al. defines ''resonance'' as the similarity between everyday reality and television narratives. The example they give is of minority groups whose fictional television character is stereotypically more frequently victimized on television, creating an exaggerated perception of violence for individuals who watch more television&lt;ref name="Growing" /&gt; Griffin sums it up nicely, when he states, "Gerbner claimed that other heavy viewers grow more apprehensive through the process of resonance."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Furthermore, Gerbner said, "The congruence of the television world and real-life circumstances may 'resonate' and lead to markedly amplified cultivation patterns."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; This cultivation could have a large effect on our society if these viewers insist on receiving more security from the government, their work place, family, friends, etc. Resonance seeks to explain why heavy TV viewers often have an amplified vigilance about the world.

As either mainstreaming or resonance, cultivation produces first-order or second-order effects. First-order effects refers to the learning of facts, while second-order effects involve "hypotheses about more general issues and assumptions" that people make about their environments.&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt;

===Mean World Index===
Gerbner et al. developed the [[Mean world syndrome|Mean World Index]]. The Mean World Index finds that long-term exposure to television in which violence is frequent cultivates the image of a mean and dangerous world. Viewers who consumed television at a higher rate believed that greater protection by law enforcement is needed and reported that most people "cannot be trusted" and are "just looking out for themselves".&lt;ref name="Mainstreaming" /&gt; The Mean World Index consists of three statements:

*Most people are just looking out for themselves.
*You can't be too careful in dealing with people.
*Most people would take advantage of you if they got the chance.

===Dramatic violence===
Dramatic violence is the "overt expression or serious threat of physical force as part of the plot."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Shows such as ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit|Law &amp; Order SVU]]'' and ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' use murder to frame each episode of their shows, thus underscoring the presence of dramatic and gratuitous violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Berger, A. A. (Ed.). (1987). Television in society. Transaction Publishers.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of dramatic violence underscores the relationship between fear and entertainment. Though death is being used as a plot point, it also functions to cultivate a particular image of looming violence.

===Heavy viewers===
Heavy viewers are individuals who watch at least four hours of television a day,&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; however [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] notes that heavy viewers are now defined as those that watch more than 11 hours of television a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tipping the Scale: Heavy TV Viewers=a Big Opportunity for Advertisers|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/tipping-the-scale-heavy-tv-viewers-a-big-opportunity-for-advertisers.html|website=www.nielsen.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy viewers are consistently characterized as being more susceptible to the images and messages on television. They also rely on television more to cultivate their perceptions of the real world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a recent study done on the cultivation effects of [[reality television]], an Indiana University study found that young girls who regularly watched the [[MTV]] hit ''[[Teen Mom]]'' had an unrealistic view of teen pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Study: Heavy viewers of 'Teen Mom' and '16 and Pregnant' have unrealistic views of teen pregnancy: IUB Newsroom: Indiana University|url=http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/01/16-and-pregnant-teen-mom-shows-encourage-teen-pregnancy.shtml|website=news.indiana.edu|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cognitive mechanisms that explain cultivation effects have been put forth by [[Shrum]] (1995; 1996; 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrum|first=L.J.|title=Assessing the social influence of television: A social cognitive perspective on cultivation effects.|journal=[[Communication Research (journal)|Communication Research]]|year=1995|volume=22|issue=4|pages=402–429|doi=10.1177/009365095022004002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrum|first=L.J.|title=Psychological processes underlying cultivation effects: Further tests of construct accessibility.|journal=[[Human Communication Research]]|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=482–509|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00376.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrum|first=L.J.|title=The role of source confusion in cultivation effects may depend on processing strategy: A comment on Mares (1996).|journal=Human Communication Research|year=1997|volume=24|issue=2|pages=349–358|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00418.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrum's availability [[heuristic]] explanation suggests that heavy viewers tend to have more frequent, recent, and vivid instances of television reality on the "top of the head" (i.e., available and accessible) when surveyors ask them questions, resulting in more responses that relate to television viewing and also speedier responses. Another mechanism that might explain the cultivation phenomenon is a cognitive-narrative mechanism. Previous research suggests that the realism of television narratives in combination with individual-level "transportability", or the ability to adopt a less critical stance toward a narrative, might facilitate cultivation effects (e.g., Bilandzic &amp; Busselle, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bilandzic|first=H.|author2=Busselle, R.W|title=Transportation and transportability in the cultivation of genre-consistent attitudes and estimates.|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|year=2008|volume=58|issue=3|pages=508–529|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00397.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magic bullet theory===
The [[Hypodermic needle model|magic bullet]] theory (also known as the '''hypodermic-syringe model''', '''transmission-belt model''', or '''hypodermic needle model''') is a [[Linear model|linear model of communication]]. This theory talks about "the audiences directly influenced by the mass media" and "the media's power on the audiences".

The "magic bullet" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the "media gun" into the viewer's "head" (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Mass Communication Theory|last=Arthur Asa|first=Berger|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|date=5 July 1995|edition=1|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "hypodermic needle model" uses the same idea of direct "injection." It suggests that the media delivers its messages straight into the passive audience's mind (Croteau, Hoynes 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Industries and Audience"|author1=Croteau, D.|author2=Hoynes, W|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages.

===Television reality===
Television reality describes the effects television viewing has on heavy viewers. Cultivation theory research seems to indicate that heavy television viewing can result in the creation of a television reality, which is a set of facts and beliefs based on television content rather than actual facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modeling Behavior from Images of Reality in Television Narratives|last=Tony R.|first=DeMars|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press, Ltd|year=2000|isbn=|location=US|pages=36|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the beliefs of heavy television viewers about the real world are consistent with the repetitive and emphasized images and themes presented on television.&lt;ref name="Growing"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Growing up with television: The cultivation perspective|vauthors=Gerbner G, Gross L, Morgan M, Signorielli N|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1994|isbn=|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=|quote=|via=|editor= M. Morgan|title=Against the mainstream: The selected works of George Gerbner|pp=193–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, heavy viewing cultivates a television-shaped view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Searching for cognitive processes in the cultivation effect: Adult and adolescent samples in the United States and Australia|last=Hawkins|first=R. P.|author2=Pingree, S.|author3=Alter, I|publisher=|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=553–577|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While viewers might differ in their demographic characteristics, the amount of television viewing can make a difference in terms of their conceptions of social reality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbner|first=George|author2=Larry Gross|author3=Nancy Signorielli|author4=Michael Morgan|year=1980|title=Aging with Television: Image on Television Drama and Conceptions of Social Reality|journal=Journal of Communication |volume=30|issue=1|pp=37–47|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1980.tb01766.x|pmid=7372841|url=http://web.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, people's different degrees of sex-role stereotypes can be traced back to the independent contribution of TV viewing just like others such as sex, age, class, and education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Television viewing time is a main element of creating television reality to the audiences or the viewers. According to Gerbner's research, the more time spent 'living' in the world of television, the more likely people are to report perceptions of social reality which can be traced to television's most persistent representations of life and society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since the 1960s, communication scholars have examined television's contributions to viewers' perceptions of a wide variety of topics and issues. Little effort has been made to investigate the influence of television on perceptions of social reality among adolescents, particularly in the areas of sexism, sex roles, mean world, and television reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/05-Jong-G.-Kang-Stephen-S.-Andersen-Michael-Pfau.pdf|title=Television Viewing and Perception of Social Reality Among Native American Adolescents|author1=Jong G. Kang|author2=Stephen S. Andersen|author3=Michael Pfau|date=1996|website=|publisher=Illinois State University, Augustana College University of Wisconsin, Madison|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of several researchers support the concept of television reality as a consequence of heavy viewing. According to Wyer and Budesheim's research, television messages or information, even when they are not necessarily considered truthful, can still be used in the process of constructing social judgments. Furthermore, indicted invalid information may still be used in subsequent audience's judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=[[Robert S. Wyer|Wyer, Robert S.]]|author2=William H. Unverzagt|year=1985|title=Effects of Instructions to Disregard Information on Its Subsequent Recall and Use in Making Judgments|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=48|issue=3|pages=533–549|pmid=3989660|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.48.3.533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==
Although Gerbner's research focused on violence on TV this theory can be applied to a variety of different situations. Many other theorists have done studies related to the cultivation theory which incorporated different messages than Gerbner's original intent. This research has been conducted in order to defeat two criticisms of the theory; its breadth and lumping of genres.

===Cultivation effects on children===
"There was a positive relationship between childhood television viewing levels and the social reality beliefs in young adulthood. The results of this study suggest that television viewed during childhood may affect the social reality beliefs a person holds as an adult."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; "Accordingly, the present study focuses on the potential effect of childhood television viewing on social reality beliefs during adulthood. The focus of the present study will be childhood exposure to television genres that tend to be violent. Given that it has been argued and demonstrated that measuring exposure to violent content is a more appropriate method for cultivation analyses than measuring overall television exposure levels."&lt;ref name="Karyn Riddle"/&gt;

Another longitudinal study shows how television exposure is associated with overall self-esteem in children. Nicole Martins and Kristen Harrison measured the amount of television viewing in elementary school children and their overall level of self-esteem (not related to perceptions about the body) after television exposure over time. They found that higher levels of television viewing predicted lower self-esteem for White girls, Black girls, and Black boys, but higher self-esteem for White boys. This relationship indicates that exposure to portrayals of White males on television, which tend to be positive, and those of Black men and women and White women which tend to be negative, shape the way children understand their own identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Nicole|last2=Harrison|first2=Kristen|date=16 March 2011|title=Racial and Gender Differences in the Relationship Between Children's Television Use and Self-Esteem|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0093650211401376|journal=[[Communication Research (Journal)|Communication Research]]|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=338–357|doi=10.1177/0093650211401376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International cultivation analysis===
International cultivation analysis attempts to answer the question of whether the medium or the system is the message. Gerbner ''et al.'' found that countries where the television programs were less repetitive and homogeneous than the United States produced less predictable and consistent results.&lt;ref name="Growing" /&gt; The variety of television content is also an important factor. Increased diversity and balance within television channels or programs leads viewers to report similar preferences. Furthermore, importing television programs internationally can elicit variable responses depending on the cultural context and the type of television program. For example, exposure of US television programs to Korean females portrayed a [[liberalism|liberal]] perspective of gender roles and family. However, for the Korean male television viewers, US programs brought out increased hostility and protection of Korean culture. Another study showed that Australian students who watched US television programs (especially adventure and crime shows) were more likely to view Australia as dangerous;&lt;ref name="Growing" /&gt; however, they didn't transfer this danger to America, even though they were watching US television programs. A study conducted by Minnebo and Eggermont in 2007 found that heavy television viewers, over the age of 30, in [[Belgium]] "were more likely to believe that most young people are substance users."&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan"/&gt;

===Lifetime television exposure analysis===
In order to accurately survey and represent findings from cultivation theory research, the duration of television exposure has become a topic for further research. It's stated that "cultivation effect only occurs after long-term, cumulative exposure to stable patterns of content on television."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Television and its viewers: Cultivation theory and research|last=Shanahan|first=J|last2=Morgan|first2=M|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-4331-1368-0|location=Cambridge|pages=286–302|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research that tracks long-term media exposure is very rare and if conducted, must be thoroughly planned out in order to secure dependable results. In a study conducted in 2009, participants were asked to list the number of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' episodes they had viewed in prior and current seasons. The purpose of the study was to gain a perspective of how viewers see doctors based on impressions from television. Findings from the study showed a positive association with [[Grey's Anatomy|''Grey's Anatomy''{{'}}s]] portrayal with real-world doctors' acts of courage. The finding wasn't surprising, as many episodes within ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' often show doctors as courageous, either by employing a detailed view of an operation, or crediting doctors for their empathy in specific patient scenarios. Gerbner and colleagues argue that cultivation effects span total television viewing, not genre- or program-specific viewing (Gerbner et al., 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quick|title=The Effects of Viewing Grey's Anatomy on Perceptions of Doctors and Patient Satisfaction|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/HBEM|journal=[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]|volume=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609184549/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/HBEM|archivedate=9 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Jonathan Cohen and Gabriel Weimann, they found that cultivation through television is more prevalent within the age group of older teenagers and young adults, thus supporting the claim that a cumulative exposure to television throughout a viewer's life has a steady impact on their cultivation longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cultivation revisited: Some genres have some effects on some viewers|year=2000|publisher=|journal=Communication Reports|volume=13|issue=2|pages=99–114|doi=10.1080/08934210009367728|author1=Cohen, J.|author2=Weimann, G.|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on psychosocial health===
A study conducted by Hammermeister, Brock, Winterstein, and Page compares the psychosocial health of viewers that reported no television use, viewers who followed the [[American Academy of Pediatrics|American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)]] suggested consumption of up to 2 hours of television per day, and viewers with high exposure to television. They surveyed 430 participants within the United States implemented via survey method. They found that there was more of an impact on the psychosocial health of women who participated in the study and, "revealed that all the psychosocial variables examined in this study contributed significantly to the one function equation with depression, hopelessness, self-esteem, and weight satisfaction being the strongest discriminators" (Hammermeister, Brock, Winterstein, Page, 260). Findings also exposed the similarity in [[psychosocial]] health data between participants who watched up to 2 hours of television per day and participants who opt out of television consumption all together.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"/&gt;

==="InterTV"===
InterTV is a concept forecasting the inevitable melding of television and online media. Described by Shanahan and Morgan as television's "convergence" with computers, they argue that computers will essentially act as an extension of television through the creation of related websites and online news articles covered within the traditional television journalism realm. Additionally, television programming will also suffer a shift to an online platform in result of [[Streaming media|streaming services]] such as [[Netflix]] and [[Hulu]]. According to Shanahan and Morgan, this may not be the worst thing, as it allows advertisers a direct source in which they can gather information regarding viewers. They state that, "within a market filled with individual interests, desires and the channels to serve them, such a data-gathering enterprise would still allow advertisers to assemble mass audiences from the fragmented media systems". In a sense, this would allow viewers some way to control the content they are fed through the online platform. While advertisers are infringing on viewer information, the correlated result requires them to shift any programming or storyline content to the satisfaction of the viewer. This poses a challenging example in terms of extending the impact of cultivation theory, instead empowering the viewer to cultivate their own television use experience.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Music videos===
Kathleen Beullens, Keith Roe, and Jan Van den Bulck conducted research relating to [[alcohol]] consumption in music videos. The research revealed that high exposure to music videos develops an unrealistic perception of alcohol consumption. Musicians in these videos endorse alcohol in their songs and create a false reality about alcohol and its effects."&lt;ref name="Beullens and Van den Bulck"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beullens|first1=K.|last2=Roe|first2=K.|last3=Van|first3=|last4=den Bulck|first4=J.|year=2012|title=Music Video Viewing as a Marker of Driving After the Consumption of Alcohol|url=|journal=Substance Use &amp; Misuse|volume=47|issue=2|pages=155–165|doi=10.3109/10826084.2012.637449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Research conducted by Dmitri Williams draws the comparison of the effects of television to interactive [[video game]]s. He argues that while the parameters and basic content of the game developed is through the employment of game developers, creators and designers, the role of the "other player" within the game is also essential in the progression of the story within the video game. Essentially, an interactive game allows players to build relationships with others, and thus is more dynamic and unpredictable as compared to traditional television. Williams attempts to research the question of whether video games are as influential as television from a cultivation theory standpoint. Does it impact our [[social reality]]? In the field study, participants were asked to play a [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] game, one in which participants interacted with other players in real time. Crime measures divided into four categories were used to evaluate the correlation between the research hypotheses and cultivation theory. The study proved a strong correlation between the impact of cultivation on participants and the players of the MMORPG game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Dmitri|year=2006|title=Virtual cultivation: Online worlds, offline perceptions|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and sexuality===
====LGBT====
Sara Baker Netzley conducted research in a similar fashion to Gerbner in the way that [[homosexuals]] were depicted on television. This study found that there was an extremely high level of sexual activity in comparison to the amount of homosexual characters that appeared on television. This has led those who are heavy television consumers to believe that the gay community is extremely sexual. Much like the idea of a mean and scary world it gives people a parallel idea of an extremely sexualized gay community."&lt;ref name="Netzley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Netzley|first1=S|year=2010|title=Visibility That Demystifies Gays, Gender, and Sex on Television|url=|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=57|issue=8|pages=968–986|doi=10.1080/00918369.2010.503505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Jerel Calzo and Monique Ward, they first begin by analyzing recent research conducted on the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters on television. While growth in the representation of gay and lesbian characters has continued to grow, they found that most television shows frame gay and lesbian characters in a manner that reinforces [[LGBT stereotypes|homosexual stereotypes]]. Diving into discussion, they even use examples such as ''[[The Ellen Show|Ellen]]'' and ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', describing the storyline content as reinforcing "stereotypes by portraying these characters as lacking stable relationships, as being preoccupied with their sexuality (or not sexual at all), and by perpetuating the perception of gay and lesbian people as laughable, one-dimensional figures (Cooper, 2003; Fouts &amp; Inch, 2005; Herman, 2005)". Their findings confirmed that media genres played an important role in the attitudes developed regarding homosexuality. They also were surprised by the finding that prior prime-time shows, which are no longer on air, reinforced a larger magnitude of acceptance within the LGBTQ realm. They then suggested that because genre played a large impact in the perception that viewers gained while watching certain television shows, more research should be designated towards, "more genre-driven effects analyses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Media Exposure and Viewers' Attitudes Toward Homosexuality: Evidence for Mainstreaming or Resonance?|year=2009|journal=[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]|volume=53|issue=2|pages=280–299|doi=10.1080/08838150902908049|author1=Jerel P. Calzo M.A.|author2=L. Monique Ward|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women====
Beverly Roskos-Ewoldsen, John Davies and David Roskos-Ewoldsen posit that perceptions of women are integrated in a rather stereotypical fashion compared to portrayals of men on television. They state that, "men are characters in TV shows at about a 2 to 1 ratio to women(Gerbner et al., 2002)". Viewers who consume more television usually also have more sexist views of women (Gerbner et al., 2002; Morgan, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roskos-Ewoldsen|first=Beverly|last2=Davies|first2=John|last3=Roskos-Ewoldsen|first3=David|date=2004|title=Implications of the mental models approach for cultivation theory|journal=Communications: The European Journal of Communication Research|volume=29|issue=3|doi=10.1515/comm.2004.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that women are more likely to be portrayed as victims on television than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Television news and the cultivation of fear of crime|year=2003|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=53|issue=1|pages=88–104|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb03007.x|author1=Romer, D.|author2=[[Kathleen Hall Jamieson|Jamieson, K.

Alexander Sink and Dana Mastro studied women and gender depictions on American primetime television. Although women are often perceived to have better representation on television in recent years, these researchers show that this is not necessarily the case. Women are significantly proportionally underrepresented on primetime television, making up only 39% of characters despite the fact that women make up 50.9% of the population in the US. Men were also portrayed as more dominant than women, and although men were more often objectified, women were consistently portrayed as hyperfeminized and hypersexualized. Fewer older women appeared during primetime compared to men, and were often shown to be less competent than older male characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sink|first=Alexander|last2=Mastro|first2=Dana|date=2 January 2017|title=Depictions of Gender on Primetime Television: A Quantitative Content Analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15205436.2016.1212243|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=20|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.1080/15205436.2016.1212243|issn=1520-5436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual attitudes====
A study by Bradley J. Bond and Kristin L. Drogos examined the relationship between exposure to the television program ''Jersey Shore'' and sexual attitudes and behavior in college-aged adults. They found a positive relationship between time spent watching ''Jersey Shore'' and increased sexual permissiveness. This effect was found to be stronger in the younger participants than older participants, and held true even when the researchers controlled for other influences on participants' sexual attitudes such as religious beliefs and parents' attitudes. This higher level of sexually permissive behavior and attitudes was not a result of higher overall exposure to television, but to higher exposure to ''Jersey Shore'', a highly sexualized program, specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=Bradley J.|last2=Drogos|first2=Kristin L.|date=2 January 2014|title=Sex on the Shore: Wishful Identification and Parasocial Relationships as Mediators in the Relationship Between Jersey Shore Exposure and Emerging Adults' Sexual Attitudes and Behaviors|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15213269.2013.872039|journal=Media Psychology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=102–126|doi=10.1080/15213269.2013.872039|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and ethnicity===
Meghan S. Sanders and Srividya Ramasubramanian studied perceptions which African American media consumers hold about fictional characters portrayed in film and television. They found that, while study participants tended to view all African American characters positively, social class, rather than race or ethnicity, mattered more in perceptions about the warmth and competence of a character. Their study suggests that the race and ethnicity of media consumers need to be taken into account in cultivation studies because media consumers with different backgrounds likely perceive media portrayals and their faithfulness to reality differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Meghan S.|last2=Ramasubramanian|first2=Srividya|date=1 January 2012|title=An Examination of African Americans' Stereotyped Perceptions of Fictional Media Characters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10646175.2012.641869|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|volume=23|issue=1|pages=17–39|doi=10.1080/10646175.2012.641869|issn=1064-6175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz and David Ta examined the cultivation effects of video games on White students' perceptions of Black and Asian individuals. While no significant effects were found for perceptions of Asian individuals, researchers found that increased time spent playing video games, no matter what genre, held less positive views of Black people. They also found that real-life interaction with Black individuals did not change this effect. Behm-Morawitz and Ta suggest that the stable, negative racial and ethnic stereotypes portrayed in video game narratives of any genre impact real-world beliefs in spite of more varied real-life interaction with racial and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Politics and policy preferences===
[[Diana Mutz|Diana C. Mutz]] and Lilach Nir conducted a study of how fictional television narratives can influence viewers' policy preferences and positive or negative attitudes regarding the justice system in the real world. They found that positive portrayals of the criminal justice system were associated with more positive views toward the system in real life, whereas negative television portrayals were associated with viewers feeling that the criminal justice system often works unfairly. Furthermore, researchers found that these attitudes did influence viewers' policy preferences concerning the criminal justice system in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mutz|first=Diana C.|last2=Nir|first2=Lilach|date=31 March 2010|title=Not Necessarily the News: Does Fictional Television Influence Real-World Policy Preferences?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15205430902813856|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=13|issue=2|pages=196–217|doi=10.1080/15205430902813856|issn=1520-5436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Anita Atwell Seate and Dana Mastro studied news coverage of immigration and its relationship with immigration policy preferences and negative attitudes about immigrants. They found that exposure to negative messages about immigrants in the news influenced anxious feelings towards the outgroup (i.e. immigrants), particularly when the news showed an example of a member of this outgroup on the program. This exposure did not necessarily influence immigration policy preferences, but long-term exposure to messages of this kind can affect policy preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seate|first=Anita Atwell|last2=Mastro|first2=Dana|date=2 April 2016|title=Media's influence on immigration attitudes: An intergroup threat theory approach|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2015.1068433|journal=[[Communication Monographs]]|volume=83|issue=2|pages=194–213|doi=10.1080/03637751.2015.1068433|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katerina-Eva Matsa explores cultivation effects through her thesis on television's impact on political engagement in Greece. She describes the role of satirical television within the cultural realm in Greece and how this form of television engrains the perception that Greek political institutions are corrupt, thus negatively influencing the public's overall opinion of politics in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Matsa, K. E.|year=2010|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/552931/matsaKaterina.pdf?sequence=1|title=Laughing at politics: effects of television satire on political engagement in Greece|publisher=Georgetown University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New media===
Michael Morgan, James Shanahan, and Nancy Signorielli conceptualize applications of cultivation theory to the study of [[new media]]. They note that media technology has never been static, and that there will always be new forms of media. However, in the present, older methods for cultivation analysis may have to move away from counting hours of television viewed, and take up a [[big data]] approach. These authors argue that, although many were skeptical that cultivation theory would be applicable with the increasing importance of new media, these media still use narrative, and since those narratives affect us, cultivation theory is still relevant for new media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Michael|last2=Shanahan|first2=James|last3=Signorielli|first3=Nancy|date=3 September 2015|title=Yesterday's New Cultivation, Tomorrow|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15205436.2015.1072725|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=18|issue=5|pages=674–699|doi=10.1080/15205436.2015.1072725|issn=1520-5436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen M. Croucher applies cultivation theory to his theory of social media and its effects on immigrant cultural adaptation. He theorizes that immigrants who use dominant social media while they are still in the process of adapting to their new culture will develop perceptions about their host society through the use of this media. He believes that this cultivation effect will also impact the way immigrants interact with host country natives in offline interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croucher|first=Stephen M.|date=1 November 2011|title=Social Networking and Cultural Adaptation: A Theoretical Model|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/17513057.2011.598046|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|volume=4|issue=4|pages=259–264|doi=10.1080/17513057.2011.598046|issn=1751-3057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===

Cultivation theory attempts to predict that media viewing has an effect on the values and beliefs that people have and the things they believe are "reality". A study conducted by David Atkin from the University of Connecticut revealed insights about television viewing of sports and the values of its viewers. An hypothesis that was researched stated "Level of agreement with sports-related values (i.e., being physically fit, athletic, and active) is positively related to participation in sports-related media and leisure activities" (Atkin 324). Studies were conducted and research was presented and the conclusion was that the hypothesis was correct. The study specifically found that "those for whom being physically fit, being athletic and being active are important also engage in more sports media" (Atkin). In this instance, cultivation theory is present because heavier exposure is related to greater agreement with the values that are presented.

Another related study felt that attendance at live and mediated sporting events might cultivate audience values that are consistent with the value of sports.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In an article titled "Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media and Politics", discussion was started about sports and cultivation theory. Cultivation theory can be applicable to many different aspects of society. The research shared "the line of research has found that, as exposure to television increases, an individual's beliefs and opinions of the real-world become more similar to that of the television world." This statement proves to be support of the previous hypothesis and is support for cultivation theory being present in the sports world. If someone engages in sports media, their beliefs of being physically fit and active will then become more and more similar to the beliefs of those they are watching and listening to in the sports media.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Cultivation theory and sports are just beginning to be studied. There are many more aspects that are being studied. One other aspect is the difference between those who participate in sporting events and those who watch them. Another part of cultivation theory can be explained by people being less active, because of what they watch on television and the rise in obesity levels. Because people don't see a lot of active people on television, their "reality" is that people no longer need to be active 30 or so minutes per day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Cultivation theory can be applied to sports as it can be applied to many other areas of media. A prime example of this is America's shift toward so-called "violent sports". A survey taken in 98 show that only 67% of American teenagers considered themselves baseball fans, compare that to football which is 78%. Just as we consume violent TV shows we also love the more violent sports. This 98 study relates perfectly to&amp;nbsp; current TV ratings, as football has by far the most hours watched since 2005 at 111.9 million hours.&amp;nbsp; Leo W. Jeffres, Jae-Won Lee, and Kimberly A. Neuendorf say that "new "media logic" that favors more violent, action-oriented sports, while slower-paced sports have been relegated to secondary status in the United States."

Past cultivation theory research supports the idea that the more someone watches television, the more that individual believes that the television content is like real world reality. This is likely to be found true when it comes to televised violence. But with new research emerging we now know that this cultivation effect is not likely to arise among individuals who watch sports. For example, an individual who happens to watch a lot of football is not going to view the world as a frightening place because of the violence that goes on during games.

Although there was no true correlation between the cultivation theory and sports, there has been research done on the level of violence in sports content and the effects it has on viewers. Results found by Raney and Depalma (2006) found that individuals were less likely to report being in a positive mood after watching violent sports content and its effect on viewers (Wanta 2013).

==Criticisms==
A number of scholars have critiqued Gerbner's assertions about cultivation theory, particularly its intentions and its scope. One critique of the theory analyzes the objective of the theory. Communications professor [[Jennings Bryant]] posits that cultivation research focuses more on the effects rather than who or what is being influenced. Bryant goes on to assert that the research to date has more to do with the "whys" and "hows" of a theory as opposed to gathering normative data as to the "whats", "whos", and "wheres".&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Road Most Traveled: Yet Another Cultivation Critique|date=1 March 1986|publisher=|journal=[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]|volume=30|issue=2|pages=231–335|doi=10.1080/08838158609386621|author=Bryant, Jennings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical leap===
Critics have also faulted the logical consistency of cultivation analysis, noting that the methods employed by cultivation analysis researchers do not match the conceptual reach of the theory. The research supporting this theory uses social scientific methods to address questions related to the humanities.&lt;ref name="wrtl" /&gt; Another possibility is that the relationship between TV viewing and fear of crime is like the relationship between a runny nose and a sore throat. Neither one causes the other—they are both caused by something else.".&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;{{Better source|reason=This accusation is quite general in communication field and may be true. However, this source seems to general to properly build the case for this assertion. A proper peer-reviewed scientific article is needed to show that cultivation theory really doesn't isolation properly cause and effect.|date=March 2017}} Many also question the breadth of Gerbner's research. When using the Cultural Indicators strategy, Gerbner separated his research into three parts. The second part focused on the effects of media when looking at [[gender]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]/ethnicity, and [[Job (role)|occupation]]. Michael Hughes writes: "it does not seem reasonable that these three variables exhaust the possibilities of variables available…which may be responsible for spurious relationships between television watching and the dependent variables in the Gerbner et al. analysis."&lt;ref name="Hughes"/&gt;{{rp|287}} Also, the variables Gerbner did choose can also vary by the amount of time a person has available to watch TV.

===Lived experience===
Another critique comes from [[Daniel Chandler]]: "those who live in high-crime areas are more likely to stay at home and watch television and also to believe that they have a greater chance of being attacked than are those in low-crime areas." He claims as well, "when the viewer has some direct lived experience of the subject matter this may tend to reduce any cultivation effect."&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler, Daniel. [http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/cultiv.html ''Cultivation Theory'']. Aberystwyth University, 18 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; While television does have some effect on how we perceive the world around us, Gerbner's study does not consider the lived experiences of those that do inhabit high crime areas.

===Forms of violence===
Gerbner is also criticized for his lumping of all forms of violence. Chandler argues, "different genres—even different programmes—contribute to the shaping of different realities, but cultivation analysis assumes too much homogeneity in television programmes".&lt;ref name="Chandler" /&gt; This point is addressed by [[Horace Newcomb]] (1978) who argues that violence is not presented as uniformly on television as the theory assumes; therefore, television cannot be responsible for cultivating the same sense of reality for all viewers.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newcomb|first1=H|year=1978|title=Assessing the violence profile studies of Gerbner and Gross: A humanistic critique and suggestion|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=5|issue=|pages=264–283|doi=10.1177/009365027800500303}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering different programs that are on television, it makes sense that scholars would criticize Gerbner's lack of categories. For example, [[Saturday morning cartoon]] "play" violence is in combination with a murder on ''[[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|Law and Order]]''. This does not seem to logically fuse together. Morgan and Shanahan understand this dispute, but they contend "that people (especially heavy viewers) do not watch isolated genres only, and that any 'impact' of individual program types should be considered in the context of the overall viewing experience".&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan"/&gt; A study by Karyn Riddle attempts to address this critique, however, by combining heuristic processing models with cultivation theory to examine how not just exposure to violence in television, but also how vividly it is portrayed impacts cultivation effects. She found that there was an interaction effect for portrayals which were vivid and viewed frequently. In this case, real world beliefs were significantly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riddle|first=Karyn|date=28 May 2010|title=Always on My Mind: Exploring How Frequent, Recent, and Vivid Television Portrayals Are Used in the Formation of Social Reality Judgments|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15213261003800140|journal=Media Psychology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=155–179|doi=10.1080/15213261003800140|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanist critique===
Cultivation analysis has also been criticized by [[humanists]] for examining such a large cultural question. Because the theory discusses cultural effects, many humanists feel offended, thinking that their field has been misinterpreted. [[Horace Newcomb]] (1978) writes "More than any other research effort in the area of television studies the work of Gerbner and Gross and their associates sits squarely at the juncture of the social sciences and the humanities."&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;{{rp|265}}

The theory has also received criticism for ignoring other issues such as the perceived [[Philosophical realism|realism]] of the televised content, which could be essential in explaining people's understanding of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minnebo|first1=J.|last2=Van Acker|first2=A.|year=2004|title=Does television influence adolescents' perceptions of and attitudes toward people with [[mental illness]]?|url=|journal=Journal of Community Psychology|volume=32|issue=|pages=267–275|doi=10.1002/jcop.20001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson, Martins, &amp; Markse (2005) argue that attention to television might be more important to cultivating perceptions than only the amount of television viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=B. J.|last2=Martins|first2=N.|last3=Marske|first3=A. L.|year=2005|title=Children's and parents' fright reactions to kidnapping stories in the news|url=|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=72|issue=|pages=46–70|doi=10.1080/0363775052000342526}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, C. R. Berger (2005) writes that because the theory ignores cognitive processes, such as attention or rational thinking style, it is less useful than desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=C. R.|year=2005|title=Slippery slopes to apprehension: Rationality and graphical depictions of increasingly threatening trends|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=32|issue=|pages=3–28|doi=10.1177/0093650204271397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived reality===
The correlation between cultivation effects and [[Philosophy of perception|perceived reality]] have been criticized due to the inconsistent findings from various research conducted on the subject. Hawkins and Pingree (1980) found that participants that reported a lower perceived reality scoring actually showed a stronger cultivation impact. Potter (1986) found that, "different dimensions and levels of perceived reality were associated with different magnitudes of cultivation effects". Additionally, a study conducted by Shrum, Wyer and O'Guinn (1994) showed a zero percentage correlation between perceived reality and cultivation effects.

===Utility===
Cultivation analysis has been criticized that its claims are not always useful in explaining the phenomenon of interest: how people see the world. Some also argue that violence is not presented as uniformly on television as the theory assumes, so television cannot be reliably responsible for cultivating the same sense of reality for all viewers. In addition, cultivation analysis is criticized for ignoring other issues such as the perceived realism of the televised content, which might be critical in explaining people's understanding of reality. Attention to television might be more important to cultivating perceptions than simply the amount of television viewing, so the fact that the cultivation analysis theory seems to ignore [[cognition]] such as attention or rational thinking style deems it to be less useful.&lt;ref name="wrtl"&gt;{{cite book|author=West, R.|author2=Turner, L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20682">'''Developmental toxicity''' is any structural or functional alteration, reversible or irreversible, which interferes with [[homeostasis]], [[Auxology|normal growth]], [[cell differentiation|differentiation]], [[Developmental biology|development]] or behavior, and which is caused by environmental insult (including [[drug]]s, [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] factors such as [[alcohol]], diet, and environmental [[toxic]] chemicals or physical factors).  It is the study of adverse effects on the development of the organism resulting from exposure to toxic agents before conception (either parent), during prenatal development, or post-natally until puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pj5iQgAACAAJ|title = Casarett &amp; Doull's Essentials of Toxicology|last = Klaassen|first = Curtis|last2 = III|first2 = John B.

The effect of the developmental toxicants depends on the type of substance, dose and duration and time of exposure.

Certain [[Pathogen]]s are also included since the toxins they secrete are known to cause adverse effects on the development of the organism when the mother or fetus is infected. Developmental toxicology is a science studying adverse developmental outcomes. This term has widely replaced the early term for the study of primarily structural [[congenital abnormalities]], [[teratology]], to enable inclusion of a more diverse spectrum of [[congenital disorder]]s. Typical factors causing developmental toxicity are [[radiation]], infections (e.g. [[rubella]]), maternal metabolic imbalances (e.g. [[alcoholism]], [[diabetes]], [[folic acid]] deficiency), drugs (e.g. [[anticancer drugs]], [[tetracyclines]], many [[hormones]], [[thalidomide]]), and environmental chemicals (e.g. [[Mercury poisoning|mercury]], [[Lead poisoning|lead]], [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[PBDEs]], [[Hexabromocyclododecane|HBCD]], [[tobacco smoke]]). The  first-trimester exposure is considered the most potential for developmental toxicity.

Once fertilization has taken place, the toxicants in the environment can pass through the mother to the developing embryo or fetus across the placental barrier. The fetus is at greatest risk during the first 14th to 60th day of the pregnancy when the major organs are being formed. However, depending on the type of toxicant and amount of exposure, a fetus can be exposed toxicant at any time during pregnancy. For example, exposure to a particular toxicant at one time in the pregnancy may result in organ damage and at another time in the pregnancy could cause death of the fetus and miscarriage. There are a number of chemicals, biological agents (such as bacteria and viruses), and physical agents (such as radiation) used in a variety of workplaces that are known to cause developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lni.wa.gov/safety/research/files/repro_dev.pdf|title=Workplace Hazards to Reproduction and Development: A Resource for Workers, Employers, Health Care Providers, and Health &amp; Safety Personnel|last=Sharon L.B.S|first=Drozdowsky|publisher=Safety and Health Assessment and Research for Prevention (SHARP) Washington State Department of Labor and Industries|access-date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental disorders can include a wide range of physical abnormalities, such as bone or organ deformities, or behavioral and learning problems, such as a mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Julvez|first=Jordi|last2=Grandjean|first2=Philippe|date=2009-10-01|title=Neurodevelopmental toxicity risks due to occupational exposure to industrial chemicals during pregnancy|journal=Industrial Health|volume=47|issue=5|pages=459–468|issn=1880-8026|pmid=19834254|doi=10.2486/indhealth.47.459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposures to some chemicals during pregnancy can lead to the development of cancer later in the life of the child and are called transgenerational carcinogens. Exposure to toxicants during the second and the third trimester of a pregnancy can lead to slow fetal grown and result in low birth weight.

== History ==
Researchers have been able to ascertain toxicity associated with abnormal development with new breakthrough in [[developmental biology]]. Recognition of the developmental toxic effects of various molecules is recent development.

Terato means monster in Greek. Until the 18th century, the [[Preformationism|preformism]] theory was accepted by which abnormal growth was considered as deformations. The 19th century saw developmental in descriptive embryology where abnormalities were now considered as malformations or errors during a developmental process giving rise to the concept of teratogenesis. By the 20th century, the concept of epigenesis the interaction between a genetic program and environment was established and in the second half of the 20th century researchers had evidence that environmental factors can cause malformations and even trans-generational effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-60492-8|title=Landmarks in Developmental Biology 1883–1924 - Springer|last=Sander|first=Klaus|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-60492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maternal irradiation and congenital malformations ===
One of the first environmentally induced congenital malformations in humans were recognized as a result of maternal irradiation. Hiroshima (’53), and Nagasaki (’55), had ascertained this fact for the first time based on the records of births occurring before May 31, 1946, but after the atomic bombing (August 6, 1945, in Hiroshima; August 9th, 1945 in Nagasaki). A 20% increase in microcephaly frequency was seen in children with in-utero radiation exposure during the first trimester of the pregnancy (Miller 1956, 1968). Sensitivity to these radiations was seen to be predominantly high during the 7-15th week of [[gestation]].

Two important points observed during this study was:
# The severity and frequency of the congenital abnormalities seen increased with dose of radiation which depended on the closeness to the source or explosion.
# It was determined that there were critical periods of pregnancy when these exposures had the maximum effect on the fetal development.

=== Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) ===
{{main article|Congenital rubella syndrome}}
[[Rubella]] was the first recognized human epidemic of malformations. Following a widespread epidemic of rubella infection in 1940, Norman Gregg, an Australian ophthalmologist, reported in 1941 the occurrence of congenital cataracts among 78 infants born following maternal rubella infection in early pregnancy. This indicated that the virus had to cross the placental barrier to reach the fetus and cause malformations. The time of exposure to the virus also had a direct impact on the incidence of congenital malformations with exposure during week 4, 5-8 and 9-12 weeks of pregnancy caused 61%, 26% and 8% of  congenital malformations. This was the first published recognition of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The progeny had congenital eye, heart and ear defects as well as mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rubella.html|title=Pinkbook {{!}} Rubella {{!}} Epidemiology of Vaccine Preventable Diseases {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thalidomide Tragedy(1950) ===
{{main article|Thalidomide}}
Thalidomide was extensively used for the treatment of nausea in pregnant women in late 1950s and early 1960s until it became apparent in the 1960s that it resulted in severe birth defects. Fetus that were exposed to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb malformation by which the limb were not developed or appeared as stumps. Other effects also seen with thalidomide exposure included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jsonpedia.org/annotate/resource/html/en:Thalidomide|title=JSONpedia - Thalidomide|website=jsonpedia.org|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thalidomide tragedy marked a turning point in toxicity testing, as it prompted United States and international regulatory agencies to develop systematic toxicity testing protocol. The effects of thalidomide led to important discoveries in the biochemical pathways of limb development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=James H.|last2=Scialli|first2=Anthony R.|date=2011-07-01|title=Thalidomide: the tragedy of birth defects and the effective treatment of disease|journal=Toxicological Sciences|volume=122|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfr088|issn=1096-0929|pmid=21507989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing and Risk assessment ==
Testing for developmental toxicant is done in different stages:
* ''Fertilization to implantation'' - Fertilization followed by increase in cell number, cleavage and cavitaion to form the blastocyst which gets implanted. Toxicant exposure at this stage usually prevents implantation and results in death. e.g. DDT, nicotine 
* ''Implantation to gastrulation'' - The three germ layers are formed and the cells start migrating out to initiate organogenesis. This is most sensitive stage for alcohol toxicity.  
* ''Organogenesis'' - It is the formation of limbs, organs, nervous system, urinary and genital systems by the process of cell differentiation, migration and cell interactions from the 3rd to 8th week of human gestation. e.g. DES 
* ''Morphogenesis -'' Includes the stages of growth and physiological maturation from week 8 till birth. Teratogenic effects results in deformations and rather than malformations in the fetus.  
* ''Post Natal to puberty'' - Environmental toxicant exposures. 
Because of the complexity of the embryo-fetal development, including the maternal-fetal interactions during gestation, it is important to understand the mechanism of toxicity and test the toxic effect in more than two species before confirming the substance to be a developmental toxicant. Embryo have different critical periods for the organ formation from day 15 to day 60 and hence the susceptibility to toxicant injury is directly related to the period of development.

== Toxicity effects ==
Developmental toxicity is the alterations of the developmental processes (organogenesis, morphogenesis) rather than functional alterations of already developed organs. The effects of the toxicants depends on the dose, threshold and duration. The effects of toxicity are:
# Minor structural deformities - e.g. Anticonvulsant drugs, Warfarin, Retinoic Acid derivatives
# Major structural deformities - e.g. DES (diethylstilbestrol), cigarette smoking
# Growth Retardation - e.g. Alcohol, Polychlorinated Biphenyls
# Functional alterations - e.g. Retinoic Acid derivatives, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Phenobarbitol, Lead
# Death- e.g. Rubella, ACE inhibitors

=== Effects on Neurulation ===
Neurulation is one of the most important stages in the development of vertebrates. It is the process of formation of a flat neural plate which then convolutes to form the hollow neural tube.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Scott (2014). ''Developmental biology''. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the main targets of developmental toxicity and defects in neurulation is a common consequence of toxicant exposure and results in large proportion of human defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60KwBgYNjMoC|title=Developmental Toxicology|last=CaroleAKimmel|date=1994-06-30|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780781701372|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) ===
{{main article|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder}}
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a term that constitutes the set of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during the course of pregnancy. These effects can include physical and cognitive problems. FASD patient usually has a combination of these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/fetalalcoholspectrumdisorders.html|title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: MedlinePlus|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extent of effect depends on exposure frequency, dose and rate of ethanol elimination from amniotic fluid. FAS disrupts normal development of the fetus, which may cause certain developmental stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recognizing and Managing Children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Effects: A Guidebook.|last=B.|first=McCreight,|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since alcohol elimination is slow in a fetus than in an adult and the fact that they do not have a developed liver to metabolize the alcohol, alcohol levels tend to remain high and stay in the fetus longer. Birth defects associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol can occur in the first three to eight weeks of pregnancy before a woman even knows that she is pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/|title=Home {{!}} FASD {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DES (diethylstilbestrol) ===
{{main article|Diethylstilbestrol}}
DES (diethylstilbestrol) is a drug that mimics [[estrogen]], a female hormone. From 1938 until 1971 doctors prescribed this drug to help some pregnant women who had had miscarriages or premature deliveries on the theory that miscarriages and premature births occurred because some pregnant women did not produce enough estrogen naturally to sustain the pregnancy for full term . An estimated 5-10 million pregnant women and the children born during this period were exposed to DES. Currently, DES is known to increase the risk of  breast cancer, and cause a variety of birth-related adverse outcomes exposed female offsprings such as spontaneous abortion, second-trimester pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, stillbirth, neonatal death, sub/infertility and cancer of reproductive tissues . DES is an important developmental toxicant which links the fetal basis of adult disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=Casey E.|last2=Fenton|first2=Suzanne E.|date=2013-06-01|title=Exposure to Diethylstilbestrol during Sensitive Life Stages: A legacy of heritable health effects|journal=Birth defects research.

==Theory==
Difference theory has roots in the studies of [[John Gumperz]], who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, ''A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication'', which itself drew on the work of Gumperz.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, ''Language and Gender: An advanced resource book'', pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Talbot makes reference to the term "gender-specific culture" in her critique of the difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, ''Communication between Men and Women in the Context of the Christian Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', pp. 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Women, Men and Language'', pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the popularity of Tannen's book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', and the resultant popularisation of difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Talbot98"&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in [[genderlect]] by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without "pointing the finger" at anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.&lt;ref name="Talbot98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Deborah Tannen and difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status v. support===
Tannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding v. advice===
Women seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.

===Information v. feelings===
Tannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.

===Orders v. proposals===
Men will use direct imperatives ("close the door", "switch on the light") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however ("let's", "would you mind if ...?").

===Conflict v. compromise===
Tannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of [[Walter J. Ong]], whose 1981 publication, ''Fighting for Life'', asserts that "expressed adversativeness" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence v. intimacy===
Difference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, "Let me consult this with my wife first." Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

General criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4198">'''Econometric Institute''' (Dutch ''Econometrisch Instituut'') at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] is a leading research institute&lt;ref&gt;The institute is ranked among the top 6% Economic Institutions. See [http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.inst.all.html Top 10% Economic Institutions, as of August 2013]. Accessed Sept 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fields of [[econometrics]] and [[management science]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch (2013) ''Yield Curve Modeling and Forecasting''. p. ii&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute offers advanced education in econometrics. It was founded in 1956 by [[Henri Theil]] in cooperation with [[Jan Tinbergen]].

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The first proposal for a special institute in quantitative economics at the Netherlands School of Economics in Rotterdam was made by [[Henri Theil]] in 1953 with support of [[Jan Tinbergen]], while working at the [[Central Planning Bureau]]. The senate of the school added the requirement that it "would not confine itself to economic applications, but would also give attention to business problems, which implied that operations research had to be included in the program."&lt;ref name="PGD 2007"&gt;Pedro Garcia Duarte (2007) ''Constructing Concepts of Optimal Monetary Policy in the Postwar Period.'' p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1955-56 Theil was Visiting Professor at the [[University of Chicago]], where he made a similar proposal again with support of [[Jan Tinbergen]]. This proposal was eventually accepted both in Chicago and in Rotterdam, and the Econometric Institute started September 1956 in Chicago&lt;ref name="PGD 2007"/&gt; and later in Rotterdam.

The Econometric Institute was the first research institute in the field of econometrics in the world, and started with a research staff of 6.&lt;ref name = "PHF 2005"&gt;[[Philip Hans Franses]] (2005) ''[http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/7860/ar2004.pdf Annual Report 2004: Econometric Institute]'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Theil became its first director, and headed the institute until 1966.

=== Development ===
In the early years the Institute developed a full academic program in Econometrics. The program originally focussed on "national and international macroeconomic policy; the required computing power to estimate econometric models was expensive and scarcely available, so that econometrics was almost exclusively applied in public (statistical) agencies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiaan Heij]] et al. (2004) ''Econometric Methods with Applications in Business and Economics''. Oxford University Press. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolved over the years. In this time many leading econometricians were guest at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Baldev Raj, J. Koerts (1992) ''Henri Theil's Contributions to Economics and Econometrics: Econometric theory and methodology. Vol. I''. Springer, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New millennium ===
In the new Millennium the Econometric Institute had "dismissed a strong emphasis on mathematics and statistics as research areas, and it embraced areas as finance, marketing and economics in general."&lt;ref&gt;Franses (2005; Preface)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the Econometric Institute served some 300 students at the BSc and MSc level, and 28 PhD students with a staff of 35.

'''Encyclopedia of Buddhist Arts''' ({{Lang-zh|t=世界佛教美術圖說大辭典|p=Shìjiè fójiào měishù túshuō dà cídiǎn}}) is a set of books that was started by the founder of [[Fo Guang Shan]], Venerable Master Hsing Yun. The project started in 2001 and was completed in March 2013. There are 20 volumes in total and the artwork spans all 5 continents with information from more than 30 countries. The project was made possible with the help of numerous scholars and volunteers, 300 monastics, 140 scholars from 16 different countries, and more than 400 volunteers. Fo Guang Shan has donated copies of the encyclopedia to libraries and academic institutions across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem113315.html |title=SOAS Library receives 20-volume Encyclopedia of Buddhist Arts donated by Fo Guang Shan Monastery |last= |first= |date=7 July 2016 |website= [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]] |publisher=[[University of London]] |access-date=17 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem113315.html |title=Fo Guang Shan Temple presents Encyclopedia of Buddhist Arts to the Lusi Wong Library

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14092">'''Entheogenic drugs''' have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous
historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using [[entheogen]]s, [[chemical substance]]s used in a [[religion|religious]], [[shamanism|shamanic]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology - Jurema-Preta (Mimosa tenuiflora [Willd.] Poir.): a review of its traditional use, phytochemistry and pharmacology |publisher=scielo.br |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-89132008000500010&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common era==
A Finnish study [[assay]]ed psilocybin concentrations in old [[herbarium]] specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old.&lt;ref name=Ohenoja1987&gt;{{cite journal |title=The occurrence of psilocybin and psilocin in Finnish fungi |journal=Journal of Natural Products |vauthors=Ohenoja E, Jokiranta J, Mäkinen T, Kaikkonen A, Airaksinen MM |year=1987 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=741–44 |pmid=3430170 |doi=10.1021/np50052a030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well-documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharon|first1=Douglas | author-link1=Douglas Sharon|title=Shamanism &amp; the sacred cactus: ethnoarchaeological evidence for San Pedro use in northern Perú|date=2000|publisher=San Diego Museum of Man|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0937808740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olmec entheogens===
The [[Olmec]] (12,000 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens:

#Burials of [[Bufo|Bufo toads]] with priests
#The use of entheogens in later Olmec-inspired cultures
#Sculptures of shamans and other figures have strong [[Therianthrope|Therianthropic]] imagery.

===Maya===
The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way.

The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, (better known by his contemporaries as Borhegyi) published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C  This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b,  "Mushroom Stones of Middle America," in Mushrooms, Russia and History  by [[Valentina Pavlovna Wasson|Valentina P. Wasson]] and [[R. Gordon Wasson]], eds. N.T.)

Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is based on the excavations of  Kidder and  Shook at the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave, discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons. Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these  Pre-Classic finds can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following".....(see Shook, E.M. &amp; Kidder, A.V., 1952. Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology &amp; History No. 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendents of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today.

===Aztec===
The [[Aztec entheogenic complex]] is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods," a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The [[Xochipilli]] statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs.

===Native Americans of the southwest United States===
There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences.

==Old World==

=== Paleolithic===
During the [[Paleolithic]], there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the "Flower Burial" in [[Shanidar Cave]], a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from [[Tassili n'Ajjer|Tassili, Algeria]] cave paintings depicting ''[[Psilocybe mairei]]'' mushrooms&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; dated 7000 to 9000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saromini|first1=Giorgio|title=The Oldest Representation of Hallucinogenic Mushrooms in the World|journal=Integration: Journal for Mind-Moving Plants and Culture|date=1992|volume=1|issue=2/3|url=http://www.samorini.it/doc1/sam/sam-1992-sahara.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2017}} Reprinted at [http://www.artepreistorica.com/2009/12/the-oldest-representations-of-hallucinogenic-mushrooms-in-the-world-sahara-desert-9000-%E2%80%93-7000-b-p/nggallery/thumbnails/ ArtePreistorica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Gaston|title=New Taxonomical and Ethnomycological Observations on Psilocybe S.S.

There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34539">In a paper delivered to the [[Aristotelian Society]] on 12 March 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Published immediately as Gallie (1956a); a later, slightly altered version appears in Gallie (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. B. Gallie|Walter Bryce Gallie]] (1912&amp;ndash;1998) introduced the term '''essentially contested concept''' to facilitate an understanding of the different applications or interpretations of the sorts of abstract, [[Qualitative properties|qualitative]], and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] notions&lt;ref&gt;They are "evaluative" in the sense that they deliver some sort of "value-judgement".&lt;/ref&gt;—such as "[[art]]" and "[[social justice]]"—used in the domains of [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of history]], and [[philosophy of religion]].

Garver (1978) describes their use as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term essentially contested concepts gives a name to a problematic situation that many people recognize: that in certain kinds of talk there is a variety of meanings employed for key terms in an argument, and there is a feeling that [[Dogma#Dogma outside of religion|dogmatism]] ("My answer is right and all others are wrong"), [[skepticism]] ("All answers are equally true (or false); everyone has a right to his own truth"), and [[eclecticism]] ("Each meaning gives a partial view so the more meanings the better") are none of them the appropriate attitude towards that variety of meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Garver (1978), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially contested concepts involve widespread agreement on a [[concept]] (e.g., "fairness"), but not on the best realization thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Hart (1961, p. 156) speaks of "a uniform or constant feature", and "a shifting or varying criterion used in determining when, for any given purposes, cases are alike or different".&lt;/ref&gt; They are "concepts the proper use of which inevitably involves endless disputes about their proper uses on the part of their users",&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 169. The dispute is about the proper use of the concept; and all argue that the concept is being "used inappropriately" by others (Smith, 2002, p. 332).&lt;/ref&gt; and these disputes "cannot be settled by appeal to [[empirical evidence]], linguistic usage, or the canons of logic alone".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1977), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying the presence of a dispute==

Although Gallie's term is widely used to denote imprecise use of [[technical terminology]], it has a far more specific application. And, although the notion could be misleadingly and evasively used to justify "agreeing to disagree",&lt;ref&gt;A statement that, in essence, is usually nothing more than a simple observation that the apparent dispute it is simply a consequence of the same label being applied to different referents.&lt;/ref&gt; the term offers something more valuable:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since its introduction by W.B. Gallie in 1956, the expression "essentially contested concept" has been treated both as a challenge and as an excuse by social theorists. It has been treated as a challenge in that theorists consider their uses of terms and concepts to be in competition with the uses advocated by other theorists, each theorist trying to be deemed the champion. It has been treated as an excuse in that, rather than acknowledge that the failure to reach agreement is due to such factors as imprecision, ignorance, or belligerence, instead theorists point to the terms and concepts under dispute and insist that they are always open to contest — that they are terms and concepts about which we can never expect to reach agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes (2000), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The disputes that attend an essentially contested concept are driven by substantive disagreements over a range of different, entirely [[reasonable]] (although perhaps mistaken) interpretations of a mutually-agreed-upon [[archetypical]] notion, such as the legal precept "treat like cases alike; and treat different cases differently", with "each party [continuing] to defend its case with what it claims to be convincing arguments, evidence and other forms of justification".&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a) p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallie speaks of how "This picture is painted in [[Oil paint|oils]]" can be successfully contested if the work is actually painted in [[tempera]];&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; while "This picture is a work of art" may meet strong opposition due to disputes over what "work of art" denotes. He suggests three avenues whereby one might resolve such disputes:
#Discovering a new meaning of "work of art" to which all disputants could thenceforward agree.
#Convincing all the disputants to conform to one meaning. 
#Declaring "work of art" to be a number of different concepts employing the same name.
 
Otherwise, the dispute probably centres on [[polysemy]].&lt;ref&gt;The embedded meaning of the term ''[[polysemy]]'' is that the polysemous word’s meanings have multiplied over time (in the sense of its original meaning being extended).
* When discussing finance, "bank" is an essentially contested concept; because the discussion involves establishing the "correct" application, meaning or interpretation of this polysemous term.
* In a different dispute over banks, where one speaks of [[Bank|financial institutions]] and the other of [[riparian zones]], it is obvious that two [[homonyms]] have been confused.&lt;/ref&gt;
Here, a number of critical questions must be asked:
* Has the term been incorrectly used, as in the case of mistakenly using [[Decimation (Roman Army)|decimated]] for devastated ([[catachresis]])?&lt;ref&gt;Which is "''a conflict between truth and error''" (Garver, 1990, p. 259)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Do two or more different concepts share the same word, as in the case of ''ear'', ''bank'', ''sound'', ''corn'', ''scale'', etc. ([[homonymy]])?&lt;ref&gt;Which is "''a disagreement generated because the parties to the conflict are [[talking past each other]]''" (Garver, 1990, p. 259) – the "talking past each other" is an allusion to the interaction between [[Thrasymachus]] and [[Socrates]] over the question of "justice" in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato dialogue)|Republic I]]'', where neither addressed any of the issues raised by the other. Gallie (1956a, p. 168.) speaks of this as being a case in which "''two '''different''' concepts about whose proper application no one need to have contested at all''" having become "'''confused'''".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is there a genuine dispute about the term's correct application that, in fact, ''can'' be resolved?
* Or, is it really the case that the term is an ''essentially contested concept''?

===Contested versus contestable===
Clarke has made a valuable contribution to the overall debate by suggesting that, in order to determine whether a particular dispute was a consequence of true polysemy or inadvertent homonymy, one should seek to "locate the source of the dispute".

This source might be "within the concept itself", or "[within] some underlying non-conceptual disagreement between the contestants".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1979), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke then drew attention to the substantial differences between the expressions "essentially contested" and "essentially contestable", that were being extensively used within the literature as though they were interchangeable.

Clarke argued that to state that a concept is merely "contested" is to "attribute significance to the contest rather than to the concept". Yet, to state that a concept is "contestable" is to "attribute some part of any contest to the concept". In other words, this is "to claim that some feature or property of the concept makes it polysemantic, and that the concept contains some internal conflict of ideas"; and it is this fact that provides the "essentially contested concept" with its ''inherent potential'' for "generating disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1979), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In 1956 Gallie proposed a set of seven conditions for the existence of an essentially contested concept.&lt;ref&gt;See Gallie (1956a).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallie was very specific about the limits of his enterprise: it dealt exclusively with abstract, qualitative notions, such as ''art'', ''religion'', ''science'', ''democracy'', and ''social justice''&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), passim. Kekes (1977, p. 71) offers ''art'', ''morality'', ''logic'', ''the novel'', ''nature'', ''rationality'', ''democracy'', ''culture'', ''science'', and ''philosophy'' as another set of examples of "concepts" that are ''essentially contested''.&lt;/ref&gt; (and, if Gallie’s choices are contrasted with negatively regarded concepts such as ''evil'', ''disease'', ''superstition'', etc., it is clear that the concepts he chose were exclusively positively regarded).

Freeden remarks that "not all essentially contested concepts signify valued achievements; they may equally signify disapproved and denigrated phenomena",&lt;ref&gt;Freeden (1998), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerring&lt;ref&gt;Gerring (1999), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; asks us to imagine just how difficult it would be to "[try] to craft definitions of slavery, fascism, terrorism, or genocide without recourse to 'pejorative' attributes".

These features distinguish Gallie's "essentially contested concepts" from others, "which can be shown, as a result of analysis or experiment, to be radically confused";&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; or, as Gray&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1977), p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; would have it, they are the features that relate to the task of distinguishing the "general words, which really denote an essentially contested concept" from those other "general words, whose uses conceal a diversity of distinguishable concepts":&lt;ref&gt;They are unpackings of, elaborations upon, or extensions of Gallie's original seven features that have been made by a very wide range of scholars spread over a wide range of academic and intellectual pursuits over the last 60 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Essentially contested concepts are ''evaluative'', and they deliver ''value-judgements''.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin stresses that whilst "''not all value judgements are appraisive''", "''[any act of] appraisal presupposes an accepted set of criteria''" (Baldwin (1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Essentially contested concepts denote comprehensively evaluated entities that have an ''internally complex'' character.&lt;ref&gt;For this reason, Benn and Gaus (1983, pp. 3-5) advocate using the term "''complex-structured concepts''".&lt;/ref&gt;
#The evaluation must be attributed to the internally complex entity ''as a whole''. 
#The different ''constituent elements'' of that internally complex entity are initially ''variously describable''.
#The different users of the concept will often allocate substantially different orders of ''relative importance'', substantially different "''weights''", and/or substantially different ''interpretations'' to each of those constituent elements.
#Psychological and sociological causes influence the extent to which any particular ''consideration'' is ''salient'' for a given individual, regarded as a ''stronger reason'' by that individual than by another, and regarded as ''a reason'' by one individual and not by another.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1990), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The disputed concepts are ''open-ended''&lt;ref&gt;Gallie cites "''democracy''" an example of a concept being "''open''" in its character: "''Politics being the art of the possible, '''democratic targets will be raised or lowered as circumstances alter''', and democratic achievements are always judged in the light of such alterations''" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 186, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; and vague, and are subject to considerable modification in the light of ''changing circumstances''.&lt;ref&gt;Because, in the absence of this condition, it is possible that experience could establish one ''instantiation'' as "''universally more acceptable than another''" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 174).&lt;/ref&gt;
#This further modification can neither be ''predicted'' nor ''prescribed'' in advance.
#Whilst, by Gallie's express stipulation, there is no ''best'' instantiation of an essentially contested concept (or, at least, none knowable to be the best), it is also obvious that some instantiations will be considerably ''better'' than others;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton (1985), p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt; and, furthermore, even if one particular instantiation seems best at the moment, there is always the possibility that a new, better instantiation will emerge in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1990), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each party knows and recognizes that its own peculiar usage/interpretation of the concept is disputed by others who, in their turn, hold different and quite incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;For, otherwise, it would only be, at best, an essentially "''contestable''" concept.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each party must (at least to a certain extent) understand the criteria upon which the other participants’ (repudiated) views are based.
#Disputes centred on essentially contested concepts are "perfectly genuine", "not resolvable by argument",&lt;ref&gt;Connolly (1974, p. 40) expressed the view that once the participants in a particular political dispute realized that the concept was an essentially contested concept, the ensuing political discussions would be far more "''enlightened''" (Connolly, 1974, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt; and "nevertheless sustained by perfectly respectable arguments and evidence".&lt;ref&gt;All from Gallie (1956a), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Each party's use of their own specific usage/interpretation is driven by a need to ''uphold'' their own particular (''correct'', ''proper'' and ''superior'') usage/interpretation against that of all other (''incorrect'', ''improper'' and ''irrational'') users.
#Because the use of an essentially contested concept is always the application of one use ''against'' all other uses, any usage is intentionally ''aggressive'' and ''defensive''.
#Because it is essentially contested, rather than "radically confused", the continued use of the essentially contested concept is justified by the fact that, despite all of their on-going disputation, ''all'' of the competitors acknowledge that the contested concept is derived from a ''single common exemplar''.&lt;ref&gt;This agreement is ''a pre-requisite for'' the argument, it is not ''a consequence of'' the argument. See McKnight (2003), p. 261; and Perry (1977), p. 25. In an attempt to account for cases where disputants trace their individual notions back to ''entirely different'', but ''mutually compatible exemplars'', Connolly (1974, p. 14) proposes that we think of the shared exemplar as a "cluster concept".&lt;/ref&gt;
#The continued use of the essentially contested concept also helps to sustain and develop our understanding of the concept's original exemplar/s.

== Concepts and conceptions ==
Scholars such as [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[John Rawls]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], and [[Steven Lukes]] have variously embellished Gallie's proposal by arguing that certain of the difficulties encountered with Gallie’s proposition may be due a consequence of the unintended [[Conflation#Logic|conflation]] of two separate domains associated with the term ''concept'':
: (a) the ''concepts'' (the abstract, ideal ''notions'' themselves), and
: (b) the ''conceptions'' (the particular ''instantiations'', or ''realizations'' of those ideal and abstract notions).&lt;ref&gt;The concept/conception terminology seems to originate with Gallie's (1956a) own comment that, whilst they might still continue to employ the contested ''concept'', the "different teams [could] come to hold… very different ''conceptions'' of how the game should be played" (p. 176, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, Hart (1961), Rawls (1971), Dworkin (1972), and Lukes (1974) distinguished between the "unity" of a notion and the "multiplicity" of its possible instantiations.

From their work it is easy to understand the issue as one of determining whether there is a single notion that has a number of different instantiations, or whether there is more than one notion, each of which is reflected in a different ''usage''.

In a section of his 1972 article in ''The New York Review of Books'', Dworkin used the example of "fairness" to isolate and elaborate the difference between a ''concept'' (''[[Jedem das Seine|suum cuique]]'') and its ''conception'' (various instantiations, for example [[utilitarian ethics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin (1972), pp. 27-28 (an almost identical passage appears at Dworkin, 1972, pp. 134-135). The four-paragraph passage is in Section II of the article [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10204]. It commences with "''But the theory of… ''" and ends with "''…I try to answer it ''".&lt;/ref&gt;

He supposes that he has instructed his children not to treat others "unfairly" and asks us to recognize that, whilst he would have undoubtedly had particular "examples" (of the sorts of conduct he was intending to discourage) in mind at the time he spoke to his children, whatever it was that he ''meant'' when he issued such instructions was not confined to those "examples" alone, for two reasons:

#"I would expect my children to apply my instructions to situations I had not and could not have thought about."
#"I stand ready to admit that some particular act I had thought was fair when I spoke was in fact unfair, or vice versa, if one of my children is able to convince me of that later."

Dworkin argues that this admission of error would not entail any "change" to his original instructions, because the true ''meaning'' of his instructions was that "[he] meant the family to be guided by the ''concept'' of fairness, not by any specific ''conception'' of fairness [that he] might have had in mind". Therefore, he argues, his instructions do, in fact, "cover" this new case.
 
Exploring what he considers to be the "crucial distinction" between the overall ''concept'' of "fairness" and some particular, and specific ''conception'' of "fairness", he asks us to imagine a group whose members share the view that certain acts are ''unfair''.&lt;ref&gt;These unfair acts involve either "a wrongful division of benefits and burdens, or a wrongful attribution of praise or blame".&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of this group "agree on a great number of standard cases of unfairness and use these as benchmarks against which to test other, more controversial cases".

In these circumstances, says Dworkin, "the group has a ''concept'' of unfairness, and its members may appeal to that concept in moral instruction or argument."&lt;ref&gt;Emphasis added to original.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the members may still disagree over many of these "controversial cases"; and differences of this sort indicate that members ''have'', or ''act upon'', entirely different theories of why and how each of the "standard cases" are, in fact, genuine acts of "unfairness".

And, because each considers that certain principles "[which] must be relied upon to show that a particular division or attribution is unfair" are far a more "fundamental" sort of principle than certain other principles, it can be said that members of the group have different ''conceptions'' of "fairness".

Consequently, those responsible for giving "instructions", and those responsible for setting "standards" of "fairness", in this community may be doing one of two things:
#Appealing to the ''concept'' of "fairness", by demanding that others act "fairly". In this case, those instructed to act "fairly" are responsible for "developing and applying their own conception of fairness as controversial cases arise".&lt;ref&gt;He notes that this does not "[grant] them a discretion to act as they like''"; but, from the fact that "it assumes that one conception is superior to another", it is clear that "it sets a standard they must try — and may fail — to meet".&lt;/ref&gt; Each of those issuing the instructions (or setting the standards) may have quite different explanations underlying their actions; and, also, they may well change their explanations from time to time, without ever changing the standards they set.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, we could say, there is a demand for [[orthopraxy]] (the correctness of action), not for [[orthodoxy]] (the correctness of thought).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Laying down a particular ''conception'' of "fairness"; by, for example, specifying that all hard cases were to be decided "by applying the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]]".

It is important to recognize that rather than it just being a case of delivering two different instructions; it is a case of delivering two different ''kinds'' of instruction:
#In the case of the appeal to the ''concept'' of "fairness", one invokes the ideal (and, implicitly, the universally agreed upon) notion of "fairness"; and whatever one might believe is the best ''instantiation'' of that notion is, by and large, irrelevant. 
#In the case of laying down a ''conception'' of "fairness", one specifies what one believes to be the best instantiation of the notion "fairness"; and, by this action, one specifies what one ''means'' by "fairness"; and whatever one might believe is the ideal ''notion'' of "fairness" is, by and large, irrelevant.

As a consequence, according to Dworkin, whenever an appeal is made to "fairness", a moral issue is raised; and, whenever a conception of "fairness" is laid down, an attempt is being made to answer that moral issue.

==Not "hotly disputed" concepts==
Whilst Gallie's expression "essentially contested concepts" precisely denotes those "essentially questionable and corrigible concepts" which "are permanently and essentially subject to revision and question",&lt;ref&gt;Hampshire (1965), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; close examination of the wide and varied and imprecise applications of Gallie's term subsequent to 1956, by those who have ascribed their own literal meaning to Gallie's term without ever consulting Gallie's work, have led many philosophers to conclude that "essentially disputed concepts" would have been far better choice for Gallie's meaning, for at least three reasons:

#Gallie's term has led many to the mistaken belief that he spoke of ''hotly disputed'', rather than ''essentially disputed'' concepts.&lt;ref&gt;See Waldron (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Expressly stipulating that a specific issue can never be resolved, and then calling it a "contest" seems both absurd and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;There seems to be a radical fault in the very notion of a contest that can not by its nature be won or lost. (Gray, 1999, p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt;
#Any assertion that "essentially contested" concepts are ''[[Commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]]'' made at the same time as an assertion that "they have any common subject-matter" is incoherent; and, also, it reveals an "inconsistency in the idea of essential contestability".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1999), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Waldron]]'s research has revealed that Gallie's notion has "run wild" in the law review literature over the ensuing 60 years and is now being used to denote something like "very hotly contested, with no resolution in sight",&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002, p. 149) found that the following concepts had been labelled as "essentially contested" in the [[Westlaw]] database: alienation, autonomy, author, bankruptcy, boycott, citizenship, civil rights, coherence, community, competition, the Constitution, corruption, culture, discrimination, diversity, equality, equal protection, freedom, harm, justification, liberalism, merit, motherhood, the national interest, nature, popular sovereignty, pornography, power, privacy, property, proportionality, prosperity, prostitution, public interest, punishment, reasonable expectations, religion, republicanism, rights, sovereignty, speech, sustainable development, and textuality.&lt;/ref&gt; due to an entirely mistaken view&lt;ref&gt;Of course, the equivalent view about the term in general is reasonable: it merely uses the descriptive [[definition]]. The descriptive definition is still a definition, even if one may think it less interesting than Gallie's definition.&lt;/ref&gt; that the ''essential'' in Gallie's term is an "[[intensifier]]", when, in fact, "[Gallie's] term 'essential' refers to the location of the disagreement or indeterminacy; it is contestation at the core, not just at the borderlines or penumbra of a concept".&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002), pp. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet is also clear that "if the notion of logical justification can be applied only to such theses and arguments as can be presumed capable of gaining in the long run universal agreement, the disputes to which the uses of any essentially contested concept give rise are not genuine or rational disputes at all"{{clarify|date=May 2012}} (Gallie, 1956a, p.&amp;nbsp;188).

Thus, Gallie argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So long as contestant users of any essentially contested concept believe, however deludedly, that their own use of it is the only one that can command honest and informed approval, they are likely to persist in the hope that they will ultimately persuade and convert all their opponents by logical means. But once [we] let the truth out of the bag — i.e., the essential contestedness of the concept in question — then this harmless if deluded hope may well be replaced by a ruthless decision to cut the cackle, to damn the heretics and to exterminate the unwanted.&lt;ref&gt;Gallie, 1956a, pp. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Félix Thomas''' (1815-1875) was a French architect and painter born in [[Nantes]], France in 1815. After graduating from high school [[Lycée Georges Clemenceau (Nantes)|Clemenceau]], he studied  architecture and drafting at the Polytechnique before being admitted to the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Beaux-Arts]] where he studied art under [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]]. His skills as a draftsman led him to work as project architect on several major archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia and Assyria during the early 1850s. Archaeological work provided opportunities for Thomas to demonstrate his skills as an illustrator and interpreter of historic architectural buildings and he co-authored an important early book on the archaeology of Nineveh in Assyria. He turned to full-time painting in his later life and is noted for works within the Orientalist genre.

==Career==

[[File:Gegenüsberstellung der Genien Nimrud-Khorsabad.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the book,''Nineveh and Assyria'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, 1867]]
Initially, Thomas trained as an architect or draftsman at l'Ecole Polytechnique (1834–35). He subsequently studied art at [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Beaux-Arts]] where he was a pupil of [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]] who specialised in the history of architecture. In 1845, Thomas won the first [[Prix de Rome]] for a project in Architecture Cathedral. In 1849 he submitted 14 drawings of Neptune's Temple at Paestum which were very well received. In 1850, he travelled to Greece and on his way stopped at Constantinople and Smyrna.&lt;ref&gt;Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 923&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1850s, Thomas joined several archaeological expeditions in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Assyria]] in his capacity as an architect. The first of these expeditions was led by [[Fulgence Fresnel]] and [[Julius Oppert]], commencing in 1851. Thomas was expected to describe the monuments and buildings that were discovered as well as to carry out quantity surveys, draw plans, prepare sketches and generally assist with documentation and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, M.T., ''The Conquest of Assyria: Excavations in an Antique Land,'' Routledge, 2014, pp 307-08 and p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; He was also required to make casts and stampings of inscriptions, using the new and still secret procedure developed by Lattin de Laval. Due to ill-health, Thomas left Fresnel's Mesopotamian mission prematurely. In spite of that, he still managed to contribute twelve maps to the book of the expedition, ''Expedition Scientifique En Mésopotamie: Exécutée Par Ordre Du Gouvernement De 1851 À  1854'' by Julius Oppert.&lt;ref&gt;Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;

After recovering from his illness, Thomas rejoined the archaeological team for the Assyrian excavation in 1852. The excavations, originally started by [[Paul-Emile Botta]] in 1843, were languishing, and the French government was determined to mount a large-scale operation in Assyria to showcase its dominance in the region. [[Victor Place]], the new French Consul in Mosul hired Thomas to join the expedition as the project designer. The mission which involved the excavation of the palace of the Assyrian King [[Sargon II]] in [[Dur-Sharrukin|Khorsabad]] (formerly [[Nineveh]]), would become the first systematic excavation of the site. Thomas made substantial contributions to the success of the excavation through his acute observations, the boldness of his reconstructions and the quality of his drawings which contributed to a rich understanding of the architecture of the Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Assyrian antiquities were lost when the expedition's boat sank at Qnra, on the [[Tigris]], following an attack by local rebels in May, 1855. However, Thomas, who had left earlier, retained his sketches, plans and drawings which subsequently served to illustrate a pioneering text on Assyria and the Palace of King Sargon II entitled ''Ninevah and Assyria'', jointly authored by Victor Place and Felix Thomas in around 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, C.K., ''The Near East: Archaeology in the Cradle of Civilization,'' Routledge, 2005, pp 40-41; Tanner, J.P., “Ancient Babylon: From Gradual Demise to Archaeological Rediscovery,” ''Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin,'' Vol. 47 ,2002, pp 11-20; Library notes on ''Ninive et L'Assyrie, Consul General Avec Des Essais De Restauration,'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, [3 volume set],  Imprimerie Imperiale, Paris, 1857, Online: https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libro/primera-edicion/tapa-dura/precio-min/30/vi/960590/sortby/1/; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, Thomas became a major collaborator and co-author of an important archaeological treatise.

On his return to France, Thomas gave up archaeology and devoted himself to painting. He joined the studio of [[Charles Gleyre]] who became his mentor. His travels in Italy, Greece, and Turkey and the Middle East inspired his artistic vision and he began painting works in the Orientalist genre. He enjoyed only modest success in his second career as a painter. Towards the end of his life, he divided his time between his studio in Nantes and [[Pornic]] on the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, M.T., ''The Conquest of Assyria: Excavations in an Antique Land: 1840-1860,'' Psychology Press, 1996, p. 353; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; The Baron de Girardot, in a book dedicated to him, said about him, "Modest to a fault, withdrawn and lonely, he painted for him." &lt;ref&gt;M. de Girardot, ''Felix Thomas, grand Prix de Rome Architecte, Peintre, Graveur, Sculpteur,'' Nantes, 1875&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas died in Nantes in April 1875.

The '''Fraser of Allander Institute,''' abbreviated to '''FAI''', is an independent research unit and part of the Department of Economics at the [[University of Strathclyde]]. It specialises in researching the [[Economy of Scotland|Scottish economy]]. 

The FAI covers a number of primary areas of research, including the Scottish economy, macroeconomic modelling, fiscal analysis, energy and climate change, the labour market and standard of living analysis. It regularly publishes analysis on its blog which receives widespread media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-45271076|title=What is Gers and how is it calculated?|date=2018-08-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAI is impartial and its research has been used by both sides of the political spectrum in the [[Scottish Parliament]].

The director of the institute is Professor Graeme Roy, a former Senior Economic Adviser and head of the First Minister's Policy Unit under [[Nicola Sturgeon]]. 

== History ==
The Fraser of Allander Institute was formed by the [[University of Strathclyde]] in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-35461445|title=Economic institute eyes research growth|date=2016-02-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its primary goal is to research the Scottish economy. It is based in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. 

From 2017, [[Deloitte]] announced that they would be acting as the main sponsor of the Fraser of Allander Institute Economic Commentary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/15516871.Fraser_of_Allander_in_partnership_with_accountant/|title=Fraser of Allander in partnership with accountant|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Research overview ==

=== Commentary ===
Due to the independent position of the [[research institute]], it has no bias towards any political agendas or parties. FAI research has been used by both sides of the political spectrum in [[Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=10890&amp;mode=pdf|title=Meeting of the Parliament Wednesday 19 April 2017|last=|first=|date=19 April 2017|website=The Scottish Parliament|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=11262&amp;i=102575|title=Meeting of the Parliament 13 December 2017|last=|first=|date=13 December 2017|website=The Scottish Parliament|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1975, the Fraser of Allander Institute has produced a quarterly economic commentary on [[Scotland]]. The Fraser of Allander Institute Economic Commentary provides an analysis of current economic performance, as well as examining future opportunities and risks within the [[Scottish economy]]. This includes forecasts for both the labour market and economic growth, as well as a section on government policy.

The economic commentary is also used as a platform by leading experts in [[academia]] and other sectors to share their research in the Economic Perspectives section.

Since 2016, the FAI has published a yearly report, studying the [[Scottish budget]]. The research analyses the effect of economic, budgetary and policy changes on the Scottish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insider.co.uk/news/current-spending-key-public-services-11238799|title=Current spending on key public services not sustainable says Fraser of Allander Institute|last=McCulloch|first=Scott|date=2017-09-26|work=businessInsider|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report receives widespread media and political coverage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41388256|title=Public services 'face spending restraint'|date=2017-09-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; .  

The FAI also produces a regular report studying the performance of the Scottish labour market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/labour-market-%E2%80%98holding-well%E2%80%99-despite-unemployment-rise-scotland|title=Labour market ‘holding up well’ despite unemployment rise in Scotland|date=2017-11-15|work=Holyrood Magazine|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveys ===
The FAI, in partnership with the Scottish Chamber of Commerce, is responsible for producing the Quarterly Economic Indicator Survey. It is considered the longest running survey of the Scottish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-40657052|title=Scots economy 'facing challenges ahead'|date=2017-07-20|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It studies a number of business trends in the Scottish economy, such as optimism, sales and investment, and examines individual sectors within the Scottish economy. Each quarter, various newspapers and publications cover the economic survey as an indicator of general economic performance in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/business/scottish-businesses-remain-optimistic-survey-shows-1-4595903|title=Scottish businesses remain optimistic, survey shows|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAI also produces the Scottish Business monitor on a quarterly basis in partnership with the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16143481.Scots_economy_flat_but_pick-up_projected/|title=Scots economy flat but pick-up projected|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Business Monitor examines a range of business indicators including volume of business, turnover, investment and export activity. It is frequently mentioned in both Scottish and UK-wide press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-42419409|title=Exports 'lift outlook' for Scottish firms|date=2017-12-20|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In partnership with Aberdeen &amp; Grampian Chamber of Commerce, the FAI also produces a quarterly report into the oil &amp; gas industry in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insider.co.uk/news/fraser-allander-north-sea-oil-12658052|title=North Sea optimism 'returning as oil price rises'|last=Gallagher|first=Rosemary|date=2018-06-06|work=businessInsider|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allander series ===
The Allander series was produced by the FAI to study the economic future of [[Scotland]]. The series has had contributions from a number of notable economists. These have included [[Heather Joshi]], [[Robert E. Wright]] and [[Nicholas Crafts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12522552.Allander_Series/|title=Allander Series|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable contributors include [[James Heckman]] and [[Paul Krugman]], both winners of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel prize in Economics]], as well as [[William Baumol]] who was shortlisted for the Nobel prize in Economics.

The series has led to a number of publications, research papers, a lecture series and literature specialising in the regional context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/business/markets-economy/strength-in-numbers-1-1390359|title=Strength in numbers|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content from the series has contributed to building various economic models and strategies, including the [[Scottish government]]'s economic strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2007/11/12115041/7|title=The Government Economic Strategy|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2007-11-13|website=www.gov.scot|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable outputs ===
In March 2018, the FAI released its economic commentary on the [[Scottish economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-s-economic-policy-under-fire-as-growth-flatlines-1-4713872|title=SNP’s economic policy under fire as growth flatlines|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commentary's criticism of the ‘cluttered policy landscape’ within the Scottish Government was debated in [[Parliament]] and also received global press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insider.co.uk/news/fraser-of-allander-economic-commentary-12264093|title=Fraser of Allander Institute says Scottish Government has 'lost' its economic focus|last=Gates|first=Philip|date=2018-03-28|work=businessInsider|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commissioned works ==

=== Specialist research ===
In 2014, the FAI produced a paper studying the links between constitutional change and inequality affected [[Scotland]]. It was published in the [[Oxford Review of Economic Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comerford|first=D.|last2=Eiser|first2=D.|date=2014-06-01|title=Constitutional change and inequality in Scotland|url=https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/30/2/346/521772?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy|language=en|volume=30|issue=2|pages=346–373|doi=10.1093/oxrep/gru014|issn=0266-903X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Brexit vote]], the FAI carried out research into the potential effects of [[Brexit]] on different sectors within the Scottish economy. The study covered the various outcomes of Brexit and how it could affect Scotland. A bad outcome for [[Scotland]] could result in a reduction in GDP of £8 billion, jobs by 80,000 and wages an average of £2,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37564729|title=Brexit 'could cost Scotland 80,000 jobs'|date=2016-10-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the report showed that a [[Hard Brexit]] could lead to problems, it was stated that some sectors in Scotland would fare quite well, when compared to the rest of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/hard-brexit-scotland-wages-gdp-employment-england-migration-fraser-allander-institute-2016-10|title=A 'Hard Brexit' will kill 80,000 Scottish jobs but still cause a wave of migration to Scotland|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, the FAI has published a survey of Scottish businesses on their preparations for [[Brexit]]. The survey found that 44% of the Scottish businesses had noted a negative impact since the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on European Union membership]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/scottish-business-split-on-brexit-impact-mmwxhjv7q|title=Scottish business split on Brexit impact|last=Scottish Business Editor|first=Greig Cameron|date=2018-08-07|work=The Times|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAI studied the economic impact of college graduates in Scotland. The research showed that colleges could generate £20 billion for the [[Scottish economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-41412389|title=Scottish colleges 'could generate £20bn'|date=2017-09-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, the FAI was commissioned to research the economic impact of the commercial property sector on the [[Scottish economy]]. According to the data the sector contributed £2.4 billion to the Scottish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-43324827|title=Real estate sector valued at £2.4bn|date=2018-03-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydroseeding''' (or hydraulic mulch seeding, hydro-mulching, hydraseeding) is a [[planting]] process that uses a [[slurry]] of [[seed]] and [[mulch]]. It is often used as an [[erosion control]] technique on construction sites, as an alternative to the traditional process of [[broadcast seeding|broadcasting]] or [[sowing]] dry seed.

==Description==
The hydroseeding slurry is transported in a tank, either truck-mounted or trailer-mounted and sprayed over prepared ground. [[Helicopter]]s have been used to cover larger areas. Aircraft application may also be used on burned [[wilderness]] areas [[Post fire seeding|after a fire]], and in such uses may contain only soil stabilizer to avoid introducing [[Introduced species|non-native plant]] species. Hydroseeding is an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed. A study conducted along the lower [[Colorado River]] in Arizona, the United States found that hydroseeding could be used to restore riparian vegetation in cleared land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R.G. |last=Matthew |author2=A.M. Michael |author3=M.K. Martin |author4=E.R. Barbara |author5=M.G. Gregg |author6=P.B. Daniel |year=2011 |title=Direct seeding for riparian tree re-vegetation: Small-scale field study of seeding methods and irrigation techniques |journal=Ecological Engineering |volume=37 |pages=864–872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slurry often has other ingredients including [[fertilizer]], [[Tackifier|tackifying agents]], fiber mulch, and green dye.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Transportation (CalTrans). Sacramento, CA. [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/construc/stormwater/CSBMPM_303_Final.pdf "Construction Site Best Management Practices (BMP) Manual."] Section 3, BMP No. SS-4. March 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originating back to the USA in the 1940s, Maurice Mandell from the Connecticut Highway Department discovered that by mixing seed and water together, the resulting mulch could be spread and sprayed over the steep and otherwise inaccessible slopes of the Connecticut expressways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Hydroseeding|url=https://oliverbrownltd.co.uk/hydroseeding/the-history-of-hydroseeding/|website=Oliver Brown Ltd|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
If planting a relatively large area, hydroseeding &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampalandscaping.org/lawncare-tips/ |title=Lawncare via. Hydroseeding |first=Owen |last=Cook |publisher=Tampa Landscaping |date=2016-05-04 |accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be completed in a very short period of time. It can be very effective for hillsides and sloping lawns to help with erosion control and quick planting. Hydro seeding will typically cost less than planting with sod, but more than broadcast seeding. Results are often quick with high germination rates producing grass growth in about a week and mowing maintenance beginning around 3 to 4 weeks from the date of application. Fiber mulch accelerates the growing process by maintaining moisture around the seeds thereby increasing the rate of germination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutlawns.com/lawn-maintenance-care/planting-and-repair/planting-by-hydroseeding.php |title=Planting by Hydroseeding |first=Dawn |last=West |publisher=All About Lawns |date=2006-08-21 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Art and Ideas'''&lt;ref&gt;https://iai.tv/about-iai/introducing-iai&lt;/ref&gt; is an arts organisation founded in 2008 in London. Its programming includes the world's largest philosophy and music festival, [[HowTheLightGetsIn]]&lt;ref name="iai"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iai.tv/about-iai/introducing-iai |title=Introducting the IAI. |publisher=Institute of Art and Ideas |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the online channel [https://iai.tv/player IAI TV], where talks and debates can be accessed for free, under the slogan "Philosophy for our times."&lt;ref name="iai"/&gt;

The IAI's main offering, [[HowTheLightGetsIn]], is held annually in [[Hay-on-Wye]] at the globe at Hay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeathay.org/about-us/ |title=About the globe. |publisher=The globe at Hay |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAI is led by its founding director, the British post-realist philosopher and former broadcaster [[Hilary Lawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iai.tv/home/host/hilary-lawson |title=Hilary Lawson: Profile. |publisher=Institute of Art and Ideas |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IAI TV==

IAI TV is an online channel where the debates and talks curated by the IAI are released and made available online. Subjects include philosophy, science, politics and art.

In September 2016 the videos had received in excess of 670,000 views, reaching over 1,000,000 people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/interview-hilary-lawson-director-of-how-the-light-gets-in/ |title=Interview: Hilary Lawson, Director of How the Light Gets In. |publisher=Wales Art Review |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hilary Lawson in an interview in 2014: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the things we're up to is breaking down the idea of philosophy as being the sort of thing that is undertaken only by a specialist and is impenetrable. Not to say laughable, frankly. And I think when we started – I founded the Institute of Art and Ideas seven years ago, two years before the first HowTheLightGetsIn – that was indeed the only way people thought about philosophy. But every human being, in a way, is a philosopher. Because that's what it is to be human. You wonder about life. You wonder about what you're doing. You wonder about where you're going. You wonder: "What the hell's going on"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/apr/27/howthelightgetsin-2014-philosophy-music-hay-on-wye |title=HowTheLightGetsIn 2014: philosophy, music and thought for all |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Intellectual cover''' is a usually negative term for sophisticated arguments provided by members of the intelligentsia to bolster a particular viewpoint, and thereby help it gain respectability. Usually the viewpoint is one that a supporter (e.g. a politician) leaned toward anyway, but needed arguments to help him justify to others. The implication is that the supporter is not really interested in the truth but is just looking for an excuse to hold a certain position. For instance, it has been alleged that [[free market economics]] serve as intellectual cover for a "predator state."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mises.org/journals/scholar/MacKenzie15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers into the characteristics of minorities have been accused of providing intellectual cover for bigots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination|author=Nelson, Todd D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Testament]] scholar [[Gerhard Kittel]] was accused of offering intellectual cover to the [[Nazi]]s' [[genocidal]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=99|number=4|date=Fall 2009|issn=1553-0604|author=Levenson, Alan T.|title=The Mismeasure of the Jew|publisher=Jewish Quarterly Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Morris''' (née '''Jane Burden'''; 19 October 1839&amp;nbsp;– 26 January 1914) was an embroiderer and English [[Model (art)|artists' model]] who embodied the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of beauty. She was a model and [[muse]] to [[William Morris]] (1834–1896), the English [[textile design]]er, [[poetry|poet]], [[novel]]ist, [[translation|translator]], and [[Socialism|socialist activist]], whom she later married, and to [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].

==Life==
[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Proserpine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jane Morris painted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] as ''Proserpine'' (1874)]]
[[File:Jane Burden at 18 by William Morris.jpg|thumb|Jane sketched by Morris at age 18, while engaged to him]]
[[File:Jane and Jenny Morris circa 1864 by H. Smith.jpg|150px|thumb|Jane and Jenny Morris, circa 1864]]
[[File:Jane and May Morris circa 1865.jpg|thumb|Jane and May Morris, circa 1865]]
Jane Burden was born in [[Oxford]], the daughter of a [[stable]]man, Robert Burden, and his wife Ann Maizey, who was a laundress. At the time of her birth, her parents were living at St Helen's Passage, in the parish of [[St Peter-in-the-East]], off [[Holywell Street]] in Oxford which has since been marked with a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisle, Nicola, Cinderella story and others''[[Oxfordshire Limited Edition]]'', no. 249, pages 23–25, October 2007; and [http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/burden.html picture of blue plaque]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother Ann was [[wikt:illiterate|illiterate]] and probably came to Oxford as a [[Domestic service|domestic servant]]. Little is known of Jane Burden's childhood, but it was poor and deprived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jane &amp; May Morris: A Biographical Story|last=Marsh|first=Jan|publisher=Printed Word|year=2000|isbn=|location=Horsham, UK|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1857, Burden and her sister Elizabeth, known as "Bessie," attended a performance of the [[Drury Lane]] Theatre Company in Oxford. Jane Burden was noticed by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who were members of a group of artists painting the [[Oxford Union murals]], based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tales. Struck by her beauty, they asked her to [[Model (art)|model]] for them. Burden sat mostly for Rossetti as a model for Queen [[Guinevere]] and afterwards for [[William Morris]], who was working on an easel painting, ''La Belle [[Iseult]]'', now in the [[Tate Gallery]]. During this period, Morris fell in love with Burden and they became engaged, though by her own admission she was not in love with Morris.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Burden's education was limited and she was probably destined to go into [[domestic service]] like her mother. After her engagement, she was privately educated to become a gentleman's wife. Her keen intelligence allowed her to recreate herself. She was a voracious reader who became proficient in French and Italian, and she became an accomplished pianist with a strong background in [[European classical music|classical music]]. Her manners and speech became refined to an extent that contemporaries referred to her as "Queenly." Later in life, she had no trouble moving in upper-class circles. She was possibly the model for the heroine of the 1884 novel ''Miss Brown'' by [[Vernon Lee]] upon which [[George Bernard Shaw]] based the character of Eliza Doolittle in his play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1914) and the later film ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). She also became a skilled needlewoman who would be later renowned for her embroideries.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Jane married William Morris at [[St Michael at the Northgate]] in Oxford on 26 April 1859. Her father was described as a [[Groom (horses)|groom]], in stables at 65 [[Holywell Street]]. After the marriage, the Morrises lived at [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in [[Bexleyheath]], Kent. While living there, they had two daughters, [[Jane Alice Morris|Jane Alice]] "Jenny," born in January 1861, and [[May Morris|Mary "May"]] (March 1862–1938), who later edited her father's works. They moved to 26 Queen Square in London, which they shared with the design firm of [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co]]., and later bought Kelmscott House in [[Hammersmith]] as their main residence.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1871, Morris and Rossetti took out a joint tenancy on [[Kelmscott Manor]] on the Gloucestershire–[[Oxfordshire]]–[[Wiltshire]] borders. William Morris went to [[Iceland]], leaving his wife and Rossetti to furnish the house and spend the summer there. Jane Morris had become closely attached to Rossetti and became a favourite muse of his. Their relationship is reputed to have started in 1865 and lasted, on differing levels, until his death in 1882. They shared a deep emotional relationship, and she inspired Rossetti to write poetry and create some of his best paintings. Her discovery of his dependence on the drug, [[chloral hydrate]], which was taken for insomnia, eventually led her to distance herself from him, although they stayed in touch until he died in 1882.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

In 1884, Jane Morris met the poet and political activist [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] at a house party given by her close friend, [[Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Rosalind Howard]] (later Countess of Carlisle). There appears to have been an immediate attraction between them. By 1887 at the latest, they had become lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Mancoff, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Their sexual relationship continued until 1894 and they remained close friends until his death.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Jane Morris was an ardent supporter of [[Irish Home Rule]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

A few months before her death, she bought Kelmscott Manor to secure it for her daughters' future. However, she did not return to the house after having purchased it. Jane Morris died on 26 January 1914, while staying at 5 Brock Street in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. She is buried in the churchyard of St. George's Church in [[Kelmscott]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

'''John Law''' (born 16 May 1946),&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web |title= Law, John, 1946- |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n91117383.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 13 February 2015 |quote= data sheet (b. 5/16/46) }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sociologist currently on the Faculty of Social Sciences at the [[Open University]] and key proponent of [[Actor-network theory]]. Actor-network theory, sometimes abbreviated to ANT, is a social science approach for describing and explaining social, organisational, scientific and technological structures, processes and events. It assumes that all the components of such structures (whether these are human or otherwise) form a network of relations that can be mapped and described in the same terms or vocabulary.

Developed by two leading French [[Science and technology studies|STS]] scholars, [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], Law himself, and others, ANT may alternatively be described as a 'material-semiotic' method. ANT strives to map relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and 'semiotic' (between concepts), for instance, the interactions in a bank involve both people and their ideas, and computers. Together these form a single network.

Professor John Law is one of the directors of the [[Economic and Social Research Council|ESRC]] funded [[Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change]].

'''Lakehead University''' is a [[public research university]] with campuses in [[Thunder Bay]] and [[Orillia]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Lakehead University, shortened to 'Lakehead U', or 'LU', is non-denominational and provincially supported. It has undergraduate programs, graduate programs, the [[Lakehead University Faculty of Law|Bora Laskin Faculty of Law]], the only internationally accredited (AACSB) business school in northern Ontario, and is home to the western campus of the [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]]. 

Lakehead has more than 45,000 alumni. The main campus in Thunder Bay has about 7,900 students. As of September 2006, a new permanent extension campus in Orillia, located about {{convert|150|km}} north of [[Toronto]], has about 1,400 students.

==History==

Lakehead University evolved from Lakehead Technical Institute and Lakehead College of Arts, Science, and Technology.
&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/lakehead-university/ "Lakehead University"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lakehead Technical Institute was established in response to a brief that outlined the need for an institution of higher education in northwestern Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagefdn.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_6746_1.html|Ontario Heritage Trust  Lakehead University&lt;/ref&gt; It was established on June 4, 1946, by an Order-in-Council of the Province of [[Ontario]]. Classes commenced in January 1948, in temporary rented quarters in downtown [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]]. In September of that same year, the first university courses were added to the curriculum.&lt;ref name="Harold S 1987"&gt;Harold S. Braun with William G. Tamblyn. 'A Northern Vision: The Development of Lakehead University.' Thunder Bay: Lakehead University, President's Office, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology was established by an Act of the [[Ontario Legislature]] proclaimed on August 1, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Lakehead University Act board.lakeheadu.ca/wp/?pg=18&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, the original Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology Act was amended to grant the college authority to establish new faculties, and confer degrees in arts and sciences.&lt;ref name="Harold S 1987"/&gt; The Lakehead University Act, 1965, was given royal assent on June 22, 1965, and came into force on July 1, 1965. The ''Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology'', thereafter known as "Lakehead University," was continued under this new charter. The first degrees were conferred on May 5, 1965. The first university chancellor was Senator [[Norman McLeod Paterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

===Thunder Bay campus===

The original college site comprised about 32 hectares of land in south-west [[Port Arthur, Ontario]]. From 1962 to 1965, an additional 87 hectares of adjoining land was purchased in anticipation of future expansion. The first building was opened in 1957.

In 2005 the [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]] (NOSM) was formed as a joint initiative between Lakehead University and [[Laurentian University]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] organized within the Faculty of Medicine of both Laurentian (East Campus) and Lakehead (West Campus) universities. The medical school has multiple teaching and research sites across [[Northern Ontario]], including large and small communities. Students are given a choice of attending either one of the two main NOSM campuses. NOSM is the only Canadian medical school to be established as a stand-alone not-for-profit corporation, with its own Board of Directors and corporation bylaws.

A new [[law school]] was established; the faculty accepted its first students in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lakehead-wins-approval-to-launch-law-school/article586735/ "Lakehead wins approval to launch law school"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', July 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The program is housed in the former [[Port Arthur Collegiate Institute]].  In 2014 it was named the [[Lakehead University Faculty of Law|Bora Laskin Faculty of Law]], after the fourteenth [[Bora Laskin|Chief Justice of Canada]].

Lakehead University's physical plant now consists of 39 buildings and 116 hectares of property including 40 hectares of landscaped and maintained grounds.

===Orillia campus===

Lakehead University opened a campus at Heritage Place in Downtown [[Orillia]] in 2006; during the first semester there were about 100 students.

In September 2010 the university expanded to its new 500 University Avenue location. A new academic building at this site represents the first phase in the development of Canada’s first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Platinum university campus.  A 271-bed student residence building and a cafeteria/bookstore facility opened in November 2012 at the University Avenue site.  Lakehead Orillia now has over 1,400 students studying at the Heritage Place and University Avenue sites.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lakeheadu.ca/about/orillia-campus&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate programs are offered at the 500 University Avenue site, while the professional year of Lakehead – Orillia’s education programs are offered at the downtown campus.

===Residence===
Accommodations at Lakehead are divided into three living styles: residence halls, apartments and townhouses. The Thunder Bay residence currently has a total of 1,196 beds and three cafeteria/dining halls. Students can choose from meal options that range from kitchenette, full-kitchen and complete meal plan depending on the residence styles.

The men's residence for 52 students was opened in fall of 1962, and has grown to include a residence village consisting of 10 new buildings. The village is situated on the banks of the McIntyre River within  five-minute walking distance of all university buildings and athletic facilities.

From 1989 to 1992, a complex of townhouses, including some handicap accessible units, was added to the residence facility.

A 271-bed residence in Orillia opened its doors in late Fall 2012. The Orillia residence has one mandatory meal plan for students, as well as one cafeteria, owned by Madison County.

===Agricultural Research Station===
The university supports a research station near Thunder Bay to test newly developed crop varieties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/agricultural-research-station-growing-new-and-exciting-ideas-3-photos-994830 "Agricultural Research Station growing new and exciting ideas"]. ''Thunder Bay Newswatch'',  Jul 25, 2018 by Doug Diaczuk &lt;/ref&gt; The station had been in operation for a number of years, and was officially taken over by the university in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/lakehead-university-officially-on-board-with-research-station-913788 "Lakehead University officially on board with research station"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">'''Leave the gate as you found it''' (or '''leave all gates as found''') is an important rule of [[courtesy]] in rural areas throughout the world. If a [[gate]] is found open, it should be left open, and if it is closed, it should be left closed. If a closed gate absolutely must be traversed, it should be closed again afterwards. It applies to visitors travelling onto or across [[farm]]s, [[ranch]]es, and [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]].

In low-rainfall areas, closing gates can cut [[livestock]] off from water supplies. For example, most of the land used for grazing in [[Australia]] has no natural water supplies, so drinking water for the stock must be supplied by the farmer or landowner, often by using a [[windmill]] to pump [[groundwater]]. Even visitors who know how a stock water system works may be unaware of breakdowns. During hot weather, [[cattle]] require large quantities of water to drink and can die in less than a day if they don't get it. [[Sheep]] need less water and can survive longer without it, but will die if cut off from water for several hot days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myhorse.com/training/western/an_open_and_shut_gate_on_horseback.aspx#top |title=Open and Shut a Gate Horseback |publisher=MyHorse.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all agricultural areas, farmers need to keep groups of livestock separate, for reasons including [[Selective breeding|breeding]] for disease resistance and increased production, pest control, and controlling when ewes [[lambing|deliver their lambs]]. Unwanted mingling of flocks or herds can deprive a farmer of significant income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beginnercampingtips.com/articles/hiking-and-camping-uk.html |title=Camping Information |publisher=Beginnercampingtips.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original versions of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[The Country Code|Country Code]] advised visitors to always close gates. The revised Countryside Code now suggests that gates should be left as found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7382">[[Image:Lesbian sign.svg|thumb|right|A [[lesbian]] sign made from two linked [[astronomical symbols]] for [[Venus]]. In ancient times the metal [[copper]] was associated with the Roman goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] in line with traditional planetary metallurgy. Copper's ancient [[alchemy]] symbol, a circle (for [[spirit]]) above a cross (for [[matter]]), became a sign for both the goddess and the [[Venus|planet]]. It was later also used to represent the female in [[biology]] and popular culture. Here, it is doubled and twined in symbolic hues of [[Lilac (color)|lilac]] as a sign for ''lesbian''.]]
'''Lesbian utopia''' refers to a conceptual community made up entirely of [[Woman|women]] who are not dependent on [[Man|men]] for anything.&lt;ref&gt;Usage example: ''[[Montreal Mirror]]'', "[http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/051007/news1.html A Condo of One's Own] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912002817/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/051007/news1.html |date=12 September 2007 }}", Jane Shulman, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Usage example: Off Our Backs, ''[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3693/is_200110/ai_n8980189 Sexual violence within lesbian battering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124013155/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3693/is_200110/ai_n8980189 |date=24 November 2007 }}'', Lori B Girshick, Oct 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an all-female society is mentioned in [[Greek mythology]] through a [[legend]] of [[Amazons|the Amazons]], a nation of all-female warriors. In this legend, once each year the Amazons call upon [[Gargareans|the Gargareans]] and mate with them.

==Reproduction==
It could be argued that a major hurdle for a philosophical lesbian utopia would be that, as with many [[species]], [[human reproduction]] requires an [[Ovum|egg]] (from the [[female]]), a [[sperm]] (from the [[male]]) and a [[Uterus|womb]] as a suitable environment with an available source of [[nutrients]] in which an [[embryo]] can develop into a [[fetus]] and [[Gestation|gestate]] until [[childbirth]].

Scientists have created [[mouse]] pups from two female mice, including [[Kaguya (mouse)|Kaguya]].&lt;ref name="BBC News:"&gt;''[[BBC News]]'', [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3643847.stm Mice created without fathers], 21 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was conducted by researchers from the [[Tokyo University of Agriculture]], led by Dr. [[Tomohiro Kono]]. The research uncovered that by suppressing the activity of a certain hormone from the original mouse eggs, they could initiate growth of the eggs by using two sets of ''female'' DNA, by increasing the activity of another hormone contained within the egg.&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt;

However, Dr. Komo has stated that the extremely low success rate of the procedure uncovered by his team meant that just 2 out of 598 mice were able to be produced both successfully and ''safely'' using this method (Giving an estimated success rate of about 0.334%). He said that many of the mice died during the trial, with just two of them surviving to adulthood.&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt;

Researchers have also dismissed the use of this technology in fertility treatment for the time being, citing that it is impossible to tell whether this treatment would even be applicable for use in this area without further research.&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt; Dr. Komo has also expressed reservations regarding human [[fertility]] treatments, stating, "This is a very complicated thing. So no, It is impossible to do this experiment in a human. And I don't want to do it".&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt; However, some researchers still believe the methods could have potential applications in [[stem cell research]].&lt;ref name="BBC News:"/&gt;

Scientists have also found a way to fertilise human eggs using [[genetic material]] from any [[cell (biology)|cell]] in the body.&lt;ref name="BBC News2:"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1431489.stm Eggs fertilised without sperm], 10 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
This could eventually allow [[Three-parent baby|two or more females to conceive]] and bring a baby to term without male assistance. There have been some public health concerns amongst a vocal minority about the viability of the techniques put forward in this instance, particularly regarding the health of the children conceived through [[biotechnology]], as well as the "high risk of creating damaged people" through genetic engineering of this type.&lt;ref name="BBC News2:"/&gt;

It is as of yet unknown if any new biotechnology could be applied to humans, regardless of any [[Ethics|ethical]] issues which may arise.&lt;ref&gt;About.com, ''[http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/families/a/Parthenogenesis.htm Parthenogenesis: Do We Need Men Anymore? Creating Children Without Men or Sperm]'', Kathy Belge, retrieved 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
A historical fictional example of this concept is [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s feminist novel ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915).

More contemporary examples of lesbian utopian fiction include [[John Wyndham]]'s ''[[Consider Her Ways]]'' (1956); [[Poul Anderson]]'s  ''Virgin Planet'' (1959); [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1975); [[Nicola Griffith]]'s ''[[Ammonite (novel)|Ammonite]]'' (1993); and [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s story "The Manikins". These stories often include the premise that a gender-specific [[pandemic]] has eradicated all male human life on Earth or another world. The female survivors usually reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]], whether through benign [[mutation]] or technological progress.

The 1984 Polish science fiction comedy ''[[Sexmission]]'' features two men, subjects of a hibernation experiment, who wake to find themselves in a post-apocalyptic, all female society.

[[Lithia (The Outer Limits)|Lithia]], Episode 17 of the fourth season of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' features a man who was cryogenically frozen and awakens in a world populated only by women.

British sci-fi writer [[Edmund Cooper]] explored the subject in several of his novels, including ''Five to Twelve'' (1968) and ''Who Needs Men'' (1972).

In the [[Mass Effect|Mass Effect universe]], the ''Asari'' are a [[agender|monogender]]-[[pansexuality|pansexual]] "female" species.

[[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] was created by [[William Moulton Marston]] to allegorize the safety and security of the home where women thrived apart from the hostile, male-dominated work place. It is governed by ''[[Aphrodite (DC Comics)|Aphrodite's Law]]'', which stated: "Penalty of death to any [[Man]] attempting to set foot on Themyscira."&lt;ref&gt;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4763e71ec804b0998e4d29162420de87.webp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-outlandish-examples-of-subtext-in-comic-books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/573997914979868676/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[toxicology]], the '''LC&lt;sub&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the lowest concentration of a chemical, given over a period of time, that results in the fatality of an individual animal. LC&lt;sub&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt; is typically for an acute (&lt;24 hour) exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books |title = Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Informatics |year = 2008 |url = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6754-9_9257 |isbn = 978-1-4020-6754-9 |publisher = Springer |doi = 10.1007/978-1-4020-6754-9_9257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ehs/msds/glossary/?page=l |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621230708/http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ehs/msds/glossary/?page=l |archivedate=2015-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the [[LC50|LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]], the median lethal concentration.

'''Lotka's law''',&lt;ref name=seminalarticle&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lotka, Alfred J.|year=1926|title=The frequency distribution of scientific productivity|journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences|volume=16|issue=12|pages=317&amp;ndash;324}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Alfred J. Lotka]], is one of a variety of special applications of [[Zipf's law]].  It describes the frequency of publication by authors in any given field. It states that the number of authors making  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  contributions in a given period is a fraction of the number making a single contribution, following the formula  &lt;math&gt;1/x^{a}&lt;/math&gt;  where ''a'' nearly always equals two, i.e., an approximate [[inverse-square law]], where the number of authors publishing a certain number of articles is a fixed ratio to the number of authors publishing a single article.  As the number of articles published increases, authors producing that many publications become less frequent.  There are 1/4 as many authors publishing two articles within a specified time period as there are single-publication authors, 1/9 as many publishing three articles, 1/16 as many publishing four articles, etc.  Though the law itself covers many disciplines, the actual ratios involved (as a function of 'a') are discipline-specific.

[[File:Lotka plot.png|thumb|Graphical plot of the Lotka function described in the text, with C=1, n=2]]
The general formula says:
:&lt;math&gt;
X^n Y = C
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = C / X^n, \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''X'' is the number of publications, ''Y'' the relative frequency of authors with ''X'' publications, and ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are constants depending on the specific field (&lt;math&gt;n \approx 2&lt;/math&gt;).

== Example ==
Say 100 authors write at least one article each over a specific period, we assume for this table that C=100 and n=2. Then the number of authors writing portions of any particular articles in that time period is describe as in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
! Portion of articles written
! Number of authors writing that number of articles
|-----
| 10 || 100/10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1
|-----
| 9 || 100/9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 1 (1.23)
|-----
| 8 || 100/8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 2 (1.56)
|-----
| 7 || 100/7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 2 (2.04)
|-----
| 6 || 100/6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 3 (2.77)
|-----
| 5 || 100/5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4
|-----
| 4 || 100/4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 6 (6.25)
|-----
| 3 || 100/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 11 (11.111...)
|-----
| 2 || 100/2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25
|-----
| 1 || 100
|}

That would be a total of 294 articles with 155 writers with an average of 1.9 articles for each writer.

This is an empirical observation rather than a necessary result.  This form of the law is as originally published and is sometimes referred to as the "discrete Lotka power function".&lt;ref name=discreteLotka&gt;{{cite journal |last=Egghe |first=Leo |year=2005

'''Mandat International''', also known as the '''International Cooperation Foundation''', is an international [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] with consultative status to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the [[UNDPI]], and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]].

==Aims==
Mandat Internatioal aims to promote international dialogue and cooperation, including in the research domain. It promotes international law, data protection and sustainable development. It is strictly independent from any political or religious affiliation.

==Activities==
Mandat International is a foundation with public utility status, relying on a network of members covering the various fields of activity of international cooperation. It collaborates closely with most of the international organizations and is independent of any political or religious affiliation. Its first aim is is to promote international cooperation, including in the research domain. Its activities encompass various domains, from ICT research, to international law and privacy, multistakeholder dialogue and international research projects. Over time, the foundation has developed many projects, including several international research projects, international conferences and events, support to over 10’000 delegates for attending international conferences, educational programes, creating the Eduki foundation, legal search engines, conferences, etc. The foundation usually supports projects for a limited period of time but with the objective to have a sustainable impact.

The '''Marine Station of Endoume''' is an [[oceanography]] and [[marine biology]] research institute located in [[Marseille]] (France). It was founded in 1882 by [[Antoine-Fortuné Marion]] (1846–1900). It is today one of the sites for the joint research unit IMBE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imbe.fr/|title=IMBE website|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Mediterranean Institute of marine and terrestrial Biodiversity and Ecology) hosting research teams from [[Aix-Marseille University]] and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. 

== History ==
The first [[marine biology]] laboratory in France outside Paris was founded in [[Marseille]] in 1869. The project to build a marine station in [[Marseille]] was initiated by its director [[Antoine-Fortuné Marion]] in 1872 and accepted in 1882. The station was built between 1883 and 1889, on the site of an old artillery battery in the neighbourhood of [[Endoume]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marion|first=A.-F.|year=1897|title=La Station zoologique d’Endoume-Marseille|journal=Revue générale internationale scientifique, littéraire et artistique|volume=14|pages=179–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first scientific studies started in the summer of 1889. 

In 1891, the first public aquarium in Marseille opened at the marine station; in 1894, a marine natural reserve was created right in front of the marine station&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romano|first=R.|year=1996|title=Histoire d’une station marine à Marseille : origine, naissance, développement (1869–1983)|journal=Master thesis, Université Aix-Marseille 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A-F Marion was director of the station until his death in 1900.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32551">'''Metatranscriptomics''' is the science that studies [[gene]] expression of [[microbes]] within natural environments. It also allows to obtain whole gene expression profiling of complex microbial communities.&lt;ref name="Filiatrault_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Filiatrault MJ | title = Progress in prokaryotic transcriptomics | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 579–86 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21839669 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[metagenomics]] focuses on studying the genomic content and on identifying which microbes are present within a community, metatranscriptomics can be used to study the diversity of the active genes within such community, to quantify their expression levels and to monitor how these levels change in different conditions (e.g., physiological vs. pathological conditions in an organism). The advantage of metatranscriptomics is that it can provide information about differences in the active functions of [[microbial communities]] which appear to be the same in terms of microbe composition.&lt;ref name="pmid27127406"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bashiardes S, Zilberman-Schapira G, Elinav E | title = Use of Metatranscriptomics in Microbiome Research | journal = Bioinformatics and Biology Insights | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 19–25 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27127406 | pmc = 4839964 | doi = 10.4137/BBI.S34610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
The [[microbiome]] has been defined as a microbial community occupying a well-defined habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Whipps JM, Lewis K, Cooke RC | title = Mycoparasitism and Plant Disease Control. | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester, UK | date = 1988 | pages = 161–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are ubiquitous and extremely relevant for the maintenance of” the characteristic of the environment in which they reside and an imbalance in these communities can affect negatively the activity of the setting in which they reside. 
To study these communities, and to then determine their impact and correlation with their niche, different omics- approaches have been used. While metagenomics allows to obtain a taxonomic profile of the sample, metatrascriptomics provides a functional profile by analysing which genes are expressed by the community. 
It is possible to infer what genes are expressed under specific conditions, and this can be done using functional annotations of expressed genes.

== Function ==
Since metatranscriptomics focuses on what genes are expressed, it allows to understand the active functional profile of the entire microbial community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moran MA | title = Metatranscriptomics: eavesdropping on complex microbial communities. | journal = Microbiome | date = 2009 | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 329–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overview of the gene expression in a given sample is obtained by capturing the total [[mRNA]] of the microbiome and by performing a whole metatranscriptomics [[shotgun sequencing]].

== Tools and techniques ==
Although microarrays can be exploited to determine the gene expression profiles of some model organisms, NGS is the preferred technique in metatranscriptomics. The protocol that is used to perform a metatranscriptome analysis may vary depending on the type of sample that needs to be analysed. Indeed, many different protocols have been developed for studying the metatranscriptome of microbial samples. Generally, the steps include sample harvesting, RNA extraction (different extraction methods for different kinds of samples have been reported in the literature), mRNA enrichment, cDNA synthesis and preparation of metatranscriptomic libraries, sequencing and data processing and analysis.
mRNA enrichment is one of the trickiest parts. Different strategies have been proposed:
* removing rRNA through Ribosomal RNA capture
* using a 5-3 exonuclease to degrade processed RNAs (mostly rRNA and tRNA&lt;ref name="pmid7682412"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Apirion D, Miczak A | title = RNA processing in prokaryotic cells | journal = BioEssays : News and Reviews in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–20 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 7682412 | doi = 10.1002/bies.950150207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* adding poly(A) to mRNAs by using a polyA polymerase (in E. coli)
* using antibodies to capture mRNAs that bind to specific proteins
The last two strategies are not recommended as they have been reported to be highly biased.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Mariana | last1 = Peimbert | first2 = Luis D | last2 = Alcaraz | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2016 | chapter = A Hitchhiker’s Guide to Metatranscriptomics | title = Field Guidelines for Genetic Experimental Designs in High-Throughput Sequencing | pages = 313–342 | publisher = Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computational analysis ==
A typical metatranscriptom¬e analysis pipeline:
*maps reads to a reference genome or
*performs de novo assembly of the reads into transcript contigs and supercontigs
The first strategy maps reads to reference genomes in databases, to collect information that is useful to deduce the relative expression of the single genes.
Metatran¬scriptomic reads are mapped against databases using alignment tools, such as Bowtie2, BWA, and BLAST. Then, the results are annotated using resources, such as GO, KEGG, COG, and Swiss-Prot. The final analysis of the results is carried out depending on the aim of the study.
One of the latest metatranscriptomics techniques is stable isotope probing (SIP), which has been used to retrieve specific targeted transcriptomes of aerobic microbes in lake sediment.&lt;ref name="pmid24115627"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dumont MG, Pommerenke B, Casper P | title = Using stable isotope probing to obtain a targeted metatranscriptome of aerobic methanotrophs in lake sediment | journal = Environmental Microbiology Reports | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 757–64 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24115627 | doi = 10.1111/1758-2229.12078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The limitation of this strategy is its reliance on the information of reference genomes in databases.
The second strategy retrieves the abundance in the expression of the different genes by assembling metatranscrip¬tomic reads into longer fragments called contigs using different softwares. So, its limits  depend on the software that is used for the assembly.
The Trinity software for RNA-seq, in comparison with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, was reported to recover more full-length transcripts over a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. This is particularly important in the absence of a reference genome.&lt;ref name="pmid21572440"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grabherr MG, Haas BJ, Yassour M, Levin JZ, Thompson DA, Amit I, Adiconis X, Fan L, Raychowdhury R, Zeng Q, Chen Z, Mauceli E, Hacohen N, Gnirke A, Rhind N, di Palma F, Birren BW, Nusbaum C, Lindblad-Toh K, Friedman N, Regev A | display-authors = 6 | title = Full-length transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data without a reference genome | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 7 | pages = 644–52 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21572440 | pmc = 3571712 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A quantitative pipeline for transcriptomic analysis was developed by Li and Dewey &lt;ref&gt;103. Li B, Dewey CN. Rsem: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-seq data with or without a reference genome. BMC Bioinformatics. 2011;12(1):323.&lt;/ref&gt; and called RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization). It can work as stand-alone software or as a plug-in for Trinity. 
RSEM starts with a reference transcriptome or assembly along with RNA-Seq reads generated from the sample and calculates normalized transcript abundance (meaning the number of RNA-Seq reads cor-responding to each reference transcriptome or assembly).&lt;ref name="pmid23845962"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haas BJ, Papanicolaou A, Yassour M, Grabherr M, Blood PD, Bowden J, Couger MB, Eccles D, Li B, Lieber M, MacManes MD, Ott M, Orvis J, Pochet N, Strozzi F, Weeks N, Westerman R, William T, Dewey CN, Henschel R, LeDuc RD, Friedman N, Regev A | title = De novo transcript sequence reconstruction from RNA-seq using the Trinity platform for reference generation and analysis | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 1494–512 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23845962 | pmc = 3875132 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18689821"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Bona F, Ossowski S, Schneeberger K, Rätsch G | title = Optimal spliced alignments of short sequence reads | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 24 | issue = 16 | pages = i174–80 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18689821 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although both Trinity and RSEM were designed for tran¬scriptomic datasets (i.e., obtained from a single organism), it may be possible to apply them to metatranscriptomic data (i.e., obtained from a whole microbial community).

==Bioinformatics==
Given the huge amount of data obtained from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis, the use of bioinformatic tools have become of greater importance in the last decades. In order to achieve so, many different bioinformatic pipelines have been developed, often as open source platforms, such as HUMAnN and the most recent HUMAnN2, MetaTrans, SAMSA and Leimena-2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niu SY, Yang J, McDermaid A, Zhao J, Kang Y, Ma Q | title = Bioinformatics tools for quantitative and functional metagenome and metatranscriptome data analysis in microbes | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 1415–1429 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 28481971 | doi = 10.1093/bib/bbx051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HUMAnN2===
HUMAnN2 is a bioinformatic pipeline designed from the latter HUMAnN developed during the [[Human Microbiome Project]] (HMP), implementing a “tiered search” approach. In the first tier, HUMAnN2 screens DNA or RNA reads with MetaPhlAn2 in order to identify already known microbes and constructing a sample-specific database by merging pangenomes of annotated species; in the second tier the algorithm performs a mapping of the reads against the assembled pangenome database; in the third tier, non-aligned reads are used for a translated search against a protein database &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franzosa EA, McIver LJ, Rahnavard G, Thompson LR, Schirmer M, Weingart G, Lipson KS, Knight R, Caporaso JG, Segata N, Huttenhower C | title = Species-level functional profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes | language = En | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 962–968 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30377376 | pmc = 6235447 | doi = 10.1038/s41592-018-0176-y | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0176-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MetaTrans===
MetaTrans is a pipeline that exploits multi-threading computers to improve metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis. Data is obtained from paired-end RNA-Seq, mainly from 16S RNA for taxonomy and mRNA for gene expression levels. The pipeline is divided in 4 major steps. Firstly, paired-end reads are filtered for quality control purposes, to be thereafter sorted for taxonomic analysis (by removal of tRNA sequences) or functional analysis (by removal of both tRNA and rRNA sequencing). For the taxonomic analysis, sequences are mapped against 16S rRNA Greengenes v13.5 database using SOAP2, while for functional analysis sequences are mapped against a functional database such as MetaHIT-2014 always by using SOAP2 tool. This pipeline is highly flexible, since it offers the possibility to use third-party tools and improve single modules as long as the general structure is preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez X, Pozuelo M, Pascal V, Campos D, Gut I, Gut M, Azpiroz F, Guarner F, Manichanh C | title = MetaTrans: an open-source pipeline for metatranscriptomics | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 26447 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27211518 | pmc = 4876386 | doi = 10.1038/srep26447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SAMSA===
This pipeline is designed specifically for metatranscriptomics data analysis, by working in conjunction with the [[MG-RAST]] server for metagenomics. This pipeline is simple to use, requires low technical preparation and computational power and can be applied to a wide range of microbes. The algorithm is divided in 4 steps. At first, sequences from raw sequencing data are selected on quality basis and are then submitted to MG-RAST (which foresee different steps such as quality control check, gene calling, clustering of amino acid sequences and use of sBLAT on each cluster to detect the best matches). Matches are then aggregated for taxonomic and functional analysis purposes, that usually follow up as last steps of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westreich ST, Korf I, Mills DA, Lemay DG | title = SAMSA: a comprehensive metatranscriptome analysis pipeline | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 399 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27687690 | pmc = 5041328 | doi = 10.1186/s12859-016-1270-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leimena-2013===
This pipeline actually does not have a name so that it is usually reckoned with the first name of the author of the article in which it is described. This algorithm foresees the implementation of alignment tools such as BLAST and MegaBLAST. Reads, usually obtained by Illumina sequencing, are clustered in identical-reads clusters and are then processed for in-silico removal of t-RNA and r-RNA sequences. Remaining reads are then mapped on NCBI databases by using BLAST and MegaBLAST tools and classified by their bitscore. Higher bitscore sequences are thereby interpreted to predict phylogenetic origin and function. Lower score reads instead are aligned with BLASTX (higher sensitivity) and eventually can be aligned in protein databases so that their function can be characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leimena MM, Ramiro-Garcia J, Davids M, van den Bogert B, Smidt H, Smid EJ, Boekhorst J, Zoetendal EG, Schaap PJ, Kleerebezem M | title = A comprehensive metatranscriptome analysis pipeline and its validation using human small intestine microbiota datasets | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 14 | pages = 530 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23915218 | pmc = 3750648 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-14-530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microarray ==
Another method that can be exploited for metatranscriptomic purposes is [[Tiling array|Tiling Microarrays]].   
In particular, microarrays have been used to measure microbial transcription levels, to detect new transcripts and to obtain information about the structure of mRNAs (for instance, the UTR boundaries). Recently, it has also been used to find new regulatory ncRNA. 
However, microarrays are affected by some pitfalls:
*requirement of probe design
*low sensitivity 
*prior knowledge of gene targets. 
RNA-Seq can overcome these limitations: it does not require any previous knowledge about the genomes that have to be analysed and it provides high throughput validation of genes prediction, structure, expression. Thus, by combining the two approaches it is possible to have a more complete representation of bacterial transcriptome.&lt;ref name="Filiatrault_2011" /&gt;

==Limits of the metatranscriptomic techniques==
*With its dominating abundance, ribosomal RNA strongly reduces the coverage of mRNA (main focus of transcriptomic studies) in the total collected RNA.
*Extraction of high-quality RNA from some biological or environmental samples (such as feces) can be difficult
* Instability of mRNA that compromises sample integrity even before sequencing. 
*Experimental issues can affect the quantification of differences in expression among multiple samples: They can influence integrity and input RNA, as well as the amount of rRNA remaining in the samples, size section and gene models. Moreover, molecular base techniques are very prone to artefacts.
*Difficulties in differentiating between host and microbial RNA, although com¬mercial kits for the microbial enrichment are available. This may also be done in silico if a reference genome is available for the host. 
*Transcriptome reference databases are limited in their coverage.
*Generally, large populations of cells are exploited in metatranscriptomic analysis, so it is difficult to resolve important variances that can exist between subpopulations. Actually, high variability in pathogen populations was demonstrated to affect disease progression and virulence. 
*Both for microarray and RNA-Seq, it is difficult to set a real “cut off” in order to consider the genes as “express”, due to the high dynamic range in gene expression.
*The presence of mRNA is not always associated with the actual presence of the respective protein.&lt;ref name="Filiatrault_2011" /&gt;

==Metatrascriptomics and Gut Microbiome==
The gut microbiome has emerged in recent years as an important player in human health. Its prevalent functions are related to the fermentation of indigestible food components, competitions with pathogen, strengthening of the intestinal barrier, stimulation and regulation of the immune system.&lt;ref name="pmid21314432"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karasov WH, Martínez del Rio C, Caviedes-Vidal E | title = Ecological physiology of diet and digestive systems | journal = Annual Review of Physiology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 69–93 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21314432 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22940212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = LeBlanc JG, Milani C, de Giori GS, Sesma F, van Sinderen D, Ventura M | title = Bacteria as vitamin suppliers to their host: a gut microbiota perspective | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–8 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22940212 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2012.08.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28721242"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Claus SP, Guillou H, Ellero-Simatos S | title = The gut microbiota: a major player in the toxicity of environmental pollutants? | journal = NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 16003 | date = 2016 | pmid = 28721242 | pmc = 5515271 | doi = 10.1038/npjbiofilms.2016.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23618829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamada N, Seo SU, Chen GY, Núñez G | title = Role of the gut microbiota in immunity and inflammatory disease | journal = Nature Reviews.

Although much has been learnt about the microbiome community in the last years, the wide diversity of microorganisms and molecules in the gut requires new tools to enable new discoveries. 
By focusing on the changes in the expression of the genes, metatrascriptomics allows to take a more dynamic picture of the state and activity of the microbiome than metagenomics. It has been observed that metatranscriptomic functional profiles are more variable than what might have been reckoned only by metagenomic information. This suggests that non-housekeeping genes are not stably expressed in situ&lt;ref name="pmid21408168"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gosalbes MJ, Durbán A, Pignatelli M, Abellan JJ, Jiménez-Hernández N, Pérez-Cobas AE, Latorre A, Moya A | title = Metatranscriptomic approach to analyze the functional human gut microbiota | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e17447 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21408168 | pmc = 3050895 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0017447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24843156"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franzosa EA, Morgan XC, Segata N, Waldron L, Reyes J, Earl AM, Giannoukos G, Boylan MR, Ciulla D, Gevers D, Izard J, Garrett WS, Chan AT, Huttenhower C | title = Relating the metatranscriptome and metagenome of the human gut | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 22 | pages = E2329–38 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24843156 | pmc = 4050606 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1319284111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One example of metatranscriptomic application is in the study of the gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic diseases of the digestive tract that affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;ref name="pmid23395397"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burisch J, Jess T, Martinato M, Lakatos PL | title = The burden of inflammatory bowel disease in Europe | journal = Journal of Crohn's &amp; Colitis | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 322–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23395397 | doi = 10.1016/j.crohns.2013.01.010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several human genetic mutations have been linked to an increased susceptibility to IBD, but additional factors are needed for the full development of the disease.
Regarding the relationship between IBD and gut microbiome, it is known that there is a dysbiosis in patients with IBD but microbial taxonomic profiles can be highly different among patients, making it difficult to implicate specific microbial species or strains in disease onset and progression. In addition, the gut microbiome composition presents a high variability over time among people, with more pronounced variations in patient with IBD.&lt;ref name="Halfvarson_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halfvarson J, Brislawn CJ, Lamendella R, Vázquez-Baeza Y, Walters WA, Bramer LM, D'Amato M, Bonfiglio F, McDonald D, Gonzalez A, McClure EE, Dunklebarger MF, Knight R, Jansson JK | title = Dynamics of the human gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 5| pages = 17004 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28191884 | pmc = 5319707 | doi = 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26468751"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis JD, Chen EZ, Baldassano RN, Otley AR, Griffiths AM, Lee D, Bittinger K, Bailey A, Friedman ES, Hoffmann C, Albenberg L, Sinha R, Compher C, Gilroy E, Nessel L, Grant A, Chehoud C, Li H, Wu GD, Bushman FD | display-authors = 6 | title = Inflammation, Antibiotics, and Diet as Environmental Stressors of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Crohn's Disease | journal = Cell Host &amp; Microbe | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 489–500 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26468751 | pmc = 4633303 | doi = 10.1016/j.chom.2015.09.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The functional potential of an organism, meaning the genes and pathways encoded in its genome, provides only indirect information about the level or extent of activation of such functions. So, the measurement of functional activity (gene expression) is critical to understand the mechanism of the gut microbiome dysbiosis.
Alterations in transcriptional activity in IBD, established on the rRNA expression, indicate that some bacterial populations are active in patients with IBD, while other groups are inactive or latent.&lt;ref name="pmid20522625"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rehman A, Lepage P, Nolte A, Hellmig S, Schreiber S, Ott SJ | title = Transcriptional activity of the dominant gut mucosal microbiota in chronic inflammatory bowel disease patients | journal = Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 59 | issue = Pt 9 | pages = 1114–22 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20522625 | doi = 10.1099/jmm.0.021170-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A metatranscriptomics analysis measuring the functional activity of the gut microbiome reveals insights only partially observable in metagenomic functional potential, including disease-linked observations for IBD. It has been reported that many IBD-specific signals are either more pronounced or only detectable on the RNA level.&lt;ref name="Halfvarson_2017" /&gt;
These altered expression profiles are potentially the result of changes in the gut environment in patients with IBD, which include increased levels of inflammation, higher concentrations of oxygen and a diminished mucous layer.&lt;ref name="pmid24149677"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naughton J, Duggan G, Bourke B, Clyne M | title = Interaction of microbes with mucus and mucins: recent developments | journal = Gut Microbes | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–52 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24149677 | pmc = 4049936 | doi = 10.4161/gmic.26680 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Metatranscriptomics has the advantage of allowing to skip the assaying of biochemical products in situ (like mucus or oxygen) and allows to study the effects of environmental changes on microbial expression patterns in vivo for large human populations.
In addition, it can be coupled with longitudinal sampling to associate modulation of activity with the disease progression. Indeed, it has been shown that while a particular path may remain stable over time at the genomic level, the corresponding expression varies with the disease severity.&lt;ref name="Halfvarson_2017" /&gt; This suggests that microbial dysbiosis affect the gut health through changing in the transcriptional programmes in a stable community. In this way, metatracriptomic profiling emerges as an important tool for understanding the mechanisms of that relationship.
Some technical limitations of the RNA measurements in stool are related to the fact that the extracted RNA can be degraded and, if not, it still represents only the organisms presents in the stool sample.
Other applications of metagenomics:
*Directed culturing: it was used to understand nutritional preferences of organisms in order to allow the preparation of a proper culture medium, resulting in a successful isolation of microbes in vitro.&lt;ref name="Filiatrault_2011" /&gt;
*Identify potential virulence factors: through comparative transcriptomics, in order to compare different transcriptional responses of related strains or species after specific stimuli.
*Identify host-specific biological processes and interactions For this purpose, it’s important to develop new technologies which allow the detection, at the same time, of changes in the expression levels of some genes.
Examples of techniques applied:
Microarrays: allow the monitoring of changes in the expression levels of many genes in parallel for both host and pathogen. First microarray approaches have shown the first global analysis of gene expression changes in pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica, revealing the strategies that are used by these microorganisms to adapt to the host.
In addition, microarrays only provide the first global insights about the host innate immune response to PAMPs, as the effects of bacterial infection on the expression of various host factor.
Anyway, the detection through microarrays of both organisms at the same time could be problematic.
Problems:
*Probe selection (hundreds of millions of different probes)
*Cross-hybridization
*Need of expensive chips (with the proper design; high-density arrays)
*Require the pathogen and host cells to be physically separated before gene expression analysis (eukaryotic cells’ transcriptomes are larger in comparison to the pathogens’ ones, so could happen that the signal from pathogens’ RNAs is hidden). 
*Loss of RNA molecules during the eukaryotic cells lysis.
	

Dual RNA-Seq: this technique allows the simultaneous study of both host and pathogen transcriptomes as well. It is possible to monitor the expression of genes at different time points of the infection process; in this way could it be possible to study the changes in cellular networks in both organisms starting from the initial contact until the manipulation of the host (interplay host-patogen). 
*Potential: No need of expensive chips
*Probe-independent approach (RNA-seq provides transcript information without prior knowledge of mRNA sequences)
*High sensitivity.
*Possibility of studying the expression levels of even unknown genes under different conditions
Moreover, RNA-Seq is an important approach for identifying coregulated genes, enabling the organization of pathogen genomes into operons. Indeed, genome annotation has been done for some eukaryotic pathogens, such as Candida albicans, Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum.
Despite the increasing sensitivity and depth of sequencing now available, there are still few published RNA-Seq studies concerning the response of the mammalian host cell to the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westermann AJ, Gorski SA, Vogel J | title = Dual RNA-seq of pathogen and host | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | date = September 2012 | volume = 10| issue = 9 | pages = 618–630 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2852 | pmid = 22890146 | url = https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/11246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28214646"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saliba AE, C Santos S, Vogel J | title = New RNA-seq approaches for the study of bacterial pathogens | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 78–87 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28214646 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2017.01.001  | hdl = 10033/621506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Churches Trust''', formerly the '''Historic Churches Preservation Trust''', is a British [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|registered charity]] whose aim is "promoting and supporting church buildings of historic, architectural and community value across the UK".&lt;ref name=whoweare&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/who-we-are.php | title = About us| accessdate = 28 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It carries out this aim by providing financial grants to repair and modernise church buildings, supporting projects to enable churches to remain open, collaborating with local Churches Trusts and volunteer bodies, providing practical advice, support and information, and working to promote public awareness of the needs of churches.  Its forerunner was the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, whose  functions it has taken over, together with those of the Incorporated Church Building Society.&lt;ref name=whoweare/&gt;

==History==

By the middle of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the fabric of many British church buildings was in a poor state of repair.  This had followed socioeconomic changes in the late 19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries, including population changes, followed by neglect during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  Matters came to a head in 1950 with public statements, including an [[editorial]] in ''[[The Times]]''.  About this time the [[Pilgrim Trust]] declared that it was ceasing to give grants for repairs to individual churches.&lt;ref name=ch108&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|pp=108–111.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church of England Assembly (now the [[General Synod of the Church of England]]) established the Repair of Churches Commission to decide what should be done about the problem.  This resulted in the creation of the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, which was registered as a charity in 1953.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ch108/&gt;  Its first Secretary and Executive Committee Chairman was [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], a [[Conservatism|Conservative]] politician, the role of Secretary being taken over later in 1953 by Hugh Llewellyn Jones.  In order to ensure that the grants it gave were appropriate, local advisory panels of architects were established, later replaced by the Committee of Honorary Consultant Architects, who continued to advise the Trust until 2002.  At the time of its foundation, it was estimated that a total of £4 million was necessary to fulfil its aims.  Money was raised in a variety of ways, including appeals on radio and television, exhibitions, concerts, individual and corporate donations, and a benefit dinner.  Support was received from charitable trusts, including the Pilgrim Trust, the Dulverton Trust, the [[Manifold Trust]], and the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]].&lt;ref name=hcpt&gt;{{Citation | url = | title = Keeping Churches Alive — a brief history of the Trust| accessdate = | publisher = Historic Churches Preservation Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of its creation, the Trust gave grants for the repair of both active and [[redundant church|redundant]] churches, although the care of redundant churches was strictly beyond its remit.  In 1960 the Bridges Commission recommended that "a new fund be set up under a new Pastoral Measure to preserve churches of acknowledged historic or architectural worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|p=227.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pastoral Measure of 1968 led to the creation of the Redundant Churches Fund (later the [[Churches Conservation Trust]]), which provided money from both the Church of England and the State for the preservation of redundant churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|pp=227–229.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1984 to raise the first £4&amp;nbsp;million.  After that the size of donations tended to be larger. and by the end of 2005 a total of over £27&amp;nbsp;million had been raised.  In 2000 alone over £2.2&amp;nbsp;million was received.  The size of grants made to churches has varied greatly.  Up to 2005 the smallest grant had been £33&amp;nbsp;4[[Shilling|s]]&amp;nbsp;4[[Penny|d]] to a church in [[Mileham]], [[Norfolk]], in 1957, and the largest grants were of £100,000 each to a church in [[Portsea, Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], in 2000, and to [[Selby Abbey]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  The criterion for the award of a grant was "for essential repairs to any place of worship (with the exception of cathedrals) over 100 years old which is of a recognized Christian denomination and is open for public worship".&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt; Initially available only to churches in England, the scheme was extended to churches and chapels in Wales in 1987.  The decision to award a grant is made by the Trust's Grants committee.  Some of the churches that have been helped are now closed and have been declared [[redundant church|redundant]].  These are now cared for by the [[Churches Conservation Trust]].  In 1983 the Historic Churches Preservation Trust took over the management of the Incorporated Church Building Society.  This had been founded in 1818 to assist [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches of any age, sometimes giving grants for new churches.    In the early 1990s a Friends' scheme was instituted.  In 2006 the Trust took over the functions of the Open Churches Trust.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was succeeded by the National Churches Trust in 2007.&lt;ref name=whoweare/&gt;

==Present day==

The National Churches Trust is a registered charity.  The full definition of its objectives and activities are "to promote the conservation, repair, maintenance, improvement, and reconstruction of churches (to mean any recognised Christian places of worship, chapel or meeting house in the UK), and of such monuments, fittings, stained glass, furniture, organs, bells, in such churches and to promote the building, development of churches in the United Kingdom".&lt;ref name=charity&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1119845&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0| title = The National Churches Trust| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = [[Charity Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the year ending 31 December 2009 its income was £1,895,258, of which 87.4% came from voluntary sources, and it spent £2,712,564, of which 89.4% was used for its charitable activities.  It employed eight people.&lt;ref name=charity/&gt;  The Trust is managed by a board of Trustees, and decisions to award grants are decided by the Grants Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/our-people.php | title = Our People and Partners| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grants of £10,000 and above are made for urgent structural repairs, and grants of between £5,000 and £25,000 are made towards the installation of facilities for such functions as toilets and catering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/supporting-you/grants/overview.php| title = Our Grants Programme| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120215013949/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/supporting-you/grants/overview.php| archivedate = 15 February 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2005, the Trust has distributed over £9&amp;nbsp;million to over 1,000 churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/statistics-and-key-facts.php| title = Key Facts| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110926024838/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/statistics-and-key-facts.php| archivedate = 26 September 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports church buildings of any denomination that are members of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]], and covers the whole of the United Kingdom.  It does not own churches, and does not support [[redundant church]]es.  It receives no funding from the Government or from church authorities.  Its income is derived from individual donations, and from parishes, Trusts and Foundations, and from investment income.  As of 2011 the Trust is not contributing towards the building of new places of worship.  The Trust works in conjunction with a network of Local Churches Trusts that cover most of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/faqs/faq.php#49 | title = Frequently Asked Questions| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public can become a Friend of the National Churches Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/how-you-can-help/donate.php| title = How you can help| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110830084843/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/how-you-can-help/donate.php| archivedate = 30 August 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5745">'''Physics First''' is an educational program in the USA, that teaches a basic [[physics]] course in the ninth grade (usually 15-year-olds),&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [http://www.physicsfirstmo.org/ a National Science Foundation-funded project for 80 physics teachers 2009-2014]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the [[biology]] course which is more standard in public schools. This course relies on the limited math skills that the students have from pre-algebra and algebra I.  With these skills students study a broad subset of the introductory physics canon with an emphasis on topics which can be experienced kinesthetically or without deep mathematical reasoning. Furthermore, teaching physics first is better suited for English Language Learners, who would be overwhelmed by the substantial vocabulary requirements of Biology. 

Physics First began as an organized movement among educators around 1990, and has been slowly catching on throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/Resources/policy/physicsfirst.cfm American Association of Physics Teachers, College Park, MD, April 13, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;   The most prominent movement championing Physics First is [[Leon Lederman]]'s ARISE (American Renaissance in Science Education). 

Many proponents of Physics First argue that turning this order around lays the foundations for better understanding of chemistry, which in turn will lead to more comprehension of biology.  Due to the tangible nature of most introductory physics experiments, Physics First also lends itself well to an introduction to inquiry-based science education, where students are encouraged to probe the workings of the world in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/aboutaapt/ennouncer/upload/physicsfirst.pdf Physics First: an informational guide for teachers, school administrators, parents, scientists, and the public --  upload file from the American Association of Physics Teachers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of high schools which have implemented "physics first" do so by way of offering two separate classes, at two separate levels: simple physics concepts in 9th grade, followed by more advanced physics courses in 11th or 12th grade.  In schools with this curriculum, nearly all 9th grade students take a "Physical Science", or "Introduction to Physics Concepts" course.  These courses focus on concepts that can be studied with skills from pre-algebra and algebra I.  With these ideas in place, students then can be exposed to ideas with more physics related content in chemistry, and other science electives.  After this, students are then encouraged to take an 11th or 12th grade course in physics, which does use more advanced math, including vectors, geometry, and more involved algebra.

There is a large overlap between the Physics First movement, and the movement towards teaching [[conceptual physics]] - teaching physics in a way that emphasizes a strong understanding of physical principles over problem-solving ability.  Many Physics First programs use the popular textbook "Conceptual Physics" by [[Paul G. Hewitt]].

==Criticism==
American public schools traditionally teach biology in the first year of high school, chemistry in the second, and physics in the third. The belief is that this order is more accessible, largely because biology can be taught with less mathematics, and will do the most toward providing some [[scientific literacy]] for the largest number of students.

In addition, many scientists and educators argue that freshmen do not have an adequate background in mathematics to be able to fully comprehend a complete physics curriculum, and that therefore quality of a physics education is lost. While physics requires knowledge of vectors and some basic [[trigonometry]],  many students in the Physics First program take the course in conjunction with [[geometry]]. They suggest that instead students first take [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] which are less [[mathematics]]-intensive so that by the time they are in their junior year, students will be advanced enough in mathematics with either an [[algebra]] 2 or [[pre-calculus]] education to be able to fully grasp the concepts presented in physics. Some argue this even further, saying that at least calculus should be a prerequisite for physics.

Others point out that, for example, secondary school students will never study the advanced physics that underlies chemistry in the first place.  “[I]nclined planes (frictionless or not) didn't come up in ... high school chemistry class ... and the same can be said for some of the chemistry that really makes sense of biological phenomena.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/07/27/brief-remarks-on-physics-first/ Brief remarks on 'physics first' and high school science.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For physics to be relevant to a chemistry course, students have to develop a truly fundamental understanding of the concepts of energy, force, and matter, beyond the context of specific applications like the inclined plane.

{{History of printing}}

A '''printing press''' is a device for applying pressure to an [[ink]]ed surface resting upon a [[printing|print]] medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. It marked a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts, the invention and [[global spread of the printing press]] was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1999, the [[A&amp;E Network]] ranked [http://www.wmich.edu/mus-gened/mus170/biography100 Gutenberg no. 1 on their "People of the Millennium" countdown]. In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked [http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310192514/http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm |date=10 March 2010 }}; the same did four prominent US journalists in their 1998 resume [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium]. The [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07090a.htm Johann Gutenberg] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] describes his invention as having made a practically unparalleled cultural impact in the [[Christian era]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]], a [[goldsmith]] by profession, developed, circa 1439, a printing system by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. [[History of printing in East Asia|Printing in East Asia]] had been prevalent since the [[Tang dynasty]],&lt;ref name=Needham /&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; and in Europe, [[woodblock printing]] based on existing [[screw press]]es was common by the 14th century. Gutenberg's most important innovation was the development of hand-molded metal printing matrices, thus producing a movable type based printing press system. His newly devised [[matrix (printing)|hand mould]] made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal [[movable type]] in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In Europe, the two inventions, the hand mould and the printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents, particularly in short print runs.

The printing press spread within several decades to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): "The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800", London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo", Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp. 58f.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1500, printing presses in operation throughout [[Western Europe]] had already produced more than twenty million volumes.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; The operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of printing, and lent its name to a new medium of expression and communication, "[[Newspaper|the press]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=387}}: {{quote|At the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of [[mass communication]], which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in [[literacy]] broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging [[middle class]]. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-[[nationalism]], and accelerated by the development of European [[vernacular language]]s, to the detriment of [[Latin]]'s status as [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo", Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp.63–76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by [[steam-powered]] [[rotary press]]es allowed printing on an [[industrial age|industrial]] scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerhardt|1978|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of printing}}

=== Economic conditions and intellectual climate ===
{{See also|History of capitalism|Medieval university}} 
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|[[Medieval university]] class (1350s)]]

The rapid economic and socio-cultural development of [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval society]] in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg's improved version of the printing press: the entrepreneurial spirit of [[history of capitalism|emerging capitalism]] increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work-processes. The sharp rise of [[Medieval university|medieval learning]] and literacy amongst the [[middle class]] led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological factors ===
{{See also|History of Western typography|Medieval technology}}

Technologies preceding the press that led to the press's invention included: manufacturing of paper, development of ink, woodblock printing, and distribution of eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43294-8|page=133|edition=1st|date=1994-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:

[[File:Holzspindelkelter von 1702.jpg|thumb|left|Early modern [[wine press]]. Such [[screw press]]es were applied in Europe to a wide range of uses and provided Gutenberg with the model for his printing press.]]

The [[screw press]] which allowed direct pressure to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used for a wide range of tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=21–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in the 1st century AD by the [[Roman agriculture|Romans]], it was commonly employed in agricultural production for [[Pressing (wine)|pressing]] [[vitis vinifera|wine grapes]] and ([[olive]]) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onken|2009}}; {{harvnb|White|1984|pp=31f.}}; {{harvnb|Schneider|2007|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a [[cloth]] press for printing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schneider|2007|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the [[paper]] presses which had spread through the [[Holy Roman Empire|German lands]] since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schulte|1939|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=39f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the [[platen]] on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=39–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:metal movable type.jpg|thumb|[[Movable type]] sorted in a [[letter case]] and loaded in a [[composing stick]] on top]]

The concept of movable type was not new in the 15th century; movable type printing had been [[History of science and technology in China|invented in China]] during the [[Song dynasty]], and was later used in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]], where [[metal]] movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper and Printing |author=[[Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin]] |author2=[[Joseph Needham]] |series=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=5 part 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=158,201|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, sporadic evidence that the [[typographical principle]], the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany ([[Prüfening dedicatory inscription|Prüfening inscription]]) to England ([[letter tiles]]) to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Germany: {{harvnb|Brekle|1995|pp=23–26}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|p=62}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|2005|p=25}}; England: {{harvnb|Lehmann-Haupt|1940|pp=93–97}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|p=62}}; Italy: {{harvnb|Lipinsky|1986|pp=75–80}}; {{harvnb|Koch|1994|p=213}}. Lipinsky surmises that this typographical technique was known in [[Constantinople]] from the 10th to 12th century and that the [[Venice|Venetians]] received it from there (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.

Gutenberg greatly improved the process by treating [[typesetting]] and [[printing]] as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a [[lead]]-based [[alloy]] which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today.&lt;ref name="EB: Printing"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] 2006: "Printing", retrieved 27 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special [[hand mould]], the [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]].&lt;ref name="Childress 2008, 51–55"&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|pp=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin alphabet]] proved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to [[Logogram|logographic writing systems]], it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different [[letter (alphabet)|letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|pp=51–55}}; {{harvnb|Hellinga|2007|p=208}}: {{quote|Gutenberg's invention took full advantage of the degree of abstraction in representing language forms that was offered by the alphabet and by the Western forms of script that were current in the fifteenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the [[codex]], which had originated in the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=24–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the [[Classical Antiquity|ancient]] [[scroll]] at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=1, 38–67, 75}}: {{quote|The most momentous development in the history of the book until the invention of printing was the replacement of the roll by the codex; this we may define as a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers. (p. 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both [[recto and verso]] could be used for writing − and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45–53}}. Technically speaking, a scroll could be written on its back side, too, but the very few ancient specimen found indicate that this was never considered a viable option. (p. 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A paper [[codex]] of the acclaimed [[42-line Bible]], Gutenberg's major work]]

A fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing [[paper]] manufacture. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=68−73}}; {{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim papermaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414–417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997|pp=41–44}}; {{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=419}}: {{quote|In the West, the only inhibiting expense in the production of writings for an increasingly literate market was the manual labor of the scribe himself. With his mechanization by movable-type printing in the 1440s, the manufacture of paper, until then relatively confined, began to spread very widely. The Paper Revolution of the thirteenth century thus entered a new era.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=7f.}}: {{quote|Despite all that has been said above, even the strongest supporters of papyrus would not deny that parchment of good quality is the finest writing material ever devised by man. It is immensely strong, remains flexible indefinitely under normal conditions, does not deteriorate with age, and possesses a smooth, even surface which is both pleasant to the eye and provides unlimited scope for the finest writing and illumination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the [[42-line Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;The ratio between paper and parchment copies is estimated at around 150 to 30 ({{harvnb|Hanebutt-Benz|2000|pp=158–189}}).&lt;/ref&gt; After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Press skeen 1872 with description.png|thumb|left|Early Press, etching from Early Typography by William Skeen]] [[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|upright|This [[woodcut]] from 1568 shows the left printer removing a page from the press while the one at right inks the text-blocks.

The small individual metal letters known as type would be set up by a compositor into the desired lines of text. Several lines of text would be arranged at once and were placed in a wooden frame known as a galley. Once the correct number of pages were composed, the galleys would be laid face up in a frame, also known as a forme.&lt;ref&gt; Lyons 2011, p. 59 &lt;/ref&gt;, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, 'bed,' or 'coffin.' The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressinstitute.in/file-folder/rindsurvey/Rind%20June%202015%20SN.pdf] RIND Survey (The Press Institute of India- Research Institute for Newspaper Development) June 2015, p14&lt;/ref&gt; and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a [[frisket]] and [[tympan]] (two frames covered with paper or parchment).

These are folded down, so that the paper lies on the surface of the inked type. The bed is rolled under the [[platen]], using a windlass mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power. 

The function of the press in the image on the left was described by William Skeen in 1872,
{{quotation | this sketch represents a press in its completed form, with tympans attached to the end of the carriage, and with the frisket above the tympans. The tympans, inner and outer, are thin iron frames, one fitting into the other, on each of which is stretched a skin of parchment or a breadth of fine cloth. A woollen blanket or two with a few sheets of paper are placed between these, the whole thus forming a thin elastic pad, on which the sheet to be printed is laid. The frisket is a slender frame-work, covered with coarse paper, on which an impression is first taken; the whole of the printed part is then cut out, leaving apertures exactly corresponding with the pages of type on the carriage of the press. The frisket when folded on to the tympans, and both turned down over the forme of types and run in under the platten, preserves the sheet from contact with any thing but the inked surface of the types, when the pull, which brings down the screw and forces the platten to produce the impression, is made by the pressman who works the lever,—to whom is facetiously given the title of “the practitioner at the bar.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Early Typography|last = Skeen|first =William|publisher =Government Printer, Colombo |year =1872|isbn = |location =Ceylon|pages = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Gutenberg's press ==
{{See also|Letterpress printing}}

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehn—a man who had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; However, it was not until a 1439 [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt;

Having previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an [[alloy]] of [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[antimony]], which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions,&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58–69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a special [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His [[type case]] is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, [[typographic ligature|ligatures]], punctuation marks, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahnke|2009|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based [[ink]] which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and [[vellum]] (high-quality parchment). In the [[Gutenberg Bible]], Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapr|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later work, the [[Mainz Psalter]] of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]], had elaborate red and blue printed initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapr|1996|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Printing Revolution ==

The Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an "agent of change" through the societies that it reached. ([[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein|Eisenstein (1980)]])

=== Mass production and spread of printed books ===
{{See also|Global spread of the printing press|List of early modern newspapers}}
[[File:Printing towns incunabula.svg|thumb|left|Spread of printing in the 15th century from [[Mainz]], Germany]]
[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450–1800.png|thumb|The European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buringh|van Zanden|2009|p=417, table 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The invention of mechanical movable type printing led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in [[Mainz]], Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="ISTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html |title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, [[Bohemia]] and Poland.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; From that time on, it is assumed that "the printed book was in universal use in Europe".&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt;

In Italy, a center of early printing, print shops had been established in 77 cities and towns by 1500. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, with a total of nearly three thousand printers known to be active. Despite this proliferation, printing centres soon emerged; thus, one third of the Italian printers published in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsa|1976|p=314}}; {{harvnb|Borsa|1977|p=166−169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; In the following century, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt;

European printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing about 1,500 impressions per workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollak |first1=Michael|title=The performance of the wooden printing press|journal=The Library Quarterly|date=1972|volume=42|issue=2|pages=218–264|jstor=4306163}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[History of printing in East Asia|book printing in East Asia]] did not use presses and was solely done by [[block printing]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham 1965, p. 211: {{quote|The outstanding difference between the two ends of the Old World was the absence of screw-presses from China, but this is only another manifestation of the fact that this basic mechanism was foreign to that culture.}} {{harvnb|Widmann|1974|p=34, fn. 14}}: {{quote|In East Asia, both woodblock and movable type printing were manual reproduction techniques, that is hand printing.}}  {{harvnb|Duchesne|2006|p=83}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002|pp=112–115}}: {{quote|Chinese paper was suitable only for calligraphy or block-printing; there were no screw-based presses in the east, because they were not wine-drinkers, didn’t have olives, and used other means to dry their paper.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[Erasmus]]'s work, at least 750,000 copies were sold during his lifetime alone (1469–1536).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Issawi|1980|pp=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of the Reformation, the revolutionary potential of bulk printing took princes and [[papacy]] alike by surprise. In the period from 1518 to 1524, the publication of books in Germany alone skyrocketed sevenfold; between 1518 and 1520, [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne|2006|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first [[newspaper]]s (see ''[[Relation (journal)|Relation]]'') which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|pp=387f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Incunable]] are surviving pre-16th century print works which are collected by many of the libraries in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;The British Library [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue] gives 29,777 separate ''editions'' (not copies) as of 8 January 2008, which however includes some print items from the 16th century (retrieved 11 March 2010). According to Bettina Wagner: "Das Second-Life der Wiegendrucke. Die Inkunabelsammlung der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek", in: Griebel, Rolf; Ceynowa, Klaus (eds.): "Information, Innovation, Inspiration. 450 Jahre Bayerische Staatsbibliothek", K G Saur, München 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-598-11772-5}}, pp. 207–224 (207f.), the [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] lists 28,107 editions published before 1501.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing press was also a factor in the establishment of a community of [[scientists]] who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated scholarly journals, helping to bring on the [[scientific revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Because of the printing press, [[author]]ship became more meaningful and profitable. It was suddenly important who had said or written what, and what the precise formulation and time of composition was. This allowed the exact citing of references, producing the rule, "One Author, one work (title), one piece of information" (Giesecke, 1989; 325). Before, the author was less important, since a copy of [[Aristotle]] made in Paris would not be exactly identical to one made in Bologna. For many works prior to the printing press, the name of the author has been entirely lost.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Because the printing process ensured that the same information fell on the same pages, page numbering, tables of contents, and indices became common, though they previously had not been unknown.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The process of reading also changed, gradually moving over several centuries from oral readings to silent, private reading.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Over the next 200 years, the wider availability of printed materials led to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Josh. “The State of Publishing: Literacy Rates.” ''McSweeney’s Internet Tendency''. McSweeney, 5 July 2011. Web. 28 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing press was an important step towards the [[democratization of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,473529-2,00.html Malte Herwig, "Google's Total Library", ''Spiegel Online International'', Mar. 28, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/technology/1057780670.php Howard Rheingold, "Moblogs Seen as a Crystal Ball for a New Era in Online Journalism", ''Online Journalism Review'', Jul. 9, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within 50 or 60 years of the invention of the printing press, the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe (Eisenstein, 1969; 52). More people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Book production became more commercialised, and the first [[copyright]] laws were passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/copyright-ip/2486-copyright-timeline#.Wl1E7ainHIU|title=Copyright Timeline: A History of Copyright in the United States {{!}} Association of Research Libraries® {{!}} ARL®|last=Eshgh|first=Amy|website=www.arl.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the printing press was criticized for allowing the dissemination of information which may have been incorrect.&lt;ref name="CrickWalsham2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julia C. Crick|author2=Alexandra Walsham|title=The uses of script and print, 1300–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8005wHw-KsC|accessdate=25 March 2011|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81063-0|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilton2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Bilton|title=I Live in the Future &amp; Here's How It Works: Why Your World, Work, and Brain Are Being Creatively Disrupted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VXRLlTDNrUC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=14 September 2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-307-59111-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second outgrowth of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works, to be replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. The printed word also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect 'decreasing' their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited{{Who|date=March 2015}} as one of the causes of the rise of [[nationalism]] in Europe.

A third consequence of popularization of printing was on the economy. The printing press was associated with higher levels of city growth.&lt;ref name="Dittmar2011"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Jeremiah Dittmar|title=Information technology and economic change: The impact of the printing press|url=http://voxeu.org/article/information-technology-and-economic-change-impact-printing-press|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=VoxEU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of trade related manuals and books teaching techniques like [[double-entry bookkeeping]] increased the reliability of trade and led to the decline of merchant guilds and the rise of individual traders.&lt;ref name="Raj2017"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Prateek Raj|title=How the Postal System and the Printing Press Transformed European Markets|url=http://evonomics.com/europe-markets-guilds-merchants-declined/|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=Evonomics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial printing presses ==
{{See also|History of printing}}
At the dawn of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the mechanics of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 130–133) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, the Stanhope press doubled the output of the old style press.&lt;ref name="Bolza 1967, 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza|1967|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.

[[File:Koenig's steam press - 1814.png|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Koenig|Koenig]]'s 1814 steam-powered printing press]]

Two ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer [[Friedrich Koenig]] in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818.&lt;ref name="Bolza 1967, 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza|1967|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met [[Thomas Bensley]] and secured financial support for his project in 1807.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine."&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer [[Andreas Friedrich Bauer]].

Koenig and Bauer sold two of their first models to ''[[The Times]]'' in [[London]] in 1814, capable of 1,100 impressions per hour. The first edition so printed was on 28 November 1814. They went on to perfect the early model so that it could print on both sides of a sheet at once. This began the long process of making [[newspaper]]s available to a mass audience (which in turn helped spread literacy), and from the 1820s changed the nature of [[book]] production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other [[metadata (computing)|metadata]]. Their company [[Koenig &amp; Bauer AG]] is still one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing presses today.

===Rotary press===
The steam powered [[rotary printing press]], invented in 1843 in the [[United States]] by [[Richard M. Hoe]],&lt;ref name="meggs147"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meggs|first=Philip B.|authorlink=Philip B. Meggs|title=A History of Graphic Design|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=1998|location=|edition=Third|page=147|isbn=978-0-471-29198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace.

By the late 1930s or early 1940s, rotary presses had increased substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press was capable of performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Also, in the middle of the 19th century, there was a separate development of [[jobbing presses]], small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as [[billhead]]s, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. Jobbing presses were capable of quick set-up (average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes) and quick production (even on treadle-powered jobbing presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [iph] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.

'''Real utopian sociology''' is a [[sociology]] and type of emancipatory [[social science]] created and practiced by [[Erik Olin Wright]]. The seemingly contradictory term is literal, as the goal of real [[utopia]]n sociology is finding utopian projects in the world as it exists and systematically evaluating their potential to replace systems of domination, particularly capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/OVERVIEW.html|title=OVERVIEW|last=Wright|first=Erik|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, real utopian sociology is the scientific and pragmatic pursuit of studying utopian models for society as it could exist, and pathways to get there. 

Since 1991 Wright has organized a series of workshop conferences known as ''The Real Utopian Project'' that model the practice of real utopian sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/RealUtopias.htm|title=RealUtopias|last=Wright|first=Erik Olin|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferences are sponsored by the A.E. Havens Center for Social Justice at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and structured around “a provocative manuscript that lays out the basic outlines of a radical institutional proposal.”&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This manuscript is then sent to 15-20 scholars, who write essays on the topic. Prior to the conference these essays are circulated to all the conference participants and then each is discussed at the conference. Following the conference, participants have the opportunity to revise their work before it’s collectively published in Verso’s ''Real Utopias Project'' series; with the exception of papers from the first 1991 conference, which were not published as a series.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; 

Past conference topics include: [[Basic income|Basic Income Grants]];&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Secondary Associations and Democratic Governance;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/Associations%20and%20Democracy%20--%20Real%20Utopias%20Project%20Volume%20I%20(1995).pdf|title=Associations and Democracy: The Real Utopias Project, Vol. 1|last=Center|first=A.

The foundations of this work may be traced to [[philosopher]] and sociologist [[George Herbert Mead]], whose work provided major insights into the formation of [[mind]], concepts of [[self (philosophy)|self]] and other, and the internalization of [[society]] in individual social beings, viewing these as emerging out of human interaction and [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;(Walter Buckley, 1996; Norbert Wiley, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work &lt;ref&gt;(Buckley, 1996; Tom R. Burns and Erik Engdahl, 1998a, 1998b, Burns et al., 2003, among others)&lt;/ref&gt; brings such a sociological and social psychological perspective to bear on several key aspects of consciousness, and in doing so inverts explanation: starting from collective phenomena, one ends  up analyzing individual consciousness. 

In making this inversion, they do not totally reject [[reductionist]] approaches—nor deny their value in identifying the "hardware" through which collective and social psychological processes operate. However, they would reject the idea that a complete explanation can be formulated on the basis of either purely sociological mechanisms or underlying [[physics|physical]], [[chemistry|chemical]], [[neurological]], [[hormonal]], or [[psychological]] factors and processes. For a critique of reductionism from the perspective of modern physics and [[biology]] see Morowitz (1981). 

The biological and bio-physical bases of human life are recognized. However, these approaches cannot be relied on entirely. In part, the level of analysis is misdirected when it comes to some classes of consciousness phenomena; most of the natural science approaches focus on the wrong levels and the wrong factors with which to explain some of the most mysterious and paradoxical features of human consciousness.

== Theory ==
The sociological approach &lt;ref&gt;(Buckley, 1996; Burns and Engdahl (1998a, 1998b), Wiley, 1994, 1986 among others)&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the importance of [[language]], collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-reflectivity. This theoretical approach argues that the shape and feel of human consciousness is heavily social, and this is no less true of our experiences of "collective consciousness" than it is of our experiences of individual consciousness. 

The theory suggests that the problem of consciousness can be approached fruitfully by beginning with the human group and collective phenomena: [[community]], language, language-based communication, institutional, and cultural arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;(Wiley, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; A collective is a group or [[population]] of individuals that possesses or develops through communication collective representations or models of "we" as opposed to "them": a group, community, organization, or nation is contrasted to "other"; its values and goals, its structure and modes of operating, its relation to its environment and other agents, its potentialities and weaknesses, strategies and developments, and so on. 

A collective has the capacity in its collective representations and communications about what characterizes it, or what (and how) this self perceives, judges, or does, or what it can (and cannot) do, or should do (or should not do). It monitors its activities, its achievements and failures, and also to a greater or lesser extent, analyzes and discusses itself as a defined and developing collective agent. 

This is what is meant by self-reflectivity. Such reflectivity is encoded in language and developed in conversations about collective selves (as we discuss below, there are also conversations about the selves of individuals, defining, justifying, and stigmatizing them).

=== Human consciousness as a reflective activity ===
Human consciousness in at least one major sense is a type of reflective activity. It entails the capacity to observe, monitor, judge, and decide about the collective self. This is a basis for maintaining a particular collective as it is understood or represented; it is a basis for re-orienting and re-organizing the collective self in response to performance failings or profound crisis (economic, political, cultural).

Collective reflectivity emerges then as a function of a group or organization producing and making use of collective representations of the self in its discussions, critical reflections, planning, and actions.

===Individual consciousness===
Individual consciousness is the normal outcome of processes of collective naming, classifying, monitoring, judging, and reflecting on the individual members of the group or organization. And an individual in a collective context learns to participate in discussions and discourses about "themself", that is, group reflections on themself, their appearance, their orientations and attitudes, their strategies and conduct. Thus, an individual learns (in line with George Herbert Mead's earlier formulations) a naming and classification of themself (self-description and identity) and a characterization of their judgments, actions, and predispositions.

In acquiring a language and conceptual framework for this mode of activity along with experience and skills in reflective discussion they develop a capability of inner reflection and inner dialog about themself. These are characteristic features of a particular type of individual "consciousness". This conception points up the socially constructed character of key properties of the human mind, realized through processes of social interaction and social [[constructavism|construction]]. In sum, individual self-representation, self-reference, self-reflectivity, and experiences of consciousness, derive from the collective experience.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Engdahl, 1998b; Wiley, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction of selves through reflectivity===
Self-reflectivity as a type of consciousness often facililtates critical examination and re-construction of selves, collective as well as individual. This plays an essential role in human communities (as well as individual beings) in the face of systematic or highly risky performance failures or new types of problems. Through self-reflection, agents may manage in the course of directed [[problem-solving]] to develop more effective [[institutions|institutional arrangements]], for instance, large-scale means of social coordination such as administration, [[democracy|democratic association]], or [[market (economics)|market]]s.

== Relationship with social organization ==
Language-based collective representations of the past as well as of the [[future]], enable agents to escape the present, to enter into future as well as past imagined worlds, and to reflect together on these worlds. Moreover, in relation to the past, present, and future, the agents may generate alternative representations. These alternative constructions imagined, discussed, struggled over, and tested, make for the generation of variety, a major input into evolutionary processes, as discussed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns et al., 2003; Burns and Dietz, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such variety may also lead to social conflicts, as agents disagree about representations, or oppose the implications or remedies to problems proposed by particular agents. This opens the way for political struggles about alternative conceptions and solutions (where democratic politics entails at times collective self-reflectivity par excellence). 

In general, such processes enhance the collective capacity to deal with new challenges and crises. Thus, a collective has potentially a rich basis not only for talking about, discussing, agreeing (or disagreeing) about a variety of objects including the "collective self" as well as particular "individual selves"; but it also has a means to conceptualize and develop alternative types of social relationships, effective forms of [[leadership]], [[:wikt:coordination|coordination]] and control, and, in general, new [[norm (social)|normative]] orders and institutional arrangements.

Collectives can even develop their potentialities for collective representation and self-reflectivity, for instance through innovations in information and accounting systems and processes of social accountability. These potentialities enable systematic, directed problem-solving, and the generation of variety and complex strategies. In particular selective environments, these make for major evolutionary advantages.

=== Oppressive reflectivity ===
The powerful tool of collective reflectivity must be seen as a double-edged sword in relation to expanding [[freedom of opportunity]] and variability, on the one hand, and, on the other, imposing particular constraints and limiting variability. 

Collective representations and reflectivity and directed problem-solving based on them may prevent human groups from experiencing or discovering the un-represented and the unnamed; unrecognized or poorly defined problems cannot be dealt with (as discussed elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;(Burns et al., 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, in the case of failures of accounting systems to recognize or take into account important social and environmental conditions and developments). 

Reflective and problem-solving powers may then be distorted, the generation of alternatives and varieties narrow and largely ineffective, and social innovation and transformation misdirected and possibly self-destructive. Thus, the presumed evolutionary advantages of human reflectivity must be qualified or viewed as conditional.

==Outlooks==
In sum, recent research, building on the work of George Herbert Mead, suggests that a sociological and social psychological perspective can be a point of departure with which to define and analyze certain forms of human consciousness, or more precisely, one class of consciousness phenomena, namely verbalized reflectivity: monitoring, discussing, judging and re-orienting and re-organizing self; representing and analyzing what characterizes the self, what self perceives, judges, could do, should do (or should not do)). 

The "hard problem" of consciousness &lt;ref&gt;(Chalmers, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; can be approached fruitfully by beginning with the human group and collective phenomena: community, language, language-based communication, institutional and cultural arrangements, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-referentiality. Collective reflectivity emerges as a function of an organization or group producing and making use of collective representations of the self ("we", our group, community, organization, nation) in its discussions, critical reflections, and decision-making. A collective monitors and discusses its activities, achievements and failures, and reflects on itself as a defined, acting, and developing collective being. This reflectivity is encoded in language and developed in conversations about collective (as well as individual) selves.

Individual consciousness is seen as deriving from the processes of collective naming, classifying, monitoring, judging, reflecting on, and conducting discussions and discourses about, the individual themself. In acquiring a language and conceptual framework for this mode of activity—along with skills and experiences in reflective discussion—they develop a capability of inner reflection and [[internal discourse|inner discourse]] about self, which are characteristic features of individual consciousness. One can also distinguish multiple modes of individual awareness and consciousness, distinguishing awareness from consciousness proper, and also identifying pre- and [[sub-conscious]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns and Engdahl, 1998b)&lt;/ref&gt; This points up the [[complexity]] of the human mind, in part because of its elaboration through processes of social interaction and construction.

'''''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story''''' is a 2016 documentary and comedy film by Nicholas Tana that attempts to explain why most people are afraid to discuss [[masturbation]]. The movie is one of the first documentaries to address the myths and social taboos around masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexpert.com/sextainment/sticky-self-love-story-first-documentary-masturbation/|title=Sticky, A (Self) Love Story; The First Documentary on Masturbation - Sexpert.com|first=Anka|last=Radakovich|website=Sexpert.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer for ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/01/watch-things-get-sticky-in-exclusive-trailer-for-nsfw-masturbation-doc-38861|title=Watch: Things Get ‘Sticky’ in Exclusive Trailer for NSFW Masturbation Doc|first=Mike|last=Lown|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was selected as top trailers of the week by [[IndieWire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/the-best-trailers-of-the-week-high-rise-masturbation-doc-and-tilda-swinton-make-a-splash-20160108|title=The Best Trailers of The Week... |author=Zach Sharf|publisher=IndieWire|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/director-nicholas-tana-sticky-a-self-love-story-interview|title=Director Nicholas Tana Breaks Down The Taboos Of Masturbation In 'Sticky: A Self Love Story'|date=February 3, 2016|website=Uproxx.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on sex education==
The feature-length documentary has received positive reviews in national media for its controversial stance in favor of [[masturbation]] as part of [[sex education]]. The filmmaker Nicholas Tana was paid to speak during a screening of his film at the 47th. annual [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists|American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT)]] conference in Minneapolis in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aasect.org/sites/default/files/AASECT%202015%20Annual%20Conference%20Final%20Program%20(Minneapolis,%20MN).pdf|format=PDF|title=47TH AASECT ANNUAL CONFERENCE|website=Aasect.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time an early educational cut of the film was screened in front of over a hundred certified sex educators. 

The AASECT screening resulted in invitations to conduct educational screenings at [[Arizona State University]] sponsored by VOX Voices For Planned Parenthood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/this-asu-grad-made-a-masturbation-doc-called-sticky-because-of-course-8194179|title=This ASU Grad Made a Masturbation Doc Called Sticky, Because of Course|author=Lauren Cusimano|work=The Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Wisconsin]] sponsored by Sex Outloud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://union.wisc.edu/events-and-activities/event-calendar/event/sticky-2016|title=Sticky (2016)|website=Wisc.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eastern Michigan University]] spearheaded by Pam Landau of the Psychology department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emich.edu/psychology/special-events/HSM_2016_sticky.php|title=Eastern Michigan University: Psychology Department|website=Emich.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2016 and ending in May 2016 in honor of international Masturbation Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-zombeck/get-to-know-yourself-its-_b_3290255.html|title=Get to Know Yourself -- It's Masturbation Month|first=Richard|last=Zombeck|date=May 20, 2013|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film addresses the need for sex education that discusses masturbation in a healthy manner to students; it includes interviewees with sex educators who express concerns about not properly educating children around sex and masturbation. The [[Harvard University]] screened ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' on campus in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on April 4, 2017, as part of Harvard's Sex week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/4/11/sex-weekend-stimulates-discussion|title='Sex Weekend' Seeks to Stimulate Discussion - News|website=Thecrimson.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasting viewpoints on health==
Full of interviews from sex educators, religious figures, and psychologists, the documentary offers often contrasting opinions about the health benefits both physically and psychologically of masturbation. Among those interviewed who belief masturbation could be harmful is Alexander Rhodes, the founder of a popular Reddit masturbation abstinence group called [[NoFap]]. The movie also includes health findings associated with a Cambridge Study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090126082343.htm|title=Frequent Sex And Masturbation In 20s And 30s Linked To Higher Prostate Cancer, But Risks Diminish With Age|website=Sciencedaily.com|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that link masturbation to prostate cancer, and a Chinese medical doctor's warning about the impact too much masturbation could have on a men's health and vitality.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

These perspectives are contrasted with sex-positive statements from notable sex educators who speak in favor of the health benefits of [[masturbation]]. The film also references a medical study written in [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] indicating that masturbation might help to prevent prostate cancer.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Sex-positive feminism==
The film contains interviews with some of the founding members of the [[Sex-positive feminism|sex positive feminism]] movement. These interviewees include [[Nina Hartley]], [[Betty Dodson]], [[Joani Blank]], and [[Carol Queen]].{{cn|date=September 2017}} Judy Norsidian and Wendy Sanford who worked for many years on the publication of the historical sex education book "[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]" both appear in the film.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Issues==
''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' traces societal shame and guilt affiliated with [[masturbation]] to events in history and religious beliefs, and calls into question how this may influence politics and scientific study. {{cn|date=September 2017}} Among the issues discussed in the film is the [[Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act|Anti-Obscenity Act]] that bans the sale of sex toys in the state of Alabama, and the contradictory stances of four major religions surrounding [[masturbation]], which include [[Catholicism]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Judaism]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other topics include the controversial firing of the first African American [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] by former U.S. President Bill Clinton; the career damaging fall out after [[Paul Reubens]] (Pee-Wee Herman) arrest in an adult theater for masturbating in public; current debates concerning sex education; the billion dollar sex toy industry; contradictory prostate cancer studies linked to male masturbation; the media obsession with sex addiction and sexual compulsion; the FBI study that links compulsive masturbation to serial killers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfYFYEWb62AC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=FBI+Study+compulsive+masturbation+to+serial+killers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EtBe5Bqga4&amp;sig=DoxQo82Na5DxH6GALXLzlMfsOOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkoJS_2u_QAhUDzWMKHYwbC8AQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=FBI+Study+compulsive+masturbation+to+serial+killers&amp;f=false|title=Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters|first=Peter|last=Vronsky|date=5 October 2004|publisher=Penguin|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of pornography on relationships; opinions as to the future of masturbation.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Masturbation in politics==
The film contains an interview with the first African American appointed as Surgeon General, [[Joycelyn Elders]] about why she was fired by former president [[Bill Clinton]] for her controversial statement on world's AIDS day in favor of sex education on masturbation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/remember-time-bill-clinton-fired-his-surgeon-general-encouraging-masturbation-423302|title=Remember that Time Bill Clinton Fired His Surgeon General For Encouraging Masturbation Education?|author=Zach Schonfeld|website=Newsweek.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an interview with comedian [[Janeane Garofalo]] about her embarrassment on doing the phone sex masturbation scene in ''[[The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs|The Truth About Cats And Dogs]]'', and an interview with "[[Hustler]]" creator [[Larry Flynt]] about how he came to discover masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/22/sticky-documentary-dispels-myths-about-self-love.html|title='Sticky' Documentary Dispels Myths About Self-Love|author=Samantha Allen|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masturbation in film, TV, and music==
The impact of masturbation on the media is explored through a series of movie clips and music. [[Film Threat]] founder and film critic, [[Chris Gore]], states in the documentary that most instances of masturbation depicted in movies or television are seen as either grotesque or as something one wouldn't want to be caught doing. This comment is substantiated by clips from movies like ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film series)|American Pie]]'' shown in the film. 

Television clips from the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode called "The Contest" and a clip from ''[[Sex and the City|Sex in the City]]'' are also discussed, along with songs that make reference to masturbation in some way. A section in the film on Masturbation and Media includes interviews with comedian [[Ant (comedian)|ANT]], and [[Keith Morris]], singer/songwriter formerly of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Circle Jerks|The Circle Jerks]]. The movie features an acoustic performance of the song "[[I Touch Myself|Touch Myself]]" played by songwriter Billy Steinberg who is also interviewed in the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sdcitybeat.com/article-17814-keith-morris-sticky-a-(self)-love-story-and-the-radvocate.html|title=Keith Morris, ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' and The Radvocate|author=Citybeat Staff|work=San Diego City Beat|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subvocalization''', or silent [[Speech communication|speech]], is the [[Internal Monologue|internal speech]] typically made when [[reading (activity)|reading]]; it provides the [[sound]] of the [[word]] as it is read.&lt;ref name=carter&gt;Carver, R. P. (1990) Reading Rate: A Comprehensive Review of Research and Theory (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=History&gt;Cleland, D. L., Davies, W. C and T. C. 1963. Research in Reading. ''The Reading Teacher'', ''16''(4), 224-228&lt;/ref&gt; This is a natural process when reading, and it helps the [[mind]] to access meanings to comprehend and [[memory|remember]] what is read, potentially reducing [[cognitive load]].&lt;ref name=rayner&gt;Rayner, Keith and Pollatsek, Alexander (1994) The Psychology of Reading&lt;/ref&gt; This inner speech is characterized by minuscule movements in the [[larynx]] and other muscles involved in the articulation of speech. Most of these movements are undetectable (without the aid of machines) by the person who is reading.&lt;ref name=rayner /&gt; It is one of the components of Baddeley and Hitch's [[phonological loop]] proposal which accounts for the storage of these types of information into short-term memory.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, J. D., Wilson, M., &amp; Reisberg, D. (1995). The role of subvocalization in auditory imagery. ''Neuropsychologia, 33(11)'', 1433-1454.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|alt=the larynx and associated musculature|the larynx and associated musculature]]

==History of subvocalization research==
Subvocalization has been considered as far back as 1868.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;  Only in 1899 did an experiment take place to record movement of the [[larynx]] through silent reading by a researcher named Curtis, who concluded that silent reading was the only mental activity that created considerable movement of the larynx.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;
 
In 1950 Edfelt reached a breakthrough when he created an electrically powered instrument that can record movement.  He concluded that newer techniques are needed to accurately record information and that efforts should be made to understand this phenomenon instead of eliminating it.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;  After failed attempts trying to reduce silent speech in study participants, in 1952, it came to the conclusion that silent speech is a developmental activity which reinforces learning and should not be disrupted during [[Child development|development]]. In 1960, Edfelt seconded this opinion.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

==Techniques for studying subvocalization==
Subvocalization is commonly studied using [[electromyography]] (EMG) recordings,&lt;ref name=Locke&gt;Locke, J., &amp; Fehr, F. (1972). Subvocalization of Heard or Seen Words Prior to Spoken or Written Recall. The American Journal of Psychology, 8(1), 63-68.&lt;/ref&gt; concurrent speaking tasks,&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;Levy, B. A. (1971). Role of Articulation in Auditory and Visual Short-Term Memory. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour, 10, 123-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Daneman&gt;Daneman, M., &amp; Newson, M. (1992). Assessing the Importance of Subvocalization in Normal Silent Reading. Reading and Writing: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 4, 55-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek&gt;Slowiaczek, M., &amp; Clifton, C. (1980). Subvocalization and reading for meaning. Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior, 19.5, 573-582.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speech shadowing|shadowing]],&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;  and other techniques.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt; 

EMG can be used to show the degree to which one is subvocalizing&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt; or to train subvocalization suppression.&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;Cole, R. A., &amp; Young, M. (1975). Effect of subvocalization on memory for speech sounds. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 1(6), 772-779.&lt;/ref&gt; EMG is used to record the electrical activity produced by the articulatory muscles involved in subvocalization. Greater electrical activity suggests a stronger use of subvocalization.&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; In the case of suppression training, the trainee is shown their own EMG recordings while attempting to decrease the movement of the articulatory muscles.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; The EMG recordings allows one to monitor and ideally reduce subvocalization.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;

In concurrent speaking tasks, participants of a study are asked to complete an activity specific to the experiment while simultaneously repeating an irrelevant word.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; For example, one may be asked to read a paragraph while reciting the word "cola" over and over again.&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt; Speaking the repeated irrelevant word is thought to preoccupy the articulators used in subvocalization.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; Subvocalization, therefore, cannot be used in the mental processing of the activity being studied. Participants who had undergone the concurrent speaking task are often compared to other participants of the study who had completed the same activity without subvocalization interference. If performance on the activity is significantly less for those in the concurrent speaking task group than for those in the non-interference group, subvocalization is believed to play a role in the mental processing of that activity.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; The participants in the non-interference comparison group usually also complete a different, yet equally distracting task that does not involve the articulator muscles &lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;(i.e. tapping). This ensures that the difference in performance between the two groups is in fact due to subvocalization disturbances and not due to things such as task difficulty or a divide in attention.&lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; 

Shadowing is conceptually similar to concurrent speaking tasks. Instead of repeating an irrelevant word, shadowing requires participants to listen to a list of words and to repeat those words as fast as possible while completing a separate task being studied by experimenters.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;  

Techniques for subvocalization interference other may also include counting,&lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt; chewing &lt;ref name=Eiter/&gt; or locking one's jaw while placing the tongue on the roof of one's mouth.&lt;ref name=Eiter/&gt;

[[Subvocal recognition]] involves monitoring actual movements of the [[tongue]] and [[vocal cords]] that can be interpreted by [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] sensors. Through the use of electrodes and [[nanocircuitry]], synthetic telepathy could be achieved allowing people to communicate silently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://txchnologist.com/post/43496630304/temporary-tattoos-could-make-electronic-telepathy|title=Temporary Tattoos Could Make Electronic Telepathy, Telekinesis Possible|website=Txchnologist.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary background==
The exploration into the evolutionary background of subvocalization is currently very limited. The little known is predominantly about language acquisition and memory. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that the development of subvocalization is related to [[Modularity of mind|modular]] aspects of the brain.&lt;ref name=evolution&gt;Buller, D. J. (2005). ''Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature''. Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a great amount of exploration on the evolutionary basis of [[universal grammar]].&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; The idea is that although the specific language one initially learns is dependent on one's culture, all languages are learned through the activation of universal "language modules" that are present in each of us.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; This concept of a modular mind is a prevalent idea that will help explore memory and its relation to language more clearly, and possibly illuminate the evolutionary basis of subvocalization. Evidence for the mind having modules for superior function is the example that hours may be spent toiling over a car engine in an attempt to flexibly formulate a solution, but, in contrast, extremely long and complex sentences can be comprehended, understood, related and responded to in seconds.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; The specific inquiry into subvocalization may be minimal right now but there is a lot to investigate in regard to the modular mind.

==Associated brain structures and processes==
The brain mechanics of subvocalization are still not well understood. It is safe to say that more than one part of the brain is used, and that no single test can reveal all the relevant processes.  Studies often use [[event-related potential]]s; brief changes in an EEG ([[electroencephalography]]) to show brain activation, or [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRIs]].

Subvocalization is related to inner speech; when we use inner speech there is bilateral activation in predominantly the [[Frontal lobe|left frontal lobe]].&lt;ref name=brainstructures&gt;Girbau, D. (2007). A Neurocognitive Approach to the Study of Private Speech. ''The Spanish Journal of Psychology'', ''10''(1), 41-51&lt;/ref&gt; This activation could suggest that the frontal lobes may be involved in [[motor planning]] for speech output.&lt;ref name=brainstructures/&gt;

Subvocal rehearsal is controlled by [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down processing]];&lt;ref name=brainstructures/&gt; conceptually driven, it relies on information already in memory.&lt;ref name=brainstructures2&gt;Klob, B. &amp; Whishaw, I.Q. (2009). ‘’Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology’’ (6th ed.). New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for significant left hemisphere activation in the [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior]] and [[Middle frontal gyrus|middle frontal gyri]] and inferior parietal gyrus during subvocal rehearsal.&lt;ref name="brainstructures"/&gt; [[Broca's area]] has also been found to have activation in other studies exploring subvocal rehearsal.&lt;ref name=brainstructures3&gt;Burgess, N. &amp; Hitch, G. J. (1999). Memory for Serial Order: A Network Model of the Phonological Loop and its Timing. ''Psychological Review'', ''106''(3), 551-581&lt;/ref&gt;

Silent speech-reading and silent counting are also examined when experimenters look at subvocalization. These tasks show activation in the frontal cortices, [[hippocampus]] and the [[thalamus]] for silent counting.&lt;ref name=brainstructures/&gt; Silent-reading activates similar areas of the [[Primary auditory cortex|auditory cortex]] that are involved in listening.&lt;ref name=brainstructures/&gt;
    
Finally, the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|phonological loop]]; proposed by Baddeley and Hitch as “being responsible for temporary storage of speech-like information”&lt;ref name=brainstructure4&gt;Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M. W. &amp; Anderson, M. C. (2009). ''Memory''. New York, NY: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; is an active subvocal rehearsal mechanism, activation originating mostly in the left hemispheric speech areas: Broca's, lateral and medial premotor cortices and the [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name=brainstructures5&gt;Gruber, O. (2001). Effects of Domain-specific Interference on Brain Activation Associated with Verbal Working Memory Task Performance. ''Cerebral Cortex'', ''11'', 1047-1055&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of subvocalization in memory processes==
===The phonological loop and rehearsal===
{{further|Phonological loop}}

The ability to store verbal material in [[working memory]], and the storage of verbal material in [[short-term memory]] relies on a phonological loop.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; This loop, proposed by Baddeley and Hitch, represents a system that is composed of a short-term store in which memory is represented [[phonology|phonologically]], and a rehearsal process. This rehearsal preserves and refreshes the material by re-enacting it and re-presenting it to short-term storage, and subvocalization is a major component of this rehearsal.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The phonological loop system features an interaction between subvocal rehearsal and specific storage for phonological material.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;  The phonological loop contributes to the study of the role of subvocalization and the inner voice in auditory imagery.&lt;ref name=Hubbard&gt;Hubbard, T.L. (2010). Auditory imagery: empirical findings. ''Psychological Bulletin, 136(2)'', 302-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Subvocalization and the phonological loop interact in a non-dependent manner demonstrated by their differential requirements on different tasks.&lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt; The role of subvocalization within the workings of memory processes is heavily reliant on its involvement with Baddeley's proposed phonological loop.

===Working memory===
{{further|Working memory}}

There have been findings that support a role of subvocalization in the mechanisms underlying working memory and the holding of information in an accessible and malleable state. Some forms of internal speech-like processing may function as a holding mechanism in immediate memory tasks.&lt;ref name="Standing1980"&gt;Standing, L., Bond, B., Smith, P., Isley, C. (1980). Is the immediate memory span determined by subvocalization rate? ''British Journal of Psychology, 71(4)'', 535-539&lt;/ref&gt; The working memory span is a behavioural measure of “exceptional consistency” &lt;ref name="Standing1989"&gt;Standing, L., &amp; Curtis, L. (1989). Subvocalization rate versus other predictors of the memory span. ''Psychological Reports,65(2)'', 487-495.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a positive function of the rate of subvocalization. Experimental data has shown that this span size increases as the rate of subvocalization increases, and the time needed to subvocalize the number of items comprising a span is generally constant.&lt;ref name="Standing1980"/&gt; [[fMRI]] data suggests that a sequence of five letters approaches the individual capacity for immediate [[Recollection|recall]] that relies on subvocal rehearsal alone.&lt;ref name=Logie&gt;Logie, R.H., Venneri, A., Sala, S.D., Redpath, T.W., Marshall, I. (2003). Brain activation and the phonological loop: the impact of rehearsal. ''Brain and Cognition, 53(2)'', 293-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short-term memory===
{{further|Short-term memory}}

The role of subvocal rehearsal is also seen in short-term memory.  Research has confirmed that this form of rehearsal benefits some [[cognition|cognitive]] functioning.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Subvocal movements that occur when people listen to or rehearse a series of speech sounds will help the subject to maintain the [[phoneme|phonemic]] representation of these sounds in their short-term memory, and this finding is supported by the fact that interfering with the overt production of speech sound did not disrupt the encoding of the sound's features in short term memory.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; This suggests a strong role played by subvocalization in the encoding of speech sounds into short-term memory.  It has also been found that language differences in short-term memory performance in bilingual people is mediated, but not exclusively, by subvocal rehearsal.&lt;ref name=Thorn&gt;Thorn, A. S. C., &amp; Gathercole, S. E. (2001). Language differences in verbal short-term memory do not exclusively originate in the process of subvocal rehearsal. ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 8(2)'', 357-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of acoustic errors in short-term memory is also thought to be, in part, due to subvocalization.&lt;ref name=Glassman&gt;Glassman, W.E. (1972). Subvocal activity and acoustic confusions in short-term memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 96(1)'', 164-169.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who stutter and therefore have a slower rate of subvocal articulation &lt;ref name="Bosshardt 1990"&gt;Bosshardt, H. (1990). Subvocalization and reading rate differences between stuttering and nonstuttering children and adults. ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 3''”, 776-785.&lt;/ref&gt; also demonstrate a short-term reproduction of serial material that is slower as compared to people who do not stutter.&lt;ref name=Bosshardt&gt;Bosshardt, H. (1993). Differences between stutterers and nonstutterers short-term recall and recognition performance.”Journal of Speech &amp; Hearing Research, 36(2)”, 286-293.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encoding===
Subvocalization plays a large role in memory [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]]. Subvocalization appears to facilitate the translating of visual linguistic information into acoustic information &lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eiter/&gt; and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Locke"/&gt; For example, subvocalization occurs when one sees a word and is asked to say it (see-say condition), or when one hears a word and is asked to write it (hear-write condition), but not when one is asked to see a word and then write it (see-write condition) or hear and word and then say it (hear-say condition).&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt; The see-say condition converts visual information into acoustic information. The hear-write condition converts acoustic information into visual information. The see-write and hear-say conditions, however, remain in the same sensory domain and do not require translation into a different type of code.&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt;

This is also supported by findings that suggest that subvocalization is not required for the encoding of speech,&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eiter&gt;Eiter, B., &amp; Inhoff, A. (2010). Visual Word Recognition During Reading by Subvocal Articulation. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 35(2), 457-470.&lt;/ref&gt; as words being heard are already in acoustic form and therefore enter short term memory directly without use of subvocal articulation.&lt;ref name=Eiter/&gt; Furthermore, subvocalization interference impedes reading comprehension but not listening comprehension.&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt;

==Role in reading comprehension==
Subvocalization's role in reading comprehension can be viewed as a function of task complexity. Subvocalization is involved minimally or not at all in immediate comprehension.&lt;ref name=Aaronson&gt;Aaronson, D., &amp; Ferres, S. (1986). Reading Strategies for Children and Adults: A Quantitative Model. Psychological Review, 93(1), 89-112.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, subvocalization is not used in the making of homophone judgements (are heir and air homophones?) &lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; but is used more for the comprehension of sentences and even more still for the comprehension of paragraphs.&lt;ref name="Daneman"/&gt; Subvocalization, which translates visual reading information into a more durable and flexible acoustic code &lt;ref name=Bad&gt;Baddeley, A., Eldridge, M., &amp; Lewis, V. (1981). The role of subvocalisation in reading.. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology, 33(4), 439-454&lt;/ref&gt; is thought to allow for the integration of past concepts with those currently being processed.&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aaronson/&gt;

==Comparison to speed reading==
Advocates of [[speed reading]] generally claim that subvocalization places extra burden on the cognitive resources, thus, slowing the reading down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/cwlt/classes/accelerated-reading/subvocalization/ |title=Subvocalization |work=Accelerated Reading |author=Charlotte Emigh |publisher=University of Puget Sound Center for Writing, Learning &amp; Teaching |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedreading courses often prescribe lengthy practices to eliminate subvocalizing when reading. Normal reading instructors often simply apply remedial teaching to a reader who subvocalizes to the degree that they make visible movements on the [[lip]]s, [[jaw]], or [[throat]].&lt;ref name=mcwhorter /&gt;

Furthermore, fMRI studies comparing fast and slow readers (during a reading task) indicate that between the two groups there are significant differences in the brain areas being activated. In particular, it was found that rapid readers show lower activation in the brain regions associated with speech, which indicates that the higher speeds were attained, in part, by the reduction in subvocalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method|date=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the slower rates (memorizing, [[learning]], and reading for [[reading comprehension|comprehension]]), subvocalizing by the reader is very detectable. At the faster rates of reading ([[Skimming (reading)|skimming]] and scanning), subvocalization is less detectable. For competent readers, subvocalizing to some extent even at scanning rates is normal.&lt;ref name=mcwhorter&gt;McWhorter, K. (2002) Efficient and Flexible Reading. Longman&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, subvocalizing is an inherent part of reading and understanding a word. Micro-muscle tests suggest that full and permanent elimination of subvocalizing is impossible. This may originate in the way people learn to read by associating the [[Visual perception|sight]] of words with their spoken sounds. Sound associations for words are indelibly imprinted on the [[nervous system]]&amp;mdash;even of [[deaf]] people, since they will have associated the word with the mechanism for causing the sound or a sign in a particular [[sign language]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

At the slower [[Reading (activity)#Reading rate|reading rates]] (100–300 words per minute), subvocalizing may improve comprehension.&lt;ref name=rayner /&gt; Subvocalizing or actual vocalizing can indeed be of great help when one wants to learn a passage verbatim. This is because the person is repeating the information in an auditory way, as well as seeing the piece on the paper.

==Auditory imagery==
{{further|Auditory imagery}}

The definition of auditory imagery is analogous to definitions used in other modalities of imagery (such as visual, auditory and olfactory imagery) in that it is, according to Intons-Peterson (1992), “the introspective persistence of an auditory experience, including one constructed from components drawn from long-term memory, in the absence of direct sensory instigation of that experience.”. Auditory imagery is often but not necessarily influenced by subvocalization,&lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt; and has ties to the rehearsal process of working memory.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The conception of working memory relies on a relationship between the "inner ear" and the "inner voice" (subvocalization), and this memory system is posited to be at the basis of auditory imagery. Subvocalization and the phonological store work in partnership in many auditory imagery tasks.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

The extent to which an auditory image can influence detection, encoding and recall of a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] through its relationships to perception and memory has been documented.&lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt; It has been suggested that auditory imagery may slow the decay of memory for [[pitch (music)|pitch]], as demonstrated by T. A. Keller, Cowan, and Saults (1995) &lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt; who demonstrated that the prevention of rehearsal resulted in decreased memory performance for pitch comparison tasks through the introduction of distracting and competing stimuli. It has also been reported that auditory imagery for verbal material is impaired when subvocalization is blocked.&lt;ref name=Aleman&gt;Aleman, A., &amp; vant Wout, M. (2004). Subvocalization in auditory-verbal imagery: Just a form of motor imagery? ''Cognitive Processing, 5(4)'', 228-231.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that subvocalization is common to both auditory imagery and rehearsal.

In objection to a subvocalization mechanism basis for auditory imagery is in the fact that a significant amount of auditory imagery does not involve [[speech]] or stimuli similar to speech, such as music and environmental sounds.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;Pitt, M. A., &amp; Crowder, R. G. (1992). The role of spectral and dynamic cues in imagery for musical timbre. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology:Human Perception and Performance, 18'', 728–738.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, to combat this point, it has been suggested that rehearsal of non-speech sounds can indeed be carried out by the phonological mechanisms previously mentioned, even if the creation of nonspeech sounds within this mechanism isn't possible.&lt;ref name=Baddeley&gt;Baddeley, A. D., &amp; Logie, R. H. (1992). Auditory imagery and working memory. In D. Reisberg (Ed.), ''Auditory imagery'' pp. 179–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in speech==
There are two general types of individuals when it comes to subvocalization.  There are Low-Vocalizers and High-Vocalizers.&lt;ref name=Speech1&gt;Aarons, L. (1971). Subvocalization: Aural and emg feedback in reading. ‘’Perceptual and Motor Skills’’, ‘’33’’(1), 271-306&lt;/ref&gt;  Using [[electromyography]] to record the muscle action potential of the larynx (i.e. muscle movement of the larynx), an individual is categorized under a high or low vocalizer depending on how much muscle movement the muscles in the larynx undergo during silent reading.

===Regulation of speech intensity===
Often in both high and low vocalizers, the rate of speech is constantly regulated depending on intensity/volume of words (said to be affected by long delays between readings) and increasing the delay of speech and hearing ones' voice is an effect called “delayed auditory feedback”.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt;  Increasing the voice intensity while reading was found to be higher in low-vocalizers than high-vocalizers.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt;  It is believed that because high-vocalizers have greater muscle movement of the larynx during silent reading, low-vocalizers read louder to compensate for this lack of movement so they can understand the material.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt;  When individuals undergo “feedback training”, where they are conscious of these muscle movements, this difference diminishes.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt;

===Role in articulation===
{{further|Manner of articulation|l1=Articulation}}

Articulation during silent speech is important, though speech is not solely dependent on articulation alone.  Impairing articulation can reduce sensory input from the muscle movements of the larynx to the brain to understand information being read and it also impaires on-going speech production during reading to direct thinking.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt; Words that are of high similarity minimizes articulation causing interference and may reduce subvocal rehearsal.&lt;ref name=Speech2&gt;Glassman, W. E. (1972). Subvocal activity and acoustic confusions in short-term memory. ‘’Journal of Experimental Psychology’’, ‘’96’’(1), 164-169.&lt;/ref&gt; As articulation of similar words is effecting subvocalization, there is an increase in acoustic errors for short term memory and recall.&lt;ref name=Speech2/&gt;

Impairing or suppressing articulation causes a greater impact on performance.&lt;ref name=Speech3&gt;Neath, I. (2000). Modeling the effects of irrelevant speech on memory. ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', ''7''(3), 403-423.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of articulation suppression is repeating the same word over many times such as ' ''the'' ' and attempting to memorise other words into short term memory. Even though primary cues may be given for these words in attempt to retrieve them, words will either be recalled for the incorrect cue or will not be recalled at all &lt;ref name=Speech3/&gt;

==Schizophrenia and subvocalization==
[[Schizophrenics]] known to experience auditory [[hallucination]]s could show the result of over-activation of the muscles in the larynx.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia&gt;Green, M. F., &amp; Kinsbourne, M. (1990). Subvocal activity and auditory hallucinations: Clues for behavioral treatments?. ''Schizophrenia Bulletin'', ''16''(4), 617-625.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using an electromyography to record muscle movement, individuals experiencing hallucinations showed greater muscle activation before these hallucinations occurred.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia/&gt;  Unfortunately, this muscle activation is not easily detected which means the muscle movement must be measured on a wider range.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia/&gt;
Though a wider range is needed to detect the muscle movement, it is still considered as subvocalization.  Much more research is needed to link subvocalization with hallucination but many schizophrenics report "hearing voices" (as hallucinations) coming from their throat.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia2&gt;Smith, J. D., Wilson, M., &amp; Reisberg, D. (1995). The role of subvocalization in auditory imagery. ''Neuropsychologia'', ''33''(11), 1433-1454. doi:10.1016/0028-3932(95)00074-D&lt;/ref&gt;  This small fact could be a clue to finding if there is a true link between subvocalization and hallucinations, but it is very difficult to see this connection because not many patients experience hallucinations.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">'''Surface engineering''' is the sub-discipline of [[materials science]] which deals with the [[interface (matter)|surface]] of solid matter.  It has applications to [[chemistry]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]] (particularly in relation to [[semiconductor manufacturing]]).

[[Solids]] are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface. The surface which bounds the bulk material is called the [[Surface phase]]. It acts as an interface to the surrounding environment. The bulk material in a solid is called the [[Bulk phase]]. 

The surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment. This interaction can degrade the surface phase over time. [[Environmental degradation]] of the surface phase over time can be caused by [[wear]], [[corrosion]], [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. 

Surface engineering involves altering the properties of the Surface Phase in order to reduce the degradation over time. This is accomplished by making the surface robust to the environment in which it will be used.it provides a cost effective material for robust design. A spectrum of topics that represent the diverse nature of the field of surface engineering includes Plating technologies, Nano and emerging technologies and Surface engineering, characterization and testing.

==Applications ==

Surface engineering techniques are being used in the automotive, aerospace, missile, power, electronic, biomedical, textile, petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, steel, cement, machine tools and construction industries including [[road surface|road surfacing]]. Surface engineering techniques can be used to develop a wide range of functional properties, including physical, chemical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant properties at the required substrate surfaces.  Almost all types of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites can be coated on similar or dissimilar materials.  It  is also possible to form coatings of newer materials (e.g., met glass. beta-C3N4), graded deposits, multi-component deposits etc. 

In 1995, surface engineering was a ₤10 billion market in the United Kingdom. Coatings, to make surface life robust from wear and corrosion, was approximately half the market. 

In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in surface engineering from age-old electroplating to processes such as vapor phase deposition, diffusion, thermal spray &amp; welding using {{clarify|text=advanced heat sources|date=January 2016}} like plasma, laser, ion, electron, microwave, solar beams, pulsed arc, pulsed combustion, spark, friction and induction.

It's estimated that loss due to wear and corrosion in the US is approximately $500 billion. In the US, there are around 9524 establishments (including automotive, aircraft, power and construction industries) who depend on engineered surfaces with support from 23,466 industries.

There are around 65 academic institutions world-wide engaged in surface engineering research and education.

==Surface Cleaning Techniques==

Surface cleaning, synonymously referred to as dry cleaning, is a mechanical
cleaning technique used to reduce superficial soil, dust, grime, insect droppings,
accretions, or other surface deposits. (Dry cleaning, as the term is used in paper
conservation, does not employ the use of organic solvents.) Surface cleaning
may be used as an independent cleaning technique, as one step (usually the
first) in a more comprehensive treatment, or as a prelude to further treatments
(e.g., aqueous immersion) which may cause dirt to set irreversibly in paper
fibers.

==Purpose==
The purpose of surface cleaning is to reduce the potential for damage to paper
artifacts by removing foreign material which can be abrasive, acidic,
hygroscopic, or degradative. The decision to remove surface dirt is also for
aesthetic reasons when it interferes with the visibility of the imagery or
information. A decision must be made balancing the probable care of each
object against the possible problems related to surface cleaning.

'''''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism''''' is a book on the [[sociology of religion]] written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[economist]] and [[sociologist]] of the early twentieth century. The original edition was in German under the title '''''Hinduismus und Buddhismus''''' and published in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagepub.com/mcdonaldizationstudy5/references.htm&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation was made in 1958 and several editions have been released since then.

It was his third major work on the sociology of religion, after ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]''. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian [[society]], with the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[doctrine]]s of [[Hinduism]] and the [[heterodoxy|heterodox]] doctrines of [[Buddhism]], with the changes wrought by popular [[religiosity]] and their influence on the [[secular]] [[ethic]] of Indian society.&lt;ref name=rb142&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hindu social system==

The Indian social system was influenced by the concept of [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]].&lt;ref name=rb142/&gt; Varna is not caste and caste is not Varna. This is a critical difference not understood by many. It directly linked religious belief and the segregation of society into [[status group]]s. Weber goes on to describe the Varna system (the [[Brahmin]]s - priests, the [[Kshatriya]]s - warriors, the [[Vaishya]]s - merchants, the [[Shudra]]s - laborers and the [[Dalit|Untouchable]]).

Weber pays special attention to Brahmins and considers why they occupied the highest place in Indian society for many centuries. With regards to the concept of [[dharma]] he concludes that the Indian ethical pluralism is very different both from the universal ethic of [[Confucianism]] and [[Christianity]]. He notes that the varna system prevented the development of urban status groups.&lt;ref name=rb147-148&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu orthodoxy and Brahmin restoration==

After the structure of the society, Weber analysed the Hindu religious beliefs - [[ascetism]] and the Hindu view of the world, the Brahman orthodox doctrines, the rise and fall of Buddhism in India, the Hindu restoration and the evolution of [[guru]].

==Secular ethic and impact of Hindu beliefs on economy==

Weber discussed what influence Hinduism and Buddhism had on the mundane activities, and how they impacted the economy. He noted the idea of unchanging world order consisting of the eternal [[rebirth (Buddhism)|cycle]]s of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], and the deprecation of mundane world.&lt;ref name=rb193&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[tradition]]alism of the Varna system supported by the dharma, the economic development is slowed as, - according to Weber - the "spirit" of the varna system worked against the development of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=rb196&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian belief systems==

Weber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|his previous work on China]] to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems. He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherworldy [[Mysticism|mystical]] experience. The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a [[prophet]] or wise man, and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. In Asia, there was no [[Messianic prophecy]] to ''plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike''. Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies, notably from the [[Near East]] region to those found on the [[Asia]]tic mainland, focusing more on exemplary ways to live one's life. It was those differences that prevented the countries of the [[Western world|Occident]] from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilizations. His next work, [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]] was an attempt to prove this theory.&lt;ref name=rb199-201&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.199-201&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra''''' is a 1945 musical composition by [[Benjamin Britten]] with a subtitle '''''Variations and [[Fugue]] on a Theme of [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'''''. It was based on the second movement, "Rondeau", of the ''[[Abdelazer]]'' suite. It was originally commissioned for the British educational documentary film called ''Instruments of the Orchestra'' released on 29 November 1946, directed by [[Muir Mathieson]] and featuring the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b69f17167 "Instruments of the Orchestra"], British Film Institute, accessed 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Sargent also conducted the concert première on 15 October 1946 with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]] in the [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool]], England.

The work is one of the best-known pieces by the composer, and is often associated with two other works in the context of children's [[music education]]: [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]' ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''.{{citation needed|date = November 2013}}

This work, in the composer's own words, "is affectionately inscribed to the children of [[John Redcliffe-Maud, Baron Redcliffe-Maud|John]] and [[Jean Redcliffe-Maud|Jean Maud]]: [[Humphrey Maud|Humphrey]], Pamela, Caroline and Virginia, for their edification and entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KX-zz5p-Fp0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Essential Britten: A Pocket Guide for the Britten Centenary"], John Bridcut, accessed 14 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra'' is scored for symphony orchestra:

*''[[Woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]'':  [[piccolo]], 2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B flat and A]] and 2 [[bassoon]]s
*''[[Brass instrument|Brass]]'': 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, 3 [[trombone]]s (2 [[tenor trombone|tenors]] and 1 [[bass trombone|bass]]) and [[Tuba|bass tuba]]
*''[[Percussion]]'': [[timpani]],  [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s,  [[tambourine]],  [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]],  [[snare drum]],  [[cowbell]],  [[xylophone]], [[castanet]]s,  [[Gong|tamtam]], and  [[Whip (percussion)|whip]]
*''[[String instrument|Strings]]'':  [[harp]], first and second [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s and [[double bass]]es

==Structure==
The work is based on the [[Rondo|Rondeau]] from [[Henry Purcell]]'s [[incidental music]] to [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Abdelazer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/programme-notes-archive/18-april-2013-programme-notes|accessdate=3 August 2013|publisher=London Chamber Orchestra|title=Programme Notes|date=18 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130804060800/http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/programme-notes-archive/18-april-2013-programme-notes|archivedate=4 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is structured, in accordance with the plan of the original documentary film, as a way of showing off the tone colours and capacities of the various sections of the orchestra.

In the introduction, the theme is initially played by the entire orchestra, then by each major family of instruments of the orchestra: first the woodwinds, then the [[brass instrument|brass]], then the [[string instrument|strings]], and finally by the percussion. Each [[variation (music)|variation]] then features a particular instrument in depth, generally moving through each family from high to low (the order of the families is slightly different from the introduction). So, for example, the first variation features the piccolo and flutes; each member of the woodwind family then gets a variation, ending with the bassoon; and so on, through the strings, brass, and finally the percussion.

After the whole orchestra has been effectively taken to pieces in this way, it is reassembled using an original [[fugue]] which starts with the piccolo, followed by all the woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion in turn. Once everyone has entered, the brass are re-introduced (with a strike on the tamtam) with Purcell's original melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/special-events/20-march-2013-qmul/20-march-2013-programme-notes|accessdate=3 August 2013|publisher=London Chamber Orchestra|title=Programme Notes|date=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130804060802/http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/special-events/20-march-2013-qmul/20-march-2013-programme-notes|archivedate=4 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sections of the piece and instruments introduced by the variations are as follows.

;Fugue: Allegro molto

==Narration==
The narration for the documentary film was written by [[Eric Crozier]], the producer of the first production of Britten's opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]'',  and is sometimes spoken by the conductor or a separate speaker during performance of the piece. The composer also arranged a version without narration. The one without narration is more often recorded. The commentary often alters between recordings.

A new narration was written by Simon Butteriss for the Aldeburgh Festival and broadcast live by CBBC presenter Johny Pitts with the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the Britten 100 celebrations in 2013.

Comedian and author [[John Hodgman]] wrote a new narration of ''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra'' in 2015 for a series of performances with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra|Boston Pops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgbh.org/articles/John-Hodgman-in-the-Young-Persons-Guide-10425|title=John Hodgman in the Young Person's Guide: Boston Pops: WCRB: WGBH|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKuU2_Q7zH4|title=Excerpts from John Hodgman's Debut Narration with Boston Pops|first=|last=Boston Pops|date=14 May 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/guestlisted/2015/05/excerpts_from_john_hodgmans_debut_narration_with_boston_pops|title=Excerpts from John Hodgman's debut narration with Boston Pops|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6074">The study of '''real estate''' at the undergraduate level is commonly contained as a degree of Bachelor of Science in Real Estate or a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in real estate.  A very limited number of universities offer a full "Bachelor of Science in Real Estate" and have "Real Estate" departments in their respective Colleges within the University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cob.fsu.edu/content/download/169088/1479911/file/REE-2014-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bus.wisc.edu/bba/academics-and-programs/majors/real-estate|title=Real Estate|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the maturity of [[Graduate real estate education|Master of Real Estate Development]] programs, universities are now looking at also offering specialized undergraduate education in real estate.

Many of the programs ranked by ''U.S. News and World Report'' are Bachelor of Business Administration or Bachelor of Science programs though some, such as [[University of Florida]], [[Cornell University]], and [[University of Illinois]], only offer minors in Real Estate or majors in Finance "with emphasis in Real Estate".&lt;ref name="ufl.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warrington.ufl.edu/departments/fire/|title=Department of Finance, Insurance &amp; Real Estate - Warrington|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realestate.cornell.edu/|title=Real Estate at Cornell University|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.illinois.edu/finance/courses9.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; While business schools continue to attract future real estate professionals, many critics of business education have many complaints. Some say the schools have become too scientific, too detached from real-world issues. Others say students are taught to come up with hasty solutions to complicated problems. Another group contends that schools give students a limited and distorted view of their role - that they graduate with a focus on maximizing shareholder value and only a limited understanding of ethical and social considerations essential to business leadership. Such shortcomings may have left business school graduates inadequately prepared to make the decisions that, taken together, might have helped mitigate the financial and real estate crisis, critics say.&lt;ref&gt;http://network.nationalpost.com/NP/blogs/fpposted/archive/2010/03/17/why-a-liberal-arts-education-can-best-prepare-business-leaders.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative course of study to an undergraduate degree in business or real estate is the liberal arts, such as [[economics]], [[public administration]], [[urban planning]], or [[geography]].  An aspiring real estate professional may supplement his education with a [[Master of Real Estate Development]] degree, a common prerequisite for many institutional and corporate real estate firms.

==Business school rankings==

The [[U.S. News and World Report]] ranks the top 13 undergraduate programs which offer a study in real estate.&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-real-estate&lt;/ref&gt; However, many schools on the U.S. News and World Reports list (University of Florida&lt;ref name="ufl.edu"/&gt; and Cornell University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sha.cornell.edu/admissions-programs/undergraduate/academics/degree-requirements/concentrations-minors/real-estate-minor.html|title=Undergraduate Minor in Real Estate - Cornell SHA|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.cornell.edu/|title=Real Estate at Cornell University|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example)  do not actually offer undergraduate degrees (majors) in Real Estate, and alternatively run a "focus" or "minor" in Real Estate under their Finance departments.  Additionally there are many non-business schools that offer other real estate related degrees. The International Council of Shopping Centers provides an alternative list of active "Real Estate" institutions: http://www.icsc.org/student/resources_undergrad.php

The '''values''' embodied in [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; are identified in order to assess significance, prioritize resources, and inform [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] decision-making. It is recognised that values may compete and change over time, and that heritage may have different meanings for different [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].

==Origins==
[[Alois Riegl]] is credited with developing [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s concept of 'voicefulness' into a systematic categorization of the different values of a [[monument]]. In his 1908 essay ''Der moderne Denkmalkultus'' (The modern cult of monuments) he describes historical value, artistic value, age value, commemorative value, use value, and newness value. Riegl demonstrates that some of these values conflict and argues that they may be culturally [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage |author=Stanley Price, Nicholas ''et al.'' (edd.) |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |pages=18–21, 69–83 |ISBN=0-89236-398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charters and Conventions==
The [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] addresses cultural sites of outstanding universal value, from a [[History|historical]], [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[Science|scientific]], [[Ethnology|ethnological]] or [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective, and highlights the need for [[Authenticity (heritage)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide08-en.pdf |title=Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention |pages=13, 94) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussed in the 1964 [[Venice Charter]], values and the question 'why conserve?' are the focus of the 1979 [[Burra Charter]] (last revised 1999). Cultural significance is said to be 'embodied' in the fabric, setting, use, associations, and meanings of a place, and includes aesthetic, historic, scientific, social and spiritual values for past, present and future generations. In order to preserve such values a 'cautious approach' of [[minimum intervention]] is advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australia.icomos.org/wp-content/uploads/BURRA_CHARTER.pdf |title=Burra Charter (''vid.'' Preamble, Articles 1, 3, Guidelines) |publisher=[[Australia ICOMOS]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China |page=55) |publisher=China [[ICOMOS]]/[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Managing Built Heritage: The Role of Cultural Significance |author1=Worthing, Derek |author2=Bond, Stephen |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |pages=94ff |year=2008 |ISBN=978-1-4051-1978-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
[[Significance assessment]] typically includes consideration of the rarity, representativeness, and communicative power of assets and their values. These are then managed in order to sustain and valorize that significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/folklore/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |title=The Subtle Power of Intangible Heritage: Legal and Financial Instruments for Safeguarding Intangible Heritage |pages=36f |author=Deacon, Harriet (et al.) |publisher=[[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|HSRC Press]] |year=2004 |ISBN=978-0-7969-2074-4 |access-date=16 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012222850/http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/folklore/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/publications/docs/conservationprinciplespoliciesandguidanceapril08web.pdf |title=Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance for the Sustainable Management of the Historic Environment |pages=21ff |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engagement with the economic value of heritage may help promote its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/econrpt.pdf |title=Economics and Heritage Conservation |page=54 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9386">{{for|the academic journal Visual Sociology|Visual Studies (journal)}}
'''Visual sociology''' is an area of [[sociology]] concerned with the visual dimensions of social life. This subdiscipline is nurtured by the [[International Visual Sociology Association]] (IVSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualsociology.org|title=IVSA|website=International Visual Sociology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds annual conferences and publishes the journal, ''Visual Studies.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/1472586X.asp|title=Visual Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the interests of its founders, the IVSA tends to be concerned with photography and documentary filmmaking within a sociological context. However, visual sociology – theoretically at least – includes the study of all kinds of visual material and the visual social world, and uses all kinds of visual material in its methodologies.

Similarly, the newly formed British Sociological Association Visual Sociology Study Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualsociology.org|title=IVSA|website=International Visual Sociology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers UK-based researchers and academics working in a broad range of sub-disciplines within sociological fields a network in which to explore existing and emerging visual research methods and methodologies.

==Theory and method==
There are at least three approaches to doing visual sociology:

===Data collection using cameras and other recording technology===
In this context, the camera is analogous to a [[tape recorder]].  [[Film camera|Film]] and [[video camera]]s are particularly well suited as data gathering technologies for [[experiment]]s and small group interactions, classroom studies, [[ethnography]], [[participant observation]], [[oral history]], the use of [[urban design|urban space]], etc.  The tape recorder captures things that are not preserved in even the best researchers' field notes.  Similarly, tape recordings preserve audible data not available in even the most carefully annotated transcripts: [[timbre]], the music of a voice, inflection, intonation, grunts and groans, pace, and space convey meanings easily (mis)understood but not easily gleaned from written words alone.  By opening another channel of information, visual recordings preserve still more information.  For instance, the raised eyebrow, the wave of a hand, the blink of an eye might convert the apparent meaning of words into their opposite, convey [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], or [[contradiction]].  So, regardless of how one analyzes the data or what is done with the visual record, sociologists can use cameras to record and preserve data of interest so it can be studied in detail.

Visual recording technology also allows us to manipulate the data.  Visual recordings have long been employed by natural [[scientists]] because they make it possible to speed up, slow down, repeat, stop, and zoom in on things of interest.  It is the same in the social sciences, recordings facilitate the study of phenomena that are too fast, or too slow, or too infrequent or too big or too small to study directly "in the life."  Most importantly, through editing visual sociologists can juxtapose events to produce meanings.  Sociologists may also be able to put cameras in places where one would not put a researcher: where it is dangerous, or where a person would be unwelcome, or simply to remove the observer effect from particular situations, e.g., studying social behavior among school children on a playground.

[[Photo elicitation]] is another technique of data gathering.  This methodological tool is a combination of photography as the visual equivalent of a tape recorder, and ethnography or other qualitative methods.  Photo elicitation techniques involve using photographs or film as part of the interview—in essence asking research subjects to discuss the meaning of photographs, films or videos.  In this case the images can be taken specially by the researcher with the idea of using them to elicit information, they can belong to the subject, for example family photographs or movies, or they can be gathered from other sources including archives, newspaper and television morgues, or corporate collections.  Typically the interviewee's comments or analysis of the visual material is itself recorded, either on audio tape or video, etc.

[[Photo voice]] is a related research method in which researchers give those being studied still or movie cameras. Research participants are taught to use the image making technology but are then responsible for making photos or movies which are subsequently analyzed either by the researchers or the participants, or both.

In any case, in this first sense visual sociology means including and incorporating visual methods of data gathering and analysis in the work of sociology. This method has recently been transferred to other academic disciplines, notably having been pioneered in contemporary religious research.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Sarah Dunlop ''Values and Significance: A case study exploring the search for meaning among young people in Eastern and Central Europe'', a paper given at the [http://www.socrel.org.uk BSA Sociology of Religion Study Group] [http://www.socrel.org.uk/conferences/Birmingham%202008/Final%20Programme%202008.pdf Annual Conference 2008 'Religion and Youth'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820012555/http://www.socrel.org.uk/conferences/Birmingham%202008/Final%20Programme%202008.pdf |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Sarah Dunlop "[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1847996698 Visualising Hope]." published 2008 by [http://www.ytcpress.com YTC Press].&lt;/ref&gt; Visual sociology has also been employed as a useful tool to 'make the familiar strange' and can be a particularly effective research approach for working with children and marginalised groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qrj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/1/91|title= Mannay, D 2010. Making the familiar strange:Can visual research methods render the familiar setting more perceptible?Qualitative Research, 10 (1), 91-111|work=Sage publications|date=8 August 2010|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2013. ‘Who put that on there... why why why?:’ Power games and participatory techniques of visual data production. Visual Studies, 28 (2), pp.136-146
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1472586X.2013.801635&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studying visual data produced by cultures===
Visual sociology attempts to study visual images produced as part of culture.  [[Art]], [[photographs]], [[film]], [[video]], [[fonts]], [[advertisements]], [[Icon (computing)|computer icons]], [[landscape]], [[architecture]], [[machines]], [[fashion]], [[makeup]], [[hair style]], [[facial expressions]], [[tattoos]], and so on are parts of the complex [[visual communication]] system produced by members of societies.  The use and understanding of visual images is governed by socially established symbolic codes.  Visual images are constructed and may be deconstructed.  They may be read as texts in a variety of ways.  They can be analyzed with techniques developed in diverse fields of [[literary criticism]], [[art theory]] and criticism, [[content analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[deconstruction]]ism, or the more mundane tools of [[ethnography]].  Visual sociologists can categorize and count them; ask people about them; or study their use and the social settings in which they are produced and consumed.  So the second meaning of visual sociology is a discipline to study the visual products of society—their production, consumption and meaning.

===Communication with images and media other than words===
A third dimension of visual sociology is both the use of visual media to communicate sociological understandings to professional and public audiences, and also the use of visual media within sociological research itself.

In this context, visual sociology draws on the work of [[Edward Tufte]], whose books ''Envisioning Information'' and ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'' address the communication of quantitative information.  Visual sociology considers the logics of presentation of sociological and anthropological documentarians and ethnographers like [[Robert Flaherty]], [[Konrad Lorenz]], [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Frederick Wiseman]].  Visual sociology also requires the development of new forms—for example, data driven computer graphics to represent complex relationships e.g., changing social networks over time, the [[primitive accumulation of capital]], the flow of labor, relations between theory and practice.
