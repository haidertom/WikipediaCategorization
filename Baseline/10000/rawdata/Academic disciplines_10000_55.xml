      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3569">'''Alkaline lysis''' or '''alkaline extraction''' is a method used in [[molecular biology]] to [[Plasmid preparation|isolate plasmid DNA]] from bacteria.

==Method==
Bacteria containing the [[plasmid]] of interest are first [[Cell culture|cultured]], then a sample is [[Centrifugation|centrifuged]] in order to concentrate cellular material (including [[DNA]]) into a pellet at the bottom of the containing vessel. The supernatant is discarded, and the pellet is then re-suspended in an [[EDTA]]-containing physiological [[Buffer solution|buffer]]. The purpose of the EDTA is to chelate divalent metal cations such as [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]], which are required for the function of DNA degrading enzymes ([[Deoxyribonuclease|DNAses]]) and also serve to de-stabilise the DNA phosphate backbone and cell wall. Glucose in the buffer will maintain the osmotic pressure of the cell in order to prevent the cell from bursting. Tris in the buffer will retain the pH of the cell with 8.0 and RNase will remove the RNA which will disrupt the experiment.

Separately, a strong [[alkaline]] solution consisting of the detergent [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) and a strong base such as [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) is prepared and then added. The resulting mixture is incubated for a few minutes. During this time, the detergent disrupts cell membranes and allows the alkali to contact and denature both [[Circular bacterial chromosome|chromosomal]] and plasmid DNA.
One thing which should be noted is that, after tearing apart the cell membrane by SDS, the cell content will neutralize the NaOH; this is why the pH of the lysis goes down from 12.8 to 12.3. So if there are not enough bacterial cells, the extra NaOH will function to generate small DNA fragment. But 0.5 M L-arginine, which can supply a stable pH, can be used to replace 0.1 M sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{Cloninger, 2008 #100}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, [[potassium acetate]] is added. This acidifies the solution and allows the renaturing of plasmid DNA, but not chromosomal DNA, which is precipitated out of solution. Another function of the potassium is to cause the precipitation of [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] and thus removal of the detergent. A final centrifugation is carried out, and this time the pellet contains only debris and can be discarded. The plasmid-containing supernatant is carefully removed and can be further purified or used for analysis, such as [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|gel electrophoresis]].

==Other Uses==
Also, alkaline lysis is sometimes used to extract plant genetic material.  The plant cells are subjected to a strongly alkaline solution containing a detergent (usually a [[zwitterion]]ic or [[nonionic]] [[detergent]] such as [[polysorbate 20|Tween 20]]), and the mixture is incubated at high temperature.  This method is not used as often due to the sodium hydroxide's tendency to damage genetic material, reducing DNA fragment size.

The '''argument from poor design''', also known as the '''[[Dysteleology|dysteleological]] argument''', is an argument against the [[Existence of God|existence of]] a [[Creator deity|creator]] [[God]], based on the reasoning that an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and  [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God would not create [[organism]]s with the perceived suboptimal designs that can be seen in nature.

The argument is structured as a basic [[modus tollens]]: if "creation" contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence.  It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however:  not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which argues that living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance, so must have been deliberately created by an intelligent God.

Although the phrase "argument from poor design" has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as "poor design", "suboptimal design", "unintelligent design" or "[[Dysteleology|dysteology/dysteological]]". The last of these is a term applied by the nineteenth-century biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism.&lt;ref name="haeckel"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haeckel, in his book ''The History of Creation'', devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of "a theory of the ''unsuitability of parts'' in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the ''suitability of parts''".&lt;ref name="haeckel"/&gt;  The term "incompetent design", a play on "[[intelligent design]]", has been coined by [[Donald Wise]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] to describe aspects of nature that are currently flawed in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wise |first=Donald |date=2005-07-22 |title="Intelligent" Design versus Evolution |journal=Science |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |volume=309 |issue=5734 |pages=556–557 |doi=10.1126/science.309.5734.556c |pmid=16040688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional theological responses generally posit that God's creation was perfect but that humanity's misuse of its [[free will]] to rebel against God&lt;!--[?:], and the consequent damage from hostile spiritual forces,--&gt; has resulted in the corruption of good design.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hahne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K-Ls4CUEWFAC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;f=false ''The Corruption and Redemption of Creation: Nature in Romans 8, Volume 34'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj791_BeAF0C&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;pg=PA206#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;f=false ''God at War: The Bible &amp; Spiritual Conflict'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ed. Charles Taliaferro, Chad Meister, ''The Cambridge Companion to Christian Philosophical Theology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=KJQyhzY4PucC&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;f=false page 160]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|right|Natural selection is expected to push fitness to a peak, but that peak often is not the highest.]]

The argument runs that:

# An [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] creator God [[Creation myth|would create]] [[organism]]s that have optimal [[design]].
# Organisms have features that are suboptimal.
# Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

It is sometimes used as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which runs as follows:

# Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.
# Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.
# This creator is God.

"Poor design" is consistent with the predictions of the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]]. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses, are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the [[heredity|hereditary]] mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.

In [[fitness landscape]] terms, natural selection will always push "up the hill", but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.

The argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', 6th ed., Ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; modern proponents have included [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Dawkins]]. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. [[Theistic evolutionists]] generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===In humans===

====Fatal flaws====
{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Ectopic.png|250px|thumb|right|[[Regnier de Graaf|Artist's]] representation of an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Critics cite such common biological occurrences as contradictory to the '[[watchmaker analogy]]'.]]
Several defects in human anatomy can result in death, especially without modern medical care:
* In the human female, a [[zygote|fertilized egg]] can implant into the [[fallopian tube]], [[cervix]] or [[ovary]] rather than the [[uterus]] causing an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother.
* In the human female, the [[vagina|birth canal]] passes through the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the [[baby]]'s head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery ([[caesarean section]]), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby, or both. Other birthing complications such as [[breech birth]] are worsened by this position of the birth canal.
* In the human male, [[testes]] develop initially within the [[abdomen]]. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the [[scrotum]]. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where [[hernia]]s can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias, such as intestinal blockage and [[gangrene]], usually resulted in death.&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Colby |author2=Loren Petrich |year=1993 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |title=Evidence for Jury-Rigged Design in Nature |publisher=[[Talk.Origins]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/615A4Dvf5?url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence of the [[pharynx]], a passage used for both [[ingestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], with the consequent drastic increase in the risk of [[choking]]. 
* The breathing reflex is stimulated not directly by the absence of [[oxygen]] but indirectly by the presence of carbon dioxide.  A result is that, at high altitudes, oxygen deprivation can occur in unadapted individuals who do not consciously increase their breathing rate.
* The human [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] is a [[vestigial organ]] with no known purpose (suggested purposes are either unproven or incidental/non-essential){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} and no deleterious effects come from its removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} However [[appendicitis]], an infection of this organ, is a certain death without medical intervention.

====Other flaws====
* Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the [[plantaris muscle]] of the foot,&lt;ref name="selim"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selim |first=Jocelyn |date=June 2004 |title=Useless Body Parts |journal=Discover |volume=25 |issue=6 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817155923/http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |archivedate=2011-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations. Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to [[scoliosis]], [[sciatica]] and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae. The [[spinal cord]] cannot ever properly heal if it is damaged, because neurons have become so specialized that they are no longer able to regrow once they reach their mature state. The spinal cord, if broken, will never repair itself and will result in permanent [[paralysis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nervous System Guide by the National Science Teachers Association."

* Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own [[vitamin C]], but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective ([[L-gulonolactone oxidase|Pseudogene ΨGULO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishikimi M, Yagi K |title=Molecular basis for the deficiency in humans of gulonolactone oxidase, a key enzyme for ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=54 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=1203S–1208S |date=December 1991 |pmid=1962571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of vitamin C results in [[scurvy]] and eventually death. The gene is also non-functional in other [[primate]]s and in [[guinea pig]]s, but is functional in most other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohta Y, Nishikimi M |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochim.

* The prevalence of [[congenital disease]]s and genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]].
* Crowded [[teeth]] and poor [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] drainage, as human faces are significantly flatter than those of other [[primates]] and humans share the same tooth set. This results in a number of problems, most notably with [[wisdom teeth]], which can damage neighboring teeth or cause serious infections of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;"Wisdom Teeth."

* The structure of [[human eye|humans' eye]]s (as well as those of all vertebrates). The [[retina]] is 'inside out'. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the ''surface'' of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many [[invertebrate]] species.

===Other life===

* In the [[Africa]]n [[locust]], [[nerve]] cells start in the abdomen but connect to the wing. This leads to unnecessary use of materials.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* Intricate reproductive devices in [[orchid]]s, apparently constructed from components commonly having different functions in other flowers.
* The use by [[panda]]s of their enlarged [[sesamoid bone#Other animals|radial sesamoid bones]] in a manner similar to how other creatures use [[thumb]]s.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* The existence of unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The route of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is such that it travels from the brain to the larynx by looping around the [[aortic arch]]. This same configuration holds true for many animals; in the case of the [[giraffe]], this results in about twenty feet of extra nerve.
* The [[Tetrachromacy|loss of tetrachromatic vision]] by mammals as compared to other tetrapods.
* The enzyme [[RuBisCO]] has been described as a "notoriously inefficient" enzyme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spreitzer RJ, Salvucci ME |title=Rubisco: structure, regulatory interactions, and possibilities for a better enzyme |journal=Annu Rev Plant Biol |volume=53 |issue= |pages=449–75 |year=2002 |pmid=12221984 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.53.100301.135233}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibited]] by oxygen, has a very slow turnover and is not saturated at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The enzyme is inhibited as it is unable to distinguish between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen, with oxygen acting as a [[competitive inhibition|competitive enzyme inhibitor]]. However, RuBisCO remains the key enzyme in [[carbon fixation]], and plants overcome its poor activity by having massive amounts of it inside their cells, making it the most abundant protein on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Biochemistry: Tackling unintelligent design |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=7278 |pages=164–5 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20075906 |doi=10.1038/463164a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The enzyme [[nitrogenase]] actually preferentially binds with [[acetylene]] over di-nitrogen, despite its being the key enzyme used in nitrogen fixation in many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].
* Sturdy but heavy bones, suited for non-flight, occurring in animals like bats. Or, on the converse: unstable, light, hollow bones, suited for flight, occurring in birds like penguins and ostriches, which cannot fly.
* Various [[vestigial]] body parts, like the femur and pelvis in whales (evolution says the ancestor of whales lived on land).
* [[Turritopsis dohrnii]] and [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]] genus have [[biological immortality]], but most animals do not.
* Many species have strong instincts to behave in response to a certain stimulus. Natural selection can leave animals behaving in detrimental ways when they encounter a [[supernormal stimulus]] - like a [[moth]] flying into a flame.
* Plants are green and not black, as [[chlorophyll]] absorbs green light poorly, even though black plants would absorb more light energy.
* [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s breathe air, but live in the water, meaning they must swim to the surface frequently to breathe.
* [[Albatross]]es cannot take off or land properly.

== Criticism ==

===Unproven assumptions===
Several generic philosophical criticisms can be directed towards the first premise of the argument – that a [[Creator deity]] would have designed things 'optimally'.  The argument hinges on an assumption that the human concept of 'optimal design' is the same as that of a theistic god. This is, in effect, the argument for the incomprehensibility of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] in the [[Book of Job]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible.  Job 38:1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Book of Job]] goes on to list a number of aspects of the world that seem wonderful or miraculous beyond human understanding. The claim is that, if humans have no understanding of how the wonders of the world were created, they cannot fully understand the things that appear flawed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Optimal design engineering and trade-offs===
Others argue that the observed suboptimality in one system or another is intentional, as a [[trade-off]] to improve overall optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fazale|first=Rana|title=Responding to a Skeptic|url=http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|accessdate=2018-07-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927013720/http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific examples===
[[Intelligent design]] proponent [[William Dembski]] questions the first premise of the argument, maintaining a distinction between "intelligent design" and optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dembski |first=William |authorlink=William Dembski |title=Intelligent design: the bridge between science &amp; theology |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8308-2314-X |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article written by [[John Woodmorappe]] on the [[Creation Ministries International]] website says that the [[Sesamoid bone|panda's "thumb"]] works well for what the panda uses it for – to strip leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|title=Panda thumbs its nose at the dysteleological arguments of the atheist Stephen Jay Gould - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130704051258/http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|archivedate=2013-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[veriform appendix|appendix]] has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms.  In young adults, the appendix has some immune functions.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite web |first=Loren G. |last=Martin |date=October 21, 1999 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-function-of-t |title=What is the function of the human appendix? |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009062840/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-function-of-t |archivedate=October 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] and ophthalmologist Peter Gurney have both published articles on the Creation Ministries International website which disagree that the human eye is poorly designed, arguing that alternative arrangements would have further complications and that the human eye actually works very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|title=Is our 'inverted' retina really 'bad design'? - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130627193627/http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|title=Mueller cells backwardly wired retina v Dawkins - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130626233057/http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|archivedate=2013-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to criticism==

In addition, the [[plantaris]] muscle does atrophy. Its motor function is so minimal that its long tendon can readily be harvested for reconstruction elsewhere with little functional deficit. "Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students, the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet. It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population."&lt;ref name=selim/&gt;

In response to the claim that uses have been found for "junk" DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include [[pseudogenes]] that are nonfunctional "junk", with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Isaak |year=2004 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |title=Claim CB130 |publisher=Talk.Origins |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911070043/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |archivedate=2006-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original study that suggested that the ''Makorin1-p1'' served some purpose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotsune | first1 = S | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = N | last3 = Chen | first3 = A | last4 = Garrett | first4 = L | last5 = Sugiyama | first5 = F | last6 = Takahashi | first6 = S | last7 = Yagami | first7 = K | last8 = Wynshaw-Boris | first8 = A | last9 = Yoshiki | first9 = A. | year = 2003 | title = An expressed pseudogene regulates the messenger-RNA stability of its homologous coding gene | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6935 | pages = 91–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature01535 | pmid = 12721631 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080425042454/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | archivedate = 2008-04-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = TA | last2 = Wilson | first2 = A | last3 = Fortin | first3 = PJ | last4 = Nicholls | first4 = RD | year = 2006 | title = The putatively functional Mkrn1-p1 pseudogene is neither expressed nor imprinted, nor does it regulate its source gene in trans | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 103 | issue =  | pages = 12039–12044 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0602216103 | pmid = 16882727 | pmc = 1567693 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001043736/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | archivedate = 2007-10-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;lr&amp;cites=16337157008352528383|title=Google Scholar|author=|date=|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an argument regarding God==
The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an [[argument against the existence of God]], or against characteristics commonly attributed to a [[creator deity]], such as [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of "poor design" (as well as the perceived prodigious "wastefulness" of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a "poor" designer, or a "blind" designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, "If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda%27s-thumb.html |title=The Panda's Peculiar Thumb |work=NATURAL HISTORY |date=November 1978 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928063454/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda's-thumb.html |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by [[theistic evolutionists]] to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses [[natural selection]] as a mechanism of his creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Collins|Collins, Francis S.]] ''The Language of God'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster), 2006. p 191. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-4274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a [[false dilemma]], imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well, or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of [[intelligent design]] to [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry pick]] which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the [[unfalsifiability]] of the theory. Christian proponents of intelligent design as evidence of the existence of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] can claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|free will]] that caused the [[Fall (religion)|Fall]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:16 has [[Yahweh]] saying to [[Eve]] "I will increase your trouble in pregnancy").

The '''Norman and Helen Asher Space Research Institute''' ('''ASRI''') is a specialized institute dedicated to multidisciplinary [[scientific research]] at [[Technion - Israel Institute of Technology]], in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].

ASRI was established in 1984. Its members come from five Technion faculties, and it has a technical staff of Technion scientists in a variety of space-related fields ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110519171541/http://physics.technion.ac.il/eng/ Physics], [[Technion Faculty of Aerospace Engineering|Aerospace Engineering]], [http://meeng.technion.ac.il/en/ Mechanical Engineering], [[Technion Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Electrical Engineering]], [http://tasp.technion.ac.il/ Autonomous Systems] and [http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/ Computer Sciences]). ASRI is a leading space research center in [[Israel]] and is involved in the development of space systems based on advanced and innovative technologies, as well as education&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jyi.org/SCC/Article.php?articleNum=84&lt;/ref&gt; through advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://community.iknowfutures.eu/pg/file/popper/view/8789/ozone-space-vision&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Technion History}}

Technion is Israel's oldest university, founded in 1912 to bring young people the technical skills they would need to build a nation. In the spirit of anticipating future needs, Technion established the faculty of Aeronautical Engineering in 1948. At the time, it was the only place in Israel teaching and researching aeronautics, and it has been credited in bringing the expertise to create the airforce which guaranteed the survival on the young [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/home/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925051740/http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/home/history.php |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty evolved into today's Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the Technion. Driven by a need for Israel to move into satellite technology in the 1980s, the Asher Space Research Institute was set up in 1984, four years before Israel formally rocketed into space with the launch of the [[Ofeq|Ofeq-1]] satellite in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Alpert]], ''TECHNION The Story of Israel's Institute of Technology''. {{ISBN|0-87203-102-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ASRI is the only center of higher education for space research in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/home/asher_heb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811044633/http://ae-www.technion.ac.il/home/asher_heb.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ASRI Building Back 1.JPG|thumb|The ASRI Building at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology']]
On February 12, 2009, the Norman and Helen Asher Space Building was dedicated at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. Chicago resident Helen S. Asher and her late husband Norman provided the $3.5 million lead gift for the building. The occasion also celebrated the 30-year anniversary of [[Israel Space Agency|Israel's space program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.org/site/News2?page%3DNewsArticle%26id%3D5933%26security%3D1141%26news_iv_ctrl%3D1461 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722021453/http://www.ats.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5933&amp;security=1141&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1461 |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Institute is today managed by ASRI Director Prof. Ehud Behar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.technion.ac.il/en/technion/sci-tech/100211-behar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected laboratories==
In parallel to system development activities, members of the Institute technical staff perform, in collaboration with faculty members, research in various space related fields.

===The Distributed Space Systems Laboratory (DSSL)===
The Distributed Space Systems Laboratory (DSSL) is focused on dynamics and control of multiple spacecraft formation flying. The experimental facility is designed and equipped to test methods and machinery under circumstances as close to actual operating conditions as possible, including cooperative control, relative position and attitude sensing and space-borne sparse-aperture imaging. The lab includes an air bearing table, model satellites, and sensing devices.
ASRI DSSL is currently working towards the launch of a formation flying mission into an Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/dssl/|title=DSSL |publisher=[[ASRI]], [[Technion]]|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASRI's research into electric propulsion of small satellites has culminated in the creation of the patented CAMILA, cited as the most efficient and effective rocket propulsion engine for space-craft and satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/Feb10/spaceStory1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006230929/http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/Feb10/spaceStory1.htm |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Working in collaboration with Israel's [[Soreq Nuclear Research Center|Soreq National Research Laboratory]] and [[RAFAEL]], ASRI's Electric Propulsion laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/electric-propulsion|title=Electric Propulsion |publisher=[[ASRI]], [[Technion]]|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be pioneering the next generation of small thrusters. The lab is headed by Prof. Alexander Kapulkin, a rocket scientist from the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.technion.ac.il/_local/includes/blocks/news-items/091129-camila/news-item-en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory for Space Interferometry (LaSI)===
The Laboratory for Space Interferometry (LaSI) at the Asher Space Research Institute seeks solutions for improving the angular resolution of telescopes for both astronomical and Earth observations from space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/space-interferometry/ |title=Space Interferometry|publisher=[[ASRI]], [[Technion]]|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
ASRI's educational activities include topical lectures for engineering students, supervision of undergraduate students space projects, and of graduate research theses'. 
One example of ASRI's educational initiatives was the DUSAT project. This consists of two identical Low Earth Orbit (LEO) [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellites]] designed for simultaneous three-dimensional mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/DUSAT |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064446/http://asri.technion.ac.il/DUSAT |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A current example is SABRES:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asri.technion.ac.il/SABRES |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064507/http://asri.technion.ac.il/SABRES |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a constellation of microsatellites for automated meter reading and other non-real time communication services.
In addition to undergraduate and graduate degrees, ASRI has opportunities for postdoctoral research positions and frequently hosts international scientists.

==Gurwin TechSat==
Gurwin TechSat was one of the world's first microsatellites to be designed, built and launched by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/May10/newsStory11.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929095838/http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/May10/newsStory11.htm |archivedate=2013-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Operations of TechSat II, also known as TechSat-1b and Gurwin-TechSAT-2, ceased in April 2010 when deterioration of its solar cells reduced power output so that the nominal performance of the satellite systems could no longer be supported.
In the early 1990s, the Technion proposed building three or four small satellites for continuous early warning coverage.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Space-Systems-and-Industry/TechSat-Gurwin-Series-Israel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The TechSat Gurwin I was named in honour of Joseph and Rosalind Gurwin, whose interest and support of Israeli space research enabled its development.
The flight model was completed in October 1994, but the first TechSat, also known as TechSat-1a, was lost when its Soviet converted ICBM Start launch vehicle failed. 
On 10 July 1998, the next microsatellite in the series, TechSat/Gurwin II, was successfully launched by Zenit 2 from Baikonur Cosmodrome.
 
The Asher Space Research Institute (ASRI) at Technion managed and conducted TechSat II operations from the university-based station. The solar cells used thin-film photovoltaic cell technology developed in Russia; they were mounted on four of the six outer aluminium panels. The box-shaped TechSat II carried six instruments to perform a range of experiments. 
Operations of TechSat II ceased in April 2010 when deterioration of its solar cells reduced power output so that the nominal performance of the satellite systems could no longer be supported.
The mission has been said to demonstrate that a reduction of the satellite mass, size, and power consumption can be achieved without deterioration of its basic characteristics, such as mission life, payload efficiency and measurements precision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_techsat_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and outreach==

===Ilan Ramon Space Team Program===
[[File:Ilan Ramon.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonel Ilan Ramon,Israeli astronaut killed during the failed re-entry of the Space Shuttle Columbia.]]
In 2002, ASRI set up the Ilan Ramon Space Club, in collaboration with the Jerusalem-based [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322191940/http://www.excellence.org.il/eng/Index.asp?CategoryID=98&amp;ArticleID=56%20 Society for Excellence in Education.]
After the tragic loss of the Columbia Shuttle and its crew, the space club was renamed in honor of [[Ilan Ramon]] - Israel's first astronaut. Ramon had conducted experiments in space designed by high school students and commissioned by ASRI and [[Israel Ministry of Education|Israel's Ministry of Education]].
The club today consists of 12 nationwide groups of 20 high school students each. ASRI researchers prepare the syllabus for the clubs which are run with the help of Technion undergraduates.

===Science and communication===
Part of ASRI's global outreach drive involves a social media initiative to educated and inform the general public about space research in general and projects at Technion's ASRI in particular.

An '''aurora''' (plural: '''auroras''' or '''aurorae'''),{{efn|The name "auroras"  is now the more common plural of "aurora", however ''aurorae'' is the original Latin plural and is often used by scientists; in some contexts, aurora is an uncountable noun, multiple sightings being referred to as "the aurora".

Modern style guides recommend that the names of [[meteorological phenomena]], such as aurora borealis, be uncapitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |title=University of Minnesota Style Manual |publisher=.umn.edu |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722101345/http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |archivedate=22 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} sometimes referred to as '''polar lights''', '''northern lights''' (aurora borealis) or '''southern lights''' (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the [[polar regions of Earth|high-latitude regions]] (around the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]]).

Auroras are produced when the [[magnetosphere]] is sufficiently disturbed by the [[solar wind]] that the trajectories of [[charged particle]]s in both solar wind and [[Van Allen belt|magnetospheric plasma]], mainly in the form of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere ([[thermosphere]]/[[exosphere]]) due to [[Earth's magnetic field]], where their energy is lost.

The resulting [[ionization]] and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident [[hydrogen]] atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/518 |title=Simultaneous ground and satellite observations of an isolated proton arc at sub-auroral latitudes |publisher=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=2007 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "aurora" comes from the Latin word for "dawn, morning light", since auroras were formerly thought to be the first light of dawn.

==Occurrence of terrestrial auroras==
Most auroras occur in a band known as the "auroral zone",&lt;ref name="feldstein86"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feldstein |first=Y. I. |year=2011 |title=A Quarter Century with the Auroral Oval |journal=EOS |volume=67 |issue=40 |page=761 |doi=10.1029/EO067i040p00761-02 |bibcode=1986EOSTr..67..761F }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the [[geomagnetic pole]]s at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval", a band displaced towards the night side of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gLwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Occurrence+of+terrestrial+auroras#v=onepage&amp;q=Occurrence%20of%20terrestrial%20auroras|title=Illustrated Glossary for Solar and Solar-Terrestrial Physics|last=Bruzek|first=A.|last2=Durrant|first2=C. J.|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401012454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. [[Elias Loomis]] (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881)&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, Hermann (1881). "Das Polarlicht."&lt;/ref&gt; and S. Tromholt (1882)&lt;ref&gt;Tromholt, S. (1882) Om nordlysets perioder/Sur les périodes de l'aurore boréale, l'annuaire 1880, Inst. Météorol. Danois, Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=SpaceWeather |url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=Current Auroral Oval |accessdate=19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern [[latitude]]s, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The former term was coined by [[Galileo]] in 1619, from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Aurora (mythology)|goddess of the dawn]] and the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the north wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1029/HG002p0011 |chapter=An historical footnote on the origin of 'aurora borealis' |title=History of Geophysics: Volume 2 |journal=History of Geophysics: Volume 2.

L. |isbn=978-0-87590-276-0|bibcode = 1986HGeo....2...11S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features  almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jastp.2006.05.026 |title=Auroral conjugacy studies based on global imaging |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=249 |year=2007 |last1=Østgaard |first1=N. |last2=Mende |first2=S.

M. |bibcode=2007JASTP..69..249O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in [[Antarctica]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]].

A [[geomagnetic storm]] causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, and bring the aurora to lower latitudes. The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval")&lt;ref name="feldstein86" /&gt; is slightly different, being centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]] in question is in between the observer and the [[Sun]]. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called [[magnetic midnight]].

Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frey |first=H. U. |year=2007 |title=Localized aurora beyond the auroral oval |doi=10.1029/2005RG000174 |journal=Rev.

Auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year [[sunspot|sunspot cycle]] or during the three years after the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stamper |first1=J. |first2=M. |last2=Lockwood |first3=M.

An aurora may appear overhead as a "corona" of rays, radiating from a distant and apparent central location, which results from [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]].
An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the "pitch angle" of the particle. The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.
Other types of auroras have been observed from space, e.g."poleward arcs" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related "theta aurora",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1029/2003GL017914 |title=Observations of non-conjugate theta aurora |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=30 |issue=21 |pages=2125 |year=2003 |last1=Østgaard |first1=N. |bibcode=2003GeoRL..30.2125O }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "dayside arcs" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting effects occur such as flickering aurora, "black aurora" and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through the Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.

The altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by Carl Størmer and his colleagues, who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Størmer |first1=Carl |title=Frequency of 12,330 measured heights of aurora from southern Norway in the years 1911–1944 |journal=Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity |year=1946 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1029/te051i004p00501 |bibcode=1946TeMAE..51..501S }}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150&amp;nbsp;km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km.
Images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in the use of [[digital camera]]s that have high enough sensitivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=News and information about meteor showers, solar flares, auroras, and near-Earth asteroids |publisher=SpaceWeather.com |accessdate=5 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100804164127/http://spaceweather.com//| archivedate= 4 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different color spectra present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of a film can be very important. Longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.

[[David Malin]] pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmalin.com/index.html |title=Astronomical photographs from David Malin Images |publisher=davidmalin.com |accessdate=3 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultraviolet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans. Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate the extent of the display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/pmap/index.html |title=NOAA POES Auroral Activity |publisher=swpc.noaa.gov |accessdate=3 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728192250/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/pmap/index.html |archivedate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=What's up in space: Auroras Underfoot|publisher=SpaceWeather.com |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717093810/http://www.spaceweather.com/| archivedate= 17 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excellent images are possible with standard film (using [[Film speed|ISO ratings]] between 100 and 400) and a [[single-lens reflex camera]] with full [[aperture]], a fast lens (f1.4 50&amp;nbsp;mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceweather.com/aurora/images/24nov01/Moss1.jpg Aurora image] (JPG)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the [[University of Saskatchewan]] using the [[SCR-270]] radar.

===Visual forms and colors===
Auroras frequently appear either as a diffuse glow or as "curtains" that extend approximately in the east–west direction. At some times, they form "quiet arcs"; at others, they evolve and change constantly. These are called "active aurora".

The most distinctive and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. ''In situ'' particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00585-997-0943-z |title=Magnetospheric source region of discrete auroras inferred from their relationship with isotropy boundaries of energetic particles |journal=Annales Geophysicae |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=943 |year=1997 |last1=Yahnin |first1=A.

The diffuse aurora, though, is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6826(96)00113-7 |title=Polar cap arcs: A review |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=1087 |year=1997 |last1=Zhu |first1=L. |last2=Schunk |first2=R.

Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations. The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious. Often there black aurora i.e. narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity. A typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=A |first=Brekke |last2=A |first2=Egeland |title=The Northern Lights |date=1994 |publisher=Grøndahl and Dreyer, Oslo |isbn=978-82-504-2105-9 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Red''': At the highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630&amp;nbsp;nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity. The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the "curtains". Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras.
* '''Green''': At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630-nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm emission (green) dominates. Fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100&amp;nbsp;km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths correspond to [[forbidden transition]]s of atomic oxygen, slow mechanism that is responsible for the graduality (0.7&amp;nbsp;s and 107&amp;nbsp;s respectively) of flaring and fading.
* '''Blue''': At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428&amp;nbsp;nm (blue) being dominant. Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows to the Universe – Auroral colors and spectra|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Magnetosphere/tour/tour_earth_magnetosphere_09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.
* '''Ultraviolet''': Ultraviolet radiation from auroras (within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans) has been observed with the requisite equipment. Ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on Mars,&lt;ref name="sci-news.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/space/science-nasas-maven-ultraviolet-aurora-mars-02614.html|title=NASA's MAVEN Orbiter Detects Ultraviolet Aurora on Mars &amp;#124; Space Exploration &amp;#124; Sci-News.com|publisher=sci-news.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter and Saturn.
* '''Infrared''': Infrared radiation, in wavelengths that are within the optical window, is also part of many auroras.&lt;ref name="sci-news.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dapep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapep.org/DAPT/EM-Wiki/aurora-borealis.html|title=Aurora Borealis|publisher=dapep.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Yellow''' and '''pink''' are [[Additive colour|a mix]] of red and green or blue. Other shades of red, as well as orange, may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is moderately common. As red, green, and blue are the primary colours of additive synthesis of colours, in theory, practically any colour might be possible, but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list.

===Other auroral radiation===
In addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150&amp;nbsp;kHz known as [[auroral kilometric radiation]] (AKR), discovered in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gurnett |first1=D.A. |title=The Earth as a radio source |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1974 |volume=79 |issue=79 |page=4227 |bibcode=1974JGR....79.4227G |doi=10.1029/JA079i028p04227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=K.A. |title=Balloon observations of X-rays in the auroral zone |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1960 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=551–564 |doi=10.1029/jz065i002p00551 |bibcode=1960JGR....65..551A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aurora noise ===
Aurora [[noise]], similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/auroras-sounds-noises-explained-earth-space-astronomy|title=Auroras Make Weird Noises, and Now We Know Why|date=2016-06-27|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elec.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2016-06-22/|title=News: Acoustics researcher finds explanation for auroral sounds|date=2016-06-21|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of auroras==
A full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the [[Earth's magnetosphere]]. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes, but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.
# A quiescent solar wind flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', as opposed to being 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the [[bow shock]]. It can also cause particles already trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]] to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the [[ionosphere]]. Such replacement of "hot" electrons by "cold" ones is in complete accord with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]]. The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.
# Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced [[solar wind]] causes distortions of the [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] ("magnetic substorms"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells (hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves [[magnetic flux]] (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate ("[[magnetic reconnection]]"); some blobs ("[[plasmoid]]s") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone. 
#: [[File:Moon and Aurora.jpg|thumb|Moon and Aurora]]
# Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.
[[Image:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|right|thumb|Aurora australis (11 September 2005) as captured by NASA's [[IMAGE]] satellite, digitally overlaid onto ''[[The Blue Marble]]'' composite image.
[[:Image:Aurora Australis.gif|An animation]] created using the same satellite data is also available]]
The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones, and temporarily magnetically trapped, particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burch |first1=J L |editor1-last=Akasofu S-I and Y Kamide |title=The solar wind and the Earth |date=1987 |publisher=D. Reidel |isbn=978-90-277-2471-7 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2016 more than fifty [[citizen science]] observations (under the aegis of Aurorasaurus) observed a heretofore unknown type of aurora which was dubbed "[[Steve (atmospheric phenomenon)|STEVE]]" (a reference to the animated film [[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]] in which one of the characters randomly names a previously unknown creature "Steve"); subsequent reportage went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], and STEVE remains under active scientific investigation.&lt;ref name="STEVE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.aurorasaurus.org/?p=449 |title=7 Things to Know About "STEVE" |date=2017-03-14 |website=Aurorasaurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auroral particles===
The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McIlwain |first1=C E |title=Direct Measurement of Particles Producing Visible Auroras |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1960 |volume=65 |issue=9 |page=2727 |doi=10.1029/JZ065i009p02727 |bibcode=1960JGR....65.2727M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000&amp;nbsp;km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA093iA07p07441 |title=Determination of auroral electrostatic potentials using high- and low-altitude particle distributions |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=93 |issue=A7 |pages=7441 |year=1988 |last1=Reiff |first1=P.

A. |last8=Friedman |first8=M. A. |bibcode=1988JGR....93.7441R }}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.
Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/215045a0 |title=Evidence for Velocity Dispersion in Auroral Electrons |journal=Nature |volume=215 |issue=5096 |pages=45 |year=1967 |last1=Bryant |first1=D.

D. |bibcode=1967Natur.215...45B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.

=== Auroras and the atmosphere ===
Auroras result from emissions of [[photon]]s in the Earth's upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], above {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}}, from [[ionized]] [[nitrogen]] atoms regaining an electron, and [[oxygen]] atoms and [[nitrogen]] based molecules returning from an [[excited state]] to [[ground state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultraviolet Waves|url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127004149/http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|archivedate=27 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere. Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:
;[[oxygen]] emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
;[[nitrogen]] emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.&lt;!-- atoms? not molecules? --&gt;
Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission. Because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.
This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common color. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.

===Auroras and the ionosphere===
Bright auroras are generally associated with [[Birkeland current]]s (Schield et al., 1969;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA074i001p00247 |last1=Schield |first1=M. A. |last2=Freeman |first2=J. W. |last3=Dessler |first3=A. J. |year=1969 |title=A Source for Field-Aligned Currents at Auroral Latitudes |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=247–256 |bibcode=1969JGR....74..247S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zmuda and Armstrong, 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA078i028p06802 |last1=Armstrong |first1=J. C. |last2=Zmuda |first2=A. J. |year=1973 |title=Triaxial magnetic measurements of field-aligned currents at 800 kilometers in the auroral region: Initial results |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=78 |issue=28 |pages=6802–6807 |bibcode=1973JGR....78.6802A}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other. In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125&amp;nbsp;km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an [[Ohm's law|ohmic conductor]], so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.

Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary [[Hall current]] flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral [[electrojet]]. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. [[Kristian Birkeland]]&lt;ref name="NAPE"&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkeland |first=Kristian |title=The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902–1903 |date=1908 |publisher=H. Aschehoug &amp; Co. |location=New York: Christiania (Oslo) |page=720 |url=https://archive.org/details/norwegianaurorap01chririch}} out-of-print, full text online&lt;/ref&gt; deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named "auroral electrojets" (see also [[Birkeland current]]s).

==Interaction of the solar wind with Earth==
The Earth is constantly immersed in the [[solar wind]], a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the [[corona]]. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400&amp;nbsp;km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). During [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]], in particular, flows can be several times faster; the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) may also be much stronger. [[Joan Feynman]] deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19770051690|title=
On the high correlation between long-term averages of solar wind speed and geomagnetic activity|author1=Crooker, N. U. |author2=Feynman, J. |author3=Gosling, J. T. |date=1 May 1977|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her work resulted from data collected by the [[Explorer 33]] spacecraft.
The solar wind and magnetosphere consist of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since [[Michael Faraday]]'s work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts ''across'' (or is cut ''by''), rather than ''along'', the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the ''direction'' of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. [[Dynamo]]s make use of this basic process ("the [[dynamo theory|dynamo effect]]"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.
The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the [[sunspot]]s, and its [[magnetism|field lines (lines of force)]] are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the [[Eugene Parker|Parker spiral]]. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun at any time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html Alaska.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220050940/http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html |date=20 December 2006 }}, Solar wind forecast from a [[University of Alaska]] website&lt;/ref&gt;
The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as [[magnetic reconnection]]. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the [[north magnetic pole]] and [[south magnetic pole]].
[[Image:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|Schematic of Earth's [[magnetosphere]]]]
Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when [[coronal mass ejections]] increase the intensity of the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905165404/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 September 2005 |title=NASA – NASA and World Book |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetosphere===
Earth's [[magnetosphere]] is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field. This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000&amp;nbsp;km (11 Earth radii or Re),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shue |first1=J.-H |first2=J.

The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000&amp;nbsp;km (30 Re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (&gt; 200 Re).
The high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyons |first1=L.

In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.
On 26 February 2008, [[THEMIS]] probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of [[magnetospheric substorm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html |title=NASA – THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043044/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a [[magnetic reconnection]] event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1160495 |title=Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset |year=2008 |last1=Angelopoulos |first1=V. |last2=McFadden |first2=J.

[[Geomagnetic storm]]s that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the [[equinox]]es. It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.

==Auroral particle acceleration==
The electrons responsible for the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Duncan |title=Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond |date=1998 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd |location=Bristol &amp; Philadelphia |isbn=978-0750305334 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond/Bryant/9780750305334 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.
The increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.

One early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.&lt;ref name="Evidence for the low altitude acceleration of auroral particles"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=D S |title=Hot Plasma in the Magnetosphere |date=1975 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York and London |isbn=978-0306337000 |pages=319–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible. Fundamentally, [[Poisson's equation]] indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop.  Inexplicably though, some authors&lt;ref&gt;Boström, Rolf "Observations of weak double layers on auroral field lines" (1992) IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science ({{ISSN|0093-3813}}), vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 756–763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ergun, R. E., et al. "Parallel electric fields in the upward current region of the aurora: Indirect and direct observations" (2002) Physics of Plasmas, Volume 9, Issue 9, pp. 3685–3694&lt;/ref&gt; still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact.  In another example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson |first1=C.W., R.F.Pfaff and J.G.Watzin |title=The Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST) mission |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=June 1998 |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=2013–2016|bibcode = 1998GeoRL..25.2013C |doi = 10.1029/98GL01592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is little justification given for saying 'FAST observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the '''ion beam''' energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of '''auroral particle''' acceleration'.

Another theory is based on acceleration by Landau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Landau_Lev.html|website=history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |title=Lev Davidovich Landau}}&lt;/ref&gt; resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region.

[[Image:Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|left|The aurora borealis as viewed from the International Space Station|ISS [[Expedition 6]] team, [[Lake Manicouagan]] is visible to the bottom left]]
Other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, [[Alfvén waves]], wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by [[Hannes Alfvén]] (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.
{{Wikinews|Aurora Borealis caused by electrical space tornadoes}}
Other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV, and are stopped higher up, near 200&amp;nbsp;km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 keV, suggesting they might be an "overflow" along magnetic field lines of the copious "ring current" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.
Some O+ ions ("conics") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora. These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines. They therefore start at their "mirror points" and can travel only upward. As they do so, the "mirror effect" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.

==Auroral events of historical significance==
The discovery of a 1770 Japanese [[diary]] in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of [[Kyoto]] suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the [[Carrington event]], which affected telegraph networks.&lt;ref name="1770 Japanese diary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/aurora-kyoto-1770-painting-science-magnetic-storm |title=1770 Kyoto Diary |last=Frost |first=Natasha |date=2017-10-04 |website=Atlas Obscura |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm |journal=Space Weather |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1314–1320 |date=2017-09-17 |doi = 10.1002/2017SW001690|last1 = Kataoka|first1 = Ryuho|last2=Iwahashi |first2=Kiyomi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auroras that resulted from the "[[Solar storm of 1859|great geomagnetic storm]]" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history. In a paper to the [[Royal Society]] on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording [[magnetograph]] at the [[Kew Observatory]] and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Carrington]]-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, "It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken ''in the act''."&lt;ref name="BSp1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=Balfour |jstor=111936 |title=On the Great Magnetic Disturbance of 28 August to 7 September 1859, as Recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=11 |date=1860–1862 |pages=407–10 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1860.0086}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light [[solar flare]] on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that in [[Boston]] on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the [[light]]".&lt;ref name="ADVSR1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asr.2005.12.021 |title=Eyewitness reports of the great auroral storm of 1859 |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=145–54 |last1=Green |first1=J |last2=Boardsen |first2=S |last3=Odenwald |first3=S |last4=Humble |first4=J |last5=Pazamickas |first5=K |bibcode=2006AdSpR..38..145G}}&lt;/ref&gt; One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September, would have been 6:00 GMT and the self-recording [[magnetograph]] at the [[Kew Observatory]] was recording the [[geomagnetic storm]], which was then one hour old, at its full intensity. Between 1859 and 1862, [[Elias Loomis]] published a series of nine papers on the [[Elias Loomis#Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859|Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859]] in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.

That aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense [[coronal mass ejection]]s in history. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific [[magnetometer]] measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the {{convert|125000|mi|km}} of [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient [[geomagnetically induced current]] from the [[electromagnetic field]] to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between [[Boston]] and [[Portland, Maine]], on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the ''Boston Traveler'':

{{Quotation|'''Boston operator (to Portland operator):''' "Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland operator:''' "Will do so. It is now disconnected."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland:''' "Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland:''' "Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "Yes. Go ahead."}}

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.&lt;ref name="ADVSR1" /&gt; Such events led to the general conclusion that

{{Quotation|The effect of the aurorae on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires. Sometimes it entirely neutralizes them, so that, in effect, no fluid is discoverable in them. The aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter, resembling in every respect, that generated by the electric galvanic battery. The currents from it change coming on the wires, and then disappear: the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith.&lt;ref&gt;''The British Colonist'', Vol. 2 No. 56, 19 October 1859, p. 1, accessed online at [http://britishcolonist.ca/display.php?issue=18591019&amp;pages=001,&amp;terms=aurora BritishColonist.ca]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831112729/http://britishcolonist.ca/display.php?issue=18591019&amp;pages=001%2C&amp;terms=aurora |date=31 August 2009 }}, on 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical theories, superstition and mythology==
An aurora was described by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[explorer]] [[Pytheas]] in the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Macleod, ''Explorers: Great Tales of Adventure and Endurance'', p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote about auroras in the first book of his ''[[Naturales Quaestiones]]'', classifying them, for instance as ''pithaei'' ('barrel-like'); ''chasmata'' ('chasm'); ''pogoniae'' ('bearded'); ''cyparissae'' ('like [[cypress]] trees'), and describing their manifold colors. He wrote about whether they were above or below the [[clouds]], and recalled that under [[Tiberius]], an aurora formed above the port city of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J.,[https://archive.org/stream/physicalsciencei00seneiala#page/38/mode/2up ''Physical Science in the time of Nero''] p.39-41, London, Macmillan, (1910), accessed online on 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that [[Pliny the Elder]] depicted the aurora borealis in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', when he refers to ''trabes'', ''chasma'', 'falling red flames' and 'daylight in the night'.&lt;ref&gt;Bostock, J. and Riley, H.T., ''The Natural History of Pliny: Volume II'', London, Bohn (1855), accessed online at [https://archive.org/stream/naturalhistoryof11855plin#page/62/mode/2up/search/aurora], on 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aurora australis.jpg|thumb|The Aboriginal Australians associated auroras (which are mainly low on the horizon and predominantly red) with fire.]]
In the traditions of [[Aboriginal Australians]], the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the [[Gunditjmara people]] of western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] called auroras ''puae buae'' ('ashes'), while the [[Gunai people]] of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as [[Wildfire|bushfires]] in the spirit world. The [[Diyari|Dieri]] people of [[South Australia]] say that an auroral display is ''kootchee'', an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the [[Ngarrindjeri|Ngarrindjeri people]] of South Australia refer to auroras seen over [[Kangaroo Island]] as the campfires of spirits in the 'Land of the Dead'. Aboriginal people in southwest [[Queensland]] believe the auroras to be the fires of the ''Oola Pikka'', ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamacher |first=D.W. |title=Aurorae in Australian Aboriginal Traditions |journal=Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage |year=2013 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=207–219 |url=http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2013JAHHvol16/2013JAHH...16..207H.pdf |arxiv=1309.3367 |bibcode=2013JAHH...16..207H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'' relates that in [[Norse mythology]], the armour of the [[Valkyrie|Valkyrior]] "sheds a strange flickering light, which flashes up over the northern skies, making what Men call the 'aurora borealis', or 'Northern Lights' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mythome.org/bxxxviii.html |title=Bullfinch's Mythology |publisher=Mythome.org |date=10 February 1996 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214105537/http://www.mythome.org/bxxxviii.html |archivedate=14 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be no evidence in [[Old Norse literature]] to substantiate this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/njordrljos.htm |title=The Aurora Borealis and the Vikings |publisher=Vikinganswerlady.com |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Old Norse account of ''norðrljós'' is found in the Norwegian chronicle ''[[Konungs Skuggsjá]]'' from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from [[Greenland]], and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that [[glacier]]s could store energy so that they eventually became [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irf.se/norrsken/Norrsken_history.html |title=Norrsken history |publisher=Irf.se |date=12 November 2003 |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215920/http://www.irf.se/norrsken/Norrsken_history.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1740s [[Benjamin Franklin]] theorized in his paper ''Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation'' that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N. (ed.) (1931), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wojw-wmYrNwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+northern+lights#v=onepage&amp;q=benjamin%20franklin%20northern%20lights ''The Ingenious Dr Franklin''], p.2, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|text=May not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which are condens'd there, and fall in snow, which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, I say (as a bottle overcharged) break thro' that low atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge, strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled with the upper air? |author=Benjamin Franklin|source=}}

Observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of [[Uppsala]] by [[Anders Celsius]] and [[Olof Hiorter]]. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuations with an aurora being observed overhead. This evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;J. Oschman (2016), ''Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis'' (Elsevier, Edinburgh) p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Church 1911.4.1.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church|Church's]] 1865 painting ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'']]
A variety of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer [[Samuel Hearne]] traveled with [[Chipewyan|Chipewyan Dene]] in 1771 and recorded their views on the ''ed-thin'' ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when [[caribou]] fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.&lt;ref&gt;Hearne, Samuel (1958). ''A Journey to the Northern Ocean: A journey from Prince of Wales' Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in the years 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772''. Richard Glover (ed.). Toronto: The MacMillan Company of Canada. pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night after the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The [[Confederate Army]] took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'' by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4806|title=''Aurora Borealis'' at the American Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th-century.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.II'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; It quotes [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the [[French Academy of Sciences|''Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences'']] between 1666 and 1716. And that one aurora recorded in ''Berlin Miscellany'' for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at [[Bologna]] was stated to be the first ever seen there. [[Anders Celsius|Celsius]] (1733) states the oldest residents of [[Uppsala]] thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 to 1715 corresponds to the [[Maunder minimum]] in sunspot activity.

It was the Norwegian scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.

==Non-terrestrial auroras==

[[Image:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|thumb|[[Jupiter]] aurora; the far left bright spot connects magnetically to [[Io (moon)|Io]]; the spots at the bottom of the image lead to [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].]]

{{see also|Magnetosphere of Jupiter#Aurorae}}
Both [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], as well as on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLQ71DU8E_index_0.html |title=ESA Portal – Mars Express discovers auroras on Mars |publisher=Esa.int |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially [[Io (moon)|Io]], are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter. These arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active [[volcanism]] and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.

Auroras have also been observed on [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.

An aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard [[Mars Express]]. The aurora was located at [[Terra Cimmeria]], in the region of 177° East, 52° South. The total size of the emission region was about 30&amp;nbsp;km across, and possibly about 8&amp;nbsp;km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.&lt;ref name="esa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=18 February 2006 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/mars_express_aurorae.html?1722006 |title=Mars Express Finds Auroras on Mars |publisher=Universe Today |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ever [[Extra-solar object|extra-solar]] auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the [[brown dwarf]] star [[LSR J1835+3259]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/monstrous-aurora-detected-beyond-our-solar-system-150729.htm |title=Monstrous Aurora Detected Beyond our Solar System |last1=O'Neill |first1=Ian |date=29 July 2015 |website=news.discovery.com |publisher=Discovery |access-date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/30087-alien-auroras-found-beyond-solar-system.html |title=First Alien Auroras Found, Are 1 Million Times Brighter Than Any On Earth |last1=Q.

The '''Cascade Center at the Riverplex''' is an indoor and outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex located in downtown [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]]. It opened in 2006. Much of the complex sits on the former site of the Cascade, the first movie theater of the [[Warner Bros.]], hence the name. The complex is at the corner of East Washington Street and Mill Street. As of 2013, the complex is owned by Riverplex Partners, Inc. The top three stories are rented by Refresh Dental Management as their corporate headquarters.

==History==
The [[Warner Bros.|Warners]], residents of nearby [[Youngstown, Ohio]], were sons of [[Polish Jew]]s wanting to break into the then-fledgling film business. The brothers, after successfully showing a used copy of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' at ''[[Idora Park, Youngstown|Idora Park]]'' in Youngstown,&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1964), pp. 49&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; traveled to New Castle to screen the movie in a vacant store on the site of what would become the Cascade Center.&lt;ref name="Warner54-55"&gt;Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.&lt;ref name="ohiomag-march83"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle near the Bijou, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace, taking its name from nearby [[Cascade Park (amusement park)|Cascade Park]]. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.

Gradually over time, the building that housed the Bijou would host other business while the Cascade itself would eventually be demolished to make way for a [[parking lot]]. The buildings themselves would become abandoned by the 1980s when New Castle, like most other [[Rust Belt]] cities, saw the collapse of the [[steel]] industry having a ripple effect in the region with the population dropping as well as the general [[suburbanization]] effect that had been happening throughout the [[United States]] since the 1950s.

By the mid-1990s, only two businesses were open on the site that would become the Cascade Center. One of them, Main Street Clothiers &amp; Custom Tailors, is a men's [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] shop that was housed in the building that also housed the Bijou. The other would be the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O Railroad]] Federal Credit Union, a [[credit union]] that was in a separate purpose-built building on the site bordering Mill Street and the [[Neshannock Creek]] and had actually been built on the site of the Cascade after the site was used as a parking lot.

In 1996, parts of the wall of the building that housed the Bijou collapsed onto East Washington Street, one of the cities main thoroughfares. The portion that collapsed was next door to Main Street Clothiers, which had just opened three years before on the site. The city of New Castle was very close to issuing a [[Occupancy|condemnation]] notice to the building, but at the 11th hour the building's historical significance was discovered, saving the building. The city then announced redevelopment plans to make it what would eventually become the Cascade Center.

==Development==
The city took most of the property by [[eminent domain]] and stabilized the parts of the wall that had collapsed, closing off the [[sidewalk]] in front of the building to prevent accidents until the wall could be completely rebuilt. The city was later able to persuade the B&amp;O Credit Union—now the First Choice Federal Credit Union—to temporarily move into the nearby mall, the Cascade Galleria, so that the property could be bought and made into the Cascade Center. (The credit union eventually moved out of the mall back into their own building out in neighboring [[Union Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Union Township]].) Main Street Clothiers was allowed to stay in the building where they remain today, and although their portion of the building is not officially part of the Cascade Center they do advertise in the complex, and have even expanded their business by [[screen-printing]] [[T-shirt]]s as well as serving as the area's [[J. C. Penney]] Catalog Center after [[Rite Aid]] acquired [[Eckerd Corporation|Eckerd Pharmacy]] in 2007 and ended the J. C. Penney Catalog Center's in the former Eckerd locations after they were converted to Rite Aid. Coincidentally, Main Street sits next door to a former J. C. Penney (not the side that had the wall collapse) that is currently being remodeled and eventually having a [[coffeehouse|coffee shop]] open in the building.

Although the downtown streets &amp; sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 2000s to resemble the turn of the 19th century, the complex itself wouldn't begin reconstruction until 2003 and was completed in 2006. The interiors of the existing buildings were completely gutted out while the site of the Cascade itself was completely rebuilt into a close replication of the Cascade. Both the old sections and the newly built sections are like one building inside. The city was also able to acquire the former [[Mellon Financial|Mellon Bank]] parking lot and rebuild it as the parking lot for downtown in general and the Cascade Center specifically. The [[alley]] that ran along Neshannock Creek behind the buildings was permanently closed and added on to the property of the complex, which became a [[Esplanade|promenade]] that leads to an outdoor [[Amphitheatre|amphitheater]] between the former J. C. Penney building and the creek along East Washington Street. The northern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 65]] (which runs along East Washington Street) was extended over a mile to near the complex on the other side of the creek.

Much like [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the complex is an example of [[adaptive reuse]], and focuses on the early years of [[Film|motion pictures]] much like Station Square focuses on [[train]]s. The complex largely remains vacant, although businesses have started to open up and events being held both inside the complex and at the amphitheater. The complex has also help draw businesses to downtown.

Despite the historical connection to the Warner Bros. studio, the complex has no association with [[Time Warner]], the current parent company of Warner Bros. Entertainment. Cass Warner, the granddaughter of [[Harry Warner]], did visit the complex just before it officially opened in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncnewsonline.com/archivesearch/local_story_112013504?start:int=30{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Although at one point the complex had three tenants, in 2010 all three closed for unknown reasons and the complex was put up for sale. The outdoor promenade and amphitheater, which are publicly owned, are still used by the city for downtown events.
 
It should also be noted that Main Street Clothiers and Custom Tailors, while in the building where the Cascade Center is located, is not an official part of the complex, since it has outdoor access only instead of indoor access like the rest of the businesses and also was pre-existing before the creation of the complex.

Reinvestment in the center has picked up in recent years, with the Two Rivers Coffee Shop and The Commonwealth restaurant both opening in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">'''Cerebral autoregulation''' is a process in mammals, which aims to maintain adequate and stable [[cerebral blood flow]]. While most systems of the body show some degree of autoregulation,&lt;ref name="cvphysiology"&gt;[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Flow/BF004.htm Autoregulation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the brain is very sensitive to [[Perfusion#Overperfusion and underperfusion|over- and underperfusion]]. Cerebral autoregulation plays an important role in maintaining an appropriate blood flow to that region. Brain [[perfusion]] is essential for life since the brain has a high metabolic demand. By means of cerebral autoregulation the body is able to deliver sufficient blood containing oxygen and nutrients to the brain tissue for this metabolic need, and remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other waste products.

[[File:Cerebral Autoregulation Large.jpg|thumb|alt=Schematic view of cerebral autoregulation.|Cerebral autoregulation]]

Cerebral autoregulation refers to the [[Cerebral Autoregulation#Physiological mechanisms|physiological mechanisms]] that maintain blood flow at an appropriate level during changes in blood pressure. However, due to the important influences of arterial carbon dioxide levels, cerebral metabolic rate, neural activation, activity of the sympathetic nervous system, posture, as well as other physiological variables, cerebral autoregulation is often interpreted as encompassing the wider field of cerebral blood flow regulation. This field includes areas such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactivity, neurovascular coupling and other aspects of cerebral haemodynamics.

This regulation of cerebral blood flow is achieved primarily by small arteries, arterioles, which either dilate or contract under the influence of multiple complex [[Cerebral Autoregulation#Physiological mechanisms|physiological control systems]]. Impairment of these systems may occur e.g. following stroke, trauma or anaesthesia, in premature babies and has been implicated in the development of subsequent brain injury. The non-invasive measurement of relevant physiological signals like cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, blood pressure, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, cerebral oxygen consumption, etc. is challenging. Even more so is the subsequent assessment of the control systems. Much remains unknown about the physiology of blood flow control and the best clinical interventions to optimize patient outcome.

==Physiological mechanisms==
Three different mechanisms are thought to contribute to the process of cerebral autoregulation. These are [[Cerebral Autoregulation#Metabolic regulation|metabolic]], [[Cerebral Autoregulation#Myogenic regulation|myogenic]] and [[Cerebral Autoregulation#Neurogenic regulation|neurogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cerebral autoregulation |vauthors=Paulson OB, Strandgaard S, Edvinsson L |volume=2 |journal=Cerebrovascular and brain metabolism reviews |issue= 2|year=1990 |pages=161–192 |PMID=2201348 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolic regulation===
Metabolic regulation is driven by difference the between cerebral metabolism (demand) and oxygen delivery through cerebral blood flow (supply) and acts by means of a vasoactive substance. In principle, this is a negative feedback control system that seeks to balance cerebral blood flow to its demand.

===Myogenic regulation===
The effect of transmural blood pressure changes are directly detected by the vascular smooth muscle in arterioles, probably via a stress sensing mechanism. Then, the calibers are adjusted accordingly to keep blood flow constant.

===Neurogenic regulation===
The vascular smooth muscle actuators in the resistance arterioles are controlled via sympathetic innervation, receiving the input from the appropriate brainstem autonomous control center. Nitric oxide released by parasympathetic fibers may also play a role.

==Assessment of cerebral autoregulation==
In order to assess cerebral autoregulation one must at least continuously measure arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels are of great influence to cerebral autoregulation it is recommended to also continuously measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Measuring arterial blood pressure===
[[Arterial blood pressure]] can be measured invasively using an [[arterial line]]. However, noninvasive finger arterial pressure can also be measured using a volume clamp technique. This technique uses a combination of an inflatable finger cuff and an infrared [[Photoplethysmograph|plethysmograph]].

===Measuring cerebral blood flow===
[[Cerebral blood flow]] can be quantified in various ways of which three noninvasive means are currently much used. These are [[Transcranial Doppler]] sonography, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] and [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|Near Infrared Spectroscopy]].

===Quantification of cerebral autoregulation===
The quantification of cerebral autoregulation always involves variation seen in cerebral blood flow in relation to changes in blood pressure. This blood pressure variation can either be evoked or spontaneous. Evoked blood pressure changes can be the result of:
* releasing leg cuffs that were inflated above systolic pressure
* breathing at a fixed rate
* performing a Valsalva maneuver
* performing squat-stand or sit-stand maneuvers
* lower body negative pressure
* pharmaceutical methods to raise or lower blood pressure
The quantification depends on the experimental setup and can involve methods such as regression, cross-correlation, transfer function analysis or fitting mathematical models.

Measuring and understanding cerebral autoregulation remains a big challenge. Despite great clinical interest and much research effort, benefit to patients has so far been limited.

{{Psychology sidebar|basic}}
In [[psychology]], '''cognitivism''' is a theoretical framework for understanding the mind that gained credence in the 1950s. The movement was a response to [[behaviorism]], which cognitivists said neglected to explain [[cognition]]. [[Cognitive psychology]] derived its name from the Latin ''cognoscere'', referring to knowing and information, thus cognitive psychology is an information-processing psychology derived in part from earlier traditions of the investigation of thought and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G. (2002). Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 38, 339-353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lilien-1&gt;

Behaviorists acknowledged the existence of thinking, but identified it as a behavior. Cognitivists  argued that the way people think impacts their behavior and therefore cannot be a behavior in and of itself. Cognitivists later argued that thinking is so essential to psychology that the study of thinking should become its own field.&lt;ref name=Lilien-1 /&gt; However, cognitivists typically presuppose a specific form of mental activity, of the kind advanced by [[computationalism]].

== Cognitive development ==


The process of assimilating and expanding our intellectual horizon is termed as [[cognitive]] development. We have a complex [[physiological]] structure that absorbs a variety of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from the [[environment (systems)|environment]], stimuli being the interactions which are able to produce [[knowledge]] and skills. Parents   process   knowledge   informally   in   the home while teachers process knowledge formally in school. [[Knowledge]] should be pursued with zest and zeal; if not, then learning becomes a burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Psychology|publisher=Neelkamal|page=60|edition=First edition, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attention ==


Attention is the first part of cognitive development. Learning takes place when the student gives attention towards the teacher. Interest and effort closely relate to attention. Attention is an active process which involves numerous outside stimuli.  The attention of an organism at any point in time involves three concentric circles; beyond awareness, margin, and focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Psychology|publisher=Neelkamal|page=59|edition=First edition, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How does learning occur? ==


[[Cognitive]] theory mainly stresses the acquisition of [[knowledge]] and growth of the mental structure. [[Cognitive]] theory tends to focus on conceptualizing the student's [[learning]] process: how information is received; how information is processed and organized into existing schema; how information is retrieved upon recall. In other words, cognitive theory seeks to explain the process of [[knowledge]] acquisition and the subsequent effects on the mental structures within the mind. Learning is not about the mechanics of what a learner does, but rather a process depending on what the learner already knows (existing information) and their method of acquiring new [[knowledge]] (how they integrate new information into their existing schemas). Knowledge acquisition is an activity consisting of internal codification of mental structures within the student's mind. Inherent to the theory, the student must be an active participant in their own learning process. Cognitive approaches mainly focus on the mental activities of the learner like mental planning, goal setting, and organizational strategies (Shell, 1980).
In [[cognitive]] theories not only the environmental factors and instructional components play an important role in learning. There are additional key elements like learning to code, transform, rehearse, and store and retrieve the information. Learning process includes learner’s thoughts, beliefs, and attitude values(Winna, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology|url=http://northweststate.edu/wp-content/uploads/files/21143_ftp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is the role of memory? ==


[[Memory]] plays a vital role in the [[learning]] process. Information is stored within memory in an organised, meaningful manner. Here, teacher and designers play different roles in the [[learning]] process. Teachers supposedly facilitate learning and the organization of information in an optimal way. Whereas designers supposedly use advanced techniques (such as analogies and hierarchical relationships) to help learners acquire new information to add to their prior [[knowledge]]. Forgetting is described as an inability to retrieve information from memory. [[Memory]] loss may be a mechanism used to discard situationally irrelevant information by assessing the relevance of newly acquired information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching Cognitivism|url=http://teachinglearningresources.pbworks.com/w/page/31012664/Cognitivism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How does transfer occur? ==


According to [[cognitive]] theory, if a learner knows how to implement [[knowledge]] in different contexts and conditions then we can say that transfer has occurred. (Schunk, 1991) Understanding is composed of knowledge - in the form of rules, concepts and discrimination (Duffy and Jonassen, 1991). Knowledge stored in [[memory]] is important, but the use of such knowledge is also important. Prior knowledge will be used for identifying similarities and differences between itself and novel [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Theories|url=http://www.learning-theories.com/cognitivism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What types of learning are explained in detail by this position? ==


Cognitive theory mostly explains complex forms of learning in terms of reasoning, problem solving and information processing (Schunk, 1991). Emphasis must be placed on the fact that the goal of all aforementioned viewpoints is considered to be the same - the transfer of knowledge to the student in the most efficient and effective manner possible (Bednar et al., 1991). Simplification and standardization are two techniques used to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer. Knowledge can be analysed, decomposed and simplified into basic building blocks. There is a correlation with the behaviorist model of the knowledge transfer environment. Cognitivists stress the importance of efficient processing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Teaching and Learning Cognitivism|url=http://teachinglearningresources.pbworks.com/w/page/31012664/Cognitivism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What are the basic assumptions/ principles of the cognitive theory or relevant to instructional design? ==


A behaviorist uses feedback (reinforcement) to change the behavior in the desired direction, while the cognitivist uses the feedback for guiding and supporting the accurate [[mind|mental]] connections (Thomson, Simon son. &amp; Hargrave, 1992).
For different reasons learners' task analyzers are critical to both cognitivists and behaviorists. Cognitivists look at the learner's predisposition to learning (How does the learner activate, maintain and direct his/her learning?) (Thompson et . al., 1992). Additionally, cognitivists examine the learner's 'how to design' [[Teaching|instruction]] that it can be assimilated. (i. e ., what about the learners existing mental structures?) In contrast, the behaviorists look at learners how to determine where the lesson should begin (i. e., At what level the learners are performing successfully?) and what are the most effective reinforcements (i.e., What are the consequences that are most desired by the learner?).

There are some specific assumptions or principles that direct the instructional design:  active involvement of the learner in the learning process, learner control, meta cognitive training (e.g., self-planning, monitoring and revising techniques), the use of hierarchical analyses to identify and illustrate prerequisite relationships (cognitive task analysis procedure), facilitating optimal processing of structuring, organizing and sequencing information (use of cognitive strategies such as outlining, summaries, synthesizers, advance organizers etc.), encouraging the students to make connections with previously learned material, and creating [[learning]] environments (recall of prerequisite skills; use of relevant examples, analogies).

== How should instruction be structured? ==


[[Cognitive]] theories emphasize mainly on making [[knowledge]] meaningful and helping learners to organizing relate new [[information]] to existing [[knowledge]] in [[memory]] . Instruction should be   based on students existing schema or mental structures, to be effective. The organisation of information is connected in such a manner that it should relate to the existing knowledge in some   meaningful way. The examples of [[cognitive]] strategy are   Analogies metaphors. The other   cognitive strategies includes the use of framing, outlining the mnemonics, concept mapping, advance organizers and so forth ( West, Farmer, and Wolff,1991). The cognitive theory mainly emphasizes the major tasks of the teacher / designer and includes analyzing that various learning experiences to the learning situation which can impact learning outcomes of different individuals.
Organizing and structuring the new information to connect the learners previously acquired knowledge abilities and experiences.
The new information is effectively and efficiently assimilated/accommodated within the learners cognitive structure (Stepich and Newby, 1988 ).

==Theoretical approach==

Cognitivism has two major components, one methodological, the other theoretical. Methodologically, cognitivism adopts a [[positivist]] approach and the belief that psychology can be (in principle) fully explained by the use of the [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This is also largely a [[reductionist]] goal, with the belief that individual components of mental function (the 'cognitive architecture') can be identified and meaningfully understood.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The second is the belief that [[cognition]] consists of discrete, internal mental states ([[representations]] or [[symbols]]) whose manipulation can be described in terms of rules or [[algorithm]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

Cognitivism became the dominant force in [[psychology]] in the late-20th century, replacing [[behaviorism]] as the most popular paradigm for understanding mental function. [[Cognitive psychology]] is not a wholesale refutation of behaviorism, but rather an expansion that accepts that mental states exist.  This was due to the increasing criticism towards the end of the 1950s of simplistic learning models. One of the most notable criticisms was [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] argument that language could not be acquired purely through conditioning, and must be at least partly explained by the existence of internal mental states.

The main issues that interest cognitive psychologists are the inner mechanisms of human thought and the processes of knowing. Cognitive psychologists have attempted to shed some light on the alleged mental structures that stand in a causal relationship to our physical actions.

==Criticisms of psychological cognitivism==

In the 1990s, various new theories emerged and challenged cognitivism and the idea that thought was best described as computation. Some of these new approaches, often influenced by phenomenological and [[postmodern philosophy]], include [[situated cognition]], [[distributed cognition]], [[dynamicism]], [[embodied cognition]]. Some thinkers working in the field of [[artificial life]] (for example [[Rodney Brooks]]) have also produced non-cognitivist models of cognition. On the other hand, much of early cognitive psychology, and the work of many currently active cognitive psychologists does not treat cognitive processes as computational.
The idea that mental functions can be described as information processing models has been criticised by [[philosopher]] [[John Searle]] and [[mathematician]] [[Roger Penrose]] who both argue that computation has some inherent shortcomings which cannot capture the fundamentals of mental processes. 
* Penrose uses [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem]] (which states that there are mathematical truths which can never be proven in a sufficiently strong mathematical system; any sufficiently strong system of axioms will also be incomplete) and [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] [[halting problem]] (which states that there are some things which are inherently non-computable) as evidence for his position.
* Searle has developed two arguments, the first (well known through his [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]]) is the '[[syntax]] is not [[semantics]]' argument—that a program is just syntax, while understanding requires semantics; therefore programs (hence cognitivism) cannot explain understanding. Such an argument presupposes the controversial notion of a [[private language]]. The second, which Searle now prefers but is less well known, is his 'syntax is not physics' argument—nothing in the world is intrinsically a computer program except as applied, described or interpreted by an observer, so either everything can be described as a computer and trivially a brain can but then this does not explain any specific mental processes, or there is nothing intrinsic in a brain that makes it a computer (program). Detractors of this argument might point out that the same thing could be said about any concept-object relation, and that the brain-computer analogy can be a perfectly useful model if there is a strong [[isomorphism]] between the two. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Both points, Searle claims, refute cognitivism.

Another argument against cognitivism is the problems of [[Ryle's Regress]] or the [[homunculus fallacy]].  Cognitivists have offered a number of arguments attempting to refute these attacks.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}

'''[[Custom (law)|Custom]] in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' is the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law.&lt;ref name=Metz39&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'', pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt; A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator.

Custom may be considered as a fact and as a law. As a fact, it is simply the frequent and free repetition of acts concerning the same thing; as a law, it is the result and consequence of that fact. Hence its name, which is derived from ''consuesco'' or ''consuefacio'' and denotes the frequency of the action. (Cap. Consuetudo v, Dist. I.)

In order for custom to become a source of law, it must be approved by the competent legislator.&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; Custom in canon law is not simply created by the people through their constant performance of a certain act,&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; but it is the constant performance of a certain act, with the intention of making a custom, which is approved by the competent legislator, thereby acquiring the force of law. This is because of the Catholic ecclesiological teaching on the constitution of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; which states that Christ constituted the Church by divine delegation of power to the hierarchical authorities; the Church was not created by the [[consent of the governed]], but by the direct will of Christ.

==Divisions of custom==

* (a) Considered according to extent, a custom is universal, if received by the whole Church; or general (though under another aspect, particular), if observed in an entire country or province; or special, if it obtains among smaller but perfect societies; or most special (''specialissima'') if among private individuals and imperfect societies. The last-named cannot elevate a custom into a legitimate law.
* (b) Considered according to duration, custom is prescriptive or non-prescriptive. The former is subdivided, according to the amount of time requisite for a custom of fact to become a custom of law, into ordinary (i. e. ten or forty years) and immemorial.
* (c) Considered according to method of introduction, a custom is judicial or extrajudicial. The first is that derived from forensic usage or precedent. This is of great importance in ecclesiastical circles, as the same prelates are generally both legislators and judges, i. e. the pope and bishops. Extrajudicial custom is introduced by the people, but its sanction becomes the more easy the larger the number of learned or prominent men who embrace it.
* (d) Considered in its relation to law, a custom is according to law (''juxta legem'') when it interprets or confirms an existing statute; or beside the law (''prœter legem'') when no written legislation on the subject exists; or contrary to law (''contra legem'') when it derogates from or abrogates a statute already in force.

==Legal conditions for custom==

The true efficient cause of an ecclesiastical custom, in as far as it constitutes law, is solely the consent of the competent legislating authority. All church laws imply spiritual jurisdiction, which resides in the hierarchy alone, and, consequently, the faithful have no legislative power, either by Divine right or canonical statute. Therefore, the express or tacit consent of the church authority is necessary to give a custom the force of an ecclesiastical law. This consent is denominated legal when, by general statute and antecedently, reasonable customs receive approbation. Ecclesiastical custom differs, therefore, radically from civil custom. For, though both arise from a certain conspiration and accord between the people and the lawgivers, yet in the Church the entire juridical force of the custom is to be obtained from the consent of the hierarchy while in the civil state, the people themselves are one of the real sources of the legal force of custom. Custom, as a fact, must proceed from the community, or at least from the action of the greater number constituting the community. These actions must be free, uniform, frequent, and public, and performed with the intention of imposing an obligation. The usage, of which there is question. must also be of a reasonable nature. Custom either introduces a new law or abrogates an old one. But a law, by its very concept, is an ordination of reason, and so no law can be constituted by an unreasonable custom. Moreover, as an existing statute cannot be revoked except for just cause, it follows that the custom which is to abrogate the old law must be reasonable, for otherwise the requisite justice would be wanting. A custom, considered as a fact, is unreasonable when it is contrary to Divine law, positive or natural; or when it is prohibited by proper ecclesiastical authority; or when it is the occasion of sin and opposed to the common good.

A custom must also have a legitimate prescription. Such prescription is obtained by a continuance of the act in question during a certain length of time. No canonical statute has positively defined what this length of time is, and so its determination is left to the wisdom of canonists. Authors generally hold that for the legalizing of a custom in accordance with or beside the law (''juxta'' or ''prœter legem'') a space of ten years is sufficient; while for a custom contrary (''contra'') to law many demand a lapse of forty years. The reason given for the necessity of so long a space as forty years is that the community will only slowly persuade itself of the opportuneness of abrogating the old and embracing the new law. The opinion, however, which holds that ten years suffices to establish a custom even contrary to the law may be safely followed. It is to be noted, however, that in practice the Roman Congregations scarcely tolerate or permit any custom, even an immemorial one, contrary to the sacred canons. (Cf. Gasparri, De Sacr. Ordin., n. 53, 69 sq.) In the introduction of a law by prescription, it is assumed that the custom was introduced in good faith, or at least through ignorance of the opposite law. If, however, a custom be introduced through connivance (''viâ conniventiœ''), good faith is not required, for, as a matter of fact, bad faith must, at least in the beginning, be presupposed. As, however, when there is question of connivance, the proper legislator must know of the formation of the custom and yet does not oppose it when he could easily do so, the contrary law is then supposed to be abrogated directly by the tacit revocation of the legislator. A custom which is contrary to good morals or to the natural or Divine positive law is always to be rejected as an abuse, and it can never be legalized.

==Force of custom==

The effects of a custom vary with the nature of the act which has caused its introduction, i. e. according as the act is in accord with (''juxta''), or beside (''prœter''), or contrary (''contra'') to, the written law.

* (a) The first (''juxta legem'') does not constitute a new law in the strict sense of the word; its effect is rather to confirm and strengthen an already existing statute or to interpret it. Hence the axiom of jurists: Custom is the best interpreter of laws. Custom, indeed, considered as a fact, is a witness to the true sense of a law and to the intention of the legislator. If, then, it bring about that a determinate sense be obligatorily attached to an indeterminate legal phrase, it takes rank as an authentic interpretation of the law and as such acquires true binding-force. Wernz (Jus Decretalium, n. 191) refers to this same principle as explaining why the oft-recurring phrase in ecclesiastical documents, "the existing discipline of the Church, approved by the Holy See", indicates a true norm and an obligatory law.
* (b) The second species of custom (''prœter legem'') has the force of a new law, binding upon the entire community both in the internal and external forum. Unless a special exception can be proved, the force of such a custom extends to the introduction of prohibitive, permissive, and preceptive statutes, as well as to penal and nullifying enactments.
* (c) Thirdly, a custom contrary (''contra'') to law has the effect of abrogating, entirely or in part, an already existing ordinance, for it has the force of a new and later law. As regards penal ecclesiastical legislation, such a custom may directly remove an obligation in conscience, while the duty of submission to the punishment for transgressing the old precept may remain, provided the punishment in question be not a censure nor so severe a chastisement as necessarily presupposes a grave fault. On the other hand, this species of custom may also remove the punishment attached to a particular law, while the law itself remains obligatory as to its observance.

Immemorial custom, provided it be shown that circumstances have so changed as to make the custom reasonable, has power to abrogate or change any human law, even though a clause had been originally added to it forbidding any custom to the contrary. To immemorial custom is also attached the unusual force of inducing a presumption of the existence of an Apostolic privilege, provided the said privilege be not reckoned among abuses, and the holder of the presumed privilege be a person legally capable of acquiring the thing in question without first obtaining a special and express Apostolic permission for it (cf. Wernz, op. cit., who has been followed particularly in this paragraph). Ferraris notes that no immemorial custom, if it be not confirmed by Apostolic privilege, express or presumptive, can have any force for the abrogation of ecclesiastical liberties or immunities, inasmuch as both canon and civil law declare such custom to be unreasonable by its very nature. In general, it may be said that a valid custom, in both the constitution and the abrogation of laws, produces the same effects as a legislative act.

==Concerning Tridentine decrees==

A special question has been raised by some canonists as to whether the laws of the Council of Trent may be changed or abrogated by custom, even if immemorial, or whether all such contrary customs should not be rejected as abuses. Some of these writers restrict their denial of the value of contrary customs to ordinary, some also to immemorial ones (cf. Lucidi, De Vis. Sac. Lim., I, ch. iii, n. 111). It is unquestionably a general principle in canon law, that custom can change the disciplinary statutes even of œcumenical councils. The main reason for rejecting this principle in favour of the Tridentine enactments in particular is that any contrary custom would certainly be unreasonable and therefore unjustifiable. It is by no means evident, however, that all such contrary customs must necessarily be unreasonable, as is plain from the fact that some authors allow and others deny the value of immemorial customs in the premises, even when they agree in reprobating the force of ordinary customs. As a matter of fact, there is no decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Council which declares, absolutely and generally, that all customs contrary to the laws of the Council of Trent are invalid. Moreover, the Tribunal of the Rota has allowed the force of immemorial customs contrary to the disciplinary decrees of Trent, and the Sacred Congregation of the Council has at least tolerated them in secondary matters. A salient instance of the Roman official view is the statement of the Holy Office (11 March 1868) that the Tridentine decree on clandestine marriages, even after promulgation, was abrogated in some regions by contrary custom (Collect. S. C. de Prop. Fid., n. 1408). The confirmation of the Council of Trent by Pope Pius IV (26 Jan., 1564; 17 Feb., 1565) abolishes, it is true, all contrary existing customs, but the papal letters contain nothing to invalidate future customs. Owing to the comparatively recent date of the Council of Trent and the urgency of the Holy See that its decrees be observed, it is not easy for a contrary custom to arise, but whenever the conditions of a legitimate custom are fulfilled, there is no reason why the Tridentine decrees should be more immune than those of any other œcumenical council (cfr. Laurentius, op. cit., below, n. 307).

==Cessation of custom==

Any custom is to be rejected whose existence as such cannot be proved legally. A custom is a matter of fact, and therefore its existence must be tested in the same way as the existence of other alleged facts is tested. In this particular, the decrees of synods, the testimony of the diocesan ordinary and of other persons worthy of credence are of great value. Proofs are considered the stronger the more closely they approximate public and official monuments. If there be a question of proving an immemorial custom, the witnesses must be able to affirm that they themselves have been cognizant of the matter at issue for a space of at least forty years, that they have heard it referred to by their progenitors as something always observed, and that neither they nor their fathers have ever been aware of any fact to the contrary. If the fact of the existence of an alleged custom is not sufficiently proved, it is to be rejected as constituting a source of law. Customs may be revoked by a competent ecclesiastical legislator, in the same way and for the same reasons as other ordinances are abrogated. A later general law contrary to a general custom will nullify the latter, but a particular custom will not be abrogated by a general law, unless a clause to that effect be inserted. Even such a nullifying clause will not be sufficient for the abrogation of immemorial customs. The latter must be mentioned explicitly, for they are held not to be included in any general legal phrase, however sweeping its terms may be. Customs may likewise be abrogated by contrary customs, or they may lose their legal force by the mere fact that they fall into desuetude. Finally, an authentic declaration that a custom is absolutely contrary to good morals (''rumpens nervum disciplinœ'') and detrimental to the interests of the hierarchy or of the faithful deprives it of its supposed legal value.

'''Dam removal''' is the process of demolishing a [[dam]], leaving a river to flow freely. It is undertaken for a variety of reasons that include environmental rehabilitation, structural weakness and maintenance expense.

All dams negatively affect the aquatic environments of rivers that they are located on, but those effects are often negated by the stated purpose of the dam, whether it is hydroelectric power, flood control, or other functions. When the [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|negative environmental effects]] outweigh the benefits, a dam may be considered for removal. This happened on the [[Elwha River]] in [[Olympic National Park]] in Washington when extraordinarily rich salmon habitat was being disrupted by an out-dated hydroelectric plant. Before dams were built on the Elwha River, 400,000 salmon returned each year to spawn, but that number dropped to fewer than 3,000 after dams were put up.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/08/29/removing-dams-and-restoring-rivers/|title=Removing Dams and Restoring Rivers|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the hydroelectric power generating capacities of the dams had outlived their useful lives, the importance of this salmon habitat necessitated the removal of the dams on the Elwha River.

Dam failure is another threat that can lead to the removal of dams. Sometimes the fear of failure is due to seismic activity or the placement of the dam. Additionally, the older the dam is, the more likely it is to fail. Around the world, a growing number of 20th-century dam construction projects are reaching the end of their design lives: as of 1996, 5,000 large dams around the world were more than 50 years old.[1]  By 2020, in the United States alone, 85% percent of the country’s dams will have exceeded that 50 year threshold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, economic reasons often provide a convincing reason to remove a dam. The cost of keeping outdated hydroelectric equipment running decades after it was installed or upgrading dam safety systems may not be worth it. Additionally, population centers and industrial facilities that demanded hydropower decades ago can move and leave the dam without a purpose.

Since around 2000, most major dam removal projects, and the largest single project, the $350M removal of two [[Olympic Peninsula]] dams as part of the [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration]], have been driven by restoration of river habitat and fish passages.  Inspired by the Elwha project, a French group called ''SOS Loire Vivante'' successfully lobbied for the removal of two dams in the Upper [[Loire Valley]], and the re-engineering of a 1941 hydroelectric dam on the [[Allier River]] to restore habitat for [[Atlantic salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xin|first1=Guo|title=French Dam Removal Opens Way for Atlantic Salmon|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/french-dam-removal-opens-way-for-atlantic-salmon-1632|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=internationalrivers.org|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes and effects of dams==
[[Image:Grand Coulee Dam.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Coulee Dam, Columbia River, Washington, United States]]

Many of the dams in the eastern United States were built for [[water diversion]], [[agriculture]], factory [[watermill]]s, and other purposes that are no longer seen as useful. Because of the age of these dams, over time the risk for catastrophic failure increases. In addition, many of these dams block [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] fish runs, such as [[Atlantic salmon]] and [[American shad]], and prevent important sediments from reaching [[estuaries]].

Many dams in the western United States were built for agricultural [[water diversion]] in the arid country, with [[hydroelectric]] power generation being a very significant side benefit. Among the largest of these water diversion projects is the [[Columbia Basin Project]], which diverts water at the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]. The [[Bureau of Reclamation]] manages many of these water diversion projects.

Some dams in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[California]] block passage for anadromous fish species such as [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]]. [[Fish ladder]]s and other passage facilities have been largely ineffective{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} in mitigating the negative effects on salmon populations. [[Bonneville Power Administration]] manages electricity on 11 dams on the [[Columbia River]] and 4 on the [[Snake River]], which were built by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]].

[[Image:Grand Canyon Horse Shoe Bend MC.jpg|thumb|right|Clear water below Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona, United States]]

In the [[Desert Southwest]], dams can change the nature of the river ecosystem. In the particular case of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], the originally warm, sediment-filled, muddy water, instead runs cold and clear through the [[Grand Canyon]], which has significant impacts on the downstream ecosystems. Three native fish species have become extinct in the Grand Canyon and others are endangered since the dam was completed, including [[humpback chub]] and [[razorback sucker]].

Some dam projects, such as those on the [[Salt River Project]] in [[Arizona]], eliminate the flow of the river downstream, by diverting the flow into the [[Arizona Canal]] system for use in agriculture and urban usage, such that only a dry channel or [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]] heads out across the desert.

So much water is taken out of the [[Colorado River]] for agriculture, urban use, and evaporation behind the dams, that the river no longer flows into the [[Gulf of California]].

== Methods of removal ==
There are several ways dams can be removed and the chosen method will depend on many factors. The size and type of the dam, the amount of sediment behind the dam, the aquatic environment below the dam, who owns the dam and what their priorities are, and the timeframe of dam removal are all factors that affect how the dam will be removed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/hr/print/volume-31/issue-07/articles/sediment-strategies-choosing-a-sediment-management-option-for-dam-removal.html|title=Sediment Strategies: Choosing a Sediment Management Option for Dam Removal|website=www.hydroworld.com|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is costly no matter what and expenses typically rise when greater weight is given to environmental concerns. Fortunately, the cost of dam removal is usually shared by multiple stakeholders such as the dam owner and either the federal, state or local government. Four of the most common dam removal methods are described below.

Sediment management is a driving force in all of them. A common problem for dams is how sediment carried naturally by the river is deposited in the reservoir and eventually fills it up with silt. This excess sediment reduces the hydroelectric generating capacity of a reservoir, changes the river channel downstream, traps nutrient-rich sediment behind the dam, and can put a dangerous amount of pressure on the dam itself. Oftentimes the sediment stored in a reservoir is good for the riparian corridor below the dam, can rebuild fish habitat, provide nutrients, and add onto a beach or estuary. Other times, the sediment can increase the turbidity of the river harming fish, scour the landscape, and bury infrastructure.
[[File:Notch and release approach at Glines Canyon Dam on Elwha River.jpg|thumb|288x288px|Here five notches can be seen at the Glines Canyon Dam as it was removed in a multi-year process.]]
Sediment can be tested before it is released to determine if it will be harmful to the landscape below the dam. Dam removal can have adverse consequences if this is not done. For example, when the Fort Edward Dam on the Hudson River was removed in the 1970s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] in the sediment were released, affecting human and wildlife health downstream.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Notch and release approach ===
The notch and release approach is commonly used because of its ecological benefits. It is a slow method in which the reservoir is drained through notches cut into the dam. New notches are cut in so the water drains out of the reservoir at a consistent flow. The sediment trapped behind the dam flows downstream in a fixed rate that allows the ecosystem to adjust to the changes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This method can take months or even over a year but has proven success with restoring fish species to rivers. The [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration|Elwha and Glines Canyon dam removal project]] used the notch and release approach to great success.

=== Rapid release approach ===
The rapid release approach is both the quickest and least expensive way to remove a dam, but comes with significant drawbacks. In this approach, a large tunnel is dug through the base of the dam and then connected to the reservoir. The entire body of water will drain through this tunnel in a matter of minutes or hours and the massive release of water and sediment can cause severe flooding and erosion along the river downstream for miles. This can devastate the riparian ecosystem along the river as well as dangerously scour bridge pilings, buried pipes, levees, and other infrastructure. However, if the reservoir held back by the dam is relatively small and quickly drains into a larger river or lake, this approach can be carried out with minimal impact on either the ecosystem or human infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Dig and dewater approach ===
The dig and dewater approach is typically the most expensive dam removal method, but is necessary in some cases. It entails emptying the entire reservoir, allowing the sediment to dry, and then transporting it to a safe location for disposal. It is costly and slow, but if the reservoir is located very near hydroelectric generating facilities that would be greatly impacted by released sediments, it may be necessary. Another situation is if the sediments behind the dam contain toxins. Hauling them away and disposing of them safely is important for the ecological health of the river.

=== Retained sediment approach ===
The retained sediment approach is the final commonly used approach and involves leaving the sediment behind where it is. To do this, the river or creek must be rerouted around the damsite which can prove expensive and challenging. This may be carried out in places where the dig and dewater approach makes sense, but are too remote to be cost-effective.

== Alternatives to removal ==
[[File:John Day Dam fish ladder.jpg|left|thumb|340x340px|Fish ladder at John Day Dam on the Columbia River.]]

While fewer than 1% of United States dams are being considered for removal, there has been a push in recent years to address the deficiencies in existing dams without removing them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These goals include maximizing the efficiency of existing dams and minimizing their environmental impact. Updating equipment and acknowledging that dams have a limited life span are two ways to achieve those goals. As part of them, a plan for decommissioning the dam and restoring the river should be drawn up long before the dam exceeds its design life. One part of river restoration that does not have to wait until the dam is removed is introducing [[environmental flow]]. Having variable amounts of water flow through the dam at different seasons mimics natural seasonal variations in water level from winter and spring storms. Additionally, [[fish ladder]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Fish ladder|s]] can be added to dams to increase the connectivity of a river and allow fish to reach their spawning grounds. There’s debate about the effectiveness of fish ladders, but generally some fish will make it through as opposed to zero fish spawning in their traditional location.

== Completed projects ==

[[File:Condit Dam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Condit Dam, Washington, United States]]

* 1973 - Lewiston Dam, [[South Fork Clearwater River]], [[Idaho]] – The {{convert|39|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam was built in 1927 as a hydroelectric facility, but lacked [[fish ladders]]. Upon completion of the [[Lower Granite Dam]] and its reservoir, the lack of gradient on the river made it obsolete. Its removal improved salmon runs on the river.
* 1997 - Marie Dorian Dam, [[Walla Walla River]], Oregon – The {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked passage to [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] into the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] from the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]].
* 1999 - [[Edwards Dam]], [[Kennebec River]], [[Maine]] – Built in 1837, the {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked access to [[Atlantic Salmon]] and [[American Shad]].  This was a landmark case in which a U.S. federal agency, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], required the decommissioning and removal of a dam against the operator's wishes.
* 2004 - Embrey Dam, [[Rappahannock River]], [[Virginia]] - The 22-foot-tall, 770-foot-long, 1910 hydroelectric Embrey Dam was blown up with 600&amp;nbsp;lbs of explosives by the [[U.S. Army Dive team out of Ft. Eustis, VA]] on February 23, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrivers.org/our-work/restoring-rivers/dams/projects/embrey-dam.html|title=Dams and Hydropower|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of removal was to re-open miles of spawning grounds to aid populations of [[American Shad]], herring, catadromous American eel, and other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2006/022006/02232006/170364|title=Embrey Dam just a memory|work=Fredericksburg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historical character of the [[Nils F.

* 2004 - [[Cuddebackville Dam]], [[Neversink River]], [[New York (state)|New York]] - Built in two portions dating from the 1820s (for water diversion into a canal) and 1915 (for hydroelectric power), the dam had been abandoned since 1945.  The dam was removed in October 2004 by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], in a novel partnership with the [[Nature Conservancy]], to benefit the aquatic life in the area, specifically the [[Dwarf Wedge Mussel]] and the [[American Shad]].
* 2007 - [[Marmot Dam]], [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]], Oregon – The removal of this {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam by [[Portland General Electric]] has been extremely successful at improving access for [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] to the upper Sandy River watershed up into the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]].
* 2008 - [[Milltown Dam]], [[Clark Fork River, Blackfoot River (Montana)|Missoula]], Montana - Dam held startling levels of toxic sediments from 100 years of mining and logging. Removal improved water quality, trout habitat, and the general ecological condition of the watershed.
* 2009 - [[Savage Rapids Dam]], [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]], [[Oregon]] – Built for agricultural [[water diversion]], it was removed by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] due to its out-dated facilities and non-functioning fish ladders that prevented fish migration past the dam.
* 2011 - [[Condit Dam]], [[White Salmon River]], Washington – The {{convert|123|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked access for [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] runs on {{convert|33|mi|km}} of river. [[PacifiCorp]] proposed to remove the dam, rather than paying for fish passage upgrades. Removal was proposed in 2006, but actions from [[Skamania County, Washington|Skamania]] and [[Klickitat County, Washington|Klickitat]] counties held up the process. In fall 2008, salmon were trucked up above to dam to allow them to spawn higher up the river. In October 2011, PacifiCorp contractors used explosives to blow a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} hole in the dam to drain its reservoir and allow young salmon to enter the [[Columbia River]] and head to sea.
* 2012 - [[Elwha Dam|Elwha]] and [[Glines Canyon Dam]]s, [[Elwha River]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] – The largest dam removal project in history is the [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration]] project on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. Starting in 2012, and finishing in 2014, the {{convert|108|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Elwha Dam]] and the {{convert|210|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Glines Canyon Dam]] were removed to restore stocks of [[Pacific Salmon]] and trout species to the [[Elwha River]] watershed. The removal of these blockades allows migratory salmon to travel past the dam sites and upriver, an event that has not occurred since the dams' creation in 1913. After spawning there, the salmon die and their carcasses decompose, releasing marine nutrients laid down in their bodies as they fed in the open ocean. This reintroduction provides a valuable research opportunity for interested parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elwhascienceed.org/project-update/elwha-salmon-populations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107035629/http://www.elwhascienceed.org/project-update/elwha-salmon-populations |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the dam removal, reservoir beds that looked like moonscapes have returned to vibrant rich habitat.

==Proposed removals==

===Lower Snake River Dams, Washington, US===

[[File:LGLandDam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Little Goose Dam]], Washington, USA]]

Four dams along the lower [[Snake River]], built and still operated by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], serve as hydroelectric power sources as well as maintaining an inland port at [[Lewiston, Idaho]] for agricultural barge traffic.  The four are candidates for removal because of millions of cubic yards accumulated behind the dams, which are raising water levels for riverside cities.  They include:  the 1975 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lower Granite Dam]], the 1970 {{convert|98|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Little Goose Dam]], the 1969 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lower Monumental Dam]], and the 1962 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Ice Harbor Dam]].

Three million new cubic yards of sediment are deposited behind the lower four dams on the Snake River annually.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, E. (2007, February 16). Corps of engineers gets earful about sediment problems. Lewiston Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Lewiston, Idaho and others along the Snake have built a system of levees maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. The levees in Lewiston were designed to leave five feet between water levels and the top of the levees.  As of 2011, two feet remained.  As water levels continue to rise, either some of the dams must be removed or dredged, or the municipal levees will continue to be raised.  The Corps admits that the amount of sediment in the riverbed is too great for dredging to be effective, and Lewiston community leaders are worried that higher levees will further cut the town off from its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Restore Wild Salmon?"

===Rindge Dam and Matilija Dam, Southern California===

[[File:Rindge Dam.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rindge Dam]] near [[Malibu, California]], built in 1924, completely silted and abandoned by the 1950s]]

The {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} privately owned [[Rindge Dam]] on [[Malibu Creek]] in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] of California was built in 1924 and has been allowed to completely fill with sediment, making it functionally obsolete but still a potential hazard.  Malibu Creek once supported the southernmost [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] population in the world. But today, steelhead no longer occupy the creek.

The similar 1947 [[Matilija Dam]] near [[Ojai, California]] was built against the advice of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], among others, and also blocked steelhead trout spawning grounds.  After being notched twice and largely silted up, 90% of its design capacity has been lost.  As of 2013 stakeholders agree that the dam and its sediment be removed, but no funding source has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Cheri|title=Delayed plan to remove Matilija Dam near Ojai will get new studies|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/delayed-plan-to-remove-matilija-dam-near-ojai-will-get-new-studies-ep-293034957-351781061.html|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=Ventura County Star|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klamath River Dams, California / Oregon border===

{{main|Klamath River Hydroelectric Project}}

[[File:Klamath tribes dam removal demo.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstrators calling for removal of dams on the [[Klamath River]] in Oregon and California, USA]]

As resolution of several long-range issues centered on water rights in the [[Klamath Basin]], the multi-party [[Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement]] was signed in early 2008.  Parties to the agreement included the state of [[California]], the state of [[Oregon]], three Native American tribes, four counties, and 35 other local organizations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement|url=http://klamathrestoration.gov/sites/klamathrestoration.gov/files/Klamath-Agreements/Klamath-Basin-Restoration-Agreement-2-18-10signed.pdf|website=Klamath Restoration|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement called for the removal of four of the [[Klamath River Hydroelectric Project]] dams: the 1958 [[John C. Boyle Dam]], the 1922 [[Copco Number 1 Dam|Copco Number 1]] and Copco Number 2, and the 1964 [[Iron Gate Dam (California)|Iron Gate Dam]].  All four are privately owned by [[PacifiCorp]].  At the time PacifiCorp faced a relicensing cycle with [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], with potentially expensive fixes for salmon passage and to address the growth of the toxic bacteria ''[[Microcystis aeruginosa]]'' in the Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs.

On September 29, 2009, Pacificorp reached an agreement in principle with the other KBRA parties to remove the four dams, pending Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Fimrite | first=P. | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/30/MNMM19UDKH.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | title=Deal to raze 4 Klamath dams | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date= 30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress did not act, so as of February 2016, the states of Oregon and California, the dam owners, federal regulators and other parties reached a further agreement to remove all four Klamath basin dams by the year 2020, contingent only on approval by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/New-plan-to-remove-Klamath-River-dams-without-6801869.php|title=New plan to remove Klamath River dams without help from Congress|first=Carolyn |last=Lochhead|date=3 February 2016|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new plan has been endorsed by the governors of California and Oregon, as well as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_29738226/klamath-river-dam-removal-deal-signed-by-top|title=Klamath River dam removal deal signed by top federal, state officials|first=Will | last=Houston |date=7 April 2016|publisher=Eureka Times-Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glen Canyon Dam, northern Arizona ===

[[Image:Glencanyondam.jpg|thumb|right|Glen Canyon Dam]]

The {{convert|710|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Glen Canyon Dam]] has been proposed for removal because of the negative effects it has on the water quality and riparian habitat of the [[Colorado River]] in [[Grand Canyon National Park]]. In addition, the reservoir impounded behind it, [[Lake Powell]] has filled all of the canyons for up to {{convert|160|mi|km}} above the dam. This lake, while providing recreational opportunities, has eliminated more than {{convert|160|mi|km}} of habitat for endangered [[Colorado River]] fish species.

The reservoir also loses more than 6 percent of the total annual flow of the Colorado River to evaporation and seepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Glen Canyon?|url=http://www.glencanyon.org/glen_canyon/why-glen-canyon|work=Glen Canyon Institute|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of dam removal such as the [[Glen Canyon Institute]] also cite these losses of stored water as reason to decommission the dam.   If it were to be removed, it would dwarf any completed dam removal project in history.

These designations are intended to meet federal Clean Water Act obligations requiring Wisconsin to adopt an “antidegradation” policy that is designed to prevent any lowering of water quality – especially in those waters having significant ecological or cultural value.&lt;ref name="dnr.wi.gov"/&gt;

'''Divided consciousness''' is a term coined by [[Ernest Hilgard]] to define a psychological state in which one's [[consciousness]] is split into distinct components, possibly during [[hypnosis]].

== Origin(s) ==
The theory of a division of consciousness was touched upon by [[Carl Jung]] in 1935 when he stated, "The so-called unity of consciousness is an illusion... we like to think that we are one but we are not."&lt;ref&gt;(Review: Dissociationism Revived, Matthew Hugh Erdelyi, Science, New Series, Vol. 200, No. 4342 (May 12, 1978), pp. 654-655; Published by: American Association for the Advancement of Science)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ernest Hilgard believed that hypnosis causes a split in awareness and a vivid form of everyday mind splits.&lt;ref&gt;(Myers, David G. Psychology:  Eighth Edition in Modules. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;   Drawing themes from [[Pierre Janet]], Hilgard viewed hypnosis from this perspective as a willingness to divide the main systems of consciousness into different sectors.  He argued that this split in consciousness can not only help define the state of mind reached during hypnosis, but can also help to define a vast range of psychological issues such as [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].

In Hilgard's ''Divided Consciousness Reconsidered'', he offers a great many examples of "[[dissociation (psychology)|dissociated]]" human behavior. With regard to theory, he does state that it is useful to assign two modes of consciousness, a receptive mode and an active mode—that is, a bimodal consciousness. In other places he mentions the concept of ''coconsciousness'', wherein two or more states of consciousness may be equally receptive or active, as, for example, in some types of multiple personality.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, B. (1979). Distributing cognition: A defense of collective mentality,'' Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 8 (6)'',591;  Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/h66jn31642t052j8/fulltext.pdf?page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Many psychological studies assume a unity of consciousness. Doubt is cast on this assumption by psychophysical studies in normal subjects and those with [[blindsight]] showing the simultaneous dissociation of different modes of report of a sensation, and by clinical studies of [[anosognosia|anosognosic]] patients showing dissociations of awareness of their own states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These and other phenomena are interpreted to imply two kinds of division of consciousness: the separation of phenomenal experience from reflexive consciousness and the non-unity of reflexive consciousness. Reflexive consciousness is taken to be necessary for report and is associated with the self as the subject of experience and agent of report. Reflexive consciousness is operative only when we attend to our own states. When we are involved in the world reflexivity intervenes less and our consciousness is more unified.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, D, Juzyck, P, Klein R.,(1983). The Nature of Thought, '' Medical Research Council, Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, UK.'' Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=0cprqzSe6BkC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=By+Donald+Olding+Hebb,+Peter+W.+Jusczyk,+Raymond+M.+Klein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N_f-8zNr2K&amp;sig=dBHDyYyDKSCTQ4YohMjalD85fxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA32,M1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimentation ==
The theory has been tried and tested and some tests have proven that the theory makes some legitimate predictions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Others, such as one performed on 169 undergraduate students, some of whom performed tasks in [[selective attention]] and divided attention conditions being correlated with scores on the [[Hypnotic susceptibility#Harvard Group Scale|Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility]] refute Hilgard’s findings.&lt;ref&gt;Some operationalizations of the neodissociation concept and their relationship to [[hypnotic susceptibility]]. Stava, Lawrence J.; Jaffa, Melvyn. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Vol 54(6), Jun 1988, 989-996.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

New trends in psychology and [[cognitive neuroscience]] suggest that applications of [[nonlinear dynamics]], chaos and [[self-organization]] seem to be particularly important for research of some fundamental problems regarding mind-brain relationship. Relevant problems among others are formations of memories during alterations of mental states and nature of a barrier that divides mental states, and leads to the process called [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]. This process is related to a formation of groups of [[neuron]]s which often synchronize their firing patterns in a unique spatial manner. The central theme of this study is the relationship between level of moving and oscillating [[mental process]]es and their [[neurophysiological]] substrate. This presents a question about principles of organization of the conscious experience and how the experiences happen in the brain. Chaotic self-organization provides a unique theoretical and experimental tool for deeper understanding of dissociative phenomena and enables to study how dissociative phenomena can be linked to [[epilepsy|epileptiform]] discharges which are related to various forms of psychological and somatic manifestations. Organizing principles that constitute human consciousness and other mental phenomena from this point of view may be described by analysis and reconstruction of underlying dynamics of psychophysiological measures.&lt;ref&gt;Chaos, brain and divided consciousness.

The '''early skyscrapers''' were a range of [[skyscraper|tall, commercial buildings]] built between 1884 and 1939, predominantly in the American cities of [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]]. Cities in the United States were traditionally made up of [[low-rise]] buildings, but significant economic growth after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and increasingly intensive use of urban land encouraged the development of taller buildings beginning in the 1870s. Technological improvements enabled the construction of [[Fireproofing|fireproofed]] iron-framed structures with [[deep foundation]]s, equipped with new inventions such as the [[elevator]] and [[electric lighting]]. These made it both technically and commercially viable to build a new class of taller buildings, the first of which, Chicago's {{convert|138|ft|adj=on}} tall [[Home Insurance Building]], opened in 1885. Their numbers grew rapidly, and by 1888 they were being labelled ''skyscrapers''.

Chicago initially led the way in skyscraper design, with many constructed in the center of the financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school of architecture]], these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square ''[[palazzo]]''-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than {{convert|150|ft}}, leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.

A new wave of skyscraper construction emerged in the first decade of the 20th century. The demand for new office space to hold America's expanding workforce of [[White-collar worker|white-collar staff]] continued to grow. Engineering developments made it easier to build and live in yet taller buildings. Chicago built new skyscrapers in its existing style, while New York experimented further with tower design. Iconic buildings such as the [[Flatiron Building|Flatiron]] were followed by the {{convert|612|ft|adj=on}} tall [[Singer Tower]], the {{convert|700|ft|adj=on}} [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower]] and the {{convert|792|ft|adj=on}} [[Woolworth Building]]. Though these skyscrapers were commercial successes, criticism mounted as they broke up the ordered city skyline and plunged neighboring streets and buildings into perpetual shadow. Combined with an economic downturn, this led to the [[1916 Zoning Resolution|introduction of zoning restraints]] in New York in 1916.

In the [[Interwar period|interwar years]], skyscrapers spread to nearly all major U.S. cities, while a handful were built in other Western countries. The [[Roaring Twenties|economic boom of the 1920s]] and extensive real estate speculation encouraged a wave of new skyscraper projects in New York and Chicago. New York City's 1916 Zoning Resolution helped shape the [[Art Deco]] or "[[Setback (architecture)|set-back]]" style of skyscrapers, leading to structures that focused on volume and striking silhouettes, often richly decorated. Skyscraper heights continued to grow, with the [[Chrysler Building|Chrysler]] and the [[Empire State Building]] each claiming new records, reaching {{convert|1,046|ft}} and {{convert|1250|ft}} respectively. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the real estate market collapsed, and new builds stuttered to a halt. Popular and academic culture embraced the skyscraper through films, photography, literature, and ballet, seeing the buildings as either positive symbols of modernity and science, or alternatively examples of the ills of modern life and society. Skyscraper projects after [[World War II]] typically rejected the designs of the early skyscrapers, instead embracing the [[International style (architecture)|international]] style; many older skyscrapers were redesigned to suit contemporary tastes or even demolished—such as the Singer Tower, once the world's tallest skyscraper.

==Background: 1850–79==

===Commercial and social drivers===

Early skyscrapers emerged in the U.S. as a result of economic growth, the financial organization of American businesses, and the intensive use of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York was one of the centers of early skyscraper construction and had a history as a key seaport located on the small island of [[Manhattan]], on the east coast of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of its colonial history and [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|city planning]], New York real estate was broken up into many small parcels of land, with few large sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first half of the 19th century it became the national center of American finance, and the banks in the financial district of [[Wall Street]] competed fiercely with English institutions for international dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Severini|1983|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Fire of New York|Great Fire of 1835]] destroyed most of the old financial buildings, and in their place a wide variety of new buildings were erected and demolished in quick succession during the 1840s and 1850s; traveler Philip Hone suggested that the entire city was being rebuilt every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Severini|1983|pp=39–40, 79}}; {{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most buildings adopted the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] inspired ''[[Palazzo style architecture|palazzo]]''-style of architecture popular in England, and rose no more than five or six stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Severini|1983|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York did not have any [[Height restriction laws|restrictions on the height]] of buildings, but in practice low-rise buildings were the norm, at least until 1865, with the tallest buildings being the city's churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York's population tripled between 1840 and 1870, and property values soared, increasing by more than 90 percent between 1860 and 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Downtown Chicago, 1874.jpg|thumb|left|[[Currier and Ives]]' 1874 map of Chicago shows low-rise buildings constructed after the [[Great Chicago Fire|fire of 1871]]]]

Further west, the city of Chicago became the other major site in the development of early skyscrapers. In contrast to New York, Chicago emerged as a major metropolis only in the mid-19th century, growing from a village of around fifty inhabitants in 1830, to a city of 30,000 in 1850 and nearly 300,000 by 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago became the railroad hub for the [[Western United States|American West]] and the primary trading city for the emerging territories, famous for its commercial culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronon|1992|p=68}}; {{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It saw itself as different from the cities on the east coast and was immensely proud of its status as a growing, vibrant center.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1870s, Chicago had become the main financial center for the West, but in October 1871 the [[Great Chicago Fire]] destroyed the majority of the wooden structures within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronon|1992|p=345}}; {{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was rebuilt on large plots of land in a new [[grid plan|grid network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Cronon|1992|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction in wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronon|1992|p=346}}; {{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, like New York, saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronon|1992|p=346}}; {{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of taller buildings during the 1870s was hindered by the financial [[Panic of 1873]] and the ensuing economic depression, which lasted until around 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction slowed, and property values slumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=18, 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1880, however, the recovery was well underway, with new construction in New York returning to the pace of 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the economic upturn making the construction of taller buildings an attractive financial option again, establishing many of the preconditions for the development of the skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|pp=114–115}}; {{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological developments===
{{main|Skyscraper design and construction}}
[[File:Structural design of the NY Produce Exchange.jpg|thumb|The [[2 Broadway|Produce Exchange]] of 1884 made structural advances in metal frame design.]]

The emergence of skyscrapers was made possible by technological improvements during the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these developments was the iron framed building. Masonry buildings supported their internal floors through their walls, but the taller the building, the thicker the walls had to become, particularly at the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, French engineers experimented with using built-up [[plate girder]]s made of [[wrought iron]] to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames.&lt;ref name=LandauConditPP21&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls.&lt;ref name=LandauConditPP21/&gt; The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses.&lt;ref name=LandauConditPP21/&gt;

Using these metal frames for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to increased [[wind engineering|wind pressure]].&lt;ref name=LandauConditP23&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, protective [[wind bracing]] had to be introduced, enabled by the work of [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] who produced equations for calculating the [[Structural load|loads]] and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] on larger buildings.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP23/&gt;{{refn|Despite this work on wind pressure, up until the late 1890s it was still, incorrectly, believed that wide skyscrapers did not need wind bracing.&lt;ref name="Condit 1968 125"&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special [[fireproofing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|pp=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect [[Peter Bonnett Wight|Peter Wight]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP24&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and [[Great Boston Fire of 1872|Boston in 1872]], his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taller, heavier buildings such as skyscrapers also required stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, which was in turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the [[overburden]].&lt;ref name=LandauConditPP23&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the [[bedrock]] below.&lt;ref name=LandauConditPP23/&gt; In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the [[water table]], risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP24/&gt; Special water-tight boxes called [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] were invented to deal with this problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP24/&gt;

[[File:Caissons, 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Early skyscraper [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] foundations, 1898]]

The development of the [[elevator]] was also essential to the emergence of the early skyscrapers, as office buildings taller than around six stories would have been impractical without them.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP35&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powered elevators were first installed in England during the 1830s and spread to U.S. factories and hotels by the 1840s.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP35/&gt; Elevators using hoist ropes, however, could only function effectively in low-rise buildings, and this limitation encouraged the introduction of the hydraulic elevator in 1870, even though early models contained dangerous design flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1876 these problems had been resolved, providing a solution for servicing the early skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=36–37}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New environmental technologies in heating, lighting, [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. [[Central heating]] could not be easily extended to serve larger buildings;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted in the construction of the later skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many U.S. buildings were [[gas light|lit by gas]], but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP38&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative, [[electric light]]s were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP38/&gt; Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made [[Indoor air quality|air quality]] a major health issue.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP32&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP32/&gt; Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of the skyscraper: 1880–99==

===The first skyscraper===
[[File:Home Insurance Building.JPG|thumb|Chicago's [[Home Insurance Building]] in 1884, often considered the world's first skyscraper]]
There is academic disagreement over which building should be considered the first skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in the 1780s to describe a particularly tall horse, before later being applied to the [[Sail-plan|sail at the top of a ship's mast]], tall hats and bonnets, tall men, and a ball that was hit high into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s it began to be applied to buildings, first in 1883 to describe large public monuments and then in 1889 as a label for tall office blocks, coming into widespread use over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=ix–x}}; {{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying the first "true skyscraper" is not straightforward, and various candidates exist depending on the criteria applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Post's New York [[Equitable Life Building (New York City)|Equitable Life Building]] of 1870, for example, was the first tall office building to use the elevator, while his [[2 Broadway|Produce Exchange]] building of 1884 made substantial structural advances in metal frame design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|pp=116–117}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, opened in 1885, is, however, most often labelled the first skyscraper because of its innovative use of structural steel in a metal frame design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Home Insurance Building was a {{convert|138|ft|adj=on}} tall, 10-story skyscraper designed by [[William Le Baron Jenney]], who had been trained as an engineer in France and was a leading architect in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|pp=123–124}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Sources during the period covered by this article often vary in their calculation of how many stories an early skyscraper had, depending on how they were counted and what material the writer drew on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=xiv–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Jenney's design was unusual in that it incorporated [[structural steel]] into the building's internal metal frame alongside the traditional wrought iron. This frame took the weight of the floors of the building and helped to support the weight of the external walls as well, proving an important step towards creating the genuine non-structural [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]] that became a feature of later skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was not perfect – some of the weight was still carried by masonry walls, and the metal frame was bolted, rather than [[rivet]]ed, together – but it was clearly a significant advance in tall building construction.&lt;ref name="Condit 1968 125"/&gt;

The approach quickly caught on in Chicago. In 1889 the [[Tacoma Building (Chicago)|Tacoma Building]] replaced the bolted metal design with a stronger riveted approach, and Chicago's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced interior light courts to the structural design of skyscrapers.&lt;ref name=ConditP126&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1890 [[Rand McNally Building]] became the first entirely self-supporting, steel-framed skyscraper.&lt;ref name=ConditP126/&gt; Some buildings, such as [[Rookery Building|The Rookery]] and the [[Monadnock Building]], combined elements of both the newer and older styles, but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Structural engineer]]s specializing in the steel frame design began to establish practices in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newspaper Row, 1906.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]] in New York had several early skyscrapers built for newspaper companies clustered around the [[New York City Hall|City Hall]]]]

There was a boom in skyscraper construction in Chicago from 1888 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1893, Chicago had built 12 skyscrapers between 16 and 20 stories tall, tightly clustered in the center of the financial district.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's skyscrapers, however, were constrained by the contemporary limits of steel-frame design and the muddy sub-soil in the city, which together limited most of their skyscrapers to around 16 or 17 stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's skyscrapers rapidly became tourist destinations for the views of the wider city they provided from their upper floors and as attractive sites in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists were advised to hire cabs for street tours of the skyscrapers – by lying back in the cab, they would be able to safely take in the tops of the tall buildings.&lt;ref name="Bluestone 1991 145"&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Masonic Temple (Chicago)|Masonic Temple]] was the most prominent of these skyscrapers. Built by the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] of Chicago in 1892, at a time when the Masons was a fast-growing social community, the lavish {{convert|302|ft|adj=on}} tall skyscraper had 19 stories, the bottom ten holding shops and the higher levels containing the Masons' private suites and meeting halls, some able to hold up to 1,300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolner|2005|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the top was a roof garden and observation gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolner|2005|pp=108, 113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freemasons were competing with their local rivals the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]], who intended to build a much higher skyscraper, {{convert|556|ft}} tall, that they announced would be the tallest building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolner|2005|pp=103–104, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers picked up the story, circulating facts about the size of the Temple and making comparison to historical buildings such as the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] or the [[Statue of Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolner|2005|pp=108, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Odd Fellows project failed, but the Masonic Temple capitalized on the publicity, being declared the "tallest commercial building in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolner|2005|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Despite the positive publicity at the time, the stores in the Masonic Temple had mostly failed by 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolner|2005|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

In comparison, New York trailed behind Chicago, having only four buildings over 16 stories tall by 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the delay was caused by the slowness of the city authorities to authorize metal-frame construction techniques; it was not until 1889 that they relented and allowed [[Bradford Gilbert]] to construct the [[Tower Building (New York City)|Tower Building]], an 11-story iron-framed skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; This encouraged the building of more skyscrapers in New York, although the city remained cautious about the technology for some years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1895 a breakthrough was made with the construction of the [[American Surety Building]], a twenty-story, {{convert|303|ft|adj=on}} high-steel development that broke Chicago's height record.&lt;ref name=ConditP119&gt;{{harvnb|Condit|1968|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, New York thoroughly embraced skeleton frame construction.&lt;ref name=ConditP119/&gt; In particular, New York newspaper companies adopted the skyscraper, building several along [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]], sometimes termed "Newspaper Row", in the 1880s and 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|2005|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few early skyscrapers were also constructed in Baltimore, Boston, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Rochester, and Buffalo, such as the [[Wainwright Building]], [[Wilder Building]], and [[Prudential (Guaranty) Building|Guaranty Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Revell|2005|p=43}}; refs for buildings needed.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] include the [[Old Chronicle Building]] and the [[Call Building]] in [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tobriner|2006|pp=86–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Luzon Building]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gallacci|Karabaich|2009|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural challenges===
{{main|Chicago school (architecture)|l1=Chicago School of Architecture|Architecture of New York City}}
[[File:Chicago Masonic Temple Building.jpg|thumb|Chicago's [[Masonic Temple (Chicago)|Masonic Temple Building]] depicted in 1909, showing the tripartite division of the building's exterior and the typical Chicago window bays]]
The architects of early skyscrapers faced a number of challenges. The most fashionable architectural style in the late 19th century was the French [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] movement, sometimes termed the Italian Renaissance style, which applied [[Classical architecture|Classical]] aesthetic principles to modern buildings.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP185&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; American architects trained in the Beaux-Arts style at the Parisian [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] began to return home in the 1880s, bringing these ideals and standards with them. Applying contemporary Beaux-Arts standards to early skyscrapers, however, was not straightforward. The buildings that the Beaux-Arts movement influenced were typically much shorter and broader than any skyscraper, and it was difficult to accurately reproduce the style in a tall, narrow building.&lt;ref name=LandauConditP185/&gt;

Skyscrapers were also primarily commercial buildings, and economics as well as aesthetics had to play an important part in their design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural writer Barr Ferree noted in 1893 that "current American architecture is not a matter of art, but of business. A building must pay, or there will be no investor ready with the money to meet its cost. This is at once the curse and the glory of American architecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferree|1893|p=231}} cited {{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Hill echoed the theme, condemning unnecessary features on the basis that "every cubic foot that is used for purely ornamental purposes beyond that needed to express its use and to make it harmonize with others of its class, is a waste".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1904|p=313}} cited {{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s, Chicago architects were producing a solution to this problem, creating a new architectural style, often termed the "Chicago school of architecture".&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 11"&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Although often being referred to as the "Chicago school of architecture" it is unclear if there was an organised body of architectural thought in Chicago during the period and the views of individual architects varied on many issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|pp=105–106}}; {{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The school included architects such as [[Louis Sullivan]], William Le Baron Jenney and [[John Wellborn Root|John Root]], whose designs combined architectural aesthetic theory with practical commercial sense. They favoured placing rich, ornate designs on the outside of skyscrapers at the ground level and simpler, plainer ornamentation on the upper levels, with strong vertical lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|pp=143–144}}; {{harvnb|Bragdon|2003|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roofs of their skyscrapers typically formed a comprehensible outline and structure when seen at a distance as part of the city skyline. The intent was to draw the observer's eye upwards, celebrating what Sullivan termed the "lofty" nature of the skyscraper, but not wasting resources on intricate detailing unlikely to appeal to a busy businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|pp=143–144}}; {{harvnb|Bragdon|2003|p=158}}; Root, p.71, cited {{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the more lavish ground floor designs would make the building stand out to passers-by and pull in the necessary business for a successful commercial building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New York Times Building 41 Park Row from north.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New York Times Building (41 Park Row)|New York Times Building]] in 2012, showing the multitude of different styles on a single façade typical of the city's early skyscrapers]]
This community also saw close collaboration between architects, specialist structural engineers, and building contractors emerge on the new skyscraper projects.&lt;ref name="Fenske 2005 21"&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the industry had been dominated by individuals and small firms who combined the roles of architect and engineer, but this broke down in Chicago during the period, being replaced by a partnership between specialist architects who focused on the appearance of the skyscraper, and specialist engineers who focused on the structures that enabled it to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago architectural firms grew to be large, hierarchical and with numerous specialist staff; the [[D. H. Burnham &amp; Company]], for example, felt like a small factory to visitors, and ultimately expanded to employ 180 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school]] produced large, solid-looking skyscrapers, built with a common appearance and to a common height.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 11"/&gt; The result was usually a box-like ''palazzo'', illuminated with a large light court, ideally, if space allowed, in the center.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 23"&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts: a base, middle section and the roof line. This tripartite design was intended both to emulate classical columns, and reflect the functions of the different parts of the skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central court could form a simple courtyard, but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] for shops and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rents for these shops were up to five or six times that for office space, and made an important difference to the income from a property.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 58"&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style; these were large, fixed windows flanked by smaller [[sash window]]s on either side, which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation. Sometimes these protruded from the building to form a slight bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the exterior of the Chicago skyscrapers buildings were relatively plain, the entrance ways and lobbies were fitted out in a grand style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unity Building (Chicago)|Unity Building]], for example, was reported as including "Numidian, Alps, Green and Sienna marbles&amp;nbsp;... an artistic screen of glass and bronze&amp;nbsp;... a marble balcony" alongside "Corinthian columns with finely carved capitals, gold-leaf and silver chandeliers, and silver-plated latticework" on the elevators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flinn|1893|p=197}} cited {{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=119}}; {{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to project a sense of prosperity and solid financial credentials, which in turn would attract tenants willing to pay high rents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the tenants, such surroundings were good for their own business credibility and affirmed their own social status as professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|pp=123–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York faced similar architectural challenges, but in comparison to Chicago, skyscraper architects worked less closely with engineers and other specialists, and instead held strong backgrounds in the Beaux Arts movement and perceived their role to be primarily artistic rather than a partnership with the mechanical arts.&lt;ref name="Fenske 2005 21"/&gt; Their practices tended to be smaller, resembling ''atelier'' style workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural engineers in New York took longer to build up a strong professional role there, a trend reflected in the lower engineering quality of many early skyscrapers in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York style emphasized stunning height and a somewhat eclectic use of architectural features from other periods, creating an energetic, flamboyant appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=11–12}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towers were common, making best use of the relatively small plots of land in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=23, 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some New York skyscrapers emulated the tripartite style of Chicago, but others broke their exterior down into many different layers, each with its own style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argued that this reintroduced a sense of human proportion to these tall buildings; critics felt that the results were confusing and ungainly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in early skyscrapers===
[[File:Plan of Chicago Stock Exchange.png|thumb|250px|Plan of a typical level of the [[Chicago Stock Exchange|Chicago Stock Exchange Building]], 1893; A – court; B – hall; C – toilet; D – barbershop; E – vents; F – [[flue]]; G – office, {{convert|12|ft}} by {{convert|19|ft}}]]
Early skyscrapers were mainly made up of small office cubicles, commonly only {{convert|12|ft}} across, which were placed adjacent to one another along long corridors, following a pattern first invented in the [[Oriel Chambers]] building in England in 1864.&lt;ref name=FordP24&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the average small company to rent a small amount of space using one or two offices, but held out the option for future expansion by renting additional office cubicles if required at a later date.&lt;ref name=FordP24/&gt; A skyscraper office relied on natural sunlight from the windows but if necessary was dimly lit from electric desk-top lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the standards of the day, these offices were very modern, with radiators, air vents, and the latest fixtures and fittings, and modern communication systems, including telephone and [[pneumatic tube]]s were often installed.&lt;ref name=BluestonePP128&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|pp=128, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many businesses chose to move out of their older, low-rise offices in Chicago to take up tenancy in the new skyscrapers, which were felt to be more convenient and healthier.&lt;ref name=BluestonePP128/&gt;

The first skyscrapers were mainly occupied by male workers, but this changed during the 1890s, with female employees becoming more common. The percentage of female clerical workers in Chicago, for example, increased from 11 percent in 1880 to 21 percent by 1890, reaching 30 percent by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|2005|pp=64–65, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various moral concerns were raised about men and women mixing in such offices, which were characterized as being masculine spaces, full of tobacco smoke and profanity and therefore unsuitable for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|2005|pp=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new female workers typically worked as typists or [[stenographer]]s, using the recently invented [[typewriter]], which grew in number in U.S. offices from 146 in 1879 to 65,000 by 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|2005|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skyscrapers provided a wide range of in-house services for their tenants, including shops, restaurants, barbers, tobacconists, newsagents, tailors, professional specialists and libraries.&lt;ref name=BluestoneP141&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skyscrapers also employed a substantial number of service staff to maintain and support them; a building such as the Chicago Board of Trade spent 20 percent of its rental revenue on service staff, employing 41 people, including janitors, elevator operators, engineers, and an electrician.&lt;ref name=BluestoneP141/&gt; With this collection of services and facilities, skyscrapers of the period were often referred to as small cities in their own right.&lt;ref name="Bluestone 1991 145"/&gt;

===Criticism and reform in Chicago===

Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers began to grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s.&lt;ref name=BluestoneP150&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the development of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses, and this sentiment strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|pp=5, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings in the center of the city was causing huge congestion, and each new skyscraper was also burning additional coal to power its facilities, together consuming a total of over one million tons each year, leaving smoke and stagnant air hanging over Chicago.&lt;ref name=BluestoneP150/&gt; Many were concerned over the risk of a major fire breaking out and spreading, uncontrolled, from building to building.&lt;ref name=BluestoneP150/&gt;

Chicago was not alone in having concerns over the growth of the skyscraper. In Boston, the Fiske and the [[Ames Building]]s were built in the late 1880s, {{convert|183|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|190|ft}} tall respectively, but protests by local civic campaigners and the real estate industry resulted in the city passing a law to limit new buildings to a maximum of {{convert|123|ft}}, effectively banning the construction of skyscrapers.&lt;ref name=RevellP43&gt;{{harvnb|Revell|2005|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. similarly introduced [[height restriction laws]] to limit skyscraper construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decisive factor in favor of change in Chicago, however, was the economic slowdown in the early 1890s, which gave way to the financial [[panic of 1893]].&lt;ref name=BluestonsP150WillisP9&gt;{{harvnb|Bluestone|1991|p=150}}; {{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recession, combined with the frantic building of the previous few years, meant that Chicago suddenly had a significant surplus of office space, threatening occupancy levels and rents.&lt;ref name=BluestonsP150WillisP9/&gt; Regulation was introduced by the city council to control the problem in 1892, with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and shore up their diminishing profit margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of new buildings was limited to {{convert|150|ft}}, with lower height levels on narrower streets, effectively curtailing the construction of any taller skyscrapers.&lt;ref name=BluestonsP150WillisP9/&gt;

The early years of the 20th century saw a range of technically sophisticated, architecturally confident skyscrapers built in New York; academics Sarah Landau and Carl Condit term this "the first great age" of skyscraper building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=298, 395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were relatively conservative buildings in a classical style, such as the Mutual Life, [[Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company|Atlantic Mutual]], and [[Broad Exchange Building]]s, all designed by [[Clinton and Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=288–399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others broke new ground, including the [[Flatiron Building]] which opened in 1903 near Madison Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago firm of Daniel Hudsdon Burnham designed the {{convert|307|ft}} high, 21 story structure; the unusually shaped, narrow building needed particularly strong wind bracing, while the facade was richly textured and incorporated stylistic features more common in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical and popular success, the Flatiron was likened to the [[Parthenon]] of Ancient Greece and became a New York icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=302–304}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the [[Singer Tower]] was announced by the company in 1906, who intended to produce the tallest skyscraper in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=354–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company already had several low-rise buildings in New York that the tower would be incorporated into and planned to rent out the bottom half of the tower to tenants to subsidize their use of the upper half.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skyscraper was designed by [[Ernest Flagg]], a Beaux-Arts advocate and noted critic of existing skyscrapers, who justified taking on the project as a way of generating support for skyscraper reform.&lt;ref name="Fenske 2005 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was technically challenging: the tall, narrow tower needed special wind bracing, and the deep bedrock on the site required particularly deep foundations.&lt;ref name="Landau 1996 357"&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was faced in dark brick and followed the Beaux-Arts style used by the rest of the complex, with a galleried lobby fitted out in Italian marble.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=359–361}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it opened in 1908, it had 47 stories and was {{convert|612|ft}} tall; visitors paid $0.50 ($12 in 2010 terms) each to use the observation area at the top of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woolworth Building and City Hall Park, New York City 1910s retouched.png|thumb|300px|left|Color postcard of "The [[Woolworth Building]] and [[New York City Hall|City Hall Park]], New York City" around 1913, when it was the world's-tallest building]]

The [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower]] was opened in 1909, the culmination of a long building project by [[Napoleon LeBrun|N. LeBrun and Sons]] to hold Metropolitan Life's growing headquarters staff, 2,800 strong by 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moudry|2005b|pp=120–125}}; {{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|700|ft}} high and with 50 stories, it became the world's new tallest building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moudry|2005b|pp=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Life intended the skyscraper to promote the company's image, and the building was surrounded by publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moudry|2005b|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was featured on the front of prominent magazines such as ''[[Scientific American]]'', as well as on the sides of [[corn flake]] boxes, coffee packets, and cars.&lt;ref name=MoudryPP126&gt;{{harvnb|Moudry|2005b|pp=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Metropolitan Life valued the free publicity surrounding its skyscraper building at over $440,000 ($198 million in 2010 terms).&lt;ref name=MoudryPP126/&gt;|group=nb}} The tower was loosely modeled on the Venician [[St Mark's Campanile]], and featured extensive [[Renaissance architecture|Early Renaissance]]-style detailing, with the more modern additions of huge clock faces, electric floodlights for night-time illumination, and an observation deck at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moudry|2005b|p=125}}; {{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=361, 364–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary architects Everett Waid and Harvey Corbett described how the building had "the latest ideas in ventilation, air conditioning, sound deadening, artificial lighting, intercommunicating pneumatic tubes, telephones, call bells, unit operating clock systems [and] special elevator and escalator installations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waid|Corbett|2003|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design won critical acclaim within the American architectural profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=366–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the [[Woolworth Building]] was announced in 1910 by [[Frank Winfield Woolworth|Frank Woolworth]], who wanted to create the largest income-producing property in the U.S.&lt;ref name=LandauConditPP381&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=381–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project grew, and Woolworth finally opted for a 55-story, {{convert|792|ft|adj=on}} high skyscraper, the latest tallest building in the world, at a cost of $13.5 million ($5.1 billion in 2010 terms).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=381–382}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Prices in this article are given in US dollars throughout. Equivalent modern prices have been given in 2010 US dollars to two significant figures. The equivalent prices of modern goods and services – such as entry costs to skyscrapers – have been calculated using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

It was capped by a gilded tower that blended into the sky behind it to produce an illusion of even greater height.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|pp=20. 29}}; {{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=384, 387}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was illuminated with floodlights at night, topped with red and white flashing lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was famously dubbed the "Cathedral of Commerce", rather to Gilbert's displeasure as he had attempted to avoid copying ecclesiastical architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=382, 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Chicago's skyscraper industry also boomed during the decade before [[World War I]]. The city's [[Chicago 'L'|elevated train network]] was operating by 1910, allowing more workers to come into the centre.&lt;ref name=FineP66&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|2005|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 alone {{convert|1500000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} of new offices were opened and by the end of the decade, Chicago had the second largest number of headquarters offices in the U.S.&lt;ref name=FineP66/&gt; Chicago architectural firms such as Daniel H. Burnham and then [[Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White]] continued to design skyscrapers in the ''palazzo'' style made popular in the previous decade.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 58"/&gt; Chicago had hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893, a massive international event which had excited interest in the themes of classical architecture and well-designed city landscapes.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 59"&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago also had extensive discussions in 1909 about the potential for designing large parts of the city, the [[Burnham Plan of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 59"/&gt;

The resulting skyscrapers reflected these debates: the [[Santa Fe Building (Chicago)|Railway Exchange]], the [[Peoples Gas Building|Peoples Gas]] and the [[Continental Illinois|Illinois Continental and Commercial Bank Buildings]] were each substantial, quarter-block wide ''palazzo'' cubes of common height, their facades divided into a classical tripartite design, and sporting classical columns and other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent uniformity of design, individual buildings varied considerably in the detail of their designs in effort to express their particular identities, the Peoples Gas Building using texture and the Railway Exchange Building's white terracotta, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bruegmann|1997|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvements in construction===
[[File:Typical floor of the Flatiron Building.jpg|thumb|250px|Typical floor of the [[Flatiron Building]]]]
The process of building skyscrapers became more sophisticated, starting with the acquisition of the real estate needed for the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=160–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brokers working on commission would secretly acquire the individual lots of land required for a project, operating under a variety of names to avoid having the price increase once a planned build became known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The properties at the front of the site would typically be bought first, so if news broke of the skyscraper then those owning property at the back of the plot would have little choice but to sell anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding for skyscraper developments was normally lent by banks, insurance companies, or raised through [[Corporate bond|bonds]] sold through a specialised bond house, with the latter becoming increasingly popular after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts were made to improve the processes for erecting skyscrapers, largely through the work of general contractors such as Louis Horowitz and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]], who in turn drew on recent work by efficiency specialist [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time schedules were devised for all the work to be undertaken, with costs carefully monitored and reports produced each day.&lt;ref name=FenskeP33&gt;{{harvnb|Fenske|2005|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were demonstrated on the Woolworth Building construction project, where {{convert|1153|t|kg}} of steel were assembled in only six days, a record for the period.&lt;ref name=FenskeP33/&gt; Improved windbracing techniques were introduced.&lt;ref name="Landau 1996 357"/&gt; The use of pneumatic [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] in skyscraper foundations grew more advanced; in the construction of the 1908 [[Manhattan Municipal Building]] they were successfully sunk {{convert|144|ft}} below the surface, with specially conditioned workers operating in shifts with constant medical support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=373–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies were also introduced within the buildings. Fast [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis]] elevators, powered by electricity rather than steam-driven hydraulics, began to be installed in skyscrapers, with Ellithorpe safety air cushions protecting the passengers in the case of failure.&lt;ref name="Landau 1996 386"/&gt; Lighting improved, with the recommended levels in 1916 being around twice the level of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, skyscrapers still relied primarily on natural sunlight, which required installing large windows and having tall ceilings to allow the sunlight to penetrate the back of the offices; an office deeper than {{convert|28|ft}} was not considered a practical design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in the skyscrapers===
[[File:Met Life Acturial Office, 1910.jpg|thumb|left|Working conditions in the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower]], 1910]]

One of the reasons for the increase in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S. firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldin|Katz|2008|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the [[adding machine]], the telephone and filing cabinets, all adding to the demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldin|Katz|2008|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenants and rental income were essential to the financial success of any skyscraper, as even the largest skyscrapers and those founded by prominent companies rented out much of their office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners could charge significantly more for office space close to the main windows, making it most efficient to build skyscrapers with as much premium office space as possible, even if this cost slightly more to construct in the first instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a standard pattern for office units in both New York and Chicago emerged, with either a single rectangular office adjoining an exterior wall, or a "T" shaped design, with a reception room giving way to two windowed offices, separated by glass partitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skyscrapers usually took on large numbers of relatively small companies as their tenants. A skyscraper such as the Woolworth Tower had around 600 different tenants in 1913, for example, while a typical tenant might rent four or five office units in a skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=28–29, 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism ===
[[File:Stieglitz-NewYorkOldNew.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s 1910 work ''Old and New New York'', showing the Vanderbilt Hotel under construction]]

Skyscrapers, particularly those in New York, attracted considerable comment, much of it negative. On his return to New York, writer [[Henry James]] condemned the buildings in ''The American Scene'' as simply "giants of the mere market", "mercenary monsters" doomed to be torn down in turn as other, even larger, buildings took their place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Bragdon|2003|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicago the combination of the environmental pollution and skyscrapers meant that, as Charles Warner complained, "one can scarcely see across the streets on a damp day, and the huge buildings loom up in the black sky in ghostly dimness".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronon|1992|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider artistic sentiments varied. Many, like, [[Alfred Stieglitz]] harboured mixed feelings over New York's skyscrapers, reflected in his famous 1903 portrait of the [[Flatiron building]], and his 1910 work ''Old and New New York'' that contrasts the growing steel frame of the emerging Vanderbilt Hotel with the old low-rise blocks of the street below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poets also wrote about the issues, the [[Modernist poetry|early Modernist]] [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] describing how "from the city's stir and madd'ning roar" the Flatiron's "monstrous shape soars in massive flight".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[Alvin Langdon Coburn|Alvin Coburn]] and [[John Marin]] experimented with producing portraits of New York's skyscrapers, capturing the positive and negative aspects of the modern structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|pp=46–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 artist Harry Pettit produced a romantic interpretation of a future New York, filled with giant skyscrapers supporting aerial bridges and receiving dirigibles from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the architectural community, the Exposition in Chicago inspired many in America to champion planning cities that had a unified design, in which each building had unique features but elegantly complemented its neighbours, typically by being built to a common height: "horizontal visual unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Revell|2005|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the Exposition, many of these advocates joined with the Beaux-Arts movement to form the [[City Beautiful movement]], proposing low-rise cities with wide boulevards, built in a classical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Revell|2005|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics condemned New York's skyscrapers, [[Montgomery Schuyler]] describing how they had produced a "horribly jagged sierra" of a city skyline and complaining that no modern skyscraper had turned out to be an architectural success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schuyler|1961|p=443}} cited {{harvnb|Revell|2005|p=39}}; {{harvnb|Revell|2005|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rollinson Lamb|Charles Lamb]] argued that the skyscraper impinged on the rights of the rest of the city by destroying the collective appearance of an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamb|1898|p=57}} cited {{harvnb|Revell|2005|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some architects, such as [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] and [[Stanford White]] refused to work on such projects altogether.&lt;ref name="Fenske 2005 22"/&gt;

===Reform in New York===

Calls were made in New York for legislation to prevent the growth of skyscrapers, citing their effect on the city skylines, but these attempts faced legal obstacles. The [[United States Constitution]] did not give local government authority to prevent the buildings on the grounds of aesthetics alone, and any such law in New York was considered likely to face judicial challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Revell|2005|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argued that legal reform of skyscraper construction was needed for public health and safety reasons, an area in which U.S. law was normally more supportive of state intervention.&lt;ref name=RevellP43/&gt; The risk of fire was one concern; while skyscrapers might be relatively fireproof, their height made conventional fire-fighting difficult. Architect Charles Bragdon considered a large scale, devastating high-rise fire to be inevitable if regulation was not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bragdon|2003|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Baltimore Fire|Baltimore fire of 1904]] was widely cited as an example of this risk and, although Baltimore had few high rise buildings, city lawyers argued that the taller buildings had caused the flames to spread through the city during the blaze.&lt;ref name=RevellP43/&gt; Baltimore subsequently passed a law in 1904, banning buildings higher than {{convert|70|ft}}.&lt;ref name=RevellP43/&gt; Other campaigners argued that skyscrapers were compromising access to light and air, noting that when tall buildings rose straight up from the sidewalk, they cast long shadows across the street, preventing healthy sunlight from reaching smaller buildings below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|pp=393–395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Equitable Building.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]] in 2011, showing the effect of pre-zoning skyscrapers when seen from the sidewalk]]
Early attempts by [[Ernest Flagg]] to limit the height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry.&lt;ref name=WillisP68&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1913, however, the property market in New York entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise.&lt;ref name=WillisP68/&gt; The campaign for change was helped by the construction of the [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]] in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views cast neighbours into permanent shade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=69}}; {{harvnb|American Art Publishing|1918|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]] was passed.&lt;ref name=WillisP68/&gt;

The details of the legislation were largely the work of architect George Ford. Ford had sympathies with the City Beautiful movement, disliked the unimaginative form of many New York skyscrapers, and had concerns over urban public health, but he also found tall buildings exciting and believed that horizontal visual unity produced boring architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Revell|2005|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of Ford's influence, New York's laws were relatively complex and divided up the city into different zones; in each zone, a particular [[Zoning in the United States|zoning envelope]] applied, controlling the height to which buildings could be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=67}}; {{harvnb|Revell|2005|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a building could only rise up from the sidewalk vertically by around {{convert|100|ft}}, after which the building had to be [[setback (architecture)|set back]] at a set angle to allow sunlight to reach the street below.&lt;ref name=WillisP67&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a quarter of the site, however, the owner could build as high as they wished, without any further restrictions.&lt;ref name=WillisP67/&gt;

==Inter-war period, boom and depression: 1920–39==

===Post-war boom===
[[File:Kavanagh building.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Kavanagh Building]], Buenos Aires, in 2009]]
A real estate boom occurred in the U.S. after the end of the First World War, with a particular surge in the construction of new skyscrapers between 1925 and 1931.&lt;ref name="Schleier 1986 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, a quarter of the financial district was rebuilt between 1928 and 1931, with {{convert|17000000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} of new office space added between 1925 and 1929 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=165}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicago, limited wartime construction created supply shortages, and rent levels rose in response by around 100 percent between 1919 and 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of potential profits encouraged an explosion of new building projects in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom inflated prices in the real estate market, leading to speculative financing and building projects, including the introduction of 100 percent mortgages for new builds. An early edition of the ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine commented wryly that "all a man needs to own a skyscraper is the money and the land. And he may be able to get along without the money."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=109–110, 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skyscrapers continued to grow in height throughout the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=41, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part this was the result of improvements in technology: steel-frame structures had become increasingly efficient, while improvements in elevator design made taller buildings easier to ascend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=41–42}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial factors were at work too, as growing commercial demand pushed up rents, enabling taller projects, while the higher offices attracted more sunlight, permitting the charging of premium rents.&lt;ref name=WillisPP42&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners, in turn making it easier to find and keep the best tenants.&lt;ref name=WillisPP42/&gt; Furthermore, the higher the cost of the underlying real estate, the taller a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment, and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Clark|Kingston|1930}}, cited {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70 story skyscrapers became relatively common, although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best rate of return on a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high, returning an annual profit of 10.25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skyscrapers continued to spread both across the U.S. and internationally. New York and Chicago remained the center of skyscraper development, but most major cities in the U.S. had built skyscrapers by 1929, frequently as a result of competition between rival cities for status and investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cincinnati]] built the Cincinnati Towers in 1914, followed by the [[Carew Tower|Carew Tower Complex]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="Ford 2005 36–37, 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|2005|pp=36–37, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Detroit]], the [[Cadillac Place|General Motors Building]] opened in 1920 and the [[Fisher Building]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="Douglas 1996 85"&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|1996|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cleveland]] acquired the [[Huntington Bank Building|Union Trust Building]] in 1923 and the [[Terminal Tower]] in 1929; the latter, built by the [[Van Sweringen brothers]], was, for a short period, the second tallest building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|1996|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seattle]] had built [[Smith Tower]] in 1914, and the [[Los Angeles]] local government granted itself an exemption from city planning restrictions in order to build the [[Los Angeles City Hall]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="Ford 2005 36–37, 39"/&gt; Also in 1928, the [[Industrial Trust Tower]] was built in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Trust Company, Providence|url=http://www.ricurrency.com/bank-name/industrial-trust-company-providence/|publisher=RI Currency|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skyscrapers were also built in other developed countries, although reaching nowhere near the level of construction seen in the U.S.&lt;ref name=GoldbergerP51&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was partially the result of a lack of funding but also because of local architectural preferences.&lt;ref name=GoldbergerP51/&gt; European cities including London and Paris had laws to ban tall buildings, but elsewhere skyscrapers began to appear, including [[Toronto]]'s [[Commerce Court|Imperial Bank of Commerce Building]], [[Antwerp]]'s [[Boerentoren]] and [[Buenos Aires]]' [[Kavanagh Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1991|p=157}}; {{harvnb|Binder|2006|p=64}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Walter|1993|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other European skyscrapers were proposed in a frenzy of excited planning, although few materialised.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomonson|2001|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet Russia began the construction of the {{convert|1365|ft|adj=on}} [[Palace of the Soviets]] in the late 1930s, in the [[Stalinist architecture|Socialist Classicism]] style, which would have become the tallest building in the world, but war intervened and the skyscraper was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Binder|2006|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war years, this style resulted in the monumental [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters of Moscow]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paperny|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology used in constructing skyscrapers continued to develop. Time was increasingly a factor in the projects, and architects and their specialist teams developed faster ways to design and construct the buildings to minimise the interest payments during construction and hasten the arrival of rental income.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|pp=44–45, 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, skyscrapers were being erected in just 12 months by teams of workers totalling 5,000 men, with four floors being assembled in a typical week.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building skyscraper towers involved some adaption of engineering techniques, as effectively two different buildings were being designed – the base and the tower – which needed to be efficiently linked using elevators and other service facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most new offices settled around a standard size, {{convert|9|ft}} wide by {{convert|20|to|30|ft|abbr=on}} deep, depending on the height of the ceiling, with multiple small windows considered better than a few larger ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=81}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The output of electric lighting continued to improve, although this began to give off excessive heat within the offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air conditioning was first installed in a few skyscrapers during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art Deco skyscrapers and New York's set-back style===
[[File:40 Wall Street IMG 9048.JPG|thumb|The [[40 Wall Street|Bank of Manhattan Trust Building]] in 2010, showing the setback style]]
During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were designed in an [[Art Deco]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watkin|2005|p=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The definition of architectural styles is usually imprecise. "Art Deco" was often termed "moderne" during the 1920s, and historians such as Daniel Abramson draw further contrast between styles during the period that stressed traditional, often [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] features; classic Art Deco styles; and more minimalist versions towards the end of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|pp=96–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an "aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass" with the use of rich colour and ornamentation on the surfaces of the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=114}}; {{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to call attention to the increasingly complex three-dimensional shape of the skyscraper, in contrast to earlier styles which could be critiqued, as historian Larry Ford suggests, as being merely "short buildings made taller with additional stories".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=37}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows were de-emphasised in favour of creating a strong sense of shape and mass, the surrounding walls treated as textured fabric, dressing the building underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2003|p=259}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skyscrapers of this period typically lost their ornamental horizontal divisions, being broken up by physical changes in their shape as one looked up the building, the whole forming a striking silhouette.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=102}}; {{harvnb|Shepherd|2003|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, the 1916 act to allow light and air to reach the streets encouraged a stepped or [[ziggurat]] approach to skyscraper design; this "set-back" style often made unrestricted use of the 25 percent of the site allowed by law to complete with a very tall tower.&lt;ref name="WillisP67"/&gt; This encouraged a diversity of buildings, while maintaining an element of harmony and consistency of style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Revell|2005|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paramount Building]] and [[120 Wall Street]], for example, were constructed in the set-back style without towers, partially because the limited size of the sites would have made the towers relatively narrow and – when packed with the necessary elevators and service facilities – economically unviable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=72–73, 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other skyscrapers built on larger or more expensive plots opted for the tallest towers possible, including the $24 million ($3.8 billion in 2010 terms) [[Bank of Manhattan Trust Building]] and the [[City Bank-Farmers Trust Company Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=72–73}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York continued its lead in tall skyscrapers throughout the period; in 1920 it had ten times the number of tall buildings than its nearest rival Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some New York skyscrapers complemented traditional, cubicle offices linked by corridors, with larger, more open-plan spaces called "general offices".&lt;ref name=AbramsonP2001&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; These maximised the number of workers that could be fitted into a given space and provided for greater flexibility.&lt;ref name=AbramsonP2001/&gt; Expensive corporate suites were also created during the 1930s, especially on Wall Street, typically on the highest levels of the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were used by the corporate executives and were usually lavishly outfitted in a range of traditional and exotic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|pp=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lobbies of these skyscrapers remained grand affairs, although some banks now eschewed renting out space to shops and restaurants in favour of a more exclusive atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|pp=140–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest skyscrapers held up to 16,000 workers, although between 5,000 and 10,000 was more common, and the buildings held a wide range of services to support them, including beauty salons, private luncheon clubs, chiropodists and gymnasiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; A skyscraper such as the [[70 Pine Street|Cities Service Building]] directly employed over 200 staff to manage and protect the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology within the offices also grew still more sophisticated, with [[Dictation machine|dictating]], automatic typing and [[tabulating machine]]s being used by teams of ever more specialised office workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldin|Katz|2008|pp=173–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In 1895, there were 15 well-defined roles in U.S. offices, with generalised labels such as clerks, office boys and bookkeepers; by 1922 increased specialisation meant that this had risen to 22, and by 1940 over a hundred distinct roles existed, including accountants, auditors, payroll clerks, stenographers, receptionists, machine operators and file clerks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldin|Katz|2008|p=174}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

===Chicago's towers===
[[File:Chicago 29 Oct116.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tribune Tower]] was one of the most famous buildings of the 1920s.]]
Chicago altered its laws in the 1920s to allow towers to be built as part of its skyscrapers. In 1920, the maximum building height in Chicago was increased to {{convert|260|ft}}, and unoccupied structures on a building, such as ornamental towers, were allowed to extend up to {{convert|400|ft}} high.&lt;ref name=WillisP111&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional changes came in 1923, with taller occupied towers being permitted for the first time, but subject to controls on overall volumes.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 23"/&gt; The main building of a skyscraper could be up to {{convert|264|ft}} tall, and a tower could be built on up to 25 percent of the lot, but the tower could not have a volume of more than a sixth of the main block.&lt;ref name=WillisP111/&gt; In practice, this meant that a tower could not be built more than around 20 stories tall in a typical Chicago skyscraper development.&lt;ref name=WillisP111/&gt;

Initially, Chicago still preferred ''palazzo''-styled buildings with large light courts in the centre, because they remained the most profitable designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=49, 111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wrigley Building]], built under the 1920 law, demonstrated the effect of two ornamental towers on top of a skyscraper.&lt;ref name=WillisP111/&gt; Under the revised law, the [[Metropolitan Tower (Chicago)|Straus Building]] and the [[Pittsfield Building]] took the ''palazzo'' design and added somewhat stunted towers on top in the early 1920s, producing profitable buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=112–113, 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the period's most famous buildings, the [[Tribune Tower]], emerged from a [[architectural design competition|competition]] held by the [[Tribune Company]] in 1922 to celebrate its 75th anniversary.&lt;ref name="Solomonson 2005 147"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomonson|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper was one of the largest in the world and used the competition, in which members of the public were invited to influence the design of the skyscraper, to build a loyal following amongst its readership and generate free publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomonson|2005|pp=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final design was determined by a competition panel largely made up of the company's appointees, who chose [[John Mead Howells|John Howells]] and [[Raymond Hood]]'s tower design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomonson|2005|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting tower was a conservative, Gothic design and controversy about the decision broke out almost immediately: Louis Sullivan and many others criticized Howells and Hood's design as being derivative of the Woolworth Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Solomonson|2005|p=158}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of its critics, the Tribune received as many as 20,000 visitors to its observation gallery when it opened in 1925.&lt;ref name="Solomonson 2005 147"/&gt; The unbuilt [[Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower design|second-place entry in the competition]], a more simplified stepped-back design by [[Eliel Saarinen]], also proved highly influential.&lt;ref name="Solomonson 2005 147"/&gt;

The popularity of the older style then began to wane in favor of a greater emphasis on towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common way of building these within Chicago's laws was to build a square main block with a central service core, and then simply place a tower on the top; the more massive the main block, the taller the tower could be.&lt;ref name=WillisPP118&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trustees System Service Building]] and the Foreman State National Bank Building form good examples of this approach.&lt;ref name=WillisPP118/&gt; Alternatively, the front of the main block could be recessed, as at the [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Chicago Civic Opera Building]] or the [[LaSalle-Wacker Building]], sacrificing volume but producing the visual effect of two high wings flanking a very tall tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive New York "setback" style was not adopted in Chicago, the only example of this style being the [[Palmolive Building]] on North Michigan Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Depression===
[[File:Empire State Building by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[Empire State Building]] in 2007]]
The boom in skyscraper construction began to falter following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], with fast economic growth giving way to the slump years of the [[Great Depression]]: construction of all sorts slowed considerably.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2003 226"&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2003|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real estate market that lay behind new skyscraper builds collapsed, and the value of many properties dropped dramatically: the [[LeVeque Tower|American Insurance Union]] tower cost $8 million ($1.2 billion in 2010 terms) to build in 1927, but was valued at only $3.5 million ($900 million) by 1933; the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building defaulted on its debts in 1935 and was put on sale for just $1.2 million ($240 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Put on sale for $1.2 million, the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building was valued at less than the original cost of its elevators. Skyscraper values during the Depression years should be seen against a context of [[deflation]] and a shrinking economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The major bond house of S.W. Straus, behind many successful developments, defaulted on the $214 million ($47 billion) in bonds held by 60,000 investors; the Van Swerigan developer brothers went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacancy rates began to increase as the recession bit, increasing from only one percent in central New York in early 1920 to 17 percent in 1931 and 25 percent by 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of the recession, some skyscrapers projects were canceled or scaled back. Plans by the Metropolitan Life company to build a 100-story skyscraper alongside their existing tower had been put forward in 1929, but were shelved in the face of the recession and public criticism of such expenditure in the economic climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moudry|2005b|pp=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the first phase of the project, known as the [[Metropolitan Life North Building|North Building]] ended up only 32 stories high in 1932 and the building, even at this height, was only fully completed in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moudry|2005b|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many other cases, projects which had already been commissioned continued through to completion. This resulted in {{convert|26000000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} of new office space being added to New York between 1931–34 even after the start of the recession, adding to the problem of underoccupancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these buildings, however, became iconic structures, pushing the limits of skyscraper height sharply upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chrysler Building]] was completed in 1930, just after the Depression began to affect the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architect [[William Van Alen]] competed with the designers of the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building to produce the tallest building in the world and famously erected the Chrysler spire in a last-minute, secret move in order to acquire the title for his own 69-story, {{convert|1046|ft|adj=on}} tall building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|pp=82–83}}; {{harvnb|Douglas|1996|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior was built of white and grey brick, but metal was used extensively to ornament it further, including gargoyles, [[nickel]]-[[Chrome plating|chrome]] eagles' heads, and a winged helmet of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|1996|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance used black granite to contrast with the nickel-chrome windows, and the foyer gave way to red marble and a mural ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of each part of the building was individualist and distinct, with even each elevator different in design.&lt;ref name="Douglas 1996 85"/&gt; A [[Chrysler]] showroom was placed on the first floor of the building and an observation deck and the exclusive "Cloud Club" on the upper levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Douglas|1996|pp=97–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rockefeller Center, December 1933.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Rockefeller Center]] at night, 1933]]
The [[Empire State Building]] originated from a 1928 project to redevelop the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] into a 50-story mixed-use development; the purchase of the site for $14 million ($2.1 billion) set a record in New York for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John J. Raskob|John Raskob]] and [[Pierre S. du Pont|Pierre du Pont]] entered into the project as financial backers, and concluded that the project would be more profitable if the site was used to build an extremely tall 80-story skyscraper instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=90–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although revised financial estimates suggested that the height should be cut back, the caché of having the world's tallest building was considerable, and instead an additional five stories were added to ensure the building, at {{convert|1050|ft}}, would be slightly taller than the Chrysler building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; An observation deck was built to attract tourists, which proved to be a valuable source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[limestone]], [[granite]], and [[aluminium]] skyscraper was specially designed to be easily erected, with standardized paneling and structural fittings, and was completed in only 18 months, opening in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=100–101}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the recession, however, it was only 25 percent occupied throughout the 1930s and ran at a loss; critics dubbed it the "Empty State Building".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=90}}; {{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rockefeller Center]] had originally been intended by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] to be a new location for the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]], but the Stock Market Crash brought an end to the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krinsky|2005|pp=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockefeller decided to develop a large office center instead, taking advantage of the low construction costs during the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krinsky|2005|pp=202–204, 208}}; {{harvnb|Ford|2005|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the center of the development was the RCA Building, heavily influenced by architect Raymond Hood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long, slab-like RCA had two distinct axes – from one side, it appeared to be a narrow tower, from the other it rose like a sheer wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was the structure highly distinctive, but it was also economically very effective. The design maximized the available light to the offices and eliminated any darker internal rooms, as the core of the building was entirely taken up with elevators and other engineering services.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took until 1940 before all of the building had been filled by tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krinsky|2005|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chicago, the final pre-war skyscraper was built in 1934.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 128–129"&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Field Building (Chicago)|Field Building]] was commissioned during the final boom years of the inter-war economy, and the Home Insurance Building – the first skyscraper, built in 1884 – was demolished to make way for the "wing and tower"-style development.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 128–129"/&gt;

===Skyscraper mania and social commentary===
[[File:Construction old and new from Washington Street 37 in Manhattan in1936 trimmed.jpg|thumb|[[Berenice Abbott]]'s depiction of changing Manhattan, 1936; Cunard Building (r)]]
Public interest in skyscrapers increased during the 1920s, particularly after the Tribune competition.&lt;ref name=SchleierP70&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition drawings were circulated on display, with 25,000 people coming to see them in Chicago in just one month.&lt;ref name=SchleierP71&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, images of skyscrapers flourished across American culture, commencing what historian Merrill Schleier dubbed a "skyscraper mania".&lt;ref name="Schleier 1986 69"/&gt; The "Titan City" exhibition in 1925 celebrated existing skyscraper and featured futuristic murals by [[Harvey Wiley Corbett|Harvey Corbett]] and [[Hugh Ferriss]], depicting the skyscraper at the heart of the "City of the Future".&lt;ref name=SchleierP70/&gt; [[Charles Sheeler]] and [[Paul Strand]]'s 1921 short film ''[[Manhatta]]'' explored the form, ending with a sunset shot from the top of a skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Janet Flanner]], [[John Dos Passos]] and [[Mary Borden]] wrote novels with skyscrapers as important motifs or settings.&lt;ref name=SchleierP71/&gt; [[John Alden Carpenter|John Carpenter]] produced a [[ballet]] on the theme.&lt;ref name=SchleierP71/&gt; [[Paul T. Frankl|Paul Frankl]] designed a range of popular "skyscraper furniture".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this commentary was positive, reflecting an optimism about technology and the direction of urban life in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skyscrapers were seen as an expression of rational engineering, the perfect buildings for mankind to live in, as celebrated in artist [[Louis Lozowick]]'s [[lithograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|pp=76–77}}; {{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other proponents of skyscrapers likened them to medieval cathedrals, symbols of the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poems depicted skyscrapers as objects of sublime, rational beauty, Ferris describing them as "buildings like crystals, walls of translucent glass, sheer glass blocks sheathing a steel grill".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Chicago's [[Century of Progress]] exposition in 1933, skyscrapers and technology were portrayed as a solution for America's current and future problems.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2003 226"/&gt; The French-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] acclaimed New York in 1935 as being "overwhelming, amazing, exciting, violently alive", but went on to complain that there were still too few skyscrapers, and those that had been built were not yet tall enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Corbusier|1947|p=45}} cited {{harvnb|Page|2005|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Hine]], employed to record the building of the Empire State Building, portrayed the skyscraper construction teams as courageous heroes, creating a genre of photography that continued up until 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their critics expressed concerns about the effect of modern technology and urban living on the human condition, arguing that skyscrapers generated pollution and noise, and imposed a regimented and dehumanising lifestyle on the people that worked in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|pp=72, 94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social commentator [[Lewis Mumford]] reflected the concerns of many in his critiques entitled ''Is the Skyscraper Tolerable?'' and ''The Intolerable City''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political theorist [[Stefan Hirsch]] condemned the buildings as "bandages covering the sky, stifling our breath".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|1986|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inventor [[Thomas Edison]] expressed fears that an uncontrolled expansion of skyscrapers would result in overcrowding and disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Howard Cook]]'s engravings critiqued the oppressive character of the new skyscrapers as they loomed over the traditional city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berenice Abbott]]'s photographic studies of New York in the 1930s explored the complex theme of urban change and the effect of skyscrapers on the older ways of life in the city, echoing Steigler's work in the first decade of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Page|2005|pp=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood used skyscrapers extensively in popular films. ''The Skyscrapers of New York'' in 1906 became the first of many, and in the 1920s [[Harold Lloyd]] produced his five "skyscraper films", most prominently ''[[Safety Last!]]'', in which the hero dangles from a clock on the side of a Los Angeles building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|2009|pp=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these early [[silent film|silent movies]], skyscrapers were closely associated with masculine identity; Lloyd's climbing of skyscrapers closely associated with his characters' transformation from young men into mature adults, and the winning of the heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleier|2009|pp=3–4, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 film [[King Kong (1933 film)|''King Kong'']] included another iconic use of the early skyscraper in its final scenes, as the giant ape scaled the Empire State Building shortly before his death; the scene can be interpreted as contrasting natural instinct with the insensitive rationality of the modern building and wider New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramirez|2004|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:90 West Street Building.jpg|thumb|The [[West Street Building]] in 1988, overshadowed by the modernist [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]]]
Skyscraper development paused during the years of the [[Second World War]]. Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s, the skyscraper entered a different phase of development, usually called the [[International style (architecture)|international]] or [[Modern architecture|modern]] period. Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the U.S. using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s, most notably the [[Loews Philadelphia Hotel|Philadelphia Savings Fund Society]] and [[330 West 42nd Street|McGraw-Hill Building]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watkin|2005|p=581}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war, their modernist themes were used in a new generation of skyscrapers. These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre's RCA building, rather than as part of a row of buildings, forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades, breaking with earlier skyscraper traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=134}}; {{harvnb|Goldberger|1985|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside, new technologies such as [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]] and widespread air-conditioning meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and operable windows were unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=132–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend had substantial implications for many early skyscrapers. Some were redesigned to fit new tastes. Much of the ornate detail was removed from the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s, for example, to fit contemporary, plainer fashions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many older skyscrapers could not be adapted, however, as they lacked the physical depth to build larger modern offices or the space for new service facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were demolished to make way for new, larger structures. Amongst these was the Singer Tower, demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, buildings such as [[90 West Street]] have been renovated as upmarket housing, partially because of their extensive windows and access to sunlight.&lt;ref name=NYT2004&gt;{{cite web| title = 9/11's Miracle Survivor Sheds Bandages: a 1907 Landmark Will be Restored for Residential Use| publisher = New York Times| author = Glenn Collins| year = 2004| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/05/nyregion/9-11-s-miracle-survivor-sheds-bandages-1907-landmark-will-be-restored-for.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm. | accessdate = September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical discussion of early skyscrapers began from the 1880s onwards in the architectural community and continued across a growing cultural and academic community in the inter-war period. In 1930, the terms the Chicago "school" and "movement" began to be used for the first time, popularised by the 1940s academics [[Sigfried Giedion]] and [[Carl W. Condit|Carl Condit]] as a label for the early Chicago architects. They regarded skyscrapers as the early forerunners of modernism and as marking a clear break with earlier architectural forms in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Bruegmann|1997|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of Chicago's skyscrapers was later challenged by [[Robert Bruegmann]] and Daniel Bluestone, who argued that it underplayed the links of the movement to pre-existing Chicago culture.&lt;ref name="Willis 1995 11"/&gt; During the 1980s and 1990s, analysis of the early skyscrapers increasingly shifted away from the architects and architecture of the individual buildings to considerations of skyscrapers' roles in the wider urban context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|2005|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Histories stressing the social, economic, and cultural dimension of skyscrapers began to be produced, with New York's skyscrapers receiving greater attention than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willis|1995|pp=7–9}}; {{harvnb|Moudry|2005a|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Landau|Condit|1996|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Skyscraper Museum]] – the first to address the theme – was founded in New York in 1997 by historian Carol Willis to preserve the history of the skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History| publisher = The Skyscraper Museum| year = 2011| url = http://www.skyscraper.org/LOCATION/HISTORY/history.htm | accessdate = September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electric motor.gif|thumb|Animation of an Electric motor.]]

An '''electric motor''' is an [[electric machine|electrical machine]] that converts [[electrical energy]] into [[mechanical energy]]. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's [[magnetic field]] and [[electrical conductor|winding currents]] to generate force in the form of [[rotation]]. Electric motors can be powered by [[direct current]] (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by [[alternating current]] (AC) sources, such as a power grid, [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]] or electrical generators. An [[electric generator]] is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in the reverse direction, accepting mechanical energy (such as from flowing water) and converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy. 

Electric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type, internal construction, application and type of motion output. In addition to AC versus DC types, motors may be [[brushed motor|brushed]] or [[brushless motor|brushless]], may be of various phase (see [[single-phase]], [[two-phase electric power|two-phase]], or [[three-phase]]), and may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled. General-purpose motors with standard dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors are found in industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches. 

In certain applications, such as in [[regenerative braking]] with [[traction motor]]s, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.

Electric motors produce linear or rotary force ([[torque]]) and can be distinguished from devices such as magnetic [[Solenoid|solenoids]] and loudspeakers that convert electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical force, which are respectively referred to as actuators and transducers.

{{main|History of the electric motor}}

===Early motors===
[[File:Faraday magnetic rotation.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Faraday's electromagnetic experiment, 1821&lt;ref name="Faraday (1822)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faraday|first=Michael|title=On Some New Electro-Magnetical Motion, and on the Theory of Magnetism|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and the Arts|year=1822|volume=XII|pages=74–96 (§IX)|url=https://archive.org/details/quarterlyjournal12jour|accessdate=12 February 2013|publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first electric motors were simple [[electrostatic motor|electrostatic]] devices described in experiments by Scottish monk [[Andrew Gordon (Benedictine)|Andrew Gordon]] and American experimenter [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the 1740s.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Tom McInally, The Sixth Scottish University.

JEFIMENKO, Electrostatic Motors, Their History, Types, and Principles of Operation, Electret Scientific Company - 1973, page 22-45&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical principle behind them, [[Ampère's force law]], was discovered by [[André-Marie Ampère]] in 1820. The law described the production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] means was demonstrated by English scientist [[Michael Faraday]] in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a [[permanent magnet|permanent magnet (PM)]] was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire.&lt;ref name="SparkMuseum (Motor)"&gt;{{cite conference|title=The Development of the Electric Motor,|url=http://www.sparkmuseum.com/MOTORS.HTM|publisher=SparkMuseum|accessdate=12 February 2013|booktitle=Early Electric Motors|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306085840/http://www.sparkmuseum.com/MOTORS.HTM|archivedate=6 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, substituting [[brine]] for (toxic) mercury. Though [[Barlow's wheel]] was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar [[homopolar motor]]s remained unsuited to practical application until late in the century.

In 1827, [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[physicist]] [[Ányos Jedlik]] started experimenting with [[electromagnetic coil]]s. After Jedlik solved the technical problems of continuous rotation with the invention of the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], he called his early devices "electromagnetic self-rotors". Although they were used only for teaching, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical [[Direct current|DC]] motors: the [[stator]], [[rotor (electric)|rotor]] and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings.&lt;ref name="Guillemin (1891)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guillemin|first=Amédée|trans-title=Electricity and Magnetism|year=1891|publisher=McMillan and Co.|title='Le Magnétisme et l'Électricitée'|others=trans., ed. &amp; rev. from the French by Sylvanus P.

===DC motors===
After many other more or less successful attempts with relatively weak rotating and reciprocating apparatus Prussian [[Moritz von Jacobi]] created the first real rotating electric motor in May 1834. It developed remarkable mechanical output power. His motor set a world record, which Jacobi improved four years later in September 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Richter |first=Jan |title=Jacobi's Motor |publisher=Elektrotechnischen Instituts. Karlsruhe Institute of Technology |date=7 February 2013|accessdate= 14 May 2017 |url=https://www.eti.kit.edu/english/1382.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512221521/http://www.eti.kit.edu/english/1382.php |archivedate=2017-05-12 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; His second motor was powerful enough to drive a boat with 14 people across a wide river. It was also in 1839/40 that other developers managed to build motors with similar and then higher performance.

The first [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] {{visible anchor|DC electric motor}} capable of turning machinery was invented by British scientist [[William Sturgeon]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=William|others=|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|chapter=Sturgeon, William (1783–1850)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/26748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor was built by American inventor [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)|Thomas Davenport]], which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press.&lt;ref name="Garrison (1998)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Ervan G.|title=A History of Engineering and Technology: Artful Methods|year=1998|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5mvVElGudyYC}}|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-9810-X|edition=2nd|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of [[battery (electricity)|primary battery power]], the motors were commercially unsuccessful and bankrupted Davenport. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors, but all encountered the same battery cost issues. No [[Electric power distribution|electricity distribution]] system was available at the time. No practical commercial market emerged for these motors.&lt;ref name="Nye (1990)"&gt;{{cite book |title=Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology |last=Nye |first=David E. |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/electrifying-america |year=1990 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-64030-5 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403044745/http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/electrifying-america |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, Jedlik built a device using similar principles to those used in his electromagnetic self-rotors that was capable of useful work.&lt;ref name="Guillemin (1891)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Electropaedia (home)" /&gt; He built a model [[electric vehicle]] that same year.&lt;ref name="Hungarianscience (Frankfurt)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition on the History of Hungarian Science|url=http://www.frankfurt.matav.hu/angol/magytud.htm|accessdate=13 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826080638/http://www.frankfurt.matav.hu/angol/magytud.htm|archivedate=26 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major turning point came in 1864, when [[Antonio Pacinotti]] first described the ring armature. This featured symmetrically-grouped coils closed upon themselves and connected to the bars of a commutator, the brushes of which delivered practically non-fluctuating current.&lt;ref name="Antonio Pacinotti"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonio Pacinotti|url=http://ethw.org/Antonio_Pacinotti|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305154622/http://ethw.org/Antonio_Pacinotti|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=w0o5Ld53wAEC|page=164}}|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180104232726/https://books.google.com/books?id=w0o5Ld53wAEC&amp;pg=PT164&amp;lpg=PT164&amp;dq=pacinotti+dc+motor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s9gxdk7Xb1&amp;sig=6bXaoWnI8s1M1SXb-cQl9KUtzLc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_-u_B75PLAhWBPpQKHTksCO8Q6AEIODAG#v=onepage&amp;q=pacinotti%20dc%20motor&amp;false|archivedate= 2018-01-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful DC motors followed the invention by [[Zénobe Gramme]] who, in 1871, reinvented Pacinotti's design. In 1873, Gramme showed that his dynamo could be used as a motor, [[:fr:Hippolyte Fontaine#1873 : l'expérience décisive|which he demonstrated to great effect at exhibitions in Vienna and Philadelphia]] by connecting two such DC motors up to 2&amp;nbsp;km from each other, using one as a generator.&lt;ref name="gamme"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/270.html|title=Zénobe Théophile Gramme|accessdate=2012-09-19|booktitle=Invent Now, Inc.

In 1886, [[Frank Julian Sprague]] invented the first practical DC motor, a non-sparking device that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads. Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by [[Thomas Edison]]), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided control systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887–88 in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently-powered centrally-controlled cars. The latter were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the [[South Side Elevated Railroad]], where it became popularly known as the "[[Chicago "L"|L]]". Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry. The development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of an air gap between the rotor and stator. Efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap.&lt;ref name="Ganot (1881)"&gt;

Electric motors revolutionized industry. Industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure. Instead, every machine could be equipped with its own power source, providing easy control at the point of use, and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible. Today, electric motors consume more than half of the electric energy produced in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/pdfs/mc-0382.pdf|title=Buying an Energy-Efficient Electric Motor - Fact Sheet|publisher=USDoE|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902144422/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/pdfs/mc-0382.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC motors===
In 1824 French physicist [[François Arago]] formulated the existence of [[rotating magnetic field]]s, termed [[Arago's rotations]], which, by manually turning switches on and off, Walter Baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive [[induction motor]].&lt;ref name="Babbage (1825)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babbage|first=C.|author2=Herschel, J.

The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]], in 1885 and 1887, respectively. In 1888, the ''Royal Academy of Science of Turin'' published Ferraris's research detailing the foundations of motor operation, while concluding that "the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor."&lt;ref name="Vuckovic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraris (1888)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferraris|first=G.|title=Atti della Reale Academia delle Science di Torino|journal=Atti della R.

In 1888, Tesla presented his paper ''A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers'' to the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE]] that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting [[reluctance motor]], another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting [[induction motor]], and the third a true [[synchronous motor]] with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding.

One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. [[George Westinghouse]] promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned [[Charles F. Scott (engineer)|C. F. Scott]] to help Tesla; however, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.&lt;ref name="Vuckovic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraris (EBE)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography of Galileo Ferraris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neidhofer (2007)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pansini (1989)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alger|first=P.L.|last2=Arnold z|first2=R.E.|title=The History of Induction Motors in America|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|year=1976|volume=64|issue=9|pages=1380–1383|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10329}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klooster (2009)"&gt;

Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb [[transformer]] in 1890.

[[Benjamin G. Lamme|B. G. Lamme]] later developed a rotating bar winding rotor.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt;

The [[General Electric Company]] began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt; By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the [[squirrel-cage rotor]].&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt; Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100-[[horsepower|horsepower (HP)]] induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897.&lt;ref name="Alger (1976)"/&gt;

==Components==
[[File:Stator and rotor by Zureks.JPG|thumb|right|Electric motor rotor (left) and stator (right)]]

===Rotor===
{{main|Rotor (electric)}}
In an electric motor, the moving part is the rotor, which turns the shaft to deliver the mechanical power. The rotor usually has conductors laid into it that carry currents, which interact with the magnetic field of the stator to generate the forces that turn the shaft. Alternatively, some rotors carry permanent magnets, and the stator holds the conductors.

===Bearings===
The rotor is supported by [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], which allow the rotor to turn on its axis.  The bearings are in turn supported by the motor housing.  The motor shaft extends through the bearings to the outside of the motor, where the load is applied.  Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be ''overhung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How belt drives impact overhung load |publisher=Gates Corporation |date=2017 |url=http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222054609/http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stator===
{{main|Stator}}
The stator is the stationary part of the motor’s electromagnetic circuit and usually consists of either windings or permanent magnets. The stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets, called laminations. Laminations are used to reduce energy losses that would result if a solid core were used.

===Air gap===
The distance between the rotor and stator is called the air gap. The air gap has important effects, and is generally as small as possible, as a large gap has a strong negative effect on performance. It is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate.  The magnetizing current increases with the air gap. For this reason, the air gap should be minimal. Very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses.

[[File:Salient-pole rotor.png|thumb|right|Salient-pole rotor]]

===Windings===
{{main|Windings}}
Windings are wires that are laid in [[electromagnetic coil|coils]], usually wrapped around a laminated soft iron [[magnetic core]] so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current.

Electric machines come in two basic magnet field pole configurations: ''salient-'' and ''nonsalient-pole'' configurations. In the salient-pole machine the pole's magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the pole face. In the ''nonsalient-pole'', or distributed field, or round-rotor, machine, the winding is distributed in pole face slots.&lt;ref name="Mortensen (1949)"&gt;{{cite book|title=§7-1 'General Picture of a Synchronous Machine' in Sec. 7 - Alternating-Current Generators and Motors|first=S. H.|last=Mortensen|last2=Beckwith |first2=S.|page=646-647, figs. 7-1 &amp; 7-2}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[shaded-pole motor]] has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.

Some motors have conductors that consist of thicker metal, such as bars or sheets of metal, usually [[copper]], alternatively [[aluminum]]. These are usually powered by [[electromagnetic induction]].

===Commutator===
{{main|Commutator (electric)}}
[[File:Tiny motor windings - commutator - brushes in Zip Zaps toy R-C car.jpg|thumb|A toy's small DC motor with its commutator]]
A [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] is a mechanism used to [[switch]] the input of most DC machines and certain AC machines. It consists of slip-ring segments insulated from each other and from the shaft. The motor's armature current is supplied through stationary [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal, and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] rotates from pole to pole.{{sfn|Hameyer|2001|p=  62}}&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, §83, p. 812&lt;/ref&gt; In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop. In light of improved technologies in the electronic-controller, sensorless-control, induction-motor, and permanent-magnet-motor fields, externally-commutated induction and [[permanent-magnet motor]]s are displacing electromechanically-commutated motors.

==Motor supply and control==

===Motor supply===
A DC motor is usually supplied through slip ring commutator as described above. AC motors' commutation can be either slip ring commutator or externally commutated type, can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous type. [[Universal motor]]s can run on either AC or DC.

===Motor control===
Fixed-speed controlled AC motors are provided with direct-on-line or soft-start starters.

Variable-speed controlled AC motors are provided with a range of different [[power inverter]], [[variable-frequency drive]] or electronic commutator technologies.

The term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated [[brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] and [[switched reluctance motor]] applications.

==Major categories==
Electric motors operate on three different physical principles: [[magnetism]], [[electrostatic motor|electrostatics]] and [[piezoelectric motor|piezoelectricity]]. By far, the most common is magnetism.

In magnetic motors, magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator. The product between these two fields gives rise to a force, and thus a torque on the motor shaft. One, or both, of these fields must be made to change with the rotation of the motor. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.

The main types are DC motors and AC motors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=

AC electric motors are either asynchronous or synchronous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=
{{google books |plainurl=y |id=ewKqDQAAQBAJ|page=6}}|title=Electric Motor Control: DC, AC, and BLDC Motors|last=Kim|first=Sang-Hoon|date=2017-05-09|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780128123195|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once started, a synchronous motor requires synchronism with the moving magnetic field's synchronous speed for all normal torque conditions.

In synchronous machines, the magnetic field must be provided by means other than induction such as from separately excited windings or permanent magnets.

A [[fractional-horsepower motor|fractional-horsepower (FHP)]] motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower (0.746&amp;nbsp;kW), or is manufactured with a standard-frame size smaller than a standard 1 HP motor. Many household and industrial motors are in the fractional-horsepower class.

==Self-commutated motor==

===Brushed DC motor===
{{main|DC motor}}
By definition, all self-commutated DC motors run on DC electric power. Most DC motors are small permanent magnet (PM) types. They contain a [[Brush (electric)|brushed]] internal mechanical commutation to reverse motor windings' current in synchronism with rotation.&lt;ref name="Weiβmantel (2008)"&gt;{{cite book|first=H|last =Weiβmantel|author2=Oesingmann, P. |author3=Möckel, A. |title=§2.1 Motors with Commutator in Chapter 2 - Motors with Continuous Rotation|pages=13–160}} in {{harvnb|Stölting|Kallenbach|Amrhein|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrically excited DC motor====
{{Main|Brushed DC electric motor}}
[[File:Electric motor cycle 2.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Workings of a brushed electric motor with a two-pole rotor and PM stator. ("N" and "S" designate polarities on the inside faces of the magnets; the outside faces have opposite polarities.)]]
A commutated DC motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.

The rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, [[soft magnetic material|magnetically "soft"]] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an [[electromagnet]]). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.

Many of the limitations of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the [[inductance]] of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their [[resistivity]], limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates [[electrical noise]]; sparking generates [[Radio frequency interference|RFI]]. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.

While most commutators are cylindrical, some are flat discs consisting of several segments (typically, at least three) mounted on an insulator.

Large brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.

DC machines are defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Dorf (1997)"&gt;{{cite conference|editor-last=Dorf|editor-first=Richard C.

* DC shunt-wound motor
* DC series-wound motor
* DC compound motor (two configurations):
** Cumulative compound
** Differentially compounded
* PM DC motor (not shown)
* Separately excited (not shown).

====Permanent magnet DC motor====
{{main|Permanent-magnet electric motor}}
A PM (permanent magnet) motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the "dynamo" type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.

To minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with [[neodymium]] or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed [[#Singly fed electric motor|singly-fed]] synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.

===Electronic commutator (EC) motor===

====Brushless DC motor====
{{Main|Brushless DC electric motor}}
Some of the problems of the brushed DC motor are eliminated in the BLDC design. In this motor, the mechanical "rotating switch" or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor's position. BLDC motors are typically 85–90% efficient or more. Efficiency for a BLDC motor of up to 96.5% have been reported,&lt;ref name="Nozawa (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nozawa|first=Tetsuo (2009)|title=Tokai University Unveils 100W DC Motor with 96% Efficiency|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|publisher=Tech-On -- Nikkei Electronics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101131311/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|archivedate=2011-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas DC motors with brushgear are typically 75–80% efficient.

The BLDC motor's characteristic trapezoidal [[counter-electromotive force]] (CEMF) waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from the placement of the rotor's permanent magnets. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside out DC motors, the stator windings of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be with single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use [[Hall effect sensor]]s mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost [[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control]] of the electronic commutator.

BLDC motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary, as in computer disk drives or in video cassette recorders, the spindles within CD, CD-ROM (etc.) drives, and mechanisms within office products, such as fans, laser printers and photocopiers. They have several advantages over conventional motors:
* Compared to AC fans using shaded-pole motors, they are very efficient, running much cooler than the equivalent AC motors. This cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fan's bearings.
* Without a commutator to wear out, the life of a BLDC motor can be significantly longer compared to a DC motor using brushes and a commutator. Commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without a commutator or brushes, a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.
* The same Hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can also provide a convenient [[tachometer]] signal for closed-loop control (servo-controlled) applications. In fans, the tachometer signal can be used to derive a "fan OK" signal as well as provide running speed feedback.
* The motor can be easily synchronized to an internal or external clock, leading to precise speed control.
* BLDC motors have no chance of sparking, unlike brushed motors, making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals and fuels. Also, sparking generates ozone, which can accumulate in poorly ventilated buildings risking harm to occupants' health.
* BLDC motors are usually used in small equipment such as computers and are generally used in fans to get rid of unwanted heat.
* They are also acoustically very quiet motors, which is an advantage if being used in equipment that is affected by vibrations.
Modern BLDC motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts. Larger BLDC motors up to about 100&amp;nbsp;kW rating are used in electric vehicles. They also find significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft.

====Switched reluctance motor====
[[File:Switched reluctance motor 6-4.svg|thumb|right|6/4 pole switched reluctance motor]]
{{Main|Switched reluctance motor}}

The SRM has no brushes or permanent magnets, and the rotor has no electric currents.
Instead, torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator.
The rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator, while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field.

The magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque. As the rotor turns, different windings will be energized, keeping the rotor turning.

SRMs are used in some appliances&lt;ref name="Bush (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush |first=Steve (2009) |title=Dyson vacuums 104,000&amp;nbsp;rpm brushless DC technology |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |publisher=Electronics Weekly Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411205153/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |archivedate=2012-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/11/tesla-model-3-motor-in-depth/|title=Tesla Model 3 Motor — Everything I've Been Able To Learn About It (Welcome To The Machine) {{!}} CleanTechnica|last=|first=|date=March 11, 2018|website=cleantechnica.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universal AC/DC motor===
{{main|Universal motor}}
[[File:Universalmotor 3.JPG|thumb|Modern low-cost universal motor, from a vacuum cleaner. Field windings are dark copper-colored, toward the back, on both sides. The rotor's laminated core is gray metallic, with dark slots for winding the coils. The commutator (partly hidden) has become dark from use; it is toward the front. The large brown molded-plastic piece in the foreground supports the brush guides and brushes (both sides), as well as the front motor bearing.]]
A commutated electrically excited series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.

Operating at normal [[utility frequency|power line frequencies]], universal motors are often found in a range less than {{nowrap|1000 watts}}. Universal motors also formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in [[Railway electrification system#Low-frequency alternating current|electric railways]]. In this application, the use of AC to power a motor originally designed to run on DC would lead to efficiency losses due to [[eddy current]] heating of their magnetic components, particularly the motor field pole-pieces that, for DC, would have used solid (un-laminated) iron and they are now rarely used.

An advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to [[TRIAC#Application|electronic speed control]] and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.

Whereas SCIMs cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency, universal motors can run at much higher speeds. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor's characteristics work well. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed {{nowrap|10,000 rpm}}, while many similar miniature grinders exceed {{nowrap|30,000 rpm}}.

==Externally commutated AC machine==
{{Main|AC motor}}

The design of AC induction and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An AC motor has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC to produce a rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.

===Induction motor===
{{Main|Induction motor}}

[[File:Elliott-Motor.jpg|thumb|Large 4,500 HP AC Induction Motor.]]

====Cage and wound rotor induction motor====
An induction motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An induction motor resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.

Induction motors may be further divided into Squirrel Cage Induction Motors and [[Wound rotor motor|Wound Rotor Induction Motors]] (WRIMs). SCIMs have a heavy winding made up of solid bars, usually aluminum or copper, joined by rings at the ends of the rotor. When one considers only the bars and rings as a whole, they are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage, hence the name.

Currents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field. The shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.

In a WRIM, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to [[slip ring]]s on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.

The WRIM is used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.

Motor speed can be changed because the torque curve of the motor is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down. If the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque will be further reduced.

When used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.

====Torque motor====
{{main|Torque motor}}
A torque motor is a specialized form of electric motor that can operate indefinitely while stalled, that is, with the rotor blocked from turning, without incurring damage. In this mode of operation, the motor will apply a steady torque to the load (hence the name).

A common application of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.

Another common application is the control of the throttle of an internal combustion [[engine]] in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle.

===Synchronous motor===
{{Main|Synchronous motor}}

A synchronous electric motor is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.

Finally, hysteresis synchronous motors typically are (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it act like a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The rotor material, like that of a common nail, will stay magnetized, but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.

Low-power synchronous timing motors (such as those for traditional electric clocks) may have multi-pole permanent magnet external cup rotors, and use shading coils to provide starting torque. ''Telechron'' clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque, and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor.

===Doubly-fed electric machine===
{{Main|Doubly-fed electric machine}}

Doubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) power to the energy conversion process, with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as [[singly-fed electric machine]]s, which have only one active winding set.

A doubly-fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components. Difficulties with controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications.&lt;ref name="Lander (1993)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Lander|first=Cyril W.|title=§9–8 'Slip Ring Induction Motor Control' in Chapter 9 - A.C.

==Special magnetic motors==

===Rotary===

====Ironless or coreless rotor motor====
[[File:Miniature Coreless DC Motor.jpg|thumb|A miniature coreless motor]]
Nothing in the principle of any of the motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the ''coreless or ironless DC motor'', a specialized form of a permanent magnet DC motor.&lt;ref name="Weiβmantel (2008)"/&gt; Optimized for rapid [[acceleration]], these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.

Because the rotor is much lighter in weight (mass) than a conventional rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations, the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical [[time constant]] under one ms. This is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper. But because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air. Overheating might be an issue for coreless DC motor designs. Modern software, such as [[Motor-CAD]], can help to increase the thermal efficiency of motors while still in the design stage.

Among these types are the disc-rotor types, described in more detail in the next section.

The [[vibrating alert]] of cellular phones is sometimes generated by tiny cylindrical permanent-magnet field types, but there are also disc-shaped types that have a thin multipolar disc field magnet, and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils. Metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils.

Related limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin permanent magnets. These are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk ("hard disk") drives. Although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers, it is still loosely (and incorrectly) referred to as a "voice coil" structure, because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines, and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker.

====Pancake or axial rotor motor====
The printed armature or pancake motor has the windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets. The magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor with space in between to form an axial air gap.&lt;ref name="Krishnan (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=R.|title=Selection Criteria for Servo Motor Drives|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications|date=March 1987|volume=IA-23|issue=2|pages=270–275|doi=10.1109/TIA.1987.4504902|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4504902&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Ddesc_p_Publication_Year%26searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3Dpancake+DC+motor|accessdate=26 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515051920/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4504902&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Ddesc_p_Publication_Year%26searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3Dpancake+DC+motor|archivedate=15 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its flat profile. The technology has had many brand names since its inception, such as ServoDisc.

The printed armature (originally formed on a printed circuit board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc. The printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in that it does not have a separate ring commutator. The brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact.

An alternative manufacturing method is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator, in a flower and petal shape. The windings are typically stabilized with electrical epoxy potting systems. These are filled epoxies that have moderate, mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180&amp;nbsp;°C, Class H rating.

The unique advantage of ironless DC motors is the absence of [[Cogging torque|cogging]] (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (&gt;40&amp;nbsp;kHz) or DC because of decreased [[electromagnetic induction]].

These motors were originally invented to drive the capstan(s) of magnetic tape drives, where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available, the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos.

Another approach (Magnax) is to use a single stator sandwiched between two rotors. One such design has produced peak power of 15 kW/kg, sustained power around 7.5 kW/kg. This yokeless axial flux motor offers a shorter flux path, keeping the magnets further from the axis. The design allows zero winding overhang; 100 percent of the windings are active. This is enhanced with the use of rectangular-section copper wire. The motors can be stacked to work in parallel. Instabilities are minimized by ensuring that the two rotor discs put equal and opposing forces onto the stator disc. The rotors are connected directly to one another via a shaft ring, cancelling out the magnetic forces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/magnax-axial-flux-electric-motor/54821|title=Magnax prepares to manufacture radically high-powered, compact axial flux electric motor|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=May 30, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnax motors range in size from {{Convert|.15-5.4|m|}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Servo motor ====
{{Main|Servo motor}}
A servomotor is a motor, very often sold as a complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor permanent magnet synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.&lt;ref name="Krishnan (1987)"/&gt;

A servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that the position feedback is continuous while the motor is running. A stepper system inherently operates open-loop - relying on the motor not to "miss steps" for short term accuracy - with any feedback such as a "home" switch or position encoder being external to the motor system.&lt;ref name="Patrick (1997)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Patrick|first=Dale R.|author2=Fardo, Stephen W.|booktitle=Rotating Electrical Machines and Power Systems|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Fairmont Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88173-239-9|title=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.

====Stepper motor====
{{Main|Stepper motor}}
[[File:Stepper motor.svg|thumb|A stepper motor with a soft iron rotor, with active windings shown. In 'A' the active windings tend to hold the rotor in position. In 'B' a different set of windings are carrying a current, which generates torque and rotation.]]
Stepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required. In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing permanent magnets or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it "steps"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.

Simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to "cog" to a limited number of positions; more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly. This mode of operation is often called [[stepper motor#Microstepping|microstepping]]. Computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems, particularly when part of a digital [[servomechanism|servo-controlled]] system.

Stepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They were used for the same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term "voice coil" in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.)

Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.

So-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors; they have one coil, draw very little power, and have a permanent magnet rotor. The same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepping motor.

Closely related in design to three-phase AC synchronous motors, stepper motors and SRMs are classified as variable reluctance motor type.{{Sfn|Bose|2006|pp=569–570, 891}} Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and [[Numerical control|computer numerical control (CNC)]] machines such as routers, plasma cutters and CNC lathes.

===Linear motor===
{{Main|Linear motor}}
A linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been "unrolled" so that, instead of producing a [[torque]] (rotation), it produces a straight-line force along its length.

Linear motors are most commonly [[linear induction motor|induction motors]] or stepper motors. Linear motors are commonly found in many roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail. They are also used in [[maglev train]]s, where the train "flies" over the ground. On a smaller scale, the 1978 era HP 7225A pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the X and Y axes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenoglio|first=John A.|author2=Chin, Bessie W.

===Force and torque===
The fundamental purpose of the vast majority of the world's electric motors is to electromagnetically induce relative movement in an air gap between a stator and rotor to produce useful torque or linear force.

According to [[Lorentz force law#Force on a current-carrying wire|Lorentz force law]] the force of a winding conductor can be given simply by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = I \boldsymbol{\ell} \times \mathbf{B} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or more generally, to handle conductors with any geometry:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
The most general approaches to calculating the forces in motors use tensors.&lt;ref name="Kirtley (2005)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Kirtley|first=James L., Jr.|booktitle=6.6585 - Electric Machines|title=Class Notes 1: Electromagnetic Forces|publisher=MIT Dept of Electrical Engineering|accessdate=15 March 2013|url=http://web.mit.edu/course/6/6.685/www/chapter1.pdf|year=2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104210907/http://web.mit.edu/course/6/6.685/www/chapter1.pdf|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] is shaft speed and T is [[torque]], a motor's mechanical power output P&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; is given by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/46|title = DC Motor Calculations, part 1|date = 30 November 2011|publisher = National Instruments|accessdate = 7 December 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012234329/http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/46|archivedate = 12 October 2007|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

in British units with T expressed in foot-pounds,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = \frac {rpm \times T}{5252}&lt;/math&gt; (horsepower), and,
in [[International System of Units|SI units]] with shaft [[Angular frequency|angular speed]] expressed in radians per second, and T expressed in newton-meters,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = {angular speed \times T}&lt;/math&gt; (watts).

For a linear motor, with force F expressed in newtons and velocity v expressed in meters per second,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{em} = F\times{v}&lt;/math&gt; (watts).

In an asynchronous or induction motor, the relationship between motor speed and air gap power is, neglecting [[skin effect]], given by the following:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{airgap}=\frac{R_r}{s} * I_r^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, where
::R&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; - rotor resistance
::I&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - square of current induced in the rotor
::s - motor slip; i.e., difference between synchronous speed and slip speed, which provides the relative movement needed for current induction in the rotor.

===Back emf===
{{Main|Electromotive force}}
Since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, they have a voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called "[[electromotive force|back electromotive force (emf)]]". The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.&lt;ref name="Dwight (1949)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwight|first=Herbert B.|last2=Fink |first2=D. G.|title=§27 to §35A Electromagnetic Induction of EMF in Sec. 2 - Electric and Magnetic Circuits|pages=36–41}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In AC machines, it is sometimes useful to consider a back emf source within the machine; as an example, this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on VFDs.&lt;ref name="Dwight (1949)"/&gt;

===Losses===
[[Losses in electrical systems|Motor losses]] are mainly due to [[Joule heating|resistive losses]] in windings, core losses and mechanical losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where cooling fans are present, also occur.

Losses also occur in commutation, mechanical commutators spark, and electronic commutators and also dissipate heat.

===Efficiency===
To calculate a motor's efficiency, the mechanical output power is divided by the electrical input power:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{P_m}{P_e}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is [[energy conversion efficiency]], &lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt; is electrical input power, and &lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; is mechanical output power:

:&lt;math&gt;P_e = I V&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_m = T \omega&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is input voltage, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is input current, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is output torque, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is output angular velocity. It is possible to derive analytically the point of maximum efficiency. It is typically at less than 1/2 the [[stall torque]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Various regulatory authorities in many countries have introduced and implemented legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher-efficiency electric motors.

===Goodness factor===
{{main|Goodness factor}}
[[Eric Laithwaite]]&lt;ref name=Laithwaite&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laithwaite|first=E.R.|title=Linear electric machines - A personal view|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=February 1975|volume=63|issue=2|pages=250–290|doi=10.1109/PROC.1975.9734|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1451664&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;queryText%3DLinear+Electric+Machines-+A+Personal+View|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515032704/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1451664&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;queryText%3DLinear+Electric+Machines-+A+Personal+View|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a metric to determine the 'goodness' of an electric motor:&lt;ref name="Patterson (2003)"&gt;{{cite conference|title=The "Goodness" of Small Contemporary Permanent Magnet Electric Machines|last=Patterson|first=D.

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac {\omega} {resistance \times reluctance} = \frac {\omega \mu \sigma A_m A_e} {l_m l_e}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the goodness factor (factors above 1 are likely to be efficient)
:&lt;math&gt;A_m, A_e&lt;/math&gt; are the cross sectional areas of the magnetic and electric circuit
:&lt;math&gt;l_m, l_e&lt;/math&gt; are the lengths of the magnetic and electric circuits
:&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the permeability of the core
:&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency the motor is driven at

From this, he showed that the most efficient motors are likely to have relatively large magnetic poles. However, the equation only directly relates to non PM motors.

==Performance parameters==

===Torque capability of motor types===
{{generalize|section|date=March 2012}}
All the electromagnetic motors, and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.

Once this is done a figure relating the current to the torque can be used as a useful parameter for motor selection. The maximum torque for a motor will depend on the maximum current although this will usually be only usable until thermal considerations take precedence.

When optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic core saturation]] or safe [[operating temperature]] rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.

Capacity for bursts of torque should not be confused with field weakening capability. Field weakening allows an electric machine to operate beyond the designed frequency of excitation. Field weakening is done when the maximum speed cannot be reached by increasing the applied voltage. This applies to only motors with current controlled fields and therefore cannot be achieved with permanent magnet motors.

Electric machines without a transformer circuit topology, such as that of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the magnetic core and rendering any increase in current as useless. Furthermore, the permanent magnet assembly of PMSMs can be irreparably damaged, if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted.

Electric machines with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, which would otherwise lead to core saturation.

Electric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result, the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases, which limits the magnitude of active (i.e., real) current. Still, bursts of torque that are two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable.

The brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port).&lt;ref name="Klatt (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klatt|first=Frederick W.|title=Sensorless Real Time Control (RTC): Brushless Wound-Rotor [Synchronous] Doubly-Fed Machine|journal=Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives -SLED 2012|date=September 2012|doi=10.1109/SLED.2012.6422811|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.

===Continuous torque density===
The continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or permanent magnet damage.

Other sources state that various e-machine topologies have differing torque density.  One source shows the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=BYkwEsmHqKYCPropulsion|page=68}}|title=Propulsion Systems for Hybrid Vehicles|last=Miller|first=John M.|date=2008|publisher=IET|year=|isbn=9780863419157|location=|pages=68, 69|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where — specific torque density is normalized to 1.0 for the SPM — brushless ac, 180° current conduction, SPM is Surface Permanent Magnet machine.

Torque density is approximately four times greater for electric motors which are liquid cooled, as compared to those which are air cooled.

A source comparing direct current (DC), induction motors (IM), permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) and switched reluctance motors (SRM) showed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=HxdHDgAAQBAJPower|page=1042}}|title=Power Electronics Handbook|last=Rashid|first=Muhammad H.|date=2017-09-09|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=|isbn=9780128114087|location=|pages=1042|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous power density===
The continuous power density is determined by the product of the continuous torque density and the constant torque speed range of the electric machine.

==Acoustic noise and vibrations==
Acoustic noise and vibrations of electric motors are usually classified in three sources:
* mechanical sources (e.g. due to [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]])
* aerodynamic sources (e.g. due to shaft-mounted [[fan (machine)|fans]])
* magnetic sources (e.g. due to magnetic forces such as [[Maxwell stress tensor|Maxwell]] and [[magnetostriction]] forces acting on stator and rotor structures)
The latter source, which can be responsible for the "whining noise" of electric motors, is called [[electromagnetically-excited acoustic noise and vibration|electromagnetically-excited acoustic noise]].

==Non-magnetic motors==
{{Main|Electrostatic motor|Piezoelectric motor|Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion}}

An electrostatic motor is based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge. Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors. They typically require a high-voltage power supply, although very small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first electrostatic motors were developed by Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon. Today, the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems ([[MEMS]]) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores. Also, the molecular machinery that runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric material]] when an [[electric field]] is applied. Piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or [[ultrasonic motor|ultrasonic]] vibrations to produce linear or rotary motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IdCg2dDZQr8C|page=38}}|title=Ultra-fast Material Metrology|last=Horn|first=Alexander|date=2009-07-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9783527627936|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shafik|first1=Amro|last2=Ben Mrad|first2=Ridha|title=Nanopositioning Technologies: Fundamentals and Applications|date=2016|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-23853-1|page=39|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23853-1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67504">The '''five-planet Nice model''' is a recent variation of the [[Nice model]] that begins with five [[giant planet]]s, the current four plus an additional [[ice giant]], in a chain of mean-motion resonances. After the [[orbital resonance|resonance]] chain is broken, the five giant planets undergo a period of planetesimal-driven migration, followed by a gravitational instability similar to that in the original Nice model. During the instability the additional giant planet is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is ejected from the [[Solar System]] following an encounter with Jupiter. An [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|early Solar System]] with five giant planets was proposed in 2011 after numerical models indicated that this is more likely to reproduce the current Solar System.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nesvorný|first=David|title=Young Solar System's Fifth Giant Planet?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2011|volume=742|issue=2|pages=L22|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/742/2/L22|arxiv = 1109.2949 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...742L..22N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A five-planet Nice model==

The following is a version of the five-planet Nice model that results in a late instability and reproduces a number of aspects of the current Solar System. The early Solar System may have evolved differently, however, with the instability occurring [[Five-planet Nice model#Timing of the instability|soon after]] the dissipation of the gas nebula,&lt;ref name="Kaib_Chambers_2016" /&gt; or with the giant planets [[Five-planet Nice model#Initial conditions|beginning]] in another resonance chain.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

The Solar System ends its [[nebular hypothesis|nebula phase]] with [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and the three ice giants in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain with [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] ranging from 5.5 – 20 [[astronomical unit|AU]]. A dense disk of [[planetesimal]]s orbits beyond these [[planet]]s, extending from 24 AU to 30 AU. [[impact event|Collisions]] between planetesimals in the outer disk produce debris that is ground to dust in a cascade of collisions. The dust spirals inward toward the planets due to [[Poynting–Robertson effect|Poynting-Robertson drag]] and eventually reaches [[Neptune]]'s orbit. Gravitational interactions with the dust allow the giant planets to escape from the resonance chain roughly ten million years after the dissipation of the [[Circumstellar disc|gas disk]]. After a series of distant planetary encounters the planets settle into an extended period of slow dust-driven migration.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt; Their orbits slowly diverge over four hundred million years,&lt;ref name="Bottke_2012" /&gt; until Neptune approaches the inner edge of the planetesimal disk.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

The migration of the planets then accelerates and transitions to a [[Planetary migration#Planetesimal-driven migration|planetesimal-driven migration]] as Neptune encounters and exchanges [[angular momentum]] with an increasing number of planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt; A net inward transfer of planetesimals and outward migration of Neptune occur during these encounters as most of those [[gravity assist|scattered]] outward return to be encountered again while some of those scattered inward are prevented from returning after encountering [[Uranus]]. A similar process occurs for Uranus, the extra ice giant, and Saturn resulting in their outward migration and a transfer of planetesimals inward from the outer belt to Jupiter. Jupiter, in contrast, ejects most of the planetesimals from the Solar System, and as a result migrates inward.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis_etal_2005" /&gt; After 10 million years the divergent migration of the planets leads to resonance crossings, exciting the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] of the giant planets and destabilizing the planetary system when Neptune is near 28 AU.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2015-a" /&gt;

During this instability the extra ice giant enters a Saturn-crossing orbit and is scattered inward by Saturn onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit. Repeated gravitational encounters with the ice giant cause jumps in Jupiter's and Saturn's semi-major axes, driving a step-wise separation of their orbits, leading to a rapid increase of the ratio of their [[orbital period|period]]s until it is greater than 2.3.&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2009" /&gt; The ice giant also encounters Uranus and Neptune and crosses parts of the [[asteroid belt]] as these encounters increase the eccentricity and semi-major axis of its orbit.&lt;ref name="Roig_Nesvorny_2015" /&gt; After 10,000–100,000 years,&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_etal_2010" /&gt; the ice giant is ejected from the Solar System following an encounter with Jupiter, becoming a [[rogue planet]].&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2011" /&gt; The remaining planets then continue to migrate at a declining rate and slowly approach their final orbits as most of the remaining planetesimal disk is removed.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2016" /&gt;

===Ejected planet===

The encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in the jumping-Jupiter scenario often lead to the ejection of the ice giant. For this ice giant to be retained its eccentricity must be damped by [[dynamical friction]] with the planetesimal disk, raising its perihelion beyond Saturn's orbit. The planetesimal disk masses typically used in the Nice model are often insufficient for this, leaving systems beginning with four giant planets with only three at the end of the instability. The ejection of the ice giant can be avoided if the disk mass is larger, but the separation of Jupiter and Saturn often grows too large and their eccentricities become too small as the larger disk is cleared. These problems led David Nesvorný of the [[Southwest Research Institute]] to propose that the Solar System began with five giant planets, with an additional Neptune-mass planet between Saturn and Uranus.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2011 /&gt; Using thousands of simulations with a variety of initial conditions he found that the simulations beginning with five giant planets were ten times more likely to reproduce the orbits of the outer planets.&lt;ref name=Stuart_2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Colin|title=Was a giant planet ejected from our solar system?|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/nov/21/was-a-giant-planet-ejected-from-our-solar-system|publisher=Physics World|accessdate=16 January 2014|date=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up study by David Nesvorný and Alessandro Morbidelli found that the required jump in the ratio of Jupiter's and Saturn's periods occurred and the orbits of the outer planets were reproduced in 5% of simulations for one five-planet system vs less than 1% for four-planet systems. The most successful began with a significant migration of Neptune, disrupting the planetesimal disk, before planetary encounters were triggered by resonance crossing. This reduces secular friction, allowing Jupiter's eccentricity to be preserved after it is excited by resonance crossings and planetary encounters.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Morbidelli_2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nesvorný |first=David |last2=Morbidelli |first2=Alessandro |title=Statistical Study of the Early Solar System's Instability with Four, Five, and Six Giant Planets |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=2012 |volume=144 |issue=4 |page=17 |doi=10.1088/0004-6256/144/4/117 |arxiv=1208.2957 |bibcode=2012AJ....144..117N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Konstantin Batygin]], [[Michael E.

A number of previous works also modeled Solar Systems with extra giant planets. A study by Thommes, Bryden, Wu, and Rasio included simulations of four and five planets beginning in resonant chains. Loose resonant chains of four or five planets with Jupiter and Saturn beginning in a 2:1 resonance often resulted in the loss of an ice giant for small mass planetesimal disks. The loss of a planet was avoided in four planet systems with a larger planetesimal disk but no scattering of planets occurred. A more compact system with Jupiter and Saturn in a 3:2 resonance sometimes resulted in encounters occurring between Jupiter and Saturn.&lt;ref name="Thommes_etal_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thommes|first1=Edward W.|last2=Bryden|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Wu|first3=Yanqin|last4=Rasio|first4=Frederic A|title=From Mean Motion Resonances to Scattered Planets: Producing the Solar System, Eccentric Exoplanets, and Late Heavy Bombardments|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2007|volume=675|issue=2|pages=1538–1548|doi=10.1086/525244|arxiv=0706.1235|bibcode=2008ApJ...675.1538T}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Morbidelli, Tsiganis, Crida, Levison, and Gomes was more successful in reproducing the Solar System beginning with a four planet system in a compact resonant chain.

===Initial conditions===

The giant planets begin in a chain of resonances. During their formation in the protoplanetary disk, interactions between the giant planets and the gas disk caused them to migrate inward toward the Sun. Jupiter's inward migration continued until it was halted, or reversed, as in the [[Grand tack hypothesis|Grand Tack]] model, when it captured a faster migrating Saturn in a mean-motion resonance.&lt;ref name=Masset_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masset|first=F.|author2=Snellgrove, M.|title=Reversing type II migration: resonance trapping of a lighter giant protoplanet|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=2001|volume=320|issue=4|pages=L55–L59|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04159.x|arxiv=astro-ph/0003421|bibcode = 2001MNRAS.320L..55M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resonance chain was extended as the three ice giants also migrated inward and were captured in further resonances.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Morbidelli_2012" /&gt; A long-range migration of Neptune outward into the planetesimal disk before planetary encounters begins is most likely if the planets were captured in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain, occurring in 65% of simulations when the inner edge was within 2 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]. While this resonance chain has the highest likelihood of reproducing Neptune's migration other resonance chains are also possible if the instability occurred early.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

A late instability may have followed an extended period of slow dust-driven migration. The combination of a late escape from a resonance chain, as described in the [[Nice 2 model]], and a long-range migration of Neptune is unlikely. If the inner edge of the planetesimal disk is close an early escape from resonance occurs, if it is distant an instability typically triggered before a significant migration of Neptune occurs. This gap may be bridged if an early escape from resonance is followed by an extended period of slow dust-driven migration. Resonance chains other than the 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 are unlikely in this case. Instabilities occur during the slow migration for tighter resonance chains and the distant disk is unrealistically narrow for more relaxed resonance chains. The rate of dust-driven migration slows with time as the rate of dust generation declines. As a result, the timing of the instability is sensitive to factors that determine the rate of dust generation such as the size distribution and the strength of the planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=Rogerio|last2=Morbidelli|first2=Alessandro|last3=Gomes|first3=Rodney S.|last4=Nesvorny|first4=David|title=Constraining the giant planets' initial configuration from their evolution: implications for the timing of the planetary instability|date=2017|arxiv=1702.02094|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa5eaa|volume=153|issue=4|journal=The Astronomical Journal|page=153|bibcode = 2017AJ....153..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing of the instability===

The timing of the instability in the Nice model was initially proposed to have coincided with the Late Heavy Bombardment, a spike in the impact rate thought to have occurred several million years after the formation of the Solar System. However, recently a number of issues have been raised regarding the timing of the Nice model instability, whether it was the cause of the Late Heavy Bombardment, and if an alternative would better explain the associated craters and impact basins. Most of the effects of the Nice model instability on the orbits of the giant planets and those of the various small body populations from the asteroid belt outward to the scattered disk are independent of its timing, however.

A five-planet Nice model with a late instability has a low probability of reproducing the orbits of the terrestrial planets.

Sufficient mass may not remain in the planetesimal disk after 400 million years of collisional grinding to fit models of the instability. If the size distribution of the planetesimal disk initially resembled its current distribution and included 1000's of Pluto mass objects significant mass loss occurs. This leaves the disk with under 10 Earth masses, while a minimum of 15 Earth masses is needed in current models of the instability. The size distribution also becomes shallower than is observed. These problems remain even if simulations begin with a more massive disk or a steeper size distribution. In contrast, a much lower mass loss and little change in the size distribution occurs during a early instability.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2018a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesvorny|first1=David|last2=Parker|first2=Joel|last3=Vokrouhlicky|first3=David|title=Bi-lobed Shape of Comet 67P from a Collapsed Binary|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2018|volume=155|issue=6|page=246|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aac01f|arxiv=1804.08735|bibcode=2018AJ....155..246N}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the planetesimal disk began without Pluto mass objects collisional grinding would begin as they formed from smaller object, with the timing depending on the initial size of the objects and mass of the planetesimal disk.&lt;ref name="Kenyon_Bromley_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenyon|first1=Scott J.|last2=Bromley|first2=Benjamin C.|title=Coagulation Calculations of Icy Planet Formation at 15-150 AU: A Correlation between the Maximum Radius and the Slope of the Size Distribution for Trans-Neptunian Objects|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2012|volume=143|issue=3|page=63|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/143/3/63|arxiv=1201.4395|bibcode=2012AJ....143...63K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary objects such as [[617 Patroclus|Patroclus]]-Menoetius would be separated due to the collisions if the instability was late. Patroclus and Menoetius are a pair of ~100 km objects orbiting with a separation of 680 km and relative velocities of ~11 m/s. While this binary remains in a massive planetesimal disk it is vulnerable to being separated due to collision. Roughly ~90% of similar binaries are separated per hundred million years in simulations and after 400 million years its survival probabilities falls to 7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;. The presence of Patroclus-Menoetius among the Jupiter Trojans requires that the giant planet instability occurred within 100 million years of the formation of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2018b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nesvorný |first1=David |last2=Vokrouhlický |first2=David |last3=Bottke |first3=William F. |last4=Levison |first4=Harold F. |title=Evidence for very early migration of the Solar System planets from the Patroclus–Menoetius binary Jupiter Trojan |journal=Nature Astronomy |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=878–882 |date=2018 |doi=10.1038/s41550-018-0564-3 |arxiv=1809.04007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombardment produced by the Nice model may not match the Late Heavy Bombardment.

==Proposed names==
According to Nesvorný, colleagues have suggested several names for the hypothetical fifth giant planet—[[Hades]], after the Greek god of the underworld; [[Liber]], after the Roman god of wine and a cognate of [[Dionysus]] and [[Bacchus]]; and [[Mefitis|Mephitis]], after the Roman goddess of toxic gases. Another suggestion is "Thing 1" from Dr. Seuss's ''[[Cat in the Hat]]'' children's book.&lt;ref&gt;A New Name for an Old Planet: ''New Scientist'': 01.10.2011: 15, https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20952-missing-planet-explains-solar-systems-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes on Planet Nine==
In January 2016, Batygin and Brown proposed that a distant massive [[Planet Nine|ninth planet]] is responsible for the alignment of the perihelia of several trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes greater than 250 AU.&lt;ref name="TAJ201601" /&gt; Although the mechanism for the ejection of the fifth giant planet in the five-planet Nice model is reminiscent of the origin of Planet Nine, with a gravitational instability including an encounter with Jupiter, it is unlikely to be the same planet. The estimated timing of the capture of Planet Nine onto its distant orbit, three to ten million years after the formation of the Solar System, when the Sun was still in its [[open cluster|birth cluster]], is inconsistent with a giant-planet instability that was responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment.&lt;ref name="Drake_2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|title=How can we find planet nine?

'''FlowJo''' is a software package for analyzing [[flow cytometry]] data. Files produced by modern flow cytometers are written in the [http://www.isac-net.org/content/view/101/150/ Flow Cytometry Standard] format with an .fcs file extension. FlowJo will import and analyze cytometry data regardless of which FACS ('''F'''luorescence '''A'''ctivated '''C'''ell '''S'''orting) machine is used to collect the data.

==Operation==
In FlowJo, samples are organized in a "Workspace" window, which presents a hierarchical view of all the samples and their analyses (gates and statistics). Viewing an entire experiment in a Workspace permits organizing and managing complex cytometry experiments and produces detailed graphical reports. FlowJo's ability to automate repetitive operations facilitates the production of statistics tables and graphical reports when the experiment involves many samples, parameters and/or operations.

Within a workspace, samples can be grouped or sorted by various attributes such as the panel of antibodies with which they are stained, tissue type, or patient from whom they came. When an operation on a group is initiated, FlowJo can perform the same operation on every sample belonging to that group. Thus, you can apply a [[gate (cytometry)|gate]] to a sample, copy it to the group, and that gate will be automatically placed on all samples in the group.

FlowJo provides tools for the creation of:
* [[Histogram]] and other plot overlays
* [[Cell cycle]] analysis
* [[Calcium in biology|Calcium]] flux analysis
* [[Cell growth|Proliferation]] analysis
* Quantification
* Cluster identification and backgating display

==Development==
FlowJo became a commercial product in 1996. In 2002, Tree Star released a [[Windows]] version. FlowJo is currently developed by FlowJo LLC, a privately owned life sciences software company based in Ashland, Oregon. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150629006156/en/FlowJo-BD-Partner-Streamline-Flow-Cytometry-Data&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forest degradation''' is a process in which the biological wealth of a forest area is permanently diminished by some factor or by a combination of factors. "This does not involve a reduction of the forest area, but rather a quality decrease in its condition."The forest is still there, but with less number of trees, or less species of trees, plants or animals, or some of them affected by plagues. This degradation makes the forest less valuable and may lead to [[deforestation]]. Forest degradation is a type of the more general issue of [[land degradation]].

== Interpretations of the term ==

Deforestation is much worse than forest degradation, but it is clear and visible. On the contrary, forest degradation may start and go on without showing clear effects. It is difficult to measure and even the very term is controversial. In a paper&lt;ref name="Lanly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lanly|first1=Jean-Paul|date=2003|title=DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION FACTORS|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/article/wfc/xii/ms12a-e.htm|journal=Proceedings of the XII World Forestry Congress|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to the XII World Forestry Congress, 2003, Jean-Paul Lanly states:  "The situation is even less satisfactory regarding forest degradation due in particular to the imprecision and multiple, and often subjective, interpretations of the term". In 2009 Lund&lt;ref name="Müller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Robert|last2=Pacheco|first2=Pablo|last3=Montero|first3=Juan Carlos|title=El contexto de la deforestación y degradación de los bosques en Bolivia|date=2014|publisher=CIFOR|location=Bolivia|isbn=978-602-1504-29-1|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-100.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  identified more than 50 definitions of forest degradation.

Previously to this August 2017 editing, the Wikipedia page Forest degradation was redirected to [[Secondary forest]], a forest which has re-grown after a timber harvest. This is a confusion: a secondary forest may be perfectly healthy, and a [[primary forest]] may be suffering degradation.

The term "permanently" also poses some difficulties: a forest affected by a mild seasonal [[drought]] may experience a loss of its biological wealth, but if it is seasonally reversed, then it is not considered degradation. On the contrary, a severe prolonged drought may seriously degrade a forest and make human intervention advisable to limit damages.

== Difficulties which hamper the assessment of degradation ==

According to Lanly,&lt;ref name = "Lanly" /&gt; there are 3 difficulties:

* the different choices of the initial state of reference or baseline;
* the chosen criteria: health, biodiversity, production capacity; and
* the opinion on the evolution prospects: will the final result of the process be desirable or undesirable?

For mapping forest degradation in Bolivia, Müller et al.&lt;ref name="Müller" /&gt; consider areas where only between 30% and 70% of the original forest cover remains. If less than 30% remains, the area is considered as deforested, and if more than 70% remains, the forest is considered intact.

Davidar et al.&lt;ref name="Davidar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davidar|first1=Priya|last2=Sashoo|first2=Sasmita|last3=Mammen|first3=Pratheesh C.|last4=Acharya|first4=Prashanth|last5=Puyravaud|first5=Jean-Philippe|last6=Arjunan|first6=M.|last7=Garrigues|first7=Jean Pierre|last8=Roessingh|first8=Krista|title=Assessing the extent and causes of forest degradation in India: Where do we stand?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=15 May 2010|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Priya_Davidar/publication/238364841_Assesing_the_extent_and_causes_of_forest_degradation_in_India_Where_do_we_stand/links/55d3116f08ae0a3417225b41/Assesing-the-extent-and-causes-of-forest-degradation-in-India-Where-do-we-stand.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2017|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.04.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; also think that "Loss of dense and moderately dense forest cover is suggestive of forest degradation." but for the moment no parameter exists "that indicates at what speed forests become degraded and how long it will take for the ecosystem to degrade beyond the point of recovery."
 
== Causes ==

The Dominican Center for Agricultural and Forest Development&lt;ref name="Ovalles"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ovalles|first1=P.|title=Causas de la deforestación y degradación de bosques en la República Dominicana|url=http://www.cedaf.org.do/REDD/causas.pdf|website=CEDAF|publisher=CEDAF|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following causes of forest degradation:
* Excessive extraction of forest products like timber, charcoal or resin.
* Road building: after it has been built, the road favours soil erosion.
* Open mining: the area where extraction takes place is, of course, completely deforested, but also the surrounding zone suffers a degradation of its fauna and flora. 
* Expansion of urban areas.

Davidar et al.&lt;ref name="Davidar"/&gt; add another:

*  Livestock grazing: goats or sheep eat tree seedlings, thus slowing natural forest regeneration.

Earth Eclipse,&lt;ref name="Eclipse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eclipse|first1=Earth|title=What is Forest Degradation?|url=http://www.eartheclipse.com/environment/causes-of-forest-degradation.html|website=Earth Eclipse|publisher=Earth Eclipse|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a platform of environment research articles, adds the following causes:
* [[Acid rain]]
* Pests and diseases
* Air pollution. Degradation for this cause is specifically called&lt;ref name="InTech"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chakravarty|first1=Sumit|last2=Ghosh|first2=S. K.|last3=Suresh|first3=C. P.|last4=Dey|first4=A. N.|last5=Shukla|first5=Gopal|title=Causes, Effects and Control Strategies, Global Perspectives on Sustainable Forest Management|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/36125/InTechDeforestation_causes_effects_and_control_strategies.pdf|website=InTech|publisher=InTech|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Waldsterben'' (German word) or forest death.
* Forest fragmentation: a large forest is broken up in smaller woods, which destroys the habitat of large animals.
* Land pollution
* Soil erosion (''see image above'') and sedimentation

Finally Chakravarty et al.,&lt;ref name="InTech"/&gt; as another cause, point at:
* Excessive or unrespectful tourism

== Remedies to forest degradation ==

Generally, any [[Deforestation#Control|measure to prevent deforestation]] will also reduce forest degradation. Specifically for degradation, Greenpeace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenpeace|first1=-|title=Solutions to Deforestation|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/forests/solutions-to-deforestation|website=Greenpeace|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes:

* Attaining a responsible forest products industry
* [[Sustainable forest management]]

Curbing emissions of sulfur dioxide (to combat acid rain) would also reduce forest degradation for this cause. If a coal-fired power plant uses low-quality coal (with a high sulfur contents), this may be alleviated by [[flue-gas desulfurization]].

== Initiatives against forest degradation ==

* [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD+) is an international voluntary climate change mitigation approach to curb deforestation and forest degradation. This mechanism makes part of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) since 2005.
* The [[United Nations REDD Programme|United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (or UN-REDD Programme) is a collaborative programme created in 2008 by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP). It should not be confused with "REDD+. The UN-REDD Programme supports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PROGRAMME|first1=UN-REDD|title=About the UN-REDD Programme|url=http://www.un-redd.org/|website=UN-REDD|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; its partner countries (more than 60) through direct funding and technical support to national REDD+ programmes and technical capacity enhancing.

The '''Forum for Sankaradeva Studies''' (Assamese: ''Sankaradeva Adhyayan Kendra'') is a research-oriented institution  dedicated to promoting the message and the ideals of [[Sankaradeva|Srimanta Sankaradeva]], one of the leading lights of the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition in India. It is based at [[Guwahati]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Assam]], and operates out of its offices located at Keteki Path, Saurabh Nagar, in the [[Beltola]] precinct of [[Guwahati]].

The Forum was formally inaugurated in the year 1988, under the presidency of the eminent scholar Dr. [[Maheswar Neog]]. It has succeeded in producing a steady stream of fine scholarly output since then. The incumbent General Secretary of the Forum is Dr. Pradip Jyoti Mahanta of the department of [[Assamese language|Assamese]], University of Guwahati.&lt;ref name="Sinha2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Biswajit Sinha|title=Folk theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzEbAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Raj Publications|page=143|isbn=978-81-86208-35-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims and objects of the Forum are:
*to establish a centre for research on the diverse contributions of Sankaradeva and their abiding values;
*to organize and hold lectures, seminars, exhibitions of art, demonstrations of music, dance and drama;
*to encourage and focus standard performances and other products of various art forms of the Sankaradeva tradition;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14490">'''Functional genomics''' is a field of [[molecular biology]] that attempts to make use of the vast wealth of data given by [[genomics|genomic]] and [[Transcriptomics|transcriptomic]] projects (such as [[genome project|genome sequencing projects]] and [[RNA-Seq|RNA sequencing]]) to describe [[gene]] (and [[protein]]) functions and interactions. Unlike [[structural genomics]], functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[translation (biology)|translation]], [[regulation of gene expression]] and [[protein–protein interaction]]s, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as [[DNA sequence]] or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional “gene-by-gene” approach.

==Goals of functional genomics==
The goal of functional genomics is to understand the function of larger numbers of genes or proteins, eventually all components of a genome. A more long-term goal is to understand the relationship between an organism's [[genome]] and its [[phenotype]]. The term functional genomics is often used broadly to refer to the many '''technical approaches''' to study an organism's '''genes and proteins''', including the "biochemical, cellular, and/or physiological properties of each and every gene product"&lt;ref name="Gibson and Muse"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Gibson G, Muse SV |title=A primer of genome science |edition=3rd |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some authors include the study of '''nongenic elements''' in his definition.&lt;ref name="Pevsner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pevsner J |year=2009 |title=Bioinformatics and functional genomics |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional genomics may also include studies of natural '''genetic variation''' '''over time''' (such as an organism's development) or '''space''' (such as its body regions), as well as functional disruptions such as mutations.

The promise of functional genomics is to generate and synthesize genomic and proteomic knowledge into an understanding of the dynamic properties of an organism. This would provide a more complete picture than studies of single genes. Integration of functional genomics data is also the goal of [[systems biology]].

==Techniques and applications==
Functional genomics includes function-related aspects of the genome itself such as [[mutation]] and [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] (such as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) analysis), as well as measurement of molecular activities. The latter comprise a number of "-[[omics]]" such as [[transcriptomics]] ([[gene expression]]), [[proteomics]] ([[protein production]]), and [[metabolomics]]. Functional genomics uses mostly [[multiplex (assay)|multiplex]] techniques to measure the abundance of many or all gene products such as [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]s or [[protein]]s within a [[Biological specimen|biological sample]]. Together these measurement modalities endeavor to quantitate the various biological processes and improve our understanding of gene and protein functions and interactions.

===At the DNA level===

====Genetic interaction mapping====
{{Main|Epistasis}}
Systematic pairwise deletion of genes or inhibition of gene expression can be used to identify genes with related function, even if they do not interact physically. Epistasis refers to the fact that effects for two different gene knockouts may not be additive; that is, the phenotype that results when two genes are inhibited may be different from the sum of the effects of single knockouts.

====The ENCODE project====
{{Main|ENCODE}}
The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA elements) project is an in-depth analysis of the human genome whose goal is to identify all the functional elements of genomic DNA, in both coding and noncoding regions. To this point{{when|date=January 2018}} , only the pilot phase of the study has been completed, involving hundreds of assays performed on 44 regions of known or unknown function comprising 1% of the human genome. Important results include evidence from genomic tiling arrays that most nucleotides are transcribed as coding transcripts, noncoding RNAs, or random transcripts, the discovery of additional transcriptional regulatory sites, further elucidation of chromatin-modifying mechanisms.

===At the RNA level: transcriptome profiling===

====Microarrays====
{{Main|DNA microarray}}
Microarrays measure the amount of mRNA in a sample that corresponds to a given gene or probe DNA sequence. Probe sequences are immobilized on a solid surface and allowed to [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridize]] with fluorescently labeled “target” mRNA. The intensity of fluorescence of a spot is proportional to the amount of target sequence that has hybridized to that spot, and therefore to the abundance of that mRNA sequence in the sample. Microarrays allow for identification of candidate genes involved in a given process based on variation between transcript levels for different conditions and shared expression patterns with genes of known function.

====SAGE====
{{Main|Serial analysis of gene expression}}
[[Serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE) is an alternate method of analysis based on RNA sequencing rather than hybridization. SAGE relies on the sequencing of 10–17 base pair tags which are unique to each gene. These tags are produced from [[Polyadenylation|poly-A mRNA]] and ligated end-to-end before sequencing. SAGE gives an unbiased measurement of the number of transcripts per cell, since it does not depend on prior knowledge of what transcripts to study (as microarrays do).

====RNA sequencing====
{{Main|RNA-Seq|MicroRNA sequencing}}
RNA sequencing has taken over microarray and SAGE technology in recent years, as noted in 2016, and has become the most efficient way to study  transcription and gene expression. This is typically done by [[DNA sequencing|next-generation sequencing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrdlickova|first=Radmila|last2=Toloue|first2=Masoud|last3=Tian|first3=Bin|date=January 2017|title=RNA-Seq methods for transcriptome analysis|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1002/wrna.1364|issn=1757-7012|pmid=27198714|pmc=5717752|page=e1364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subset of sequenced RNAs are small RNAs, a class of non-coding RNA molecules that are key regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, or [[RNA silencing]]. Next generation sequencing is the gold standard tool for [[non-coding RNA]] discovery, profiling and expression analysis.

===At the protein level: protein–protein interactions===

====Yeast two-hybrid system====
{{Main|Two-hybrid screening}}
A yeast [[two-hybrid screening]] (Y2H) tests a "bait" protein against many potential interacting proteins ("prey") to identify physical protein–protein interactions. This system is based on a transcription factor, originally GAL4,&lt;ref name=pmid2547163&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 340
| title = A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions
| issue = 6230
| pages = 245–246
| journal = Nature | first2 = O.
| last2 = Song
| pmid = 2547163
| year = 1989
| last1 = Fields | first1 = S.
| doi = 10.1038/340245a0 
|bibcode = 1989Natur.340..245F }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose separate DNA-binding and transcription activation domains are both required in order for the protein to cause transcription of a reporter gene. In a Y2H screen, the "bait" protein is fused to the binding domain of GAL4, and a library of potential "prey" (interacting) proteins is recombinantly expressed in a vector with the activation domain. In vivo interaction of bait and prey proteins in a yeast cell brings the activation and binding domains of GAL4 close enough together to result in expression of a [[reporter gene]]. It is also possible to systematically test a library of bait proteins against a library of prey proteins to identify all possible interactions in a cell.

====AP/MS====
[[Affinity purification]] and [[mass spectrometry]] (AP/MS) is able to identify proteins that interact with one another in complexes. Complexes of proteins are allowed to form around a particular “bait” protein. The bait protein is identified using an antibody or a recombinant tag which allows it to be extracted along with any proteins that have formed a complex with it. The proteins are then digested into short [[peptide]] fragments and mass spectrometry is used to identify the proteins based on the mass-to-charge ratios of those fragments.

===Loss-of-function techniques===

====Mutagenesis====
Gene function can be investigated by systematically “knocking out” genes one by one. This is done by either [[gene knockout|deletion]] or disruption of function (such as by [[insertional mutagenesis]]) and the resulting organisms are screened for phenotypes that provide clues to the function of the disrupted gene.

====RNAi====
{{Main|RNAi}}
RNA interference (RNAi) methods can be used to transiently silence or knock down gene expression using ~20 base-pair double-stranded RNA typically delivered by transfection of synthetic ~20-mer short-interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) or by virally encoded short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). RNAi screens, typically performed in cell culture-based assays or experimental organisms (such as ''C. elegans'') can be used to systematically disrupt nearly every gene in a genome or subsets of genes (sub-genomes); possible functions of disrupted genes can be assigned based on observed [[phenotype]]s.

===Functional annotations for genes===

====Genome annotation====
{{Main|Genome project#Genome annotation}}
Putative genes can be identified by scanning a genome for regions likely to encode proteins, based on characteristics such as long [[open reading frames]], transcriptional initiation sequences, and [[polyadenylation]] sites. A sequence identified as a putative gene must be confirmed by further evidence, such as similarity to cDNA or EST sequences from the same organism, similarity of the predicted protein sequence to known proteins, association with promoter sequences, or evidence that mutating the sequence produces an observable phenotype.

====Rosetta stone approach====
The Rosetta stone approach is a computation method of de novo protein function prediction, based on the hypothesis that some proteins involved in a given physiological process may exist as two separate genes in one organism and as a single gene in another. Genomes are scanned for sequences that are independent in one organism and in a single open reading frame in another. If two genes have fused, it is predicted that they have similar biological functions that make such co-regulation advantageous.

===Functional genomics and bioinformatics===
Because of the large quantity of data produced by these techniques and the desire to find biologically meaningful patterns, [[bioinformatics]] is crucial to analysis of functional genomics data. Examples of techniques in this class are [[data clustering]] or [[principal component analysis]] for unsupervised [[machine learning]] (class detection) as well as [[artificial neural network]]s or [[support vector machine]]s for supervised machine learning (class prediction, [[Statistical classification|classification]]). Functional enrichment analysis is used to determine the extent of over- or under-expression (positive- or negative- regulators in case of RNAi screens) of functional categories relative to a background sets. [[Gene ontology]] based enrichment analysis are provided by [[Gene set enrichment analysis#DAVID|DAVID]] and [[gene set enrichment analysis]] (GSEA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Subramanian A, Tamayo P, Mootha VK |title=Gene set enrichment analysis: A knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles |journal=Proc.

[[File:Cholera bacteria SEM.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. This is the bacterium that causes [[cholera]].]]

The '''germ theory of disease''' is the currently accepted [[scientific theory]] of disease. It states that many [[disease]]s are caused by [[microorganism]]s. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a [[bacterium]] but to any type of microorganism, especially one which causes disease, such as [[protists]], [[fungi]], [[viruses]], [[prions]], or [[viroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/germ|title=germ – definition of germ in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms that cause disease are called [[pathogen]]s, and the diseases they cause are called [[infectious disease]]s. Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen.

The germ theory was proposed by [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] in 1546, and expanded upon by [[Marcus von Plenciz]] in 1762. Such views were held in disdain, however, and [[Galen|Galen's]] [[miasma theory]] remained dominant among scientists and doctors. The nature of this doctrine prevented them from understanding how diseases actually progressed, with predictable consequences. By the early nineteenth century, [[smallpox vaccination]] was commonplace in Europe, though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases. Similar treatments had been prevalent in India from just before AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7294/|last1=Henderson|first1=Donald A|last2=Moss|first2=Bernard|title=Smallpox and Vaccinia, Vaccines|year=1999|publisher=W.

This work was later extended by [[Robert Koch]] in the 1880s. By the end of the 1880s the miasma theory was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease. Eventually, a "golden era" of [[bacteriology]] ensued, during which the theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/cholera_prevailingtheories_a2.html|title=BRIEF HISTORY DURING THE SNOW ERA|work=ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|title=Germ Theory|work=jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses were discovered in the 1890s.

== Miasma theory ==
[[File:Cholera art.jpg|thumb|A representation by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]] of the cholera epidemic depicts the spread of the disease in the form of poisonous air.]]
{{Main article|Miasma theory}}

The miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century. It held that diseases such as [[cholera]], [[chlamydia infection]], or the [[Black Death]] were caused by a ''[[Miasma theory|miasma]]'' (μίασμα, [[Ancient Greek]]: "pollution"), a noxious form of "bad air" emanating from rotting organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution="miasma theory" |title=A Dictionary of Public Health |editor=John M. Last |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |location=Westminster College, Pennsylvania |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t235.e2851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter (miasmata) that was identifiable by its foul smell. The theory posited that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water, foul air, and poor hygienic conditions. Such infections, according to the theory, were not passed between individuals but would affect those within a locale that gave rise to such vapors.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Development ==

=== Pre-19th century ===

In [[Age of the Earth|Antiquity]], the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 – c. 400 BC) was the first person to state, in his account of the [[plague of Athens]], that diseases could spread from an infected person to others.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles and Dorothea (1917) "The scientific position of Girolamo Fracastoro [1478?–1553] with especial reference to the source, character and influence of his theory of infection," ''Annals of Medical History'', '''1''' :  1–34 ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015016778261;view=1up;seq=28 see p. 14.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides with Richard Crawley, trans., ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' (London, England:  J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1910), Book III, § 51, [https://archive.org/stream/pelocrawleyr00thucuoft#page/130/mode/2up pp. 131–132.]  From pp. 131–132:  " … there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection in nursing each other.  This caused the greatest mortality.  On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the consequence."&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory of the spread of contagious diseases that were not spread by direct contact was that they were spread by "seeds" (Latin:  ''semina'') that were present in the air.  In his poem, ''De rerum natura'' (On the Nature of Things, ca. 56 BC), the Roman poet [[Lucretius]] (ca. 99 BC – ca. 55 BC) stated that the world contained various "seeds", some of which could sicken a person if they were inhaled or if they contaminated his food.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton, Vivian (1983) "The seeds of disease: an explanation of contagion and infection from the Greeks to the Renaissance," ''Medical History'', '''27''' (1) :  1–34 ; see p. 10. Available at:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139262/?page=23 U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius with Rev. John S. Watson, trans., ''On the Nature of Things'' (London, England:  Henry G. Bohn, 1851), Book VI, lines 1093–1130, pp. 291–292 ; [https://archive.org/stream/onnaturethingsd00carugoog#page/n320/mode/2up see especially p. 292.]  From p. 292:  "This new malady and pest, therefore, either suddenly falls into the water, or penetrates into the very corn, or into other food of men and cattle.  Or even, as may be the case, the infection remains suspended in the air itself; and when, as we breathe, we inhale the air mingled with it, we must necessarily absorb those ''seeds of disease'' into our body."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman statesman [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116–27 BC) wrote, in his ''Rerum rusticarum libri III'' (Three Books on Agriculture, 36 BC): "Precautions must also be taken in the neighborhood of swamps […] because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases."&lt;ref&gt;Varro, Marcus Terentius with Lloyd Storr-Best, trans., ''Varro On Farming'' (London, England:  G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., 1912), Book 1, Ch. XII, [https://archive.org/stream/onfarmingmterent00varruoft#page/38/mode/2up/search/diseases p. 39.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek physician Galen (AD 129 – ca. 200/ca. 216) speculated in his ''On Initial Causes'' (ca. AD 175) that some patients might have "seeds of fever".&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''On the Different Types of Fever'' (ca. AD 175), Galen speculated that plagues were spread by "certain seeds of plague", which were present in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  And in his ''Epidemics'' (ca. AD 176–178), Galen explained that patients might relapse during recovery from a fever because some "seed of the disease" lurked in their bodies, which would cause a recurrence of the disease if the patients didn't follow a physician's therapeutic regimen.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, [[Isidore of Seville]] (ca. 560 – 636) mentioned "plague-bearing seeds" (''pestifera semina'') in his ''On the Nature of Things'' (ca. AD 613).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1345, [[Tommaso del Garbo]] (ca. 1305–1370) of Bologna, Italy mentioned Galen's "seeds of plague" in his work ''Commentaria non parum utilia in libros Galeni'' (Helpful commentaries on the books of Galen).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar and physician Girolamo Fracastoro proposed in 1546 in his book ''De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis'' that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable seed-like entities (''seminaria morbi'') that transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances. The diseases were categorised based on how they were transmitted, and how long they could lie dormant.

Italian physician [[Francesco Redi]] provided early evidence against [[spontaneous generation]]. He devised an experiment in 1668 in which he used three jars. He placed a [[meatloaf]] and egg in each of the three jars. He had one of the jars open, another one tightly sealed, and the last one covered with gauze. After a few days, he observed that the meatloaf in the open jar was covered by maggots, and the jar covered with gauze had maggots on the surface of the gauze. However, the tightly sealed jar had no maggots inside or outside it. He also noticed that the maggots were found only on surfaces that were accessible by flies. From this he concluded that spontaneous generation is not a plausible theory.

Microorganisms are said to have been first directly observed in the 1670s by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], an early pioneer in [[microbiology]]. Yet [[Athanasius Kircher]] may have done so prior. When Rome was struck by the bubonic plague in 1656, Kircher spent days on end caring for the sick. Searching for a cure, Kircher observed microorganisms under the microscope and invented the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his ''Scrutinium pestis physico-medicum'' (Rome 1658).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|title=The Life and Work of Athanaseus Kircher, S.J.|work=mjt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on Leeuwenhoek's work, physician [[Nicolas Andry]] argued in 1700 that microorganisms he called "worms" were responsible for [[smallpox]] and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The History of the Germ Theory|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume= 1 |year=1888|page=312 |issue= 1415 | url = https://archive.org/stream/britishmedicaljo11888brit#page/312/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1720, [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] theorised that the plague and 'all pestilential distempers' were caused by 'poisonous insects', living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes.&lt;ref name=Santer&gt;Melvin Santer, ‘Richard Bradley: A Unified, Living Agent Theory of the Cause of Infectious Diseases of Plants, Animals, and Humans in the First Decades of the 18th Century’, in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Volume 52, Number 4, Autumn, 2009, pp. 566-578&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705-1786) published a book titled ''Opera medico-physica''. It outlined a theory of contagion stating that specific 'animalculae' in the soil and the air were responsible for causing specific diseases. Von Plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious (like measles and dysentry), and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic (like rabies and leprosy).&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory (1967). Conquest of Epidemic Disease: A Chapter in the History of Ideas. Hafner Publishing Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0028548807}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book cites Anton van Leeuwenhoek to show how ubiquitous such animalculae are, and was unique for describing the presence of germs in ulcerating wounds. Ultimately, the theory espoused by von Plenciz was not accepted by the scientific community.

=== Agostino Bassi ===
The Italian [[Agostino Bassi]] was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813, demonstrating that a "vegetable parasite" caused a disease in silkworms known as ''calcinaccio''{{mdash}}this disease was devastating the French silk industry at the time. The "vegetable parasite" is now known to be a fungus pathogenic to insects called ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' (named after Bassi).

=== Ignaz Semmelweis ===
[[Ignaz Semmelweis]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[obstetrician]] working at the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (''Allgemeines Krankenhaus'') in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from [[puerperal fever]] following births assisted by doctors and medical students. However, those attended by midwives were relatively safe. Investigating further, Semmelweis made the connection between puerperal fever and examinations of delivering women by doctors, and further realized that these physicians had usually come directly from autopsies. Asserting that puerperal fever was a [[Contagious disease|contagious]] disease and that matter from autopsies were implicated in its development, Semmelweis made doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime water before examining pregnant women.  He then documented a sudden reduction in the mortality rate from 18% to 2.2% over a period of a year.  Despite this evidence, he and his theories were [[Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|rejected]] by most of the contemporary medical establishment.

=== Gideon Mantell ===

[[Gideon Mantell]], the Sussex doctor more famous for discovering [[dinosaur fossils]], spent time with his microscope, and speculated in his ''Thoughts On Animalcules'' (1850) that perhaps "many of the most serious maladies which afflict humanity, are produced by peculiar states of invisible animalcular life".&lt;ref&gt;Pg. 90 of "The invisible world revealed by the microscope or, thoughts on animalcules.", second edition, 1850 (May have appeared in first edition, too. (Revise date in article to 1846, if so.))&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Snow ===
{{Main article|1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak}}
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854]]
[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] was a skeptic of the then-dominant [[miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. Even though the germ theory of disease pioneered by Girolamo Fracastoro had not yet achieved full development or widespread currency,  Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings.  He first published his theory in an 1849 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera,''  in which he correctly suggested that the fecal-oral route was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines.  He even proposed in his 1855 edition of the work, that the structure of cholera was that of a cell.

{{bquote|Having rejected effluvia and the poisoning of the blood in the first instance, and being led to the conclusion that'' ''the disease is something that acts directly on the alimentary canal, the excretions of the sick at once suggest themselves as containing some material which being accidentally swallowed might attach itself to the mucous membrane of the small intestines, and there multiply itself by appropriation of surrounding matter, in virtue of molecular changes going on within it, or capable of going on, as soon as it is placed in congenial circumstances.||John Snow (1849)}}

{{bquote|For the morbid matter of cholera having the property of reproducing its own kind, must necessarily have some sort of structure, most likely that of a cell.  It is no objection to this view that the structure of the cholera poison cannot be recognized by the microscope, for the matter of smallpox and of chancre can only be recognized by their effects, and not by their physical properties.||John Snow (1855)}}

Snow's 1849 recommendation that water be "filtered and boiled before it is used" is one of the first practical applications of germ theory in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern [[boil-water advisory]].

In 1855 he published a second edition of his article, documenting his more elaborate investigation of the effect of the water supply in the [[Soho]], London epidemic of 1854.

By talking to local residents, he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Snow |title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera |location=London |publisher=J. Churchill |year=1849 |url=http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/0050707 |quote=There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as one of the founding events of the science of [[epidemiology]].

Later, researchers discovered that this public well had been dug only three feet from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak fecal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The diapers of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.

After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the handle on the Broad Street pump. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant accepting the fecal-oral method transmission of disease, which they dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Chapelle |chapter=Ch. 5: Hidden Life, Hidden Death |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGVzCQgjEIC&amp;pg=PA82 |title=Wellsprings |location=New Brunswick NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8135-3614-9 |pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur ===
[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|Louis Pasteur’s pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself. These experiments were important pieces of evidence supporting the idea of germ theory of disease.]]
The more formal experiments on the relationship between germ and disease were conducted by Louis Pasteur between the year 1860 and 1864. He discovered the pathology of the puerperal fever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pasteur/louis/exgerm/complete.html |chapter=(translated from French) |trans-chapter=On the extension of the germ theory to the etiology of certain common diseases |first=Louis |last=Pasteur |others=Ernst, H.C. (trans) |year=1880 |origyear=May 1880 |title=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=XC |pages=1033–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pyogenic vibrio in the blood, and suggested using [[boric acid]] to kill these microorganisms before and after confinement.

Pasteur further demonstrated between 1860 and 1864 that [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and the growth of microorganisms in [[nutrient broth]]s did not proceed by spontaneous generation. He exposed freshly boiled broth to air in vessels that contained a filter to stop all particles passing through to the growth medium, and even with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not pass dust particles. Nothing grew in the broths: therefore the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than being generated within the broth.

Pasteur discovered that another serious disease of silkworms, ''[[pébrine]]'', was caused by a small microscopic organism now known as ''[[Nosema bombycis]]'' (1870). Pasteur saved France's silk industry by developing a method to screen silkworms eggs for those that were not infected, a method that is still used today to control this and other silkworm diseases.

=== Robert Koch ===
Robert Koch is known for developing four basic criteria (known as [[Koch's postulates]]) for demonstrating, in a scientifically sound manner, that a disease is caused by a particular organism. These postulates grew out of his seminal work with [[anthrax]] using purified cultures of the pathogen that had been isolated from diseased animals.

Koch's postulates were developed in the 19th century as general guidelines to identify pathogens that could be isolated with the techniques of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker L, Levine H, Jucker M | title = Koch's postulates and infectious proteins | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16703338 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-006-0072-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Koch's time, it was recognized that some infectious agents were clearly responsible for disease even though they did not fulfill all of the postulates.&lt;ref name=Koch1884 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"/&gt; Attempts to rigidly apply Koch's postulates to the diagnosis of viral diseases in the late 19th century, at a time when viruses could not be seen or isolated in culture, may have impeded the early development of the field of [[virology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Koch: a life in medicine and bacteriology |author=[[Thomas D. Brock|Brock TD]] |year=1999 |publisher=American Society of Microbiology Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-55581-143-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evans AS |title=Causation and disease: the Henle-Koch postulates revisited |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–95 |date=May 1976 |pmid=782050 |pmc=2595276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a number of infectious agents are accepted as the cause of disease despite their not fulfilling all of Koch's postulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacomo V, Kelly P, Raoult D |title=Natural history of ''Bartonella'' infections (an exception to Koch's postulate) |journal=Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=8–18 |year=2002 |pmid=11777823 |doi=10.1128/CDLI.9.1.8-18.2002 |pmc=119901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while Koch's postulates retain historical importance and continue to inform the approach to microbiologic diagnosis, fulfillment of all four postulates is not required to demonstrate causality.

Koch's postulates have also influenced scientists who examine microbial pathogenesis from a molecular point of view. In the 1980s, a [[molecular Koch's postulates|molecular version]] of Koch's postulates was developed to guide the identification of microbial genes encoding [[virulence]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falkow S |title=Molecular Koch's postulates applied to microbial pathogenicity |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S274–6 |year=1988 |pmid=3055197 |doi=10.1093/cid/10.Supplement_2.S274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koch's postulates:'''
# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms.
# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure [[cell culture|culture]].
# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
# The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

However, Koch abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate altogether when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of cholera&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koch Robert |title=Über den augenblicklichen Stand der bakteriologischen Choleradiagnose |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Hygiene und Infektionskrankheiten |year=1893 |volume=14 |pages=319–333 |doi=10.1007/BF02284324}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, of [[typhoid fever]]. [[Asymptomatic]] or [[subclinical infection]] carriers are now known to be a common feature of many infectious diseases, especially viruses such as [[polio]], [[herpes simplex]], [[HIV]], and [[hepatitis C]]. As a specific example, all doctors and virologists agree that [[poliovirus]] causes paralysis in just a few infected subjects, and the success of the [[polio vaccine]] in preventing disease supports the conviction that the poliovirus is the causative agent.

The third postulate specifies "should", not "must", because as Koch himself proved in regard to both [[tuberculosis]] and cholera,&lt;ref name=Koch1884&gt;{{cite book |author=Koch Robert |year=1884 |title=Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte |chapter=Die Aetiologie der Tuberkulose |volume=2 |pages=1–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see also: Conferenz zur Erörterung der Cholerafrage im Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamt [Conference to discuss the matter of cholera at the Imperial Health Office]. ''Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift'' 10 (1884), pages 499-507, 519-532 --&gt; not all organisms exposed to an infectious agent will acquire the infection. Noninfection may be due to such factors as general health and proper immune functioning; acquired immunity from previous exposure or vaccination; or genetic immunity, as with the resistance to malaria conferred by possessing at least one sickle cell allele.

The second postulate may also be suspended for certain microorganisms or entities that cannot (at the present time) be grown in pure culture, such as prions responsible for [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Inglis TJ |title=Principia aetiologica: taking causality beyond Koch's postulates |journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=56 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=1419–22 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17965339 |doi=10.1099/jmm.0.47179-0 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In summary, a body of evidence that satisfies Koch's postulates is sufficient but not necessary to establish causation.

== Sanitation ==
In the 1870s, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was instrumental in developing practical applications of the germ theory of disease with respect to sanitation in medical settings and aseptic surgical techniques—partly through the use of carbolic acid ([[phenol]]) as an antiseptic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16697">'''Glycosylation''' (see also [[chemical glycosylation]]) is the reaction in which a [[carbohydrate]], i.e. a [[glycosyl donor]], is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a [[glycosyl acceptor]]). In biology, '''glycosylation''' mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches [[glycans]] to [[glycoprotein|protein]]s, or other [[glycoside|organic molecules]]. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental [[biopolymers]] found in cells (along with [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[proteins]]). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and [[post-translational modification]]. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins.&lt;ref name="varki"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2nd | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press | isbn = 978-0-87969-770-9 | editor-first = Ajit | editor-last = Varki | name-list-format = vanc | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1908/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of proteins synthesized in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] undergo glycosylation. It is an [[enzyme]]-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of [[glycation]]. Glycosylation is also present in the [[cytoplasm]] and nucleus as the ''O''-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jung ST, Kang TH, Kelton W, Georgiou G | title = Bypassing glycosylation: engineering aglycosylated full-length IgG antibodies for human therapy | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 858–67 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21420850 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2011.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263802548_Transgenic_plants_of_Nicotiana_tabacum_L._express_aglycosylated_monoclonal_antibody_with_antitumor_activity|title=Transgenic plants of ''Nicotiana tabacum'' L. express aglycosylated monoclonal antibody with antitumor activity|year=2013|journal=Biotecnologia Aplicada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five classes of glycans are produced:
* ''N''-linked glycans attached to a [[nitrogen]] of [[asparagine]] or [[arginine]] [[Side chain|side-chains]]. [[N-linked glycosylation|''N''-linked glycosylation]] requires participation of a special lipid called dolichol phosphate. 
* ''O''-linked glycans attached to the [[hydroxyl]] [[oxygen]] of [[serine]], [[threonine]], [[tyrosine]], [[hydroxylysine]], or [[hydroxyproline]] side-chains, or to oxygens on lipids such as [[ceramide]]
* phosphoglycans linked through the phosphate of a phosphoserine;
*''C''-linked glycans, a rare form of glycosylation where a sugar is added to a carbon on a [[tryptophan]] side-chain
* [[glypiation]], which is the addition of a GPI anchor that links proteins to lipids through glycan linkages.

== Purpose ==
Glycosylation is the process by which a [[carbohydrate]] is [[covalent]]ly attached to a target [[macromolecule]], typically [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s.  This modification serves various functions.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2nd | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | isbn = 978-0-19-928278-4 | vauthors = Drickamer K, Taylor ME | title = Introduction to Glycobiology | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated.&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt;  In other cases, proteins are not stable unless they contain [[oligosaccharide]]s linked at the [[amide]] [[nitrogen]] of certain [[asparagine]] residues. The influence of glycosylation on the folding and stability of glycoprotein is twofold. Firstly, the highly soluble glycans may have a direct physicochemical stabilisation effect. Secondly, ''N''-linked glycans mediate a critical quality control check point in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalziel M, Crispin M, Scanlan CN, Zitzmann N, Dwek RA | title = Emerging principles for the therapeutic exploitation of glycosylation | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 1235681 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24385630 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glycosylation also plays a role in cell-to-cell adhesion (a mechanism employed by cells of the [[immune system]]) via sugar-binding proteins called [[lectins]], which recognize specific carbohydrate moieties.&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt; Glycosylation is an important parameter in the optimization of many glycoprotein-based drugs such as [[monoclonal antibodies]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Glycosylation also underpins the [[ABO blood group]] system. It is the presence or absence of [[glycosyltransferase]]s which dictates which blood group [[antigen]]s are presented and hence what antibody specificities are exhibited. This immunological role may well have driven the diversification of glycan heterogeneity and creates a barrier to [[zoonotic]] transmission of viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crispin M, Harvey DJ, Bitto D, Bonomelli C, Edgeworth M, Scrivens JH, Huiskonen JT, Bowden TA | title = Structural plasticity of the Semliki Forest virus glycome upon interspecies transmission | language = EN | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 1702–12 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24467287 | pmc = 4428802 | doi = 10.1021/pr401162k | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr401162k }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, glycosylation is often used by viruses to shield the underlying viral protein from immune recognition. A significant example is the dense glycan shield of the envelope spike of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crispin M, Doores KJ | title = Targeting host-derived glycans on enveloped viruses for antibody-based vaccine design | journal = Current Opinion in Virology | volume = 11 | pages = 63–9 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25747313 | pmc = 4827424 | doi = 10.1016/j.coviro.2015.02.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625715000267 | series = Viral pathogenesis • Preventive and therapeutic vaccines }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, glycosylation needs to be understood by the likely evolutionary selection pressures that have shaped it. In one model, diversification can be considered purely as a result of endogenous functionality (such as [[cell trafficking]]). However, it is more likely that diversification is driven by evasion of pathogen infection mechanism (e.g. ''[[Helicobacter]]'' attachment to terminal saccharide residues) and that diversity within the multicellular organism is then exploited endogenously.

==Glycoprotein diversity==

Glycosylation increases diversity in the [[proteome]], because almost every aspect of glycosylation can be modified, including:
*[[Glycosidic bond]]—the site of glycan linkage
*Glycan composition—the types of sugars that are linked to a given protein
*Glycan structure—can be unbranched or branched chains of sugars
*Glycan length—can be short- or long-chain oligosaccharides

== Mechanisms ==

There are various mechanisms for glycosylation, although most share several common features:&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt;
*Glycosylation, unlike [[glycation]], is an enzymatic process. Indeed, glycosylation is thought to be the most complex [[Posttranslational modification|post-translational modification]], because of the large number of enzymatic steps involved.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Roberts and Co. Publishers, Englewood, CO | isbn = 0974707732 | last = Walsh | first = Christopher |  name-list-format = vanc |title = Posttranslational Modification of Proteins: Expanding Nature's Inventory | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The donor molecule is often an activated [[nucleotide sugar]].
*The process is non-templated (unlike DNA [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] or protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]]); instead, the cell relies on segregating enzymes into different cellular compartments (e.g., [[endoplasmic reticulum]], cisternae in [[Golgi apparatus]]). Therefore, glycosylation is a site-specific modification.

== Types ==

=== ''N''-linked glycosylation ===
{{main article|N-linked glycosylation}}
''N''-linked glycosylation is a very prevalent form of glycosylation and is important for the folding of many eukaryotic glycoproteins and for cell&amp;ndash;cell and cell&amp;ndash;[[extracellular matrix]] attachment. The ''N''-linked glycosylation process occurs in [[eukaryotes]] in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and widely in [[archaea]], but very rarely in [[bacteria]].  In addition to their function in protein folding and cellular attachment, the ''N''-linked glycans of a protein can modulate a protein's function, in some cases acting as an on/off switch.&lt;ref name = "immune_glycan"/&gt;

=== ''O''-linked glycosylation ===
{{main article|O-linked glycosylation}}
''O''-linked glycosylation is a form of glycosylation that occurs in [[eukaryotes]] in the [[Golgi apparatus]],&lt;ref name="Flynne2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=William G. |last=Flynne | name-list-format = vanc | title=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEBBP5IYqJQC&amp;pg=PA45|access-date=13 November 2010|year=2008|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-60456-067-1|pages=45ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also occurs in [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].

=== Phosphoserine glycosylation ===
[[Xylose]], [[fucose]], [[mannose]], and [[GlcNAc]] [[phosphoserine]] [[glycan]]s have been reported in the literature.  Fucose and GlcNAc have been found only in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', mannose in ''[[Leishmania mexicana]]'', and xylose in ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''.  Mannose has recently been reported in a vertebrate, the mouse, ''Mus musculus'', on the cell-surface laminin receptor alpha dystroglycan&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. It has been suggested this rare finding may be linked to the fact that alpha dystroglycan is highly conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida-Moriguchi T, Yu L, Stalnaker SH, Davis S, Kunz S, Madson M, Oldstone MB, Schachter H, Wells L, Campbell KP | title = O-mannosyl phosphorylation of alpha-dystroglycan is required for laminin binding | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5961 | pages = 88–92 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20044576 | pmc = 2978000 | doi = 10.1126/science.1180512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''C''-mannosylation ===
A [[mannose]] sugar is added to the first [[tryptophan]] residue in the sequence W&amp;ndash;X&amp;ndash;X&amp;ndash;W (W indicates tryptophan; X is any amino acid).  [[Thrombospondins]] are one of the most commonly ''C''-modified proteins, although this form of glycosylation appears elsewhere as well. ''C''-mannosylation is unusual because the sugar is linked to a [[carbon]] rather than a reactive atom such as [[nitrogen]] or [[oxygen]]. Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the first crystal structure of a protein containing this type of glycosylation has been determined—that of human complement component 8, {{PDB|3OJY}}.

=== Formation of GPI anchors (glypiation) ===
(Main Article:[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glypiation|Glypiation]])
A special form of glycosylation is the formation of a [[GPI anchor]]. In this kind of glycosylation a protein is attached to a lipid anchor, via a glycan chain. (See also [[prenylation]].)

=== Chemical glycosylation ===
Glycosylation can also be effected using the tools of [[synthetic organic chemistry]].  Unlike the biochemical processes, synthetic glycochemistry relies heavily on protecting groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crich D | title = Mechanism of a chemical glycosylation reaction | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 43 | issue = 8 | pages = 1144–53 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20496888 | doi = 10.1021/ar100035r }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. the 4,6-O-benzylidene) in order to achieve desired regioselectivity. The other challenge of chemical glycosylation is the stereoselectivity that each glycosidic linkage has two stereo-outcomes, alpha-/beta or cis-/trans. Generally, the alpha- or cis- glycoside is more challenging to synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nigudkar SS, Demchenko AV | title = cis glycosylation as the driving force of progress in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry | journal = Chemical Science | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 2687–2704 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26078847 | pmc = 4465199 | doi = 10.1039/c5sc00280j | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C5SC00280J }}&lt;/ref&gt; New methods have been developed based on solvent participation or the formation of bicyclic sulfonium ions as chiral-auxiliary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fang T, Gu Y, Huang W, Boons GJ | title = Mechanism of Glycosylation of Anomeric Sulfonium Ions | language = EN | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 138 | issue = 9 | pages = 3002–11 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26878147 | pmc = 5078750 | doi = 10.1021/jacs.5b08436 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b08436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Clinical==
Over 40 [[congenital disorder of glycosylation|disorders of glycosylation]] have been reported in humans.&lt;ref name=Jaeken2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaeken J | title = Congenital disorders of glycosylation | journal = Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 113 | issue =  | pages = 1737–43 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23622397 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-59565-2.00044-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be divided into four groups: disorders of protein [[N-linked glycosylation|''N''-glycosylation]], disorders of protein ''O''-glycosylation, disorders of lipid glycosylation and disorders of other glycosylation pathways and of multiple glycosylation pathways. No effective treatment is known for any of these disorders. 80% of these affect the nervous system.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Effects on therapeutic efficacy ===
It has been reported that mammalian glycosylation can improve the therapeutic efficacy of [[biotherapeutic]]s. For example, therapeutic efficacy of recombinant [[Interferon gamma|human interferon gamma]], expressed in [[HEK 293 cells|HEK&amp;nbsp;293]] platform, was improved against drug-resistant [[ovarian cancer]] cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Villacrés C, Jung V, Mashkour N, Butler M, Owens L, Heimann K | title = Improved therapeutic efficacy of mammalian expressed-recombinant interferon gamma against ovarian cancer cells | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 359 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–29 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28803068 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.08.014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.08.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two teams stand ready, each side has 24 knights, all with heraldic [[surcoat]]s and [[caparison]]s, and each accompanied by a banner-bearer with a [[heraldic flag]].
There is a central spectators' box for the four judges, where the [[heraldic shield]]s of the competitors are displayed, 
the two teams being led by the dukes of [[duke of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[duke of Bourbon|Bourbon]], respectively, and one spectator box on each side for the ladies; inscribed over the boxes is ''plus est en vous'', the [[heraldic motto]] of the [[Gruuthuse]] family of Bruges, attributed to tournament between  [[Jean III de Gruuthuse]] and Jean de Ghistelles held in 1393.&lt;ref&gt;Octave Delepierre, '' Précis des annales de Bruges'' (1835) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=eIpDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 38f]. René of Anjou's contemporary [[Louis de Gruuthuse]] himself was a famous competitor in tournaments during the 1440s.&lt;/ref&gt; The two dukes can be seen facing each other in the center of the front lines, each with a personal heraldic flag as well with a larger flag of the same design representing their team.
The chief [[herald]] is also on horseback, between the two teams, wearing his own heraldic colours.]]

'''[[Heraldry]]''' is the system of visual identification of rank and [[genealogy|pedigree]] which developed 
in the European [[High Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name="CGH 1–18"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; closely associated with the [[Royal court|courtly]] culture of [[chivalry]], 
[[Latin Church|Latin Christianity]], the [[Crusades]], [[feudalism|feudal]] [[nobility|aristocracy]], and [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchy]] of the time. 
Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]].
Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). 
Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. 
Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.

Western heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].

With the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.

==Precursors==
{{see|Byzantine flags and insignia|Aquila (Roman)|Vexillum|Seal (emblem)}}
[[File:Stuttgart Psalter 42v detail.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Carolingian-era [[round shield]]s ([[Stuttgart Psalter]], 9th century). The spiral patterns represent iron bracing reinforcing the shield.]]
[[File:Harold dead bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|Depiction of [[kite shield]]s with cross or spiral ornaments in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (c. 1070).]]
Traditions of [[field sign]]s, personal [[emblem]]s or [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] go back to at least the [[Ancient Near East|Bronze Age]].
The [[Ekphrasis|ekphrastic]] description of [[shield]] designs in particular is found as a topos in classical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Units of the Roman army were sometimes identified by distinctive markings on their shields.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', Bodleian Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldry developed in the [[high medieval period]], based on earlier, "pre-heraldic" or "ante-heraldic", traditions of visual identification by means of  [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s,  [[field sign]]s, emblems used on [[numismatics|coins]], etc. Notably, [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] that would subsequently appear in 12th-century coats of arms of European nobility have pre-figurations in the [[animal style]] of ancient art (specifically  the style of [[Scythian art]] as it developed from c. the 7th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry"  John Onians, ''Atlas of World Art'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western heraldry is an innovation of the 12th century. Certain members of the high nobility began to display animals, 
specifically [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] on their shields beginning in c. the 1140s. 
Prior to this, western military shields of the 11th to early 12th century did sometimes show simple decorations, but not apparently tied to the personal identification of the bearer.

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], illustrating the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about 1077, when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt, depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures.  Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. &amp; A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Frankish or German [[round shield]]s of the 11th century ([[Ottonian]], [[Salian dynasty|Salian]]) are sometimes depicted with simple geometric ornamentation, but not with figurative emblems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingage.org/wiki/wiki/Round_Shield_Designs Round Shield Designs (vikingage.org)]: "chequered" (11th c., Biblio. Mun. Avranches MS50), "flared cross" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), 
"spirals" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), "spirals with dots" (c.1000-1020 Bamberg MS A. II. 42 Bamberg Apocalypse).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, an account of the French knights at the court of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]] at the beginning of the twelfth century describes their shields of polished metal, utterly devoid of heraldic design.  A Spanish manuscript from 1109 describes both plain and decorated shields, none of which appears to have been heraldic.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] contained a window commemorating the knights who embarked on the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, and was probably made soon after the event; but [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon's]] illustration of the window before it was destroyed shows no heraldic design on any of the shields.&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proto-heraldry (12th century)==
{{seealso|List of oldest heraldry|Equestrian seal}}
[[File:Thibaut Blois.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of the [[equestrian seal]] of [[Theobald III, Count of Blois]], dated 1138. Traces of an ornamental cross design are visible on the shield.]]
The 12th-century tradition is mostly preserved in the form of the [[equestrian seal]]s popular at the time which show the nobleman as a fully armed warrior on horseback. Early equestrian seals show plain shields. From the mid 12th century, proto-heraldic designs are sometimes shown, but the shield is shown naturally, as part of the knight's armament, and is often seen in profile or partially obscured. 
The [[:File:Demay p6.jpg|equestrian seal]] of Enguerrand (Ingelram), [[count of Saint-Pol]] (1130s or 1140s) still shows a plain shield, but what would later become [[heraldic charge]]s (in this case, sheaves of corn) are shown arranged around the horse.&lt;ref&gt;"le blason fait son apparition dans les dernières années du XIIe siècle, brusquement, sans transition. Mais il est d’autres types plus anciens où les pièces des armoiries existent, s’annonçant pour ainsi dire avant de passer dans l’écu. Le sceau d’Enguerran, comte de Saint-Pol, antérieur à l’année 1150, est de ce nombre. Il offre déjà plusieurs ''gerbes'' dispersées dans le champ." 
G. Demay, ''Le Blason d’après les sceaux du Moyen-Âge'' (1877), [https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Demay_-_Le_Blason_d’après_les_sceaux_du_Moyen-Âge,_1877.djvu/7 p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;
Seals displaying actual heraldic shields appear by the very end of the 12th century or the early years of the 13th century.

Seals with elements of a distinctly heraldic character begin to appear in the second third of the 12th century.
A number of seals dating from between 1135 and 1155 appear to show the adoption of heraldic devices in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock]] &amp; [[John Martin Robinson]], ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  
A notable example of an early armorial seal is attached to a charter granted by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders]], in 1164.  Seals from the latter part of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries show no evidence of heraldic symbolism, but by the end of the twelfth century, seals are uniformly heraldic in nature.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''Heraldry in England'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest equestrial seals with armorials are those of [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]], duke of Saxony (1142&amp;ndash;1180) and Bavaria (1156&amp;ndash;1180). A total of seven seals of Henry's are known. Of these, only the second shows a recognizable [[heraldic lion|lion]] displayed on his shield. This seal is attached to two documents dated to 1146. It is possible that the lion was also on the first seal (c. 1142), but it is no longer recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;Xenja von Ertzdorff, Rudolf Schulz, Winfried Baumann, ''Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem Löwen'' (1994), p. 175,
citing Schmidt-Phiseldeck, '' Die Siegel des herzoglichen Hauses Braunschweig und Lüneburg'', nr. 1&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;
An equestrian seal of similar antiquity is [[:File:Ottokar III of Styria 1160.jpg|that]] of [[Ottokar III of Styria]], dated 1160, with an early form of the [[Styria]]n [[Panther (legendary creature)|panther]] on his shield.

[[File:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Enamel from the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], showing his shield in profile, with four out of what were presumably six lions visible (six lions are on the shield of the effigy of  his grandson  [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespée]], d. 1226).]]
The oldest extant depiction of a coloured armoury can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated with six golden lions rampant.  He wears a blue helmet adorned with another lion, and his cloak is lined in vair.  A medieval chronicle states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128; but this account probably dates to about 1175.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), {{p.|18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early mention of heraldic shields in [[Middle High German literature]] also dates to the 12th century.
Shield designs are described in the  ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' (c. 1150&amp;ndash;1170), such as the boar carried by the Romans, as well as, in isolated cases, in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'' (c. 1115), ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'' (c. 1150), [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']] (c. 1170), and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']] (c. 1185).
These appear in the larger context of describing an armed protagonist, and are not yet tied to the bearer's pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;"With the exception of several heraldic shields that appear in the ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'', such as the boar carried by the Romans&amp;mdash;the oldest heraldic insignia in medieval German epic literature, according to Zips [''Wappenwesen'', 1966]&amp;mdash;most of the precourtly and even courtly epics up to 1200 contain very few decorated shields at all. Several isolated coats of arms are mentioned in the German ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'', ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'', [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']], and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']]&amp;mdash;mostly related to the protagonists." Wandhoff (2016),  ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=5mYYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Depiction of emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] as a [[Crusades|Crusader]] (c. 1188). The [[heraldic cross|cross symbol]] worn on the shield and surcoat at this time is not a heraldic charge identifying the bearer but a [[field sign]] worn by all participants in the Crusade.]]
At least two distinctive features of heraldry are generally accepted as products of the [[Crusades]]: the surcoat, an outer garment worn over the armor to protect the wearer from the heat of the sun, was often decorated with the same devices that appeared on a knight's shield.  It is from this garment that the phrase "coat of arms" is derived.{{dubious|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--the term is from the 14th century, and has no direct relation to the crusades at all--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the lambrequin, or mantling, that depends from the helmet and frames the shield in modern heraldry, began as a practical covering for the helmet and the back of the neck during the Crusades,{{cn|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--do you mean the period of the crusades (i.e. the 12th century), or the actual campaign? If the latter, what is the evidence?--&gt;
serving much the same function as the surcoat.  Its slashed or scalloped edge, today rendered as billowing flourishes, is thought to have originated from hard wearing in the field, or as a means of deadening a sword blow and perhaps entangling the attacker's weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval heraldry==
{{see|Roll of arms}}
[[File:DeringRoll.jpg|thumb|200px|''Dering Roll'', c. 1270, Dover, one of the oldest extant [[Roll of arms|rolls of arms]], showing the coats of arms as yet without [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] or any other achievements.]]

===Terminology===
{{see|Blazon}}
The origin of the term ''[[:wikt:heraldry|heraldry]]'' itself ([[Middle English]] ''heraldy'', [[Old French]] ''hiraudie''), can be placed in the context of the early forms of the [[Tournament (medieval)|knightly tournament]]s in the 12th century. Combattants wore full armour, and identified themselves by wearing their emblems on their [[heater shield|shields]]. A [[herald]] (Old French ''heraut'', from a [[Frankish language|Frankish]] ''*hariwald'' "commander of an army") was an officer who would announce the competitors. 

Originally a type of messenger employed by noblemen, heralds assumed the responsibility of learning and knowing the rank, pedigree, and heraldic devices of various knights and lords, as well as the rules and protocols governing the design and description, or ''blazoning'' of arms, and the precedence of their bearers.&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the late thirteenth century, certain heralds in the employ of monarchs were given the title "King of Heralds", which eventually became "[[King of Arms]]."&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"/&gt;

The term ''[[coat of arms]]''  in origin refers to the [[surcoat]] with heraldic designs worn by combattants, especially in the knightly tournament, in Old French ''cote a armer''. The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English, in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/coat%20of%20arms#etymonline_v_28240 etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heraldic shield===
{{see|Escutcheon (heraldry)}}
By about the 1230s, the shields used by cavalry were almost triangular in shape, referred to as [[heater shield]]s. Such a 
shield is preserved, the shield of [[Konrad von Thüringen]], dated c. 1230, showing the ''lion barry'' of the [[Ludovingians]].
This heater-shaped form was used in warfare during the apogee of the [[Chivalry|Age of Chivalry]], and it becomes the classic heraldic shield, or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], at about the time of the [[Battle of Crecy]] (1346) and the founding of the [[Order of the Garter]] (1348), when heraldry had become a fully developed system.
All medieval [[roll of arms|rolls of arms]], from the late 13th and throughout the 14th to 15th century, almost exclusively use this shield shape. 

&lt;gallery&gt;

The shield at this time still has the [[kite shield|"kite" shape]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Division of the field===
{{see|Division of the field}}
Coats of arms of the 13th century in some cases already include marks of [[cadency]] to distinguish descendants, but they mostly still do without [[division of the field]] to indicate descent from more than one lineage. 
An exception is the [[coat of arms of Castile and León]], showing
the [[Heraldry of Castile|arms of Castile]] (the yellow castle) [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] with the [[Heraldry of León|arms of León]] (the purple lion) in the late 13th century ''[[Camden Roll]]'' and  ''Segar's Roll''.
This practice becomes much more common in the late medieval period. For example, the  arms of [[Eric of Pomerania]] as king of the [[Kalmar Union]] (r. 1396–1439) combine five coats of arms, for Denmark, Sweden, the [[House of Bjelbo]], Pomerania and Norway, quartered by a cross gules and with a central [[inescutcheon]].
In the later 15th century, holders of ecclesiastical office would quarter their family arms with those of the 
order or diocese they represented. Thus [[Pierre d'Aubusson]] as grand master of the [[Knights of Malta]] quartered his family arms with the [[Maltese cross]]; bishop [[Hugo von Hohenlandenberg]] quartered his family arms with those of the [[bishopric of Constance|prince-bishopric of Constance]].

===Heraldic authorities===
{{see|Heraldic authority}}
By the middle of the fourteenth century, the principle that only a single individual was entitled to bear a particular coat of arms was generally accepted, and disputes over the ownership of arms seems to have led to gradual establishment of heraldic authorities to regulate their use.  The earliest known work of [[Law of Arms|heraldic jurisprudence]], ''De Insigniis et Armis'', was written about 1350 by [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]], a professor of law at the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/bartolo.htm ''De Insigniis et Armis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Squibb, "The Law of Arms in England", in ''The Coat of Arms'' vol. II, no. 15 (Spring 1953), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The most celebrated armorial dispute in English heraldry is that of ''[[Scrope v Grosvenor]]'' (1390), in which two different men claimed the right to bear ''azure, a bend or''.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued proliferation of arms, and the number of disputes arising from different men assuming the same arms, led [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] to issue a proclamation in 1419, forbidding all those who had not borne arms at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] from assuming arms, except by inheritance or a grant from the crown.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siebmacher002.jpg|thumb|upright|Royal coats of arms in ''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' (1605)]]
In 1484, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the various heralds employed by the crown were incorporated into the [[College of Arms]], through which all new grants of arms would eventually be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"&gt;Pastoureau, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The college currently consists of three Kings of Arms, assisted by six Heralds, and four [[Pursuivants]], or junior officers of arms, all under the authority of the [[Earl Marshal]]; but all of the arms granted by the college are graÅnted by the authority of the crown.&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"&gt;[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/heralds-officers College of Arms official website], accessed 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar bodies regulate the granting of arms in other monarchies and several members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but in most other countries there is no heraldic authority, and no law preventing anyone from assuming whatever arms they please, provided that they do not infringe upon the arms of another.&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"/&gt;

Beginning in the reign of [[Henry VIII]], the Kings of Arms were commanded to make ''[[heraldic visitation|visitations]]'', in which they traveled about the country, recording arms borne under proper authority, and requiring those who bore arms without authority either to obtain authority for them, or cease their use.  Arms borne improperly were to be taken down and defaced.  The first such visitation began in 1530, and the last was carried out in 1700, although no new commissions to carry out visitations were made after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn, ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry'', MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London (1960), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[early modern period]], heraldry became highly complex and standardised, divided into "national"  traditions. 
Western heraldry can be divided into three large cultural groups, "Gallo-British", "German-Nordic" and "Latin".
Part of the Gallo-British group are [[French heraldry|French]], 
[[English heraldry|English]] and [[Scottish heraldry|Scottish]] traditions. The "German-Nordic" group includes the tradition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its greater sphere of incluence, including 
[[German heraldry]], [[Swedish heraldry]], [[Norwegian heraldry]], [[Danish heraldry]], [[Russian heraldry]],  [[Polish heraldry]], [[Hungarian heraldry]], [[Croatian heraldry]], [[Serbian heraldry]], etc.

The "Latin" group includes [[Italian heraldry]], [[Spanish heraldry]] and [[Portuguese heraldry]].

[[Dutch heraldry]] shows influence of all three groups.

Prominent burghers and corporations, including many cities and towns, assumed or obtained grants of arms, with only nominal military associations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gwynn-Jones, ''The Art of Heraldry: Origins, Symbols, and Designs'', Parkgate Books/Barnes &amp; Noble (1998), pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heraldic devices were depicted in various contexts, such as religious and funerary art, and in using a wide variety of media, including stonework, carved wood, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[stained glass]], and [[embroidery]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', Macdonald and James Publishers (1977), pp. 253–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the abandonment of the [[joust]] as courtly practice at the beginning of the 17th century,  heraldic achievements, especially the [[helmet (heraldry)|heraldry]], ceased to be tied to the technological development or fashion of [[jousting armour]] and shapes of helmets became purely conventional, and in the various regional systems, separate types of helmets came to be tied to separate ranks of nobility.

[[Baroque]] heraldic designs became increasingly elaborate, both in terms of the increasingly complex [[division of the field]] and in terms of the surrounding achievements, culminating in the development of "landscape heraldry", incorporating realistic depictions of landscapes, during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century.

==Modern heraldry==

In the mid-19th century, there was  a renewed interest in the history of armory,
but now mostly from an [[antiquarian]]'s or [[genealogy|genealogist]]'s perspective. This led to a re-evaluation of older designs over Baroque and Roccoco styles, a new appreciation for the medieval origins of the art.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late nineteenth century, heraldry has focused on the use of varied lines of partition and little-used ordinaries to produce new and unique designs.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "heraldry" is sometimes used to include the [[national emblem]]s of modern states. Some modern states, especially constitutional monarchies, use national coats of arms (such as the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] or the [[coat of arms of Spain]]).
States with republican tradition tend to avoid coats of arms, using "national seals" or "national emblems" instead, such as the [[national emblem of France]], the [[national emblem of Turkey]] or the [[Great Seal of the United States]].

'''IDEF3''' or '''Integrated DEFinition for Process Description Capture Method''' is a [[business process modelling]] method complementary to [[IDEF0]].&lt;ref name="May03"&gt;[[Richard J. Mayer]] et al. (1993) [http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef3_fn.pdf Information Integration for Concurrent Engineering (IICE): IDEF3 Process Description Capture Method Report]. Logistics Research Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433&lt;/ref&gt; The IDEF3 method is a scenario-driven process flow description capture method intended to capture the knowledge about how a particular system works.&lt;ref name="FB89"&gt;Patricia Griffith Friel and Thomas M. Blinn (1989). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910023489_1991023489.pdf "Automated IDEF3 and IDEF4 Systems Design Specification Document"]. Technical report. NASA Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDEF3 method provides modes to represent both&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;
* Process Flow Descriptions to capture the relationships between actions within the context of a specific scenario, and
* Object State Transition to capture the description of the allowable states and conditions.

This method is part of the [[IDEF]] family of [[modeling language]]s in the field of [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]].

== Overview ==
One of the primary mechanisms used for descriptions of the world is relating a story in terms of an ordered sequence of events or activities. The IDEF3 Process Description Capture Method was created to capture descriptions of [[sequence]]s of activities, which is considered the common mechanisms to describe a situation or [[business process|process]]. The primary goal of IDEF3 is to provide a structured method by which a [[domain expert]] can express [[knowledge]] about the operation of a particular system or organization. [[Knowledge acquisition]] is enabled by direct capture of assertions about real-world processes and events in a form that is most natural for capture. IDEF3 supports this kind of knowledge acquisition by providing a reliable and wellstructured approach for process [[knowledge acquisition]], and an expressively, yet easy-to-use, language for [[information capture]] and expression.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;

Motives for the development of IDEF3 were the need:&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;
* to speed up the process of [[business systems modeling]],
* to provides mechanisms to describe this [[data life cycle]] information,
* to supported [[project management]] techniques by an automated tool, 
* to provide the concepts, syntax, and procedures for building [[system requirements]] descriptions, and 
* to work well both independently and jointly with other methods which address different areas of concentration (e.g., the [[IDEF0]] Function Modeling method) as a complementary addition to the [[IDEF]] method family.

== History ==
The original [[IDEF]]s were developed since the mid-1970s for the purpose of enhancing communication among people who needed to decide how their existing systems were to be integrated. [[IDEF0]] was designed to allow a graceful expansion of the description of a systems' functions through the process of function decomposition and categorization of the relations between functions (i.e., in terms of the Input, Output, Control, and Mechanism classification). [[IDEF1]] was designed to allow the description of the information that an organization deems important to manage in order to accomplish its objectives.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

The third [[IDEF]] ([[IDEF2]]) was originally intended as a user interface modeling method. However, since the [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) Program needed a simulation modeling tool, the resulting IDEF2 was a method for representing the time varying behavior of resources in a manufacturing system, providing a framework for specification of math model based simulations. It was the intent of the methodology program within [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing|ICAM]] to rectify this situation but limitation of funding did not allow this to happen. As a result, the lack of a method which would support the structuring of descriptions of the [[user view]] of a system has been a major shortcoming of the IDEF system. The basic problem from a methodology point of view is the need to distinguish between a description of what a system (existing or proposed) is supposed to do and a representative simulation model that will predict what a system will do. The latter was the focus of [[IDEF2]], the former is the focus of IDEF3.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

== IDEF3 basic concepts ==

=== Descriptions and models ===
[[File:1-2 IDEF3 Captures Multiple Viewpoints of a Process.jpg|thumb|320px|IDEF3 want to offer alternative descriptions of the same process from multiple viewpoints on the process.]]
The distinction between [[description]]s and [[Scientific modelling|model]]s, though subtle, is an important one in IDEF3, and both have a precise technical meaning.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt; 
* The term [[description]] is used as a reserved technical term to mean records of empirical observations; that is, descriptions record knowledge that originates in or is based on observations or experience. 
* The term [[Scientific modelling|model]] is used to mean an idealization of an entity or state of affairs. That is, a model constitutes an idealized system of objects, properties, and relations that is designed to imitate, in certain relevant respects, the character of a given real-world system. Frictionless planes, perfectly rigid bodies, the assumption of point mass, and so forth are representative examples of models.

The power of a [[Scientific modelling|model]] comes from its ability to simplify the real-world system it represents and to predict certain facts about that system by virtue of corresponding facts within the model. Thus, a model is a designed system in its own right. Models are idealized systems known to be incorrect but assumed to be close enough to provide reliable predictors for the predefined areas of interest within a domain. A [[description]], on the other hand, is a recording of facts or beliefs about something within the realm of an individual’s knowledge or experience. Such descriptions are generally incomplete; that is, the person giving a description may omit facts that he or she believes are irrelevant, or which were forgotten in the course of describing the system. Descriptions may also be inconsistent with respect to how others have observed situations within the domain. IDEF3 accommodates these possibilities by providing specific features enabling the capture and organization of alternative descriptions of the same scenario or process, see figure.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;

=== Description capture ===
[[File:1-3 IDEF 3’s Focus on Description Capture Enables Maximized Reuse.jpg|thumb|320px|IDEF focus on Description Capture enabling reuse.]]
Modeling necessitates taking additional steps beyond description capture to resolve conflicting or inconsistent views. This, in turn, generally requires modelers to select or create a single viewpoint and introduce artificial modeling approximations to fill in gaps where no direct knowledge or experience is available. Unlike models, descriptions are not constrained by idealized, testable conditions that must be satisfied, short of simple accuracy.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;

The purpose of description capture may be simply to record and communicate process knowledge or to identify inconsistencies in the way people understand how key processes actually operate. By using a description capture method users need not learn and apply conventions forcing them to produce executable models (e.g., conventions ensuring accuracy, internal consistency, logical coherence, non-redundancy, completeness). Forcing users to model requires them to adopt a model design perspective and risk producing models that do not accurately capture their empirical knowledge of the domain.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;

=== Scenarios ===
The notion of a scenario or story is used as the basic organizing structure for IDEF3 Process Descriptions. A scenario can be thought of as a recurring situation, a set of situations that describe a typical class of problems addressed by an organization or system, or the setting within which a process occurs. Scenarios establish the focus and boundary conditions of a description. Using scenarios in this way exploits the tendency of humans to describe what they know in terms of an ordered sequence of activities within the context of a given scenario or situation. Scenarios also provide a convenient vehicle to organize collections of process-centered knowledge.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;

=== Process-Centered Views ===
IDEF3 Process Schematics are the primary means for capturing, managing, and displaying process-centered knowledge. These schematics provide a graphical medium that helps domain experts and analysts from different application areas communicate knowledge about processes. This includes knowledge about events and activities, the objects that participate in those occurrences, and the constraining relations that govern the behavior of an occurrence.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;

=== Object-Centered Views ===
IDEF3 Object Schematics capture, manage, and display object-centered descriptions of a process—that is, information about how objects of various kinds are transformed into other kinds of things through a process, how objects of a given kind change states through a process, or context-setting information about important relations among objects in a process.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;

== IDEF3 process description language ==
IDEF3 descriptions are developed from two different perspectives: process-centered and object-centered. Because these approaches are not mutually exclusive, IDEF3 allows cross-referencing between them to represent complex process descriptions.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;

=== Process Schematics ===
Process schematics tend to be the most familiar and broadly used component of the IDEF3 method. These schematics provide a visualization mechanism for process-centered descriptions of a scenario. The graphical elements that comprise process schematics include Unit of Behavior (UOB) boxes, precedence links, junctions, referents, and notes. The building blocks here are:&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;
[[File:3-01a Symbols Used for IDEF3 Process Description Schematics.jpg|thumb|360px|Symbols Used for IDEF3 Process Description Schematics.]]
* Unit of Behavior (UOB) boxes
* Links : Links are the glue that connect UOB boxes to form representations of dynamic processes.
* Simple Precedence Links : Precedence links express temporal precedence relations between instances of one UOB and those of another.
* Activation Plots : Activation plots are used to represent activations.
* Dashed Links : Dashed links carry no predefined semantics.
* Link Numbers : All links have an elaboration and unique link numbers.
* Activation Semantics for Nonbranching Process Schematics.
* Junctions : Junctions in IDEF3 provide a mechanism to specify the logic of process branching.
* UOB Decompositions : Elaborations capture and structure detailed knowledge about processes.
* UOB Reference Numbering Scheme : A UOB box number is assigned to each UOB box in an IDEF3 Process Description.
* Partial Descriptions : UOB boxes are joined together by links. Since the description capture is the focus of IDEF3, it is possible to conceive of UOBs without links to other parts of an IDEF3 schematic.
* Referents : Referents enhance understanding, provide additional meaning, and simplify the construction (i.e., minimize clutter) of both process schematics and object schematics.

=== Object Schematics ===
IDEF offers a series of building blocks to express detailed object-centered process information; that is, information about how objects of various kinds are transformed into other kinds of things through a process, or how objects of a given kind change states through a process.&lt;ref name="May03"/&gt;
* Objects : An object of a certain kind, like a chassis, will be represented simply by a circle containing an appropriate label. 
* Object States : A certain kind of object being in a certain state will be represented by a circle with a label that captures the kind itself and a corresponding state, representing thereby the type, or class, of objects that are in that state. 
* Object schematics : The construction of complex representations built from kind symbols and object state symbols.
* Transition Schematics : The first and most basic construct is the basic state transition schematic or simply, transition schematic.

==History==
Envisioned to fulfill the requirements of scientists and engineers in the Indian Space Program, by offering undergraduate and postgraduate education and research programmes in space science and technology, the institute started functioning from the [[Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre]] (VSSC) campus, [[Thiruvananthapuram]], on 14 September 2007 with an initial investment of {{INRConvert|270|c|year=2007}} and annual recurring cost of {{INRConvert|40|c}} by the [[Department of Space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Institute of Space Science &amp; Tech to take off on Sept 14  |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/indian-institute-of-space-science-&amp;-tech-to-take-off-on-sept-14/213610/ |date=31 August 2007 |publisher=[[The Financial Express (India)|Financial Express]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only institute of its kind in India, which offers a BTech degree in [[Space Technology]], and subjects exclusive to the arena of space science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond engineering and medicine  |url=http://www.hindu.com/edu/2009/04/20/stories/2009042050240500.htm |date= 20 April 2009|publisher=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A launch pad for space scientists  |url=http://www.hindu.com/edu/2007/08/07/stories/2007080750010100.htm |date= 7 August 2007 |publisher= [[The Hindu]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. N. Suresh]], former director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, is the founding director of the institute.

On 14 July 2008, the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Union Human Resource Development Ministry]], on the advice of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC), conferred [[deemed university]] status, under a ''new'' category, to the institute for a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IISST) Thiruvananthapuram Declared as Deemed to be University  |url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=40292 |date=14 July 2008 |publisher=[[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Union Human Resource Development Ministry]], Press Information Bureau |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= IIST gets deemed university status |url= http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/15/stories/2008071550100100.htm|date=15 July 2008 |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
At its inception, the institute started functioning at the ATF Campus, under [[Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]] (Trivandrum), [[Kerala]]. Modern environmentally friendly buildings of unique architecture merge well with the thickly wooded campus of 100 acres situated on the foot hills of Sahyadri.

A state-of-the-art residential campus built near [[Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre]] in Valiamala, [[Nedumangad]], Thiruvananthapuram was inaugurated by [[Manmohan Singh|Dr. Manmohan Singh]], the then Prime Minister of India on 25 August 2009.&lt;ref name="hindu_sep09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/26/stories/2009082662400100.htm|title=Manmohan inaugurates new IIST campus|date=26 August 2009|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute started functioning in its new campus from 15 August 2010. The campus has an extension in the picturesque [[Ponmudi]] Hills, Thiruvananthapuram, for an observatory which is under construction.

==Academics==
IIST offers undergraduate ([[BTech]]), master's ([[MTech]]) and PhD programs in [[space science]] and [[Space technology|technology]], and also serves as a research centre.&lt;ref name="nie_aug09" /&gt; Doctoral programs in basic sciences and post-doctoral programs are also offered. Till 2013 batch, three different courses in BTech were offered, namely BTech in Aerospace, Avionics and Physical Sciences. As of 2014 admissions, a new 5-year Dual Degree (BTech + MTech/M.S) in Engineering Physics replaced the existing Physical Sciences branch. The MTech/M.S can be done in any of the following – M.S. in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, M.S. in Earth System Science, MTech in Machine learning and computing, M.S. in Solid State Physics or MTech in Optical Engineering. The seats are limited to 20 in the dual degree program from the existing 36 in Physical Sciences. 60 students each are admitted to the Aerospace and Avionics branches.

'''Industrial Toxicology Research Centre''' (ITRC) is now named as '''Indian Institute of Toxicology Research''' ('''IITR'''), Lucknow, India. The institute is engaged in the field of [[Toxicology]] having its main campus in [[Lucknow]] city and the other Gheru campus, is located near village 'Gheru' at [[List of National Highways in India|Lucknow-Kanpur highway]].

It is one of the constituent laboratory of [[CSIR India]], which was established in 1965 with the motto of "Safety to Environment &amp; Health and Service to Industry". The founder Director (1965–78) of the institute was '''Prof. Sibte Hasan Zaidi''' who died on 5 April 2008 at New York. He was the recipient of Padmashri and prestigious Sir Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar award for scientific excellence. IITR conducts Dr. S.H. Zaidi Oration in his honour every year during its foundation day celebrations on 4 November.

The institute is dedicated towards research in Fundamental and Applied Toxicology. Major thrust areas include Environmental toxicology, Ground and surface water pollution, Safety assessment of food &amp; additives, Toxicity evaluation of substances for human use, Microbial contaminations, Bioremediation, Hazard identification and Toxicogenomics.

The institute attracts students from all over India to pursue research. IITR offers Ph.D. programme in various areas, few to name are ''In vivo'' &amp; ''In vitro'' Toxicology, Environmental Toxicology, Genetic Toxicology, Immunotoxicology, Neurotoxicology, Food Toxicology, Environmental Microbiology and Carcinogenesis.

The institute also offers services for Toxicological and Analytical evaluation of chemicals / finished products to public and private sectors as per OECD, USEPA, BIS, ISO guidelines.

IITR became a reality in 1965 as Industrial Toxicology Research Centre (ITRC) located in Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow. The founder Director, Prof. Sibte Hasan Zaidi, could foresee the need to address health related to work environment of the industrial workers in post independence era of rapid industrialization in our country. It was advocated that the adverse effects of chemicals on health and environment will make an adverse impact on overall development of the country. Hence, studies were needed to develop strategies for sustainable industrial development. ITRC gained national importance by addressing the health problems of our industrial work force in a growing economy. Pioneering studies carried out during the formative years were directly linked to miners' health especially to respiratory ailments.

In [[computing]], '''kill pill''' is a term given to mechanisms and technologies designed to render [[Computer systems|systems]] useless either by user command, or under a predefined set of circumstances. Kill pill technology is most commonly used to disable lost or stolen devices for security purposes, but can also be used for the enforcement of rules and contractual obligations.

==Applications==

===Lost and stolen devices===
Kill pill technology is used prominently in [[smartphone]]s, especially in the disablement of lost or stolen devices. A notable example is [[Find My iPhone]], a service that allows the user to [[password]] protect or [[Data erasure|wipe]] their [[iDevice|iDevice(s)]] remotely, aiding in the protection of private data.&lt;ref name=FindMyiPhone&gt;{{cite web|title=iCloud - Find my iPhone|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/icloud/#find|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar applications exist for other smartphone [[Operating System|operating systems]], including [[Android (operating system)|Android]],&lt;ref name=Android5Ways&gt;{{cite web|last=Lightner|first=Rob|title=5 ways to help find your lost Android device|url=http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20095637-285/5-ways-to-help-find-your-lost-android-device/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BlackBerry OS|BlackBerry]],&lt;ref name=BlackBerryProtect&gt;{{cite web|title=BlackBerry Protect|url=http://ca.blackberry.com/devices/features/security/protect.html|publisher=BlackBerry Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Phone]].&lt;ref name=FindingLostMicrosoftPhone&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding a lost phone|url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-ca/how-to/wp7/basics/find-a-lost-phone|publisher=Microsoft Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-piracy measure===
Kill pill technology has been notably used as an [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|anti-piracy]] measure. [[Windows Vista]] was released with the ability to severely limit its own functionality if it was determined that the copy was obtained through [[Software piracy|piracy]]. The feature was later dropped after complaints that [[false positive]]s caused genuine copies of Vista to act as though they were pirated.&lt;ref name=VistaKillPill&gt;{{cite news|title='Kill switch' dropped from Vista|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7126902.stm|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal of malicious software===
The concept of a kill pill is also applied to the remote removal by a [[Server (computing)|server]] of malicious files or applications from a [[Client (computing)|client's]] system. Such technology is a standard component of most handheld computing devices, mainly due to their generally more limited operating systems and means of obtaining applications. Such functionality is also reportedly available to applications downloaded from the [[Windows Store]] on [[Windows 8]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=Win8KillSwitch&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Jordan|title=The Kill Switch Comes to the PC|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-02-17/the-kill-switch-comes-to-the-pc|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Businessweek|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
Kill pill technology is used frequently in [[Motor vehicle|vehicles]] for a variety of reasons. Remote vehicle disablement can be used to prevent a vehicle from starting, to prevent it from moving, and to prevent the vehicle's continued operation. Non-remotely, vehicles can require driver recognition before starting or moving, such as asking for a password or some form of [[biometrics]] from the driver.&lt;ref name=VehicleKillPill&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle Disabling Systems|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/systems-technology/product-guides/vehicle-disabling.htm|publisher=US Department of Transportation: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association|accessdate=13 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221084256/http://@fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/systems-technology/product-guides/vehicle-disabling.htm|archivedate=21 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kill pill technology is often used by governments to prevent [[drunk driving]] by repeat offenders as a punishment and deterrent. The installation of an [[ignition interlock device]]s is a sentencing alternative for drunk drivers in almost all 50 of the [[United States]]. Such a device requires the driver to blow into a [[breathalyzer]] before starting the vehicle. If the driver is found to be over the legal [[blood alcohol content]] limit, the vehicle will not start&lt;ref name=CarBreathalyzer&gt;{{cite news|last=Cordell|first=LaDoris|title=Baby, You Can't Drive Your Car|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2009/09/baby_you_cant_drive_your_car.html|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Kill pill technology can also be implemented to contextually disable certain aspects of a smartphone's functionality. A patent obtained by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] claims the ability to disable the antenna, screen, or camera of a smartphone in settings like theaters, schools, and areas of high security sensitivity.&lt;ref name=ApplePatent&gt;{{cite patent|country = US|number = 8254902|status = patent|title = Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Kill pill technology has been criticized for allowing for the suppression of personal liberties. While a kill pill can be utilized in a school setting to prevent academic dishonesty, it has been suggested that governments may also use it to suppress their people, for example, by disabling a phone's camera or antenna in the area of a protest.&lt;ref name=ApplePatentProtest&gt;{{cite news|last=Whittaker|first=Zack|title=Apple's patent could remotely disable protesters' phone cameras|url=http://www.zdnet.com/apple-patent-could-remotely-disable-protesters-phone-cameras-7000003640/|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=ZDNet|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to remotely remove files and applications from a user's device has also come under fire. Apple's apparent ability to [[blacklist]] applications, rendering them unusable on any iDevice, has raised concerns about the user's rights when downloading from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref name=AppleRemoteWipe&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|title=Apple Can Remotely Disable Apps Installed on Your iPhone|url=https://gizmodo.com/5034007/apple-can-remotely-disable-apps-installed-on-your-iphone|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Gizmodo|date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2014, no applications appear on Apple's blacklist website.

==Early life and education==
Parker attended [[Boston University|Boston University's]] College of Engineering and graduated in 1989.  He earned a Master of Science degree in 1993 and a doctoral degree in applied physics in 1998 from [[Vanderbilt University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/professor-and-paratrooper/|title=Professor and Paratrooper - BU Today - Boston University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/kkparker|title=Kit Parker|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Parker is a paratrooper who has served in the United States Army since 1992. After the [[September 11 attacks]], he served two tours of duty in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com/kevin-kit-parker|title=Le Laboratoire Cambridge - Art and Design Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his combat tours, Parker conducted two missions into Afghanistan as part of the [[Gray Team]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/10/481568316/how-a-team-of-elite-doctors-changed-the-military-s-stance-on-brain-trauma|title=How A Team Of Elite Doctors Changed The Military's Stance On Brain Trauma|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6064/news-summaries|title=News this Week|first=American Association for the Advancement of|last=Science|date=6 January 2012|publisher=|volume=335|issue=6064|pages=18|via=science.sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian career ==
Initially, at Harvard the focus of his research was heart muscle cells.  He turned to traumatic brain injury in 2005 after realizing that an Army friend of his, who had received injuries in an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] blast in [[Iraq]] in 2005, was suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition rather than a psychological problem.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/08/480608042/an-army-buddys-call-for-help-sends-a-scientist-on-brain-injury-quest|title=Shots: An Army Buddy's Call For Help Sends A Scientist On A Brain Injury Quest |last=Hamilton|first=Jon|date=8 June 2016|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geo&gt;{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Alexander |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/healing-soldiers/blast-force.html |title=Blast Force: The Invisible War on the Brain |newspaper=National Geographic magazine |date=February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other research of Parker's includes designing camouflage using skin cells of [[cuttlefish]] and the use of a cotton candy machine to make dressings for wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/where-science-meets-war-kit-parkers-lab/|title=Where science meets war: Kit Parker's lab|date=4 August 2013|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker served on the Defense Science Research Council for nearly a decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyss.harvard.edu/team/core-faculty/kevin-parker/|title=Kevin Kit Parker, Ph.D.|date=5 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Defense Science Board Task Force on Autonomy, and has consulted to other US government agencies as well as the medical device and pharma industry.

In 2011, Parker headed Harvard's committee for reintroducing [[ROTC]] at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stacy Teicher |last=Khadaroo |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2011/0330/ROTC-returns-to-Harvard-Does-officer-training-program-need-Ivy-League |title=ROTC returns to Harvard: Does officer training program need Ivy League? |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, it was announced that The Disease Biophysics Group at Harvard, led by Kit Parker, created a tissue-engineered soft-robotic ray that swims using wave-like fin motions, and turns according to externally applied light cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diseasebiophysics.seas.harvard.edu/research/living-soft-robots/|title=Living Soft Robots «  SEAS DBG|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''marine biology dredge''' is used to sample [[organism]]s living on a rocky bottom or burrowing within the smooth muddy floor of the [[ocean]] ([[benthic]]) species).The dredge is pulled by a boat and operates at any depth on a cable or line, generally with a hydraulic winch. The dredge digs into the ocean floor and bring the animals to the surface where they are caught in a net that either follows behind or is a part of the digging apparatus.

Early dredging samplers did not have  a closing device, and many organisms were washed out. This led to a mistaken impression that the deep-sea bed lacked species diversity, as theorised by Forbes in his [[Azoic hypothesis]]. Later samplers devised by Howard L. Sanders and the [[Epibenthic sled]] designed by Robert Hessler showed that deep-sea bottoms are sometimes rich in soft-bottom benthic species.

==History==
[[Image:HarveySeasideBook.jpg|thumb|left|"Naturalists using the dredge", a plate from [[William Henry Harvey]]'s ''The Seaside Book'']]
The first marine biology dredge was designed by [[Otto Friedrich Müller]] and in 1830 the results of two dredging expeditions undertaken by [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] and his friend [[Jean Victoire Audouin]] during 1826 and 1828 in the neighbourhood of [[Granville, Normandy|Granville]] were published. This was remarkable for clearly distinguishing the marine fauna of that portion of the French coast into four zones.

Müller's design was modified by the Dublin naturalist [[Robert Ball (naturalist)|Robert Ball]] in 1838 and at the Birmingham meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1839 a committee was appointed for dredging research with a view to the investigation of the marine zoology of Great Britain, the illustration of the geographical distribution of marine animals, and the more accurate determination of the fossils of the [[Pliocene]] period. The committee was led by [[Edward Forbes]]. Later annual reports of the British Association contained communications from the English, Scottish and Irish branches of the committee, and in 1850 Forbes submitted its first general report on British marine zoology. Ball's dredge was still in use in 1910.

In the 20th century the 'anchor-dredge' was developed to sample deep burrowing animals. It is not towed but digs in, and is released, in the manner of an anchor.

The wide variety of dredges and other benthic sampling equipment makes site comparison difficult.

The '''mechanical philosophy''' is a [[natural philosophy]] describing the universe as similar to a large-scale mechanism. Mechanical philosophy is associated with the [[scientific revolution]] of [[Early Modern]] Europe. One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] published in 1651.

Some [[Intellectual history |intellectual historians]] and [[Critical theory|critical theorists]] argue that early mechanical philosophy was tied to [[disenchantment]] and the rejection of the idea of nature as living or animated by spirits or [[angels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Merchant |first= Carolyn|date= 1990 |title= The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o_l2uMk2KjsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= Harper Collins |chapter= Chapters 4, 9, 10 |isbn= 0062505955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, have noted that early mechanical philosophers nevertheless believed in [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[Christianity]] and [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | chapter = Chapter 2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism and determinism ==
Some ancient philosophies held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. This view was closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the scientific revolution of the 17th century had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of "mechanical laws": natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that imply a [[determinism]].  If all phenomena can be explained entirely through the motion of matter under physical laws, as the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, all phenomena must be completely determined, past, present or future.

==Development of the mechanical philosophy==
{{details|corpuscularianism}}
The natural philosophers directly concerned with developing the mechanical philosophy were largely a French group, together with some of their personal connections. They included [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[René Descartes]]. Also involved were the English thinkers [[Sir Kenelm Digby]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Walter Charleton]]; and the Dutch natural philosopher [[Isaac Beeckman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret J. Osler|title=Divine Will and the Mechanical Philosophy: Gassendi and Descartes on Contingency and Necessity in the Created World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtPISpxGacAC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=7 June 2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-52492-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Boyle]] used "mechanical philosophers" to refer both to those with a theory of "corpuscles" or [[atom]]s of matter, such as Gassendi and Descartes, and those who did without such a theory. One common factor was the [[clockwork universe]] view. His meaning would be problematic in the cases of Hobbes and [[Galileo Galilei]]; it would include [[Nicolas Lemery]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]], as well as himself. Newton would be a transitional figure. Contemporary usage of "mechanical philosophy" dates back to 1952 and [[Marie Boas Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Fisher|title=Pierre Gassendi's Philosophy And Science: Atomism for Empiricists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fLSO6y6DhUC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11996-3|pages=205 with note 1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the mechanical philosophy spread mostly through private academies and salons; in England in the [[Royal Society]]. In England it did not have a large initial impact in universities, which were somewhat more receptive in France, the Netherlands and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy Porter|author2=Katharine Park|author3=Lorraine Daston|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kvjAp92zcYC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=3 July 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57244-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobbes and the mechanical philosophy===
One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) by Hobbes (1651); the book's second chapter invokes the [[principle of inertia]], foundational for the mechanical philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Patricia Springborg |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes's Leviathan |date= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-54521-1 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle did not mention him as one of the group; but at the time they were on opposite sides of a controversy. [[Richard Westfall]] deems him a mechanical philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sophie. Roux|author2=Daniel Garber|title=The Mechanization of Natural Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USOoK5tRabAC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-4345-8|page=11 note 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes's major statement of his natural philosophy is in ''[[De Corpore]]'' (1655).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Garber|title=The Cambridge history of seventeenth-century philosophy: Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC&amp;pg=PA581|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53720-9|page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part II and III of this work he goes a long way towards identifying fundamental [[physics]] with [[geometry]]; and he freely mixes concepts from the two areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Janiak|author2=Eric Schliesser|title=Interpreting Newton: Critical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5IskjtmGJoC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76618-0|page=34 with note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes and the mechanical philosophy===
Descartes was also a mechanist. A [[substance dualist]], he argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

===Beeckman and the mechanical philosophy===
Isaac Beeckman's theory of mechanical philosophy described in his books ''Centuria'' and ''Journal'' is grounded in two components: matter and motion.  To explain matter, Beeckman relied on  atomism philosophy which explains that matter is composed of tiny inseparable particles that interact to create the objects seen in life.  To explain motion, he supported the idea of inertia, a theory generated by Isaac Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkel|first=Klaas|date=2013|title=Isaac Beeckman on Matter and Motion : Mechanical Philosophy in the Making|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/lib/umr-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3318707.|journal=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=|pages=76-77|via=ProQuest Ebook Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton and the mechanical philosophy===
[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a weaker notion of mechanism that tolerated the [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. Interpretations of Newton's scientific work in light of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies|his occult research]] have suggested that he did not properly view the universe as mechanistic, but instead populated by mysterious forces and spirits and constantly sustained by God and angels.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of philosophers who were influenced by Newton example were nonetheless often mechanists. Among them were [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]].

==The mechanist thesis==
The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated some implications of the mechanist thesis, writing:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

A '''medical test''' is a  [[medical procedure]] performed to [[screening (medicine)|detect]], [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]], or [[monitoring (medicine)|monitor]] diseases, disease processes, susceptibility, or to determine a course of treatment. Medical tests relate to [[clinical chemistry]] and [[molecular diagnostics]], and are typically performed in a [[medical laboratory]].

==Types of tests==

===By purpose===
Medical tests can be classified by their purposes, the most common of which are diagnosis, screening and evaluation.

====Diagnostic====
[[Image:Lung scintigraphy keosys.JPG|thumb|Lung [[scintigraphy]] evaluating lung cancer]]
A [[diagnostic test]] is a procedure performed to confirm or determine the presence of disease in an individual suspected of having a disease, usually following the report of symptoms, or based on other medical test results.&lt;ref name="anc"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Gwaiz LA, Babay HH |title=The diagnostic value of absolute neutrophil count, band count and morphological changes of neutrophils in predicting bacterial infections |journal=Med Princ Pract |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=344–347 |year=2007 |pmid=17709921 |doi=10.1159/000104806 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/ Harvard.edu]&lt;br&gt;Guide to Diagnostic Tests from Harvard Health&lt;/ref&gt; This includes [[posthumous diagnosis]]. Examples of such tests are:

* Using [[nuclear medicine]] to examine a patient suspected of having a [[lymphoma]].
* Measuring the [[blood sugar]] in a person suspected of having [[diabetes mellitus]] after periods of increased [[urination]].
* Taking a [[complete blood count]] of an individual experiencing a high [[fever]] to check for a [[bacterial infection]].&lt;ref name="anc" /&gt;
* Monitoring [[electrocardiogram]] readings on a patient suffering [[chest pain]] to diagnose or determine any [[heart]] irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/electrocardiogram-ekg Harvard.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Screening====
{{Main|Screening (medicine)}}
[[screening (medicine)|Screening]] refers to a medical test or series of tests used to detect or predict the presence of disease in at risk individuals within a defined group such as a population, family, or workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ratcliffe JM, Halperin WE, Frazier TM, Sundin DS, Delaney L, Hornung RW |title=The prevalence of screening: a report from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and the Health National Occupational Hazard Survey |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=906–912 |year=1986 |pmid=3021937 |doi=10.1097/00043764-198610000-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/medicalsurveillance/screening.html Osha.gov]&lt;br&gt;
US Dept. of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Admin.&lt;/ref&gt; Screenings may be performed to monitor disease prevalence, manage epidemiology, aid in prevention, or strictly for statistical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy LI, Halperin WE |title=Medical Screening and Biological Monitoring: A guide to the literature for physicians |journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=170–184 |year=1995 |pmid=7655958 |doi=10.1097/00043764-199502000-00016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of screenings include measuring the level of [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] in the [[blood]] of a newborn [[infant]] as part of [[newborn screening]] for [[congenital hypothyroidism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moltz KC, Postellon DC |title=Congenital hypothyroidism and mental development |journal=[[Comprehensive Therapy]] |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=342–346 |year=1994 |pmid=8062543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; checking for [[Lung cancer]] in non-smoking individuals who are exposed to [[Passive smoke|second-hand smoke]] in an unregulated working environment, and [[Pap test|Pap smear]] screening for prevention or early detection of [[cervical cancer]].

====Monitoring====
{{Main|Monitoring (medicine)}}
Some medical tests are used to [[monitoring (medicine)|monitor]] the progress of, or response to [[therapy|medical treatment]].

===By method===
Most test methods can be classified into one of the following broad groups:
*Patient observations, which may be photographed or recorded
* Questions asked when taking an individual’s [[medical history]]
* Tests performed in a [[physical examination]]
* [[Radiologic]] tests, in which, for example, [[x-rays]] are used to form an image of a body target. These tests often involve administration of a [[Contrast medium|contrast agent]].
* '''In vivo diagnostics''' which test in the body, such as:
** [[Manometry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-17-25-22423 OSA | Design of a high-sensor count fibre optic manometry catheter for in-vivo colonic diagnostics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Administering a diagnostic agent and measuring the body's response, as in the [[gluten challenge test]], [[contraction stress test]], [[bronchial challenge test]], [[oral food challenge]], or the [[ACTH stimulation test]].
* '''{{Vanchor|In vitro diagnostics}}''' which test a sample of tissue or bodily fluids,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:331:0001:0037:EN:PDF Directive 98/79/CE on in vitro diagnostic medical devices]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edma-ivd.be/#/About-In-Vitro-Diagnostics]&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
**[[Microbiological culture|Microbiological culturing]], which determines the presence or absence of microbes in a sample from the body, and usually targeted at detecting [[pathogenic bacteria]].
** [[Genetic testing]]
** Blood [[Glucose]] testing &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labtestsonline.org.uk/understanding/analytes/glucose/tab/test Glucose Tests: The Test&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Liver function testing &lt;ref name="labtestsonline.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.labtestsonline.org.uk/understanding/analytes/liver-panel/ Liver Function Tests: At a Glance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Calcium]] testing &lt;ref name="labtestsonline.org.uk"/&gt;
** Testing for electrolytes in the blood, such as Sodium, Potassium, Creatinine, and Urea &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labtestsonline.org.uk/understanding/analytes/lytes Electrolytes: At a Glance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===By sample location===
In vitro tests can be classified according to the location of the sample being tested, including:
*[[Blood test]]s
*[[Urinalysis|Urine tests]], including naked eye exam of the urine
*[[Stool test]]s, including naked eye exam of the feces
*[[Sputum]] ([[phlegm]]), including naked eye exam of the sputum

==Accuracy and precision==
{{Main|Accuracy and precision}}
*'''Accuracy''' of a laboratory test is its correspondence with the true value. Accuracy is maximized by calibrating laboratory equipment with reference material and by participating in external quality control programs.
*'''Precision''' of a test is its reproducibility when it is repeated on the same sample. An imprecise test yields widely varying results on repeated measurement. Precision is monitored in laboratory by using control material.

==Detection and quantification==
Tests performed in a [[physical examination]] are usually aimed at detecting a [[symptom]] or [[Medical sign|sign]], and in these cases, a test that detects a symptom or sign is designated a [[positive test]], and a test that indicated absence of a symptom or sign is designated a [[negative medical test|negative test]], as further detailed in separate section below.

A quantification of a target substance, a cell type or another specific entity is a common output of, for example, most [[blood test]]s. This is not only answering ''if'' a target entity is present or absent, but also ''how much'' is present. In blood tests, the quantification is relatively well specified, such as given in [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]], while most other tests may be quantifications as well although less specified, such as a sign of being "very [[Pallor|pale]]" rather than "slightly pale". Similarly, radiologic images are technically quantifications of radiologic opacity of tissues.

Especially in the taking of a [[medical history]], there is no clear limit between a detecting or quantifying test versus rather ''descriptive'' information of an individual. For example, questions regarding the occupation or social life of an individual may be regarded as tests that can be regarded as positive or negative for the presence of various risk factors, or they may be regarded as "merely" descriptive, although the latter may be at least as clinically important.

===Positive or negative===
The result of a test aimed at detection of an entity may be '''positive''' or '''negative''': this has nothing to do with a bad [[prognosis]], but rather means that the test worked or not, and a certain parameter that was evaluated was present or not. For example, a negative [[screening test]] for [[breast cancer]] means that no sign of breast cancer could be found (which is in fact very positive for the patient).

The classification of tests into either positive or negative gives a [[binary classification]], with resultant ability to perform [[bayesian probability]] and performance metrics of tests, including calculations of [[sensitivity and specificity]].

===Continuous values===
Tests whose results are of continuous values, such as most [[blood values]], can be interpreted as they are, or they can be [[Artificially binary value|converted to a binary ones]] by defining a [[cutoff (reference value)|cutoff value]], with test results being designated as positive or negative depending on whether the resultant value is higher or lower than the cutoff.

==Interpretation==
{{Further|Pre- and post-test probability}}
In the finding of a ''[[pathognomonic]]'' sign or symptom it is almost certain that the target condition is present, and in the absence of finding a ''[[sine qua non]]'' sign or symptom it is almost certain that the target condition is absent. In reality, however, the subjective probability of the presence of a condition is never exactly 100% or 0%, so tests are rather aimed at estimating a [[post-test probability]] of a condition or other entity.

Most diagnostic tests basically use a [[reference group]] to establish performance data such as [[predictive values]], [[likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratios]] and [[relative risk]]s, which are then used to interpret the post-test probability for an individual.

In monitoring tests of an individual, the test results from previous tests on that individual may be used as a reference to interpret subsequent tests.

==Risks==
Some medical testing procedures have associated health risks, and even require [[general anesthesia]], such as the [[mediastinoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/mediastinoscopy.htm Harvard.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Other tests, such as the [[blood test]] or [[pap smear]] have little to no direct risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/pap-smear.htm|title=Diagnostic Tests &gt; Pap Smear |publisher=[[Harvard University]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608072504/http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/pap-smear.htm|archivedate=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical tests may also have [[Screening (medicine)#Adverse effects of screening|indirect risks]], such as the stress of testing, and riskier tests may be required as follow-up for a (potentially) [[false positive]] test result. Consult the health care provider (including [[physician]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, and [[nurse practitioner]]s) prescribing any test for further information.

==Indications==
Each test has its own [[Indication (medicine)|indication]]s and contraindications.  An ''indication'' is a valid medical reason to perform the test.  A ''contraindication'' is a valid medical reason to reject the test.  For example, a basic [[cholesterol test]] may be ''indicated'' (medically appropriate) for a middle-aged person.  However, if the same test was performed on that person very recently, then the existence of the previous test is a contraindication for the test (a medically valid reason to not perform it).

[[Information bias (psychology)|Information bias]] is the [[cognitive bias]] that causes healthcare providers to order tests that produce information that they do not realistically expect or intend to use for the purpose of making a medical decision.  Medical tests are indicated when the information they produce will be used.  For example, a screening mammogram is not indicated (not medically appropriate) for a woman who is dying, because even if breast cancer is found, she will die before any cancer treatment could begin.

In a simplified fashion, how much a test is indicated for an individual depends largely on its ''net benefit'' for that individual.  Tests are chosen when the expected benefit is greater than the expected harm.  The net benefit may roughly be estimated by:

&lt;math&gt; b_n = \Delta p \times r_i \times ( b_i - h_i ) - h_t&lt;/math&gt;

, where:
*''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the net benefit of performing a test
*''Λp'' is the absolute difference between [[pre- and posttest probability]] of conditions (such as diseases) that the test is expected to achieve. A major factor for such an absolute difference is the power of the test itself, such as can be described in terms of, for example, [[sensitivity and specificity]] or [[Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratio]]. Another factor is the pre-test probability, with a lower pre-test probability resulting in a lower absolute difference, with the consequence that even very powerful tests achieve a low absolute difference for very unlikely conditions in an individual (such as [[rare disease]]s in the absenceower can make a great difference for highly suspected conditions. The probabilities in this sense may also need to be considered in context of conditions that are not primary targets of the test, such as [[Differential diagnosis#profile-relative probability|profile-relative probabilities in a differential diagnostic procedure]].
*''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the rate of how much ''probability differences'' are expected to result in ''changes in interventions'' (such as a change from "no treatment" to "administration of low-dose medical treatment"). For example, if the only expected effect of a medical test is to make one disease more likely compared to another, but the two diseases have the same treatment (or neither can be treated), then, this factor is very low and the test is probably without value for the individual in this aspect.
*''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the benefit of ''changes in interventions'' for the individual
*''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the harm of ''changes in interventions'' for the individual, such as [[side effects]] of medical treatment
*''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the harm caused by the test itself.

Some additional factors that influence a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not included: cost of the test, availability of additional tests, potential interference with subsequent test (such as an [[abdominal palpation]] potentially inducing intestinal activity whose sounds interfere with a subsequent [[abdominal auscultation]]), time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. The possible benefits of a diagnostic test may also be weighed against the costs of unnecessary tests and resulting unnecessary follow-up and possibly even unnecessary treatment of incidental findings.&lt;ref name="pmid12783911"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jarvik J, Hollingworth W, Martin B, Emerson S, Gray D, Overman S, Robinson D, Staiger T, Wessbecher F, Sullivan S, Kreuter W, Deyo R |title=Rapid magnetic resonance imaging vs radiographs for patients with low back pain: a randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=21 |pages=2810–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12783911 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.21.2810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, tests being performed are expected to have no benefit for the individual being tested.  Instead, the results may be useful for the establishment of statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals. Patients may give [[informed consent]] to undergo medical tests that will benefit other people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69360">'''Music education''' is a field of study associated with the [[teaching]] and [[learning]] of [[music]].  It touches on all learning domains, including the psychomotor domain (the development of skills), the cognitive domain (the acquisition of knowledge), and, in particular and significant ways, the affective domain (the learner's willingness to receive, internalize, and share what is learned), including [[music appreciation]] and sensitivity.  Music training from preschool through post-secondary education is common in most nations because involvement with music is considered a fundamental component of human [[culture]] and [[human behavior|behavior]]. Cultures from around the world have different approaches to music education, largely due to the varying histories and politics. Studies show that teaching music from other cultures can help students perceive unfamiliar sounds more comfortably, and they also show that musical preference is related to the language spoken by the listener and the other sounds they are exposed to within their own culture.

During the 20th century, many distinctive approaches were developed or further refined for the teaching of music, some of which have had widespread impact. The Dalcroze method ([[eurhythmics]]) was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. The [[Kodály Method]] emphasizes the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. The [[Orff Schulwerk]] "approach" to music education leads students to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music.

The [[Suzuki method]] creates the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language.  Gordon Music Learning Theory provides the music teacher with a method for teaching musicianship through ''[[audiation]]'', Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind ''with understanding''. Conversational Solfège immerses students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American. The Carabo-Cone Method involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard.  The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.&lt;ref name="Madeleine"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED034358&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED034358|title=A Sensory-Motor Approach to Music Learning.

Some have suggested that certain musical activities can help to improve breath, body and voice control of a child.&lt;ref&gt;Oaklander, Violet.

The [[MMCP]] (Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project) aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving. 

== Overview ==
In [[primary schools]] in [[Western world|European]] countries, children often learn to play instruments such as [[Music keyboard|keyboards]] or [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the elements of music and [[history of music]]. In countries such as [[India]], the [[harmonium]] is used in schools, but instruments like keyboards and violin are also common. Students are normally taught basics of [[Hindustani classical music|Indian Raga music]]. In [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s, students may often have the opportunity to perform in some type of [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[choir]], [[orchestra]], or [[school band]]: [[concert band]], [[marching band]], or [[jazz band]]. In some secondary schools, additional music classes may also be available. In [[junior high school]] or its equivalent, music usually continues to be a required part of the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="HDoM"&gt;Randel, D. (Ed.) (1986). Education in the United States. In '''''The New Harvard Dictionary of Music''''' (pp. 276–278). London/Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[university]] level, students in most arts and humanities programs receive academic credit for music courses such as music history, typically of Western art music, or [[music appreciation]], which focuses on listening and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities offer music ensembles – such as choir, concert band, marching band, or orchestra – that are open to students from various fields of study. Most universities also offer degree programs in music education, certifying students as primary and secondary music educators. Advanced degrees such as the [[D.M.A.]] or the [[Ph.D]] can lead to university employment. These degrees are awarded upon completion of music theory, music history, technique classes, private instruction with a specific instrument, ensemble participation, and in depth observations of experienced educators. Music education departments in North American and European universities also support interdisciplinary research in such areas as [[music psychology]], music education [[historiography]], educational [[ethnomusicology]], [[sociomusicology]], and [[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|philosophy of education]].

The study of western art music is increasingly common in music education outside of North America and Europe, including Asian nations such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of outside the Western art music canon, including [[music of West Africa]], of Indonesia (e.g. [[Gamelan music]]), Mexico (e.g., [[mariachi]] music), Zimbabwe ([[marimba]] music), as well as [[popular music]].

Music education also takes place in individualized, lifelong learning, and in community contexts. Both amateur and professional musicians typically take [[music lessons]], short private sessions with an individual teacher.

==Instructional methodologies==
While instructional strategies are determined by the music teacher and the music [[curriculum]] in his or her area, many teachers rely heavily on one of many instructional [[methodology|methodologies]] that emerged in recent generations and developed rapidly during the latter half of the 20th Century.

===Major international music education methods===

====Dalcroze method====
{{Main|eurhythmics}}
The Dalcroze method was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. The method is divided into three fundamental concepts − the use of [[solfège]], improvisation, and [[eurhythmics]]. Sometimes referred to as "rhythmic gymnastics," eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that engages all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic. According to the Dalcroze method, music is the fundamental language of the human brain and therefore deeply connected to who we are. American proponents of the Dalcroze method include Ruth Alperson, Ann Farber, Herb Henke, Virginia Mead, Lisa Parker, Martha Sanchez, and Julia Schnebly-Black.  Many active teachers of Dalcroze method were trained by Dr. Hilda Schuster who was one of the students of Dalcroze.

====Kodály method====
{{Main|Kodály method}}
[[File:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Curwen's Solfège hand signs. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]
[[Zoltán Kodály]] (1882–1967) was a prominent [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] music educator and composer who stressed the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. Although not really an educational method, his teachings reside within a fun, educational framework built on a solid grasp of basic [[music theory]] and [[music notation]] in various verbal and written forms. Kodály's primary goal was to instill a lifelong love of music in his students and felt that it was the duty of the child's school to provide this vital element of education. Some of Kodály's trademark teaching methods include the use of [[solfège]] hand signs, musical shorthand notation (stick notation), and rhythm [[solmization]] (verbalization). Most countries have used their own folk music traditions to construct their own instruction sequence, but the United States primarily uses the Hungarian sequence. The work of Denise Bacon, Katinka S. Daniel, John Feierabend, Jean Sinor, Jill Trinka, and others brought Kodaly's ideas to the forefront of music education in the United States.

====Orff Schulwerk====
{{Main|Orff Schulwerk}}
[[Carl Orff]] was a prominent German composer. Orff Schulwerk is considered an "approach" to music education. It begins with a student's innate abilities to engage in rudimentary forms of music, using basic rhythms and melodies. Orff considers the whole body a percussive instrument and students are led to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music. The approach fosters student self-discovery, encourages improvisation, and discourages adult pressures and mechanical drill. [[Carl Orff]] developed a special group of instruments, including modifications of the [[glockenspiel]], [[xylophone]], [[metallophone]], [[drum]], and other [[percussion instrument]]s to accommodate the requirements of the Schulwerk courses. Experts in shaping an American-style Orff approach include Jane Frazee, Arvida Steen, and Judith Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/orff-approach-emc/ "Orff Approach"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.  Doreen Hall, Keith Bissell, Emily-Jane Orford. 02/07/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suzuki method====
{{Main|Suzuki method}}
The Suzuki method was developed by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] in Japan shortly after World War II, and uses music education to enrich the lives and [[moral character]] of its students.  The movement rests on the double premise that "all children can be well educated" in music, and that learning to play music at a high level also involves learning certain character traits or virtues which make a person's soul more beautiful.  The primary method for achieving this is centered around creating the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language.  This 'ideal' environment includes love, high-quality examples, praise, rote training and repetition, and a time-table set by the student's developmental readiness for learning a particular technique. While the Suzuki Method is quite popular internationally, within Japan its influence is less significant than the Yamaha Method, founded by [[Genichi Kawakami]] in association with the [[Yamaha Music Foundation]].

===Other notable methods===
In addition to the four major international methods described above, other approaches have been influential. Lesser-known methods are described below:

====Gordon's Music Learning Theory====
{{Main|Gordon Music Learning Theory}}
Edwin Gordon's Music Learning Theory is based on an extensive body of research and field testing by Edwin E. Gordon and others in the larger field of [[Music Learning Theory]]. It provides music teachers with a comprehensive framework for teaching musicianship through [[Gordon Music Learning Theory#audiation|audiation]], Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind with understanding and comprehension when the sound is not physically present.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Azzara, Audiation, Improvisation, and Music Learning Theory. 1991, The Quarterly, 2(1–2), 106–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of instructions is Discrimination Learning and Inference Learning. Discrimination Learning, the ability to determine whether two elements are the same or not the same using aural/oral, verbal association, partial synthesis, symbolic association, and composite synthesis. Inference Learning, students take an active role in their own education and learn to identify, create, and improvise unfamiliar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Willie J. |title=Gordon's Music Learning on Piano |url=https://pianoin21days.com/how-to-play-piano/ |website=PI21 |publisher=Owensboro |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills and content sequences within the Audiation theory help music teachers establish sequential curricular objectives in accord with their own teaching styles and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giml.org/home.php GIML: The Gordon Institute for Music Learning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824082226/http://www.giml.org/home.php |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There also is a Learning Theory for Newborns and Young Children in which the Types and Stages of Preparatory Audiation are outlined.

====World Music Pedagogy====
The growth of cultural diversity within school-age populations prompted music educators from the 1960s onward to diversify the music curriculum, and to work with ethnomusicologists and artist-musicians to establish instructional practices rooted in musical traditions.  'World music pedagogy' was coined by [[Patricia Shehan Campbell]] to describe world music content and practice in elementary and secondary school music programs.  Pioneers of the movement, especially Barbara Reeder Lundquist, William M. Anderson, and Will Schmid, influenced a second generation of music educators (including J. Bryan Burton, Mary Goetze, Ellen McCullough-Brabson, and Mary Shamrock) to design and deliver curricular models to music teachers of various levels and specializations. The pedagogy advocates the use of human resources, i.e., "culture-bearers," as well as deep and continued listening to archived resources such as those of Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Teaching Music Globally (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conversational Solfège====
Influenced by both the Kodály method and Gordon's Music Learning Theory, Conversational Solfège was developed by Dr. John M. Feierabend, former chair of music education at the [[Hartt School]], [[University of Hartford]].  The program begins by immersing students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American.  Music is seen as separate from, and more fundamental than, notation.  In twelve learning stages, students move from hearing and singing music to decoding and then creating music using spoken syllables and then standard written notation. Rather than implementing the Kodály method directly, this method follows Kodály's original instructions and builds on America's own folk songs instead of on Hungarian folk songs.

==== Carabo-Cone Method ====
This early-childhood approach, sometimes referred to as the Sensory-Motor Approach to Music, was developed by the violinist Madeleine Carabo-Cone.  This approach involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard.  The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.&lt;ref name="Madeleine"/&gt;

====Popular Music Pedagogy====
{{Main|Popular music pedagogy}}
'Popular music pedagogy' — alternatively called rock music pedagogy, modern band, popular music education, or rock music education — is a recent development in music education consisting of the systematic teaching and learning of [[rock music]] and other forms of [[popular music]] both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Popular music pedagogy tends to emphasize group improvisation,&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee and Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Free to be Musical: Group Improvisation in Music (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and is more commonly associated with community music activities than fully institutionalized school music ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee, Community Music: In Theory and in Practice (Oxford University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MMCP ====
{{Main|MMCP}}
The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project was developed in 1965 as a response to declining student interest in school music. This creative approach aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving.  Rather than imparting factual knowledge, this method centers around the student, who learns through investigation, experimentation, and discovery.  The teacher gives a group of students a specific problem to solve together and allows freedom to create, perform, improvise, conduct, research, and investigate different facets of music in a spiral curriculum. MMCP is viewed as the forerunner to projects in creative music composition and improvisation activities in schools.

==History of music education in the United States==

===18th century===
After the preaching of Reverend Thomas Symmes, the first singing school was created in 1717 in [[Boston]]  for the purposes of improving singing and music reading in the church. These singing schools gradually spread throughout the colonies.  Music education continued to flourish with the creation of the Academy of Music in Boston. Reverend John Tufts published ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes Using Non-Traditional Notation'' which is regarded as the first music textbook in the colonies. Between 1700 and 1820, more than 375 tune books would be published by such authors as Samuel Holyoke, Francis Hopkinson, William Billings, and Oliver Holden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201838/http://www.bsu.edu/classes/bauer/hpmused/colonial.html The Colonial Period: 1600-1800] - Timeline: Music Education History/Philosophy (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

Music began to spread as a curricular subject into other school districts. Soon after music expanded to all grade levels and the teaching of music reading was improved until the music curriculum grew to include several activities in addition to music reading. By the end of 1864 public school music had spread throughout the country.

===19th century===
In 1832, [[Lowell Mason]] and George Webb formed the [[Boston Academy of Music]] with the purposes of teaching singing and theory as well as methods of teaching music.  Mason published his ''Manuel of Instruction'' in 1834 which was based upon the music education works of Pestalozzian System of Education founded by Swiss educator [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].  This handbook gradually became used by many singing school teachers. From 1837–1838, the Boston School Committee allowed Lowell Mason to teach music in the Hawes School as a demonstration.  This is regarded as the first time music education was introduced to public schools in the United States.  In 1838 the Boston School Committee approved the inclusion of music in the curriculum and Lowell Mason became the first recognized supervisor of elementary music.  In later years [[Luther Whiting Mason]] became the Supervisor of Music in Boston and spread music education into all levels of public education (grammar, primary, and high school).  During the middle of the 19th century, Boston became the model to which many other cities across the United States included and shaped their public school music education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Martha Chrisman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3344928 "Portrait of a Nineteenth-Century School Music Program"], Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Summer, 1990), pp. 79–89, MENC: The National Association for Music Education&lt;/ref&gt; Music methodology for teachers as a course was first introduced in the [[Normal School]] in Potsdam. The concept of classroom teachers in a school that taught music under the direction of a music supervisor was the standard model for public school music education during this century. (See also: ''[[Music education in the United States]]'') While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, "later, it was accepted that [[Women in music|women would have a role in music education]], and they became involved in this field...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;

===Early 20th century===
In the United States, teaching colleges with four-year degree programs developed from the Normal Schools and included music.  [[Oberlin Conservatory]] first offered the Bachelor of Music Education degree. Osbourne G. McCarthy, an American music educator, introduced details for studying music for credit in Chelsea High School.  Notable events in the history of music education in the early 20th century also include:
* Founding of the Music Supervisor's National Conference (changed to Music Educators National Conference in 1934, later [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]] in 1998, and currently [http://nafme.org/ The National Association for Music Education – NAfME]) in [[Keokuk, Iowa]] in 1907.
* Rise of the school band and orchestra movement leading to performance oriented school music programs.
* Growth in music [[method (music)|methods]] publications.
* [[Frances Elliot Clark]] develops and promotes phonograph record libraries for school use.
* [[Carl Seashore]] and his ''Measures of Musical Talent'' music aptitude test starts testing people in music.

Music course offerings and even entire degree programs in [[online music education]] developed in the first decade of the 21st century at various institutions, and the fields of [[world music pedagogy]] and [[popular music pedagogy]] have also seen notable expansion.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, social aspects of teaching and learning music came to the fore. This emerged as praxial music education,&lt;ref&gt;http://bern.library.nenu.edu.cn/upload/soft/0000/11.1goble{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[1].pdf&lt;/ref&gt; critical theory,&lt;ref&gt;http://users.rider.edu/~vrme/v6n1/visions/Regelski%20Critical%20Theory%20as%20a%20Foundation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/1461380032000182849 | volume=6 | title=Feminist theory in music education research: grrl‐illa games as nomadic practice (or how music education fell from grace) | journal=Music Education Research | pages=67–79| year=2007 | last1=Gould | first1=Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of importance are the colloquia and journals of the MayDay Group, "an international think tank of music educators that aims to identify, critique, and change taken-for-granted patterns of professional activity, polemical approaches to method and philosophy, and educational politics and public pressures that threaten effective practice and critical communication in music education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maydaygroup.org/about-us/|title=About the MayDay Group – Mayday Group|author=|date=|website=www.maydaygroup.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a new focus on social aspects of music education, scholars have analyzed critical aspects such as music and race,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bradley5_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; gender,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Lamb3_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0027432112442944 | volume=98 | issue=4 | title=Social Class and School Music | journal=Music Educators Journal | pages=33–37| year=2012 | last1=Bates | first1=Vincent C }}&lt;/ref&gt; institutional belonging,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Froehlich6_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bates10_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Institutional music education was started in colonial India by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] after he founded the [[Visva-Bharati University]]. At present, most universities have a faculty of music with some universities specially dedicated to fine arts such as [[Indira Kala Sangeet University]], [[Swathi Thirunal College of Music]] or [[Rabindra Bharati University]].[[Indian classical music]] is based on the [[Guru Shishya parampara|gurushyshyaparampara]] system. The [[teacher]], known as [[Guru]], transmit the musical knowledge to the student, or shyshya. This is still the main system used in [[India]] to transmit musical knowledge. Although European art music became popularized in schools throughout much of the world during the twentieth century (East Asia, Latin America, Oceania, Africa), India remains one of the few highly populated nations in which non-European indigenous music traditions have consistently received relatively greater emphasis. That said, there is certainly much western influence in the popular music associated with [[Bollywood]] film scores.

==Africa==
The [[South African Department of Education]] and the ILAM Music Heritage Project SA teach African music using western musical framework. ILAM's ''Listen and Learn'' for students 11–14 is "unique" in teaching curriculum requirements for western music using recordings of traditional African music.&lt;ref&gt;''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' ed. Jonathan McCollum and [[David G. Hebert]], p.325&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time that Africa was colonized up to 1994, indigenous music and arts being taught in schools was a rare occurrence. The African National Congress (ANC) attempted to repair the neglect of indigenous knowledge and the overwhelming emphasis on written musical literacy in schools. It is not well known that the learning of indigenous music actually has a philosophy and teaching procedure that is different from western “formal” training. It involves the whole community because indigenous songs are about the history of its people. After the colonization of Africa, music became more centered on Christian beliefs and European folk songs, rather than the more improvised and fluid indigenous music.  Before the major changes education went through from 1994 to 2004, during the first decade of the democratic government, teachers were trained as classroom teachers and told that they would have to incorporate music into other subject areas. The few colleges with teaching programs that included instrumental programs held a greater emphasis on music theory, history of western music, western music notation, and less on making music. Up until 1999, most college syllabi did not include training in indigenous South African Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=Anri|last2=de Wet|first2=Jacques|last3=Rijsdijk|first3=Susan|title=A Survey of Music Education in the Primary Schools of South Africa's Cape Peninsula|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|date=2005|volume=53|issue=3|pages=260–283|doi=10.2307/3598684|jstor=3598684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In African cultures music is seen as a community experience and is used for social and religious occasions. As soon as children show some sign of being able to handle music or a musical instrument they are allowed to participate with the adults of the community in musical events. Traditional songs are more important to many people because they are stories about the histories of the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nketia|first1=J. H. Kwabena|title=Music Education in Africa and the West: We Can Learn from Each Other|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=1970|volume=57|issue=3|pages=48–55|doi=10.2307/3392906|jstor=3392906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South America==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Among the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas, music was used in ceremonies and rituals to teach the history of their civilizations and was also used for worship. The Aztec people were mainly educated by their priests. Music remained an important way to teach religion and history and was taught by priests for many centuries.  When Spain and Portugal colonized parts of South America, music started to be influenced by European ideas and qualities. Several priests of European descent, such as Antonio Sepp, taught European systems of music notation and theory based on their knowledge of playing instruments throughout the 1700-1800s. Since music was taught to the general public by rote, very few knew how to read music other than those who played instruments until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  The development of music in South America mainly followed that of European development. Choirs were formed to sing masses, chants, psalms, but secular music also became more prevalent in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Couve|first1=Alicia C.|last2=Pino|first2=Claudia Dal|last3=Frega|first3=Ana Lucía|title=An Approach to the History of Music Education in Latin America|jstor=40214944|journal=The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education|pages=10–39|doi=10.2307/40214944|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music education in Latin America today has large emphasis on folk music, masses, and orchestral music. Many classrooms teach their choirs to sing in their native language as well as in English. Several Latin American Schools, specifically in Puerto Rico and Haiti, believe music to be an important subject and are working on expanding their programs. Outside of school, many communities form their own musical groups and organizations. Community performances are very popular with the local audiences. There are a few well-known Latin American choral groups, such as "El Coro de Madrigalistas" from Mexico. This famous choral group tours around Mexico, showing students around the country what a professional choral ensemble sounds like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawler|first1=Vanett|title=Music Education in Fourteen Latin-American Republics|jstor=3386758|journal=Music Educators Journal|pages=20–30|doi=10.2307/3386758|date=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-Cultural Music Education==
The music, languages, and sounds we are exposed to within our own cultures determine our tastes in music and affect the way we perceive the music of other cultures. Many studies have shown distinct differences in the preferences and abilities of musicians from around the world. One study attempted to view the distinctions between the musical preferences of English and Japanese speakers, providing both groups of people with the same series of tones and rhythms. The same type of study was done for English and French speakers. Both studies suggested that the language spoken by the listener determined which groupings of tones and rhythms were more appealing, based on the inflections and natural rhythm groupings of their language.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bicknell|first1=Jeanette|title=Cross-Cultural Research and the Nature of Music|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-music-moves-us/201303/cross-cultural-research-and-the-nature-music|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study had Europeans and Africans try to tap along with certain rhythms. European rhythms are regular and built on simple ratios, while African rhythms are typically based on irregular ratios. While both groups of people could perform the rhythms with European qualities, the European group struggled with the African rhythms. This has to do with the ubiquity of complex polyrhythm in African culture and their familiarity with this type of sound.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

While each culture has its own musical qualities and appeals, incorporating cross-cultural curricula in our music classrooms can help teach students how to better perceive music from other cultures. Studies show that learning to sing folk songs or popular music of other cultures is an effective way to understand a culture as opposed to merely learning about it. If music classrooms discuss the musical qualities and incorporate styles from other cultures, such as the Brazilian roots of the Bossa Nova, the Afro-Cuban clave, and African drumming, it will expose students to new sounds and teach them how to compare their cultures’ music to the different music and start to make them more comfortable with exploring sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilari|first1=Beatriz|last2=Chen-Hafteck|first2=Lily|last3=Crawford|first3=Lisa|title=Singing and cultural understanding: A music education perspective|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0255761413487281|website=International Journal of Music Education|pages=202–216|language=en|doi=10.1177/0255761413487281|date=1 May 2013|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and assessment==
Achievement standards are curricular statements used to guide educators in determining objectives for their teaching. Use of standards became a common practice in many nations during the 20th century. For much of its existence, the curriculum for music education in the United States was determined locally or by individual teachers. In recent decades there has been a significant move toward adoption of regional and/or national standards. [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]], created nine voluntary content standards, called the ''National Standards for Music Education''.{{ref|standardfoot}} These standards call for:
# [[Singing]], alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# [[Performing]] on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# [[Improvising]] melodies, variations, and accompaniments.
# [[Musical composition|Composing]] and arranging music within specified guidelines.
# [[Reading (activity)|Reading]] and notating music.
# Listening to, analyzing, and describing music.
# Evaluating music and music performances.
# Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts.
# Understanding music in relation to history and culture.

Many states and school districts have adopted their own standards for music education.

==Integration with other subjects==
[[File:2013 Orgelkids Doe-orgel pijpen plaatsen.jpg|thumb|200px|Children in primary school are assembling a do-organ of [[Orgelkids]]]]
Some schools and organizations promote integration of arts classes, such as music, with other subjects, such as math, science, or English, believing that integrating the different curricula will help each subject to build off of one another, enhancing the overall quality of education.

One example is the [[Kennedy Center]]'s "Changing Education Through the Arts" program. CETA defines arts integration as finding a natural connection(s) between one or more art forms (dance, drama/theater, music, visual arts, storytelling, puppetry, and/or creative writing) and one or more other curricular areas (science, social studies, English language arts, mathematics, and others) in order to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surfaquarium.com/ceta.htm CETA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512034843/http://www.surfaquarium.com/ceta.htm |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]] has funded three projects that use music to support language learning. Lullabies of Europe (for pre-school and early learners),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lullabies-of-europe.org/ Lullabies of Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; FolkDC (for primary),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkdc.eu/|title=home|author=|date=11 February 2011|website=folkdc.eu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recent PopuLLar (for secondary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/PopuLLar-Music-and-Language-Learning/181858685219155|title=PopuLLar - Music and Language Learning|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ARTinED project is also using music for all subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artined.eu/home.html|title=ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts|author=|date=|website=www.artined.eu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===

A number of researchers and music education advocates have argued that studying music enhances [[academic achievement]],&lt;ref&gt;"Multiple studies link music study to academic achievement." [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/is-music-the-key-to-success.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB&amp;_r=0 Joanne Lipman, New York Times]. October 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; such as William Earhart, former president of the Music Educators National Conference, who claimed that "Music enhances knowledge in the areas of mathematics, science, geography, history, foreign language, physical education, and vocational training."&lt;ref name="Morrison, Steven J 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Steven J | year = 1994 | title = Music students and academic growth | url = | journal = Music Educators Journal | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 33–36 | doi=10.2307/3398812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the University of Wisconsin suggested that students with piano or keyboard experience performed 34% higher on tests that measure spatial-temporal lobe activity, which is the part of the brain that is used when doing mathematics, science, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rauscher | first1 = F. | last2 = Zupan | first2 = M.A. | year = 2000 | title = Classroom Keyboard Instruction Improves Kindergarten Children's Spatial-Temporal Performance: A Field Experiment | url = | journal = Early Childhood Research Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 215–228 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2006(00)00050-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment by Wanda T. Wallace setting text to melody suggested that some music may aid in text recall.&lt;ref name="Wallace, W. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallace | first1 = W | year = 1994 | title = Memory for music: Effect of melody on recall of text | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1471–1485 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.6.1471}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created a three verse song with a non-repetitive melody; each verse with different music.  A second experiment created a three verse song with a repetitive melody; each verse had exactly the same music.  A third experiment studied text recall without music.  She found the repetitive music produced the highest amount of text recall, suggesting music can serve as a mnemonic device.&lt;ref name="Wallace, W. 1994"/&gt;

Smith (1985) studied background music with word lists.  One experiment involved memorizing a word list with background music; participants recalled the words 48 hours later.  Another experiment involved memorizing a word list with no background music; participants also recalled the words 48 hours later.  Participants who memorized word lists with background music recalled more words demonstrating music provides contextual cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = S | year = 1985 | title = Background music and context-dependent memory | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 4| pages = 591–603 | doi=10.2307/1422512| jstor = 1422512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing studies that support music education's involvement in intellectual development and academic achievement, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring that: "Music education enhances intellectual development and enriches the academic environment for children of all ages; and Music educators greatly contribute to the artistic, intellectual and social development of American children and play a key role in helping children to succeed in school."&lt;ref&gt;(H. Res. 266)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobbett (1990) suggests that most public school music programs have not changed since their inception at the turn of the last century. "…the educational climate is not conducive to their continuance as historically conceived and the social needs and habits of people require a completely different kind of band program."&lt;ref&gt;Bobbett, G. C. (1990). Rural Appalachian Band Directors' Academic Preparation: Musical Preparation, Facilities, Monetary Resources, and Methods of Student Evaluation, and Their Students' Musical Independence. [S.l.]: Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse.&lt;/ref&gt;    A 2011 study conducted by Kathleen M. Kerstetter for the Journal of Band Research found that increased non-musical graduation requirements, block scheduling, increased number of non-traditional programs such as magnet schools, and the testing emphases created by the No Child Left Behind Act are only some of the concerns facing music educators. Both teachers and students are under increased time restrictions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerstetter | first1 = Kathleen M | year = 2011 | title = Investigating High School Band Recruitment Procedures Using Educational Marketing Principles | url = | journal = Journal of Band Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Patricia Powers states, "It is not unusual to see program cuts in the area of music and arts when economic issues surface.  It is indeed unfortunate to lose support in this area especially since music and the art programs contribute to society in many positive ways." &lt;ref name="Morrison, Steven J 1994" /&gt; Comprehensive music education programs average $187 per pupil, according to a 2011 study funded by the national Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fermanich | first1 = M. L. | year = 2011 | title = Money for music education: a district analysis of the how, what, and where of spending for music education | url = | journal = Journal of Education Finance | volume = 37 | issue = 2| page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas Commission on Drugs and Alcohol Abuse Report noted that students who participated in band or orchestra reported the lowest lifetime and current use of all substances including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmusicworkshop.com/advocacy/benefits.html|title=Benefits of Music Education - How do students benefit from music?|author=|date=|website=childrensmusicworkshop.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-musical benefits===
Studies have shown that music education can be used to enhance cognitive achievement in students. In the United States an estimated 30% of students struggle with reading, while 17% are reported as having a specific learning disability linked to reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Register | first1 = D. | last2 = Darrow | first2 = A.A | last3 = Swedberd | first3 = O. | last4 = Standley | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The use of music to enhance reading skills of second grade students and students with reading disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1093/jmt/44.1.23| pmid = 17419662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using intensive music curriculum as an intervention paired alongside regular classroom activities, research shows that students involved with the music curriculum show increases in reading comprehension, word knowledge, vocabulary recall, and word decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Register | first1 = D. | last2 = Darrow | first2 = A.A | last3 = Swedberd | first3 = O. | last4 = Standley | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The use of music to enhance reading skills of second grade students and students with reading disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 23–37 | pmid = 17419662 | doi=10.1093/jmt/44.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student is singing a melody with text, they are using multiple areas of their brain to multitask. Music effects language development, increases IQ, spatial-temporal skills, and improves test scores. Music education has also shown to improve the skills of dyslexic children in similar areas as mentioned earlier by focusing on visual auditory and fine motor skills as strategies to combat their disability.&lt;ref&gt;Overy, K. (2000). Dyslexia, temporal processing and music: The potential of music as an early learning aid for dyslexic children. Psychology of Music 28(2). 218–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Since research in this area is sparse, we cannot convincingly conclude these findings to be true, however the results from research done do show a positive impact on both students with learning difficulties and those who are not diagnosed. Further research will need to be done, but the positive engaging way of bringing music into the classroom cannot be forgotten, and the students generally show a positive reaction to this form of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butzlaff | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = Can music be used to teach reading? | url = | journal = The Journal of Aesthetic Education | volume = 34 | issue = 3/4| pages = 167–178 | doi=10.2307/3333642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music education has also been noted to have the ability to increase someones overall IQ, especially in children during peak development years.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schellenberg | first1 = E.G. | year = 2004 | title = Music lessons enhance IQ | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 511–514 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spacial ability, verbal memory, reading and mathematic ability are seen to be increased alongside music education (primarily through the learning of an instrument).&lt;ref name="Schellenberg"/&gt; Researchers also note that a correlation between general attendance and IQ increases is evident, and due to students involvement in music education, general attendance rates increase along with their IQ.

Fine motor skills, social behaviours, and emotional well being can also be increased through music and music education. The learning of an instrument increases fine motor skills in students with physical disabilities. Emotional well being can be increased as students find meaning in songs and connect them to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosacki | first1 = S. | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Early adolescents' emotional perceptions and engagement with popular music activities in everyday life | url = | journal = International Journal of Adolescence and Youth | volume =  20| issue = 2| pages =  228–244| doi = 10.1080/02673843.2013.785438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through social interactions of playing in groups like jazz and concert bands, students learn to socialize and this can be linked to emotional and mental well being.

===Music advocacy===
In some communities – and even entire national education systems – music is provided little support as an academic subject area, and music teachers feel that they must actively seek greater public endorsement for music education as a legitimate subject of study. This perceived need to change public opinion has resulted in the development of a variety of approaches commonly called "music advocacy". Music advocacy comes in many forms, some of which are based upon legitimate scholarly arguments and scientific findings, while other examples controversially rely on emotion, anecdotes, or unconvincing data.

Recent high-profile music advocacy projects include the "[[Mozart Effect]]", the [[National Anthem Project]], and the movement in  [[World Music Pedagogy]] (also known as  [[Cultural Diversity in Music Education]]) which seeks out means of equitable pedagogy across students regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic circumstance.  The Mozart effect is particularly controversial as while the initial study suggested listening to Mozart positively impacts [[spatial-temporal reasoning]], later studies either failed to replicate the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F | year = 1999 | title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 400 | issue = 6747| pages = 826–827 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid = 10476958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = Kenneth M. | last2 = Bass | first2 = Karen E. | last3 = Crook | first3 = Melissa D. | year = 1999 | title = The Mystery of the Mozart Effect: Failure to Replicate | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 366–369 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;Rudi Črnčec, Sarah J. Wilson and Margot Prior, "No Evidence for the Mozart Effect in Children," ''Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Vol. 23, No. 4 (2006): 305–318. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/mp.2006.23.4.305]&lt;/ref&gt; or suggested the music of Mozart could be substituted for any music children enjoy in a term called "enjoyment arousal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Schellenberg | first2 = E.G. | last3 = Husain | first3 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Mood, arousal, and the Mozart effect | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 248–251 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggested that even if listening to Mozart may temporarily enhance a student's spatial-temporal abilities, learning to play an instrument is much more likely to improve student performance and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;(Rauscher, F. H., &amp; Hinton, S. C. (2006). The Mozart Effect: Music Listening is Not Music Instruction. Educational Psychologist, 41(4), 233–238.  Abstract: This paper clarifies the position of the author's earlier works.)&lt;/ref&gt; Educators similarly criticized the [[National Anthem Project]] not only for promoting the educational use of music as a tool for non-musical goals, but also for its links to [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Bradley, "Oh That Magic Feeling! Multicultural Human Subjectivity, Community, and Fascism's Footprints," ''Philosophy of Music Education Review,'' Vol. 17, No. 1 (2009): 56, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary music scholars assert that effective music advocacy uses empirically sound arguments that transcend political motivations and personal agendas. [[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|Music education philosophers]] such as [[Bennett Reimer]], [[Estelle Jorgensen]], [[David J. Elliott]], [[John Paynter (composer)|John Paynter]], and [[Keith Swanwick]] support this view, yet many music teachers and music organizations and schools do not apply this line of reasoning into their music advocacy arguments. Researchers such as [[Ellen Winner]] conclude that arts advocates have made bogus claims to the detriment of defending the study of music,&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Wu, "Entrepreneurship in Research: Ellen Winner on Why We Need the Arts," ''Entrepreneurship Review,'' (2013): [2 http://miter.mit/edu/ellen-winner-on-why-we-need-the-arts/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]&lt;/ref&gt; her research debunking claims that music education improves math, for example.&lt;ref name="David J 2015"&gt;David J. Elliot and Marissa Silverman, Music Matters, A Philosophy of Music Education, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 38&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers [[Glenn Schellenberg]] and [[Eugenia Costa-Giomi]] also criticize advocates [[Correlation does not imply causation|incorrectly associating correlation with causation]], Giomi pointing out that while there is a "strong relationship between music participation and academic achievement, the ''causal'' nature of the relationship is questionable."&lt;ref name="David J 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugenia Costa-Giomi, "Music Education and Intellectual Development in Children: Historical, Research, and Educational Perspectives," 2012, Conference Proceeding, Anais Do II Simpom 2012 – Simposio Brasileiro de Pos-Graduandos Em Musica, 21, [http://www.seer.unirio.br/index.php/simpom/article/viewFile/2601/1929]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers [[David J. Elliott|David Elliott]] and [[Marissa Silverman]] suggest that more effective advocacy involves shying away from "[[dumbing down]]" values and aims through slogans and misleading data, energy being better focused into engaging potential supporters in active music-making and musical-affective experiences,&lt;ref&gt;David J. Elliott and Marissa Silverman, Music Matters, A Philosophy of Music Education, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; these actions recognizing that music and music-making are inherent to human culture and behavior, distinguishing humans from other species.&lt;ref name="Yudkin, J. 2008 p. 4"&gt;Yudkin, J.

==Role of women==
{{Main|Women in music education}}
[[File:Roman Catholic Elementary School- Life at St Joseph's, Upper Norwood, 1943 D14456.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A music teacher leading a music ensemble in an elementary school in 1943.]]
While music critics argued in the 1880s that "...[[Women in music|women]] [composers] lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php|title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1|author=|date=|website=parlorsongs.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in music education, and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;"Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences. A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination."

After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers|title=A historical view of women in music education careers|first=|last=bigbadbariguru|date=5 July 2012|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14139">The '''Next Generation Science Standards''' is a multi-state effort in the United States to create new education standards that are "rich in content and practice, arranged in a coherent manner across disciplines and grades to provide all students an internationally benchmarked science education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards were developed by a consortium of 26 states and by the [[National Science Teachers Association]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], and Achieve, a nonprofit organization that was also involved in developing math and English standards.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Gillis |title=New Guidelines Call for Broad Changes in Science Education |newspaper=New York Times |date=April 9, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/science/panel-calls-for-broad-changes-in-science-education.html |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Generation Science Standards |publisher=Illinois State Board of Education |url=http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ngss/default.htm |accessdate=May 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507001303/http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ngss/default.htm |archivedate=May 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erik |last=Robelen |title=Who Is Writing the 'Next Generation' Science Standards? |journal=Education Week |date=May 14, 2012 |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2012/05/who_is_writing_the_next_genera.html |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Revkin |title=New Classroom Science Standards Up for Review |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 18, 2012 |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/new-classroom-science-standards-up-for-review/ |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public was also invited to review the standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Education Officials Seek Public Comment on Science Standards |newspaper=Topeka Capital-Journal |date=January 17, 2013 |url=http://cjonline.com/news/2013-01-17/education-officials-seek-public-comment-science-standards |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organizations such as the California Science Teachers Association encouraged this feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Generation Science Standards |publisher=California Science Teachers Association |url=http://www.classroomscience.org/ngss-scheduled-for-release-january-8 |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final draft of the standards was released in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erik |last=Robelen |title=Common Science Standards Make Formal Debut |journal=Education Week |date=April 9, 2013 |url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/04/09/28science_ep.h32.html |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==

The purposes of the standards include combatting ignorance of science, creating common standards for teaching in the U.S., and developing greater interest in science among students so that more of them choose to major in science and technology in college. Overall, the guidelines are intended to help students deeply understand core scientific concepts, to understand the scientific process of developing and testing ideas, and to have a greater ability to evaluate scientific evidence. Curricula based on the standards may cover fewer topics, but will go more deeply into specific topics, possibly using a case-study method and emphasizing critical thinking and primary investigation. Possible approaches to implementing the standards may even include replacing traditionally isolated high school courses such as biology and chemistry with a case-study approach that uses a more holistic method of teaching science to consider both (or more) topics within a single classroom structure.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Many education supply companies have already started offering NGSS-aligned products and resources to help teachers implement these new principles.&lt;ref name=MudWatt&gt;{{cite web |title=MudWatt NGSS Science Kit |url=http://www.mudwatt.com/pages/educational-resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Standards==
The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are based on the "Framework K–12 Science Education" that was created by the National Research Council. They have three dimensions that are integrated in instruction at all levels. The first is core ideas, which consists of specific content and subject areas. The second is science and engineering practices. Students are expected not just to learn content but to understand the methods of scientists and engineers. The third is cross-cutting concepts: key underlying ideas that are common to a number of topics. The NGSS give equal emphasis to engineering design and to scientific inquiry. In addition, they are aligned with the [[Common Core State Standards]] by grade and level of difficulty. The standards describe "performance expectations" for students in the area of science and engineering. They define what students must be able to do in order to show competency.&lt;ref name=NGSS&gt;{{cite web |title=The Next Generation Science Standards: Executive Summary |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |date=June 2013 |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/ngss/files/Final%20Release%20NGSS%20Front%20Matter%20-%206.17.13%20Update_0.pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important facet of the standards is that teaching of content is integrated with teaching the practices of scientists and engineers. This is a change from traditional teaching, which typically either dealt with these topics separately or didn't attempt to teach practices. According to NGSS, it is through the integration of content and practice "that science begins to make sense and allows students to apply the material."&lt;ref name=NGSS/&gt;

==Adoption==

Over 40 states have shown interest in the standards,&lt;ref name=NCSE/&gt; and as of November 2017, 19 states, along with the District of Columbia (D.C.), have adopted the standards: Arkansas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arkansas Adopts NGSS for grades K-8 |publisher=NSTA |date=June 17, 2015 |url=http://ngssblog.nsta.org/2015/06/17/arkansas-adopts-ngss-for-grades-k-8/ |accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; California, Connecticut,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) were adopted by unanimous vote of the Connecticut State Board of Education| date=November 4, 2016 |url=http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/cwp/view.asp?a=2618&amp;q=320890|accessdate=December 11, 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Delaware, Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Liana |last=Heitin |title=Hawaii Adopts the Next Generation Science Standards|publisher=Education Week | date=February 17, 2016 |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2016/02/hawaii_adopts_the_next_generation_science_standards.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-TW|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the earlier roll-out of the Common Core (CC) math and English standards, states have no financial incentives from federal grants to adopt the Next Generation Science Standards. Previously, adoption of the CC standards was incentivized through states accepting federal grants during the 2009 TARP bailouts. Once states accepted the grant, they accepted the responsibility to adopt "college and career readiness" standards, which didn't have to be CC, but most states chose CC anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-williams/common-core-standards_b_3461006.html |accessdate =December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 26 states involved in developing the NGSS, called Lead State Partners, were Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lead State Partners |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/lead-state-partners |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the standards were released in April 2013, many states were expected to adopt them within one-to-two years. However, according to the ''New York Times'', it would take several more years to actually develop curricula based on the new guidelines, to train teachers in implementing them, and to revise standardized tests.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; In addition, the pace of adoption is expected to be slower than was seen with the Common Core State Standards because, unlike Common Core, in which the states had financial incentives to adopt, there are no similar incentives for the NGSS.&lt;ref name=edweek/&gt; Many education supply companies have started offering NGSS-aligned products and resources to help teachers adopt NGSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Open NGSS Resources  |url=https://www.opened.com/search?standard_group=next-generation-science-standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

News reports have suggested there will likely be resistance towards the Next Generations Science Standards from conservatives due to the inclusion of [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=NCSE&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution and climate change in the NGSS |publisher=National Center for Science Education |url=http://ncse.com/news/2013/04/evolution-climate-change-ngss-0014800 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Emily |last=Richmond |title=Students Would Learn about Climate Change Under New Teaching Guidelines |magazine=The Atlantic |date=April 10, 2013 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/students-would-learn-about-climate-change-under-new-teaching-guidelines/274858/ |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Teresa |last=Watanabe |title=New science standards call for teaching climate change and more |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 9, 2013 |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-science-20130409,0,1524486.story |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Toppo |title=National science standards likely to raise 'ruckus' |newspaper=USA Today |date=April 10, 2013 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/09/science-school-standards/2064791/ |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Partners |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/partners |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the New Mexico Public Education Department initially attempted to make changes and deletions in the standards prior to adopting them. According to [[Skeptical Inquirer]], the "proposed changes would have deleted key terms and concepts such as evolution and the 4.6-billion-year age of the Earth. Specifically, 'evolution' would be called 'biological diversity,' the specific age of the Earth would be changed to 'geologic history,' and a 'rise in global temperatures' would be changed to 'temperature fluctuations.'" Following significant protests by the New Mexico Academy of Science, [[New Mexicans for Science and Reason]], the Coalition for Excellence in Science and Engineering as well as scientists, educators, and faith leaders, the department announced in October 2017 that it would adopt the standards in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=New Mexico Scientists, Teachers Stop Attempt to Taint Science Standards|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">The [[Norway|Norwegian]] '''Institute of Marine Research''' ({{lang-no|Havforskningsinstituttet}}) is a national consultative research institute which is owned by the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs. The Institute performs research and provides advisory services in the fields of marine ecosystems and aquaculture. 

With a staff of almost 750, the Institute of Marine Research is the largest centre of marine research in Norway. The Institute has a highly qualified scientific staff, high-technology research stations and laboratories in [[Austevoll]], [[Bergen]] (head office), Flødevigen ([[Arendal]]) and [[Matre]], a department in [[Tromsø]] and several vessels.

The primary responsibility of the Institute of Marine Research is to provide advice to national authorities, society and industry regarding questions related to the ecosystems of the [[Barents Sea]], the [[Norwegian Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and the Norwegian coastal zone and in the field of aquaculture. The Institute is heavily engaged in development aid activities through its [http://www.cdcf.no Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries].

Norwegian Fisheries Investigations ("Norske Fiskeriundersøgelser") was initiated in [[Oslo]] in 1864. In 1900 the investigations was located to Bergen, and in 1947, the institute was separated as a research institute under directorate of fisheries. To further ensure its independence, the institute became an independent institution in 1989.

Among important scientific contributions was [[Johan Hjort]]'s pivotal work on «Fluctuations in the Great Fisheries of Northern Europe» (1914). Einar Lea's use of [[ASDIC]] to find [[herring]] schools (1947) and the use of Echo Integration for estimating fish abundance (Midtun &amp; Hoff, 1962) are also notable.

In marine environments, a '''nursery [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]''' is a subset of all habitats where juveniles of a [[species]] occur, having a greater level of productivity per unit area than other juvenile habitats (Beck et al. 2001).  Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass are typical nursery habitats for a range of marine species.  Some species will use nonvegetated sites, such as Yellow Eyed Mullet, Blue Sprat and Flounder.

==Overview==
The nursery habitat hypothesis states that the contribution per unit area of a nursery habitat is greater than for other habitats used by juveniles for the species.  Productivity may be measured by density, survival, growth and movement to adult habitat (Beck et al. 2001).

There are two general models for the location of juvenile habitats within the total range for a species which reflect life history strategies of the species.  These are the Classic Concept: Juveniles and Adults in separate habitats.  Juveniles migrate to adult habitat.  General Concept: overlap of juvenile and adult habitats.  

Some marine species do not have juvenile habitats, e.g. arthropods and scallops.  Commonly fish, ells, some lobsters, blue crabs (and so forth) do have distinct juvenile habitats, whether with or without overlap with adult habitats.    

In terms of management, use of the nursery role [[hypothesis]] may be limiting as it excludes some potentially important nursery sites.  In these cases the Effective Juvenile Habitat concept may be more useful.  This defines a nursery as that which supplies a higher percentage of individuals to adult populations.  

Identification and subsequent management of nursery habitats may be important in supporting off shore fisheries and ensuring species survival into the future.  If we are unable to preserve nursery habitats, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations may decline, reducing population numbers and compromising the survival of species for [[biodiversity]] and human harvesting.

==Determination==
In order to determine the nursery habitat for a species, all habitats used by juveniles must be surveyed.  This may include [[kelp forest]], seagrass, mangroves, tidal flat, mudflat, wetland, salt marsh and oyster reef.  While density may be an indicator of productivity, it is suggested that alone, density does not adequately provide evidence of the role of a habitat as a nursery. Recruitment biomass from juvenile to adult population is the best measure of movement between the two habitats.  

Consider also biotic, abiotic and landscape variability in the value of nursery habitats.  This may be an important consideration when looking at which sites to manage and protect.  Biotic factors include: structural complexity, food availability, larval settlement cues, competition, and predation.  Abiotic: temperature, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, freshwater inflow, retention zone and disturbance.  Landscape factors involve: proximity of juvenile and adult habitats, access to [[larva]]e, number of adjacent habitats, patch shape, area and fragmentation.  The effects of these factors may be positive or negative depending on species and broader environmental conditions at any given time.  

It may be more holistic to consider temporal variation in habitats used as nurseries, and incorporating temporal scales into any testing is important.  Also consider assemblages of species.  Single species approaches may not be able to be used to adequately manage systems appropriately.

Acosta and Butler conducted experimental observation of spiny lobster to determine which habitats are used as nurseries.  Mangroves are used as preferred nursery habitat when coral density is low.  Predation on newly settled larvae was lower in mangrove than in seagrass beds and coral crevices.    In comparison, Pipefish prefer seagrass over algae and sand habitats.  King George Whiting have a more complex pattern of development.  Settlement is preferred in seagrass and [[algae]].  Growth stages are primarily preferred in reef algae.  4 months post settlement, they move into unvegetated habitats (Jenkins and Wheatley, 1998).

The '''nurturant parent model''' also "Nurturing Parent" is a metaphor, for a belief system, which is built upon an underlying value system.  In this Nurturant Parenting contrasts with Stern Father parenting (Strict Father) as two distinct metaphors each used as icons of contrasting value and political systems, i.e. Regressive (Strict Father) and Nurturing Parent as Progressive .  

The Nurturant Parent metaphor draws on [[Parenting styles|parenting style]].  The ideal, effective Nurturing Parent gives his children both "roots in the ground and wings to fly." He or she does this by imparting, conveying, role-modeling and enforcing boundaries which encourage the child towards personal freedom (try out your new wings).  The Nurturant Parent model has a healthy respect for children's inherent intelligence.  As safe and appropriate, they can and should be allowed to explore their environment. Parents are responsible for protecting their child from serious mistakes, by offering guidance. A child will be picked up if the child cries because the parent wants the child to feel safe and supported. If a child grows up believing its needs are likely to be met, it will be more confident when facing challenges.

At the same time or alternately as appropriate, the Nurturant Parent encourages the child to have deep and peaceful roots in the ground thru managed exercise of the child's own self-discipline, self-connection, age-appropriate house chores, limited allowance, discussion of both Feelings and Thoughts and mutually healthy boundaries with strangers, friends and adults generally. 

The above was originally expressed more simply as 'a family model where children are expected to explore their surroundings; at the same time, being protected by their parents.' 

Other ideas:

* True discipline is much more than strict, unquestioning obedience.  Mutual [[respect]] and [[compassion]] are also rights.
* The outside world is no more inherently hostile than it is inherently friendly; stay alert, the world  commands respect
* Mutual respect and compassion is best taught by example.

== Research ==

This model is based on a study conducted by the Boston College Graduate Program in [[Human development (psychology)|Human Development]]{{fact|date=August 2012}} where researchers were investigating the [[Parenting styles|parenting style]] preferred by parents of extraordinarily creative children. Most parenting books recommend the [[Parenting_styles#Authoritative_parenting|authoritative style]].{{fact|date=August 2012}} The researchers discovered another parenting style which they called "the nurturing parent" that focuses on responsibility, [[empathy]], and [[creativity]]. The basic approach these parents used was to:

* Trust in their children's fairness and good judgment
* Respect their children's [[autonomy]], thoughts and feelings
* Support their children's interests and goals
* Enjoy their children's company
* Protect their children from doing injury to self or others, not by establishing rules but by communicating values and discussing their children's behavior with them
* Modeling the [[self-control]], [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] they believe their children will need&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dacey |first=J. S. |last2=Packer |first2=A. J. |year=1992 |title=The Nurturing Parent: How to Raise Creative, Loving, Responsible Children |location=New York |publisher=Fireside, Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-77145-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further mentions ==

Herbert Jay Rosenfield ([[Social_work|LCSW]]) in his unfinished book ''Caring Parents: a Guide to Successful Parenting'' encourages use of the acronym "RECEPEE", for "'''R'''easonable '''E'''xpectations, '''C'''learly '''E'''xpressed, '''P'''erformed '''E'''veryday and by '''E'''xample". "The factors that children need to develop good self-esteem...are primarily 'gifts' from us parents!" writes Rosenfield, who offers another acronym "UCARE":

* '''U'''niqueness that is positive, achieved through praise, encouragement, and positive feedback
* '''C'''onnectiveness to family, to extended family, and to a neighborhood that is safe, healthy and moderate
* '''A'''ge-appropriate autonomy: responsibilities and privileges that parallel their age and capabilities
* '''R'''ole '''E'''xamples: parent models with good self-esteem and behavior, whom they can emulate

Reverend George Englehardt stated succinctly, in 1991, that "parental responsibility is to provide their children with a safe, loving, nurturing environment".

The nurturant parent model is also discussed by [[George Lakoff]] in his books, including ''[[Moral Politics]]'' and ''Whose Freedom?'' In these books, the nurturant parent model is contrasted with the [[strict father model]]. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then [[progressivism|progressive]] politics correspond to the nurturant parent model. For example, progressives want the government to make sure that the citizens are protected and assisted to achieve their potential. This might take the form of tough environmental regulations or healthcare assistance.

The model is also consistent with [[slow parenting]] in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow parenting might go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely.

'''PennPraxis''' is the "clinical" arm of the School of Design at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and is a [[501(c)|501c(3)]] non-profit subsidiary of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.  The group offers community collaborative design opportunities for Penn faculty and students to test ideas and theories in practical "real world" applications while offering architectural and planning services to individuals and groups who are either in need or are otherwise unable to procure these services from traditional sources.  In its first 10 years it earned $16m in fees.&lt;ref name=an/&gt;

Requirements for project proposals are that the projects not meet the University's guidelines for "sponsored research projects"; they must also provide educational benefits and/or serve the interests of the (Philadelphia) community.  PennPraxis has been working on ideas for [[urban planning]] for the city of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania according to a 'civic vision' it has for the city, including the [[Delaware River]] waterfront, and the western banks of the [[Schuylkill River]], where Penn's campus faces.  The group is led by executive director and Penn faculty member Harris Steinberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.design.upenn.edu/people/steinberg-faia_harris-m Harris Steinberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009064720/http://www.design.upenn.edu/people/steinberg-faia_harris-m |date=2012-10-09 }} - Penn faculty profile&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the group's funding comes from the [[William Penn Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Troy |last=Graham |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The other icon: William Penn Foundation sold off its company stock in '97 |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/24443689.html |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |publisher= |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2008-08-07 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williampennfoundation.org/search_site3576/search_site_show.htm?org_id=6906&amp;request_id=2010723 William Penn Foundation]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - 2008 grant listing for PennPraxis&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-theism''' is a variant of [[nontheism]] that proposes that the division of [[theism]] vs.  [[atheism]] is obsolete, that [[God]] belongs to a stage of human development now past. Within nontheism, post-theism can be contrasted with [[antitheism]].
The term appears in Christian [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and [[Postchristianity]].

[[Frank Hugh Foster]] in a 1918 lecture announced that modern culture had arrived at a "post-theistic stage" in which humanity has taken possession of the powers of agency and creativity that had formerly been projected upon God.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Dorrien , ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Idealism, Realism, and Modernity, 1900-1950'' (2003), {{ISBN|978-0-664-22355-7}}, p. 177f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denys Turner]] argues that [[Karl Marx]] did not choose atheism over theism, but rejected the binary "[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]ian" choice altogether, a position which by being post-theistic is at the same time necessarily '''post-atheistic'''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Turner, "Religion: Illusions and liberation", in: Terrell Carver (ed), ''The Cambridge Companion to Marx'' (1991), {{ISBN|978-0-521-36694-6}}, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at one point Marx argued "there should be less trifling with the label 'atheism,'” as he insisted "religion in itself is without content, it owes its being not to heaven but to the earth, and with the abolition of distorted reality, of which it is the theory, it will collapse of itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/letters/42_11_30.htm Karl Marx, ''Letter from Marx to Arnold Ruge In Dresden'' (1842)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s pronouncement that "[[God is dead]]" and the [[transtheism]] of [[Paul Tillich]] or [[Pema Chödrön]].

[[File:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|thumb|[[Skara Brae]] in Orkney is Northern Europe's most complete [[Neolithic]] village]]
{{History of Scotland}}

'''Prehistoric Orkney''' refers to a period in the human occupation of the [[Orkney]] archipelago of [[Scotland]] that was the latter part of these islands' [[prehistory]]. The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus ''Homo'' is part of the [[geology of Scotland]]. Although some [[Protohistory|written records]] refer to Orkney during the [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman invasions of Scotland]], prehistory in northern Scotland does not end until the commencement of the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Historic Period]] around AD 600.

There are numerous important prehistoric remains in Orkney, especially from the [[Neolithic]] period, four of which form a [[World Heritage Site]]. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The [[sandstone]] bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of [[plough]]ing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the [[Norsemen|Norse]] period of occupation) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) pp. 96&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 11&amp;ndash;13, who states that the total number of archaeological sites in Orkney is "around 10,000" i.e. about 10 for every km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prehistory is conventionally divided into a number of shorter periods but differentiating these various [[List of archaeological periods|eras of human history]] is a complex task &amp;ndash; their boundaries are uncertain and the changes between them are gradual. The [[Paleolithic]] lasted until the retreat of the ice, the [[Mesolithic]] until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until [[metalworking]] commenced. A number of the sites span long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The extraordinary wealth of structures from the Neolithic is not matched either by the early periods, for which the evidence of human occupation is sparse or non-existent, or the later [[Bronze Age]] which provides a relative dearth of evidence. The subsequent [[Iron Age]] supported a return to monumental building, especially of [[broch]]s.

Formal excavations were first recorded in the late 18th century and as they proceeded an understanding of the structures involved progressed from little more than folklore to modern archaeological science. The sites discussed are found on the [[Orkney Mainland]] unless otherwise stated.

==Paleolithic==
No traces have yet been found in Scotland of either a [[Neanderthal]] presence or of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' during the [[Pleistocene]] [[interglacial]]s. The first indications of humans occur only after the [[Last glacial period|ice retreated]] in the [[11th millennium BC]] and the current [[Flandrian interglacial]] began. Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Kevin J and Ralston, Ian B.M. "Environment and People in Prehistoric and Early Historical Times: Preliminary Considerations" in Edwards &amp; Ralston (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, [[sea level]]s were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to [[Continental Europe]]. Much of the [[North Sea]] basin was also dry land until after 4000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent [[isostasy|isostatic]] rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973) p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) pp. 46&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (1994) p. 74 states that mesolithic travellers would have encountered a stretch of water when voyaging from mainland Scotland to Orkney.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, John Flett "Geology and Landscape" in Omand (2003) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesolithic==
The very limited [[archaeology|archaeological]] record provides scant evidence of Mesolithic life in Orkney in particular and Scotland north of [[Inverness]] in general. "Lithic scatter" sites at Seatter, South Ettit, Wideford Hill, Valdigar and [[Loch of Stenness]] have produced small polished stone tools and chippings. A charred hazelnut shell, recovered during the excavations at Longhowe in [[Tankerness]] in 2007, has been dated to 6820-6660 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002600.html "Hazelnut shell pushes back date of Orcadian site"] (3 November 2007) Stone Pages Archaeo News. Retrieved 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence to suggest whether or not these sites were in year-round occupation and no Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered anywhere in Scotland to date.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (1994) pp. 62&amp;ndash;63, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noble (1996) p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finlayson, Bill and Edwards, Kevin J. "The Mesolithic" in Edwards &amp; Ralston (2003) pp. 122&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recently excavated site on [[Stronsay]] has produced a thousand pieces of [[flint]] and what may be evidence of a temporary camp. With a tentative dating of 7000 BC or older it may prove to be the oldest settlement site found so far on Orkney.&lt;ref&gt;Towrie, Sigurd (20 March 2008) [http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/stronsayflints2008.htm "New Contender for Orkney's Oldest settlement Site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026150044/http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/stronsayflints2008.htm |date=26 October 2008 }} Orkneyjar.

Evidence of widespread coastal inundations from a wave {{convert|8|m|ft}} high has been found as far south as [[Fife]] and the impact on shore-dwelling mesolithic societies in Orkney would have been considerable.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (1994) pp. 59&amp;ndash;60, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fettes.com/Shetland/Storegga.html "The Storegga Submarine Slides"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108042250/http://www.fettes.com/Shetland/Storegga.html |date=8 January 2008 }}.

==Neolithic==
[[File:Knapofhowarinsun.jpg|thumb|The seaward walls of Knap of Howar]]
The assemblage of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom and on the Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies came to the fore that were a radical departure from the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.org/about/history-tradition-and-roots/features/culture/orkney.html "Death and re-birth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704181428/http://www.scotland.org/about/history-tradition-and-roots/features/culture/orkney.html |date=4 July 2008 }} Scotland.org.

The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were constructed almost a millennium before the [[sarsen]] stones of [[Stonehenge]] were erected.&lt;ref&gt;The sarsens of Stonehenge were erected c. 2300 BC (see [http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1914 "Stonehenge – Forever a mystery"] English Heritage. Retrieved 27 September 2008). The Stones of Stenness on Orkney date from the fourth millennium BC, perhaps as early as 3400 (see [http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertydetail.htm?PropID=PL_280&amp;PropName=Stones%20Of%20Stenness%20Circle%20And%20Henge "Stones of Stenness Circle and Henge"] Historic Scotland. Retrieved 27 September 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; At one time it was believed that this flowering of culture was essentially peripheral and that its origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain. However, recently discovered evidence shows that Orkney was the starting place for much of the megalithic culture, including styles of architecture and pottery, that developed much later in the southern British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson, Clive (10 January 2014) [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3449dde2-7800-11e3-afc5-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2q5B0HnYi "Science: Orkney – hot spot of the Stone Age"].

[[Knap of Howar]] Neolithic farmstead is probably the oldest preserved house in northern Europe. Situated on the island of [[Papa Westray]] (which may have been combined with nearby [[Westray]] in the early Neolithic), the farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled buildings with low doorways linked by a passageway. This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site of an even older settlement. [[Unstan ware]] pottery pieces were found on the site, which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 31&amp;ndash;33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneydigs.org.uk/howar.html "The Knap of Howar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208183045/http://www.orkneydigs.org.uk/howar.html |date=8 February 2007 }} Orkney Archaeological Trust.

The [[Barnhouse Settlement]] is a cluster of at least fifteen buildings, including one that may have been used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/barnhouse/index.html "The Barnhouse Neolithic Settlement"]. Orkneyjar.

[[File:barnhouse04.jpg|thumb|left|House 3 in the Barnhouse Settlement, with [[Loch of Harray]] beyond]]

[[Skara Brae]] consists of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 3100&amp;ndash;2500 BC the houses are similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large [[midden]] containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four [[Carved Stone Balls|carved stone balls]] were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (2000) pp. 1, 11&amp;ndash;15, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/policyandguidance/world_heritage_scotland/world_heritage_sites/world-heritage-neolithic-orkney.htm "The Heart of Neolithic Orkney"].

There are two main types of [[chambered cairn]] on these islands: the Orkney/[[Cromarty]] type with a burial chamber approached through a low passage and usually divided into "stalls" by upright stone slabs, and the [[Maeshowe type]] (see below), which is a later development with a cruciform layout and an elongated passage.&lt;ref&gt;Noble (2006) pp. 103, 115, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are a variety of sub-types including "Bookan", "Tri-partite" and "Hybrid".

===The Heart of Neolithic Orkney===
[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|right|A stone dresser at Skara Brae]]
Skara Brae, [[Maeshowe]], the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and the [[Stones of Stenness]] together form the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]] [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in the western part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/514 "Heart of Neolithic Orkney"] UNESCO. Retrieved 29 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Noble (2006) pp. 24&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.

There is also the possibility that tribal differences were part of the Neolithic cultural landscape. Unstan Ware pottery is associated with small settlements like Knap of Howar, and stalled tombs such as Midhowe. [[Grooved Ware]] pottery on the other hand tends to be associated with larger 'village' settlements like Skara Brae and Barnhouse, and with Maes Howe style tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maeshowe====
[[File:MaesHowe.jpg|right|thumb|[[Maeshowe]] [[chambered cairn]]]]
Dating from about 3000 BC, Maeshowe is a large chambered cairn and [[passage grave]]. "[[Old Norse language|Howe]]" as an element in a name, from the [[Old Norse]] word ''haugr'' meaning mound or barrow, is common throughout Orkney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/placename.htm "The Origin of the Maeshowe Plaecename"] Orkneyjar.

It is aligned so that the rear wall of its central chamber, a rough cube of {{convert|4.5|m3|cuyd}} is illuminated on the [[winter solstice]]. It gives its name to the Maeshowe type of chambered cairns, (see above) that include other significant sites such as [[Cuween Hill Chambered Cairn|Cuween Hill]], [[Quanterness]] and [[Wideford Hill]], and at [[Quoyness]] on [[Sanday, Orkney|Sanday]].&lt;ref name=H84&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 84&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 54&amp;ndash;57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maes&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/index.html "Maeshowe"].

After it fell into disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by [[Vikings]] from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left a series of [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscriptions on the stone walls of the chamber, some of which were left by a group of crusaders in the winter of 1153&amp;ndash;54. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 178&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/maeshrunes.htm "Maeshowe's runes - Viking graffiti"] Orkneyjar.

====Ring of Brodgar====
The [[Ring of Brodgar]] is a [[henge]] and [[stone circle]] {{convert|104|m|ft}} in diameter, originally made of 60 stones (of which only 27 remain standing) set within a circular ditch up to {{convert|3|m|ft}} deep and {{convert|10|m|ft}} wide. Some of the remaining stones are {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} high and it has been estimated that the ditch alone took 80,000 man-hours to construct. The ring stands on a small [[isthmus]] between the [[Loch of Stenness|Lochs of Stenness]] and Harray and it is generally thought to have been erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/brodgar/ " The Ring o' Brodgar, Stenness "].

====Ness of Brodgar====
Excavations by [[Orkney College]] at the nearby [[Ness of Brodgar]] site between the Ring and the Stones of Stenness revealed several buildings, both ritual and domestic and the works suggest there were likely to be more in the vicinity. One structure appears to be {{convert|20|m|ft}} long by {{convert|11|m|ft}} wide.

More recent excavations have revealed a large temple complex on the site without parallel in western Europe, with more than a dozen large temples that were linked to outhouses and kitchens by carefully constructed stone pavements.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/06/orkney-temple-centre-ancient-britain |title=Neolithic discovery: why Orkney is the centre of ancient Britain  |last=McKie |first=Robin |date=6 October 2012 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The site is now considered to be of such significance that Nick Card, director of excavations, was prompted to say in 2012: "We need to turn the map of Britain upside down when we consider the Neolithic and shrug off our south-centric attitudes...London may be the cultural hub of Britain today, but 5,000 years ago, Orkney was the centre for innovation for the British isles. Ideas spread from this place. The first grooved pottery, which is so distinctive of the era, was made here, for example, and the first henges – stone rings with ditches round them – were erected on Orkney. Then the ideas spread to the rest of the Neolithic Britain. This was the font for new thinking at the time."&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012"/&gt;

====Stones of Stenness====
[[File:Stenness 1983.jpg|thumb|right|The Stenness Watch Stone stands outside the circle]]
The Stones of Stenness are five remaining [[megalith]]s of a henge, the largest of which is {{convert|6|m|ft}} high. The site is thought to date from 3100 BC, one of the earliest dates for a henge anywhere in Britain.&lt;ref name=Sten&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/standingstones/index.html "The Standing Stones o' Stenness"].

The Ring of Brodgar lies about {{convert|1.2|km|mi}}  to the north-west, and Maeshowe is a similar distance to the east. Barnhouse is only {{convert|150|m|ft}} to the north.&lt;ref name=Barn/&gt;

The existing [[megalith]]s were originally part of an elliptical shaped stone circle of 12 stones, about {{convert|32|m|ft}} in diameter surrounded by a ditch that was {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|7|m|ft}} deep and with a single entrance causeway on the north side that faces towards the Barnhouse Settlement. The Watch Stone stands outside the circle to the north-west and is {{convert|5.6|m|ft}} high. Other smaller stones include a square stone like a huge hearth setting in the centre of the circle and this along with the bones of cattle, sheep, wolves and dogs found in the ditch suggest ritual sacrifice and feasting.&lt;ref name=A68/&gt;

Even in the 18th century the site was still associated with traditions and rituals, by then relating to [[List of Norse gods and goddesses|Norse gods]]. The "[[Odin]] Stone" was pierced with a circular hole, and was used by local couples for plighting engagements by holding hands through the gap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/odinstone/index.html  "The Odin Stone"] Orkneyjar. Retrieved 30 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century a local landowner and recent immigrant to Orkney decided to remove the Stones on the grounds that local people were trespassing and disturbing his land in using the stones. He started in December 1814 by smashing the Odin Stone. This caused outrage and he was stopped after destroying one other stone and toppling another. The toppled stone was re-erected in 1906 along with some inaccurate reconstruction inside the circle.&lt;ref name=Sten/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 40&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Late Neolithic sites===
[[File:Dwarfie Stane, Island of Hoy, Orkney.jpg|thumb|The Dwarfie Stane]]
The Isbister Chambered Cairn, popularly known as the "[[Tomb of the Eagles]]" is located on the cliffs of [[South Ronaldsay]]. This [[chambered tomb]] was in use for 800 years or more from 3150 BC, and has five separate stalls and three side-chambers. 16,000 human bones were found during the excavations, as well as 725 bird bones, predominantly [[white-tailed sea eagle]] and over {{convert|25|kg|lb}} of pottery shards.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, M. 2006.

The [[Dwarfie Stane]] tomb on the island of [[Hoy]] is made from a single huge block of red [[sandstone]] with a hollowed-out central chamber. This style is quite unlike any other Neolithic Orkney site and probably dates from about 2500 BC. It was the first Orcadian ancient monument to be described in writing, appearing in the 16th century ''Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum'' by Joannem Ben who provided the explanation for its existence as having been built and used by [[Giant (mythology)|giants]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp.19&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
The Bronze Age in Scotland lasted from approximately 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland has produced a relative dearth of remains from this period in comparison to the Neolithic and later Iron Age. This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/scotland/2200-800BC "Scotland: 2200-800 BC Bronze Age"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203063651/http://worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/scotland/2200-800BC |date=3 December 2010 }} worldtimelines.org.uk Retrieved 23 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Graham "The Early Peoples" in Omand (2003) p. 32, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In Orkney, fewer large stone structures were built during this period, burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new [[Beaker people|Beaker]] culture began to dominate. Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[bronze]] metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) pp. 154, 158, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whittington, Graeme and Edwards, Kevin J.

In addition to various Mainland sites such as Knowes of Trotty, Kirbuster Hill and the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar there are various Bronze Age structures on other islands such as Tofts Ness on Sanday, Warness on Eday, the remains of two houses on [[Holm of Faray]], and a burnt mound and farmstead on [[Auskerry]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 74&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Graham "The Early Peoples" in Omand (2003) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron Age==

===Early Iron Age===
The Iron Age provides numerous substantial building remains. In the 1970s excavations at Quanterness, near the site of the Neolithic chambered tomb, revealed an [[Atlantic roundhouse]]. This was built about 700 BC using stone stripped from the older building that had fallen into disuse some two millennia previously. [[File:Midhowe Broch.jpg|thumb|left|Midhowe Broch on the west coast of [[Rousay]]]]Numerous similar finds have been made at for example, Bu on the Mainland and Pierowall Quarry on Westray. These are also many impressive [[broch]] sites. These are substantial stone towers that developed out of the roundhouse tradition in north and west Scotland, whose [[drystone|dry-stone]] walls may have reached {{convert|13|m|ft}} in height. Although Orkney has no broch towers where the surviving walls are more than a few metres high, several important sites have been excavated which have numerous associated buildings forming a "broch village".&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 81&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midhowe Broch]] lies close to the chambered cairn of the same name on Rousay. There appear to have been at least two separate periods of occupation and at some point buttresses were added to the exterior of the wall, suggesting the structure was in need of support. It is one of 11 broch sites on either side of the [[Eynhallow]] Sound.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 122&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 92&amp;ndash;93.&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughston Broch on the island of [[Shapinsay]] was built in the second half of the first millennium BC and excavated in the mid 19th century. Its earth cladding is intact, allowing visitors to peer down into the [[broch]] from above. The walls are up to {{convert|4|m|ft}} thick in places and there is a complete chamber off the entrance passage. The remains of stone furniture are evident in the interior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/shapinsay/burroughstonbroch/index.html Burroughston Broch] Undiscovered Scotland.

Although these structures are usually associated with the storage of food this site is reminiscent of the Neolithic chambered tombs and excavations revealed 18 human skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2006) pp. 127&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[wheelhouse (archaeology)|Wheelhouses]] are stone buildings from the later Iron Age whose characteristic features include an outer wall within which a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel) form the basis for [[lintel]] arches supporting [[corbel]]led roofing with a hearth at the hub.&lt;ref&gt;Turner (1998) p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of [[Shetland]] and the [[Western Isles]]. The Orkney sites are four on Sanday, one on Calf of Eday, one at Hillock of Burroughston on Shapinsay and two on the Mainland at Burrian Broch and Broch of Gurness.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Iain "The wheelhouse" in Ballin Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 112, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arguably there are none in Orkney, in which case the reason for their absence is unknown. See Armit (2003) p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of Rome===
For a brief period Orkney emerged from prehistory and into [[protohistory]]. The Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland. In his ''On the Ocean'' he refers to the most northerly point as ''Orcas'', conceivably a reference to Orkney.&lt;ref&gt;Breeze, David J. "The ancient geography of Scotland" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Broch of Gurness2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Broch of Gurness]]]]
Remarkably, the earliest written record of a formal connection between [[Roman empire|Rome]] and Scotland is the attendance of the "King of Orkney" who was one of eleven British kings who submitted to the Emperor [[Claudius]] at [[Camulodunum|Colchester]] in AD 43 following the [[Roman invasion of Britain|invasion of southern Britain]] three months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) p. 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later [[Caledonia]]n resistance to Rome is striking.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) p. 174-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pomponius Mela]], the Roman geographer, recorded in his ''De Chorographia'', written c. 43 AD, that there were thirty [[List of Orkney islands|Orkney islands]].&lt;ref name= B12&gt;Breeze, David J. "The ancient geography of Scotland" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; There is certainly evidence of an Orcadian connection with Rome prior to AD 60 from pottery found at the [[Broch of Gurness]] and 1st and 2nd century Roman coins have been found at Lingro broch.&lt;ref&gt;Moffat (2005) pp. 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (2008) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman presence in Scotland]] was however little more than a series of relatively brief interludes of partial military occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, William S. "The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes", in Edwards and Ralston (2003) pp. 195, 198. The military presence of Rome lasted for little more than 40 years for most of Scotland and only as much as 80 years in total anywhere. At no time was even half of Scotland's land mass under Roman control.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman influence waned in Scotland from 211 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;Hanson (2003) p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Orkney faded from history again and the Celtic Iron Age way of life continued, largely unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson (2003) p. 216. "The Roman presence in Scotland was little more than a series of brief interludes within a longer continuum of indigenous development."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pictish rule===
[[File:Brough of Birsay.jpg|thumb|right|The tidal islet of Brough of Birsay]]
In the centuries following Rome's excursions into Scottish territory Orkney was, at least for a time, part of the [[Picts|Pictish]] kingdom. Very little is known about the Pictish Orcadians, the main archaeological relics being [[Pictish symbol stones|symbol stones]]. One of the best examples is located on the [[Brough of Birsay]]; it shows 3 warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 106&amp;ndash;07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R39&gt;Ritchie, Anna "The Picts" in Omand (2003) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; This small tidal island has a long history of settlement that continued into the Norse period.

[[Adomnan]], the biographer of St [[Columba]], states that there were Orcadians at the court of the Pictish High King, [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]], in AD 565.&lt;ref name=R39/&gt; These Orcadians were described as "hostages" which could imply difficult relations between Orkney and the king, although they may have simply been guests at the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/history4.htm "A Brief History of Orkney: The Picts - 300-800AD"]. Orkneyjar. Retrieved 29 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A Pictish cemetery was found in the grounds of [[Skaill House]] (adjacent to Skara Brae) in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century. The [[Buckquoy spindle-whorl]] found at a Pictish site on [[Birsay]] is an [[Ogham]]&amp;ndash;inscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now generally considered to be of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Anna "The Picts" in Omand (2003) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th century was also the time the [[Viking]] invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Orkney islands. The Norse era has provided a variety of written records, the substantial [[Orkneyinga Saga]] amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 11&amp;ndash;12 repeats an old jest that the ongoing use of flagstones as a material meant that the Stone Age in Orkney lasted until the first few decades of the 19th century, which saw the introduction of cheap wooden furniture and cement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal excavations are first recorded at Earl's Knoll on [[Papa Stronsay]] in the [[Statistical Account of Scotland]] in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/papar/orkney1.html "The Papar Project: Papa Stronsay"] RCAHMS. Retrieved 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the Dwarfie Stane, the mound was assumed to be a giant's grave at the time. Following soon after this, work on the "Picts-house" (i.e. chambered tomb) at Quanterness commenced, but little else of note was achieved until the mid 19th century. F. W. L. Thomas, whose day job was as a [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] in the [[Royal Navy]] published ''The Celtic Antiquities of Orkney'' in 1852,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, F. W. L. (1852)  	 [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/ARCHway/toc.cfm?rcn=150&amp;vol=34 "Account of some of the Celtic antiquities of Orkney, including the Stones of Stenness, Tumuli, Picts-houses, etc. with plans"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624055013/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/ARCHway/toc.cfm?rcn=150&amp;vol=34 |date=24 June 2009 }} Archaeologia '''34'''. pp. 88&amp;ndash;136. Retrieved 31 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which listed various sites and aimed to interest "antiquarians" in the subject. His hopes were met and about a dozen chambered tombs were worked on between 1849 and 1867 by James Farrer, R.J. Hebden and [[George Petrie (archaeologist)|George Petrie]]. However, other than work at Unstan near [[Stromness]] there was then a lull for about six decades. Then, from the late 1920s, work recommenced with the assistance of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]] and the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. The most eminent archaeologist to work here at this time was [[Vere Gordon Childe]]. He was involved in excavations at Skara Brae and Rinyo, but it was only when a shard of pottery was discovered at the latter site that it became understood that these settlements dated to the Neolithic rather than the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V.G. and Grant, Walter G. (12 December 1938) [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_073/73_006_031.pdf A Stone-Age Settlement at the Braes of Rinyo, Rousay, Orkney]. (pdf) ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland''. Retrieved 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A further 18 tombs were excavated before 1950, including five on [[Eday]] and one on the [[Calf of Eday]] and by the 1960s the outlines of a modern understanding of Orcadian prehistory had emerged. The advent of [[radiocarbon dating]] enabled even more detailed dates to be established and refuted earlier theories that the chambered tombs of Orkney had developed from similar structures found in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]], such as those built by the [[Minoan civilization#Burial and mortuary practice|Minoans]], when it became clear that the former pre-dated the latter by a considerable margin.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges (1984) pp. 20&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Revisionist school of Islamic studies''', (also '''Historical-Critical school of Islamic studies''') is a movement within Islamic studies which started in the 1970s and initiated a [[paradigm shift]] in Islamic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, edited by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main thesis and the concept of Revisionism ==

The core concern of the Revisionist School is to finally show consequence concerning the knowledge, practically available since [[Ignác Goldziher]]'s time, that the traditional Islamic accounts about [[Islam]]'s early times - written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad - are highly questionable as historical sources. This relates to [[Muhammad]]'s biography, the formation history of the [[Quran]], and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed by applying the [[historical criticism|historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation ''Revisionism'' was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a dismissive undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010. Judith Herrin, [https://www.opendemocracy.net/judith-herrin/patricia-crone-brief-memoir Patricia Crone: memoir of a superb Islamic Scholar], openDemocracy 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Today, also the adherents of the new movement use ''Revisionism'' to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Patricia Crone: [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/42023/among-the-believers Among the Believers], Tablet Magazine 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The major representatives ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The new movement originated at the [[SOAS, University of London]] by two publications of [[John Wansbrough]]: ''Quranic Studies'' (1977) and ''The Sectarian Milieu'' (1978). Among the students of Wansbrough are: [[Andrew Rippin]], [[Norman Calder]], [[G. R. Hawting]], [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]. With their work ''Hagarism'' (1977) Patricia Crone and Michael Cook set a milestone in Islamic Studies, since by provocative theses they provided maximal attention in the academic community. Later, both distanced themselves from their too far reaching theses in ''[[Hagarism]]''. Yet they adhered to the basically new academic approach. [[Martin Hinds]], too, studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. [[Robert G. Hoyland]] is a student of Patricia Crone.

A second local focus of the new movement is at the [[Saarland University]] in [[Saarbrücken]], Germany ({{ill|Saarbrücker Schule|de}}). Since the 1970s there is a focus on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran, by [[Günter Lüling]] und [[Gerd R. Puin|Gerd-Rüdiger Puin]]. Also in Saarbrücken, [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]] developed in the 2000s together with [[Volker Popp]], [[Christoph Luxenberg]] and [[Markus Groß]] a theory of Islam's earliest times which has no need for Muhammad as a historical person.

Further representatives are: [[Hans Jansen]] from the Netherlands who in 2005/7 published a work showing in detail why the known accounts of Muhammad's life are legends only. [[Yehuda D. Nevo]] published in 2003 his work ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' in which he denies the historicity of Muhammad. [[James A. Bellamy]] is known for his textual criticism of the Quran and for his proposals of emendations, i.e. proposals to correct the traditional text of the Quran. [[Fred Donner]] published in 2010 the first well-founded hypothesis on the early time of Islam without excessive exaggerations which found public attention.

[[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] studied history and became a renowned author of popular science publications on ancient history. With his work ''[[In the Shadow of the Sword (book)|In the Shadow of the Sword]]'' (2012) Tom Holland contributed heavily to the popularization of the new research results. Tom Holland depicts a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches, thus having like Fred Donner provided a well-founded hypothesis of Islam's early times which avoids exaggerations.

[[Sven Kalisch]] is a German Islamic theologian who rejected teaching Islamic theology without considering the new results of historical-critical research. Thereupon the German Islamic associations withdrew his allowance to teach future Islamic theologians and teachers. Later Kalisch left Islam. Today he is teaching the history of ideas in the Near East in Late Antiquity in [[Münster]].

== The thesis of the incredibility of the traditional Islamic accounts ==
The arguments against the credibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. [[Hans Jansen]] in his work ''De Historische Mohammed''. Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by [[Ibn Ishaq]] resp. [[Ibn Hisham]] which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.

Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jansen, ''De Historische Mohammed'', 2005/7&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although there were [[leap month]]s at the time of Muhammad which had to be intercalated frequently into the moon calendar and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq is in a leap month.
* The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later is not very credible.
* The depiction of a strong relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha is motivated politically resp. theologically: [[Aisha]] was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, [[Ali]]. In order to legitimate this succession against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that the prophet consummated marriage with Aisha allegedly at an astonishingly early age. 
* The depiction of slaughtering the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qurayza]] is motivated politically resp. theologically: As the "[[Constitution of Medina|treaty of Medina]]" shows, the Jews were initially part of the [[Umma]] and were addressed as "believers"; cf. the research of Prof. [[Fred Donner]]. When Islam later separated from Judaism, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished but not each single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the "treaty of Medina". Finally, such an mass slaughtering would not have gone unnoticed, even not in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews: Jews used to live in international trading networks, and Jews are known to write down their history. Most likely, the slaughtering of the Banu Quraiza never happened.
* The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to boldly exaggerate the capacities of the prophet. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad always kills more enemies than according to other traditions. Even the depiction of he prophet's male potency (who allegedly could satisfy all his wives in one night) is exaggerated in a questionable way. Of the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as an illiterate person. The [[revelation]] of the [[Quran]]ic text is all the more miraculous and the capacity of the prophet is all the more astonishing if Muhammad was an illiterate person.
* The account of [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State]] including the emperor of Byzantium, that they should convert to Islam, retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion.

Jansen points out that the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation of the Quran. The Quran mostly does not reveal the situation for which a revelation was made. The historical context is merely indicated, at best. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.

In her work ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' Patricia Crone gave a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This examination is much cited in literature yet discusses only a few aspects of Muhammad's biography meant to be exemplary for the nature of all the Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: ''""These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there ''was'' an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities."''&lt;ref name="crone-encounter"&gt;Patricia Crone: Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, 1987, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

== The new theses about the true beginnings of Islam ==
Starting point for all researchers is the awareness that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:

* The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later resp. were reworked later. In addition to that many small deviations came into the text as usual with ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.&lt;ref&gt;John Wansbrough: ''Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation'' (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd-Rüdiger Puin: ''Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San’a’'', in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur’an as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence and meaning of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially with the question whether any and how many parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or, whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time. The researchers' opinions differ in this question.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003); Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Donner suggests an early date for the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'' (1998), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Quran is not written in a "pure" Arabic yet the syriac Aramaic language seems to have a certain influence on the language of the Quran which was forgotten later. This could be a possible explanation why a fifth of the Quranic text is difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 377 ff.; Christoph Luxenberg: ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran – A Contribution to the Decoding of the Koran'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Islam did not rise among polytheistic pagans in the desert, yet in a milieu where Jewish and Christian texts were well-known. The "infidels" were no pagan polytheists yet monotheists who were considered to deviate slightly from monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Hawting: ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Rise of Islam: From Polemic to History'' (1999); Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* The geographical descriptions in the Quran and later traditions do not fit to Mecca. They rather point to  a place somewhere in north-western Arabia, e.g. to Petra in Jordania.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) pp. 22-24; Patricia Crone: ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' (1987); and the private researcher Dan Gibson: ''Quranic Geography'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The connection of Muslims and Jews was very close in the early times of Islam. Also Jews were called "believers" and were part of the umma. Antisemitic texts as e.g. the slaughtering of the Jewish tribe of the Banu Qurayza came into being long after Muhammad when Islam separated from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) pp. 68 ff.; cf. also Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7) pp. 311-317 (German edition 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the beginning, secular and spiritual power were united in the person of the caliph. There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: ''God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Islamic expansion probably was no Islamic, religiously motivated expansion, yet a secular, Arabic expansion. The expansion did not yet result in an oppression of the non-Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Hoyland: ''In God's Path. The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Muhammad there were at least two phases which were of major importance for the formation of Islam in its later shape:
** Under the Umayyad caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was built. There the word "Islam" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply "believers", and coins ware minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003) pp. 410-413; Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 336 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
** During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest to legitimize their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone: ''Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity'' (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: ''Mohammed'' (2005/7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Revisionism ==

The consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book ''Hagarism'' (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.
&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism is expressed by researchers like [[Tilman Nagel]], who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/islamwissenschaft-befreit-den-propheten-aus-seiner-religioesen-umklammerung-1464313.html Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religiösen Umklammerung!] in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
A certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to "revisionism" alone but to "extreme revisionism" or "ultra-revisionism".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: [https://books.google.de/books?id=xI_7uosa4FMC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=EMLqEHO3nI&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity] (2012), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregor Schoeler]] discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: "To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schoeler, ''Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen Überlieferung über das Leben Mohammeds'', de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: "dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance comes partly from older academics who still live in their thoughts in the world of the Islamic legends.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/rezensionen/rezension-tilman-nagel-eine-sackgasse-ohlig/ Review of: Mohammed. Leben und Legende, by Tilman Nagel], in:  imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] in his famous work [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962) described, a new paradigm prevails in academia often not by convincing current academics but by convincing the next generation of academics.

Continuous resistance against the new paradigm comes from researchers who fundamentally reject the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. They argue that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too. Adherents of Revisionism doubt whether this still is a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam ==
{{POV check|section|date=October 2016}}
The [[relationship between religion and science]] had always been shaped by conflicts...{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} It is always a hurting process for every religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself;{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious [[reform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion (2010) pp. 292 f. - Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;

By nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/wissenschaftliches-arbeiten-in-der-islamwissenschaft/ Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft], in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):
* As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[Patricia Crone]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], [[Fred Donner]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[Günter Lüling]].
* As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[John Wansbrough]], [[Hans Jansen]], [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]], [[Yehuda D. Nevo]].

Besides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:&lt;ref&gt;Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;
* Traditional texts which had shaped Islam for centuries - yet ''not'' from the beginning - are not true.
* The Quranic text has not been handed down to our times unchanged.
* Even in the Quran, God's word is in many respects clothed in human words.
* Muhammad did not live in Mecca.
* The relationship between Muhammad and Jews and Christians was different than always thought it had been.

==Revisionism by non-specialists==
[[Ibn Warraq]], an author known for his criticism of Islam, has complied several revisionist essays in his book, ''[[The Quest for the Historical Muhammad (Ibn Warraq)|The Quest for the Historical Muhammad]].'' [[Fred Donner]], reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough school of revisionism, the author presents a "one-sided selection" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The results is "a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader."&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-middle-east-studies/article/the-quest-for-the-historical-muhammad-edited-and-translated-by-warraqibn-554-pages-glossary-list-of-tribes-and-individuals-chronology-amherst-ny-prometheus-books-2000-3495-cloth-isbn-1-57392-787-2/4C3D7FD138EF645D933ADDB0BCB33D6B Review of: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, by Ibn Warraq],  Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, 35(1), pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], in this book ''Did Muhammad Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam's Obscure Origins,'' advances the thesis that Islam was a state-religion created by the [[Abbasids]] to justify the empire.

The '''Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute''' is a permanent [[research institute]] at the [[University of Utah]] that focuses on the development of new [[scientific computing]] and [[scientific visualization|visualization]] techniques, tools, and systems with primary applications to [[biomedical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute – Home|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/home.html|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipson|first1=Hod|last2=Kurman|first2=Melba|title=Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Indianapolis, IN|isbn=978-1118350638|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCI Institute is noted worldwide in the [[visualization (graphics)|visualization]] community for contributions by faculty, alumni, and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shneiderman|first1=Ben|title=The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-875883-9|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty are associated primarily with the [[University of Utah School of Computing|School of Computing]], Department of Bioengineering, Department of Mathematics, and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with auxiliary faculty in the [[University of Utah Medical School|Medical School]] and [[University of Utah College of Architecture and Planning|School of Architecture]].

==History==
The Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute started in 1992 as a research group in the [[University of Utah School of Computing]] by [[Christopher R. Johnson|Chris Johnson]] and Rob MacLeod. In 1994 this group became the Center for Scientific Computing and Imaging, and in 2000 the name was changed to the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute. In 2007, the SCI Institute was awarded funding from [[USTAR]] to recruit more faculty in medical imaging technology. The SCI Institute was recognized as an [[Nvidia|NVIDIA]] [[CUDA]] Center of Excellence in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humber|first1=Andrew|title=NVIDIA Recognizes University Of Utah As A Cuda Center Of Excellence|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1217508281856.html|publisher=NVIDIA|accessdate=8 April 2017|language=en-us|date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[USTAR]] funding allowed faculty recruitment for genomic [[signal processing]] and information visualization. in 2014, [[Intel]] partnered with the SCI Institute to form the Intel Parallel Computing Center for Scientific Rendering to research and develop large scale and in situ visualization techniques for Intel hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel® Parallel Computing Center at SCI Institute, University of Utah {{!}} Intel® Software|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-parallel-computing-center-at-sci-institute-university-of-utah|website=Intel Developer Zone|accessdate=8 April 2017|language=en|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The overarching research objective of the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute is to conduct [[applied science|application-driven research]] in the creation of new [[scientific computing]] techniques, tools, and systems. Given the proximity and availability of research conducted at the [[University of Utah School of Medicine]], a main application focus is [[medicine]]. SCI Institute researchers also apply computational techniques to scientific and engineering sub-specialties, such as [[fluid dynamics]], [[biomechanics]], [[electrophysiology]], bioelectric fields, [[scientific visualization]], [[parallel computing]], [[inverse problems]], and [[neuroimaging]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1328">'''Social Nature''' is the core concept of a geographical work on the [[social construction]] of [[nature]], entitled ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', which has been published by [[Noel Castree]] and [[Bruce Braun]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;CASTREE, Noel and BRAUN, B., ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', Oxford and New York: Blackwell, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

It says that the concept of Social Nature was created by [[Critical geography|critical geographers]] and embraces the idea of a [[socialize]]d [[nature]]. Critical geographers like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] "insisted that nature is social in three related ways":&lt;ref&gt;CASTREE, Noel and BRAUN, Bruce (Eds.), ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', Oxford: Blackwell, 2001, pp.10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Knowledge "of nature is invariably inflected with the biases of the" knowers,
*"Though knowledges of nature are social through and through, the social dimensions of nature are not reducible to knowledge alone",
*Societies "''physically reconstitute'' nature, both intentionally and unintentionally", to the point of internalizing nature into social processes (particularly in advanced Western societies).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51335">[[File:1915ca abger fluegel (cropped and mirrored).jpg|thumb|Airflow separating from an [[airfoil]] at a high [[angle of attack]], as occurs at the stall.]]
In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''stall''' is a reduction in the [[lift (force)|lift]] coefficient generated by a [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] as [[angle of attack]] increases.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', p. 486. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when the [[critical angle of attack]] of the foil is exceeded.  The critical angle of attack is typically about 15 degrees, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil, and [[Reynolds number]].

Stalls in fixed-wing flight are often experienced as a sudden reduction in lift as the pilot increases the wing's angle of attack and exceeds its critical angle of attack (which may be due to slowing down below [[#Speed|stall speed]] in level flight). A stall does not mean that the engine(s) have stopped working, or that the aircraft has stopped moving—the effect is the same even in an unpowered [[glider aircraft]]. [[Thrust vectoring|Vectored thrust]] in manned and unmanned aircraft is used to surpass the stall limit, thereby giving rise to [[post-stall]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Gal-Or, ''Vectored Propulsion, Supermaneuverability, and Robot Aircraft'', Springer Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|0-387-97161-0}}, {{ISBN|3-540-97161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USAF &amp; NATO Report RTO-TR-015 AC/323/(HFM-015)/TP-1 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because stalls are most commonly discussed in connection with [[aviation]], this article discusses stalls as they relate mainly to aircraft, in particular [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. The principles of stall discussed here translate to foils in other fluids as well.

==Formal definition==
[[File:StallFormation.svg|right|350px]]
A stall is a condition in [[aerodynamics]] and aviation wherein the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point such that lift begins to decrease. The angle at which this occurs is called the ''critical angle of attack''. This critical angle is dependent upon the airfoil section or profile of the wing, its [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]], its [[aspect ratio (aeronautics)|aspect ratio]], and other factors, but is typically in the range of 8 to 20 degrees relative to the incoming wind ("relative wind") for most subsonic airfoils. The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack on the [[lift coefficient]] versus angle-of-attack curve at which the maximum lift coefficient occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flow separation]] begins to occur at small angles of attack while attached flow over the wing is still dominant. As angle of attack increases, the separated regions on the top of the wing increase in size and hinder the wing's ability to create lift. At the critical angle of attack, separated flow is so dominant that additional increases in angle of attack produce ''less'' lift and more [[drag (physics)|drag]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A fixed-wing aircraft during a stall may experience [[buffeting]] or a change in [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]]. Most aircraft are designed to have a gradual stall with characteristics that will warn the pilot and give them time to react. For example, an aircraft that does not buffet before the stall may have an audible alarm or a [[stick shaker]] installed to simulate the feel of a buffet by vibrating the stick fore and aft. The critical angle of attack in steady straight and level flight can be attained only at low airspeed. Attempts to increase the angle of attack at higher airspeeds can cause a high-speed stall or may merely cause the aircraft to climb.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Any [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] of the aircraft as it enters the stall regime can result in [[autorotation (fixed-wing aircraft)|autorotation]], which is also sometimes referred to as a "[[spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]". As air no longer flows smoothly over the wings during a stall, [[aileron]] control of roll becomes less effective, whilst simultaneously the tendency for the ailerons to generate [[adverse yaw]] increases. This characteristic increases the lift from the advancing wing and increases the likelihood of the aircraft entering into a spin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Lift curve.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|An example of the relationship between angle of attack and lift on a cambered airfoil. The exact relationship is usually measured in a [[wind tunnel]] and depends on the airfoil section. The relationship for an aircraft wing depends on the planform and its aspect ratio.]]

The graph shows that the greatest amount of lift is produced as the critical angle of attack is reached (which in early-20th century aviation was called the "burble point"). This angle is 17.5 degrees in this case, but it varies from airfoil to airfoil. In particular, for aerodynamically thick airfoils (thickness to [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] ratios of around 10%), the critical angle is higher than with a thin airfoil of the same [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]]. Symmetric airfoils have lower critical angles (but also work efficiently in inverted flight). The graph shows that, as the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle, the lift produced by the airfoil decreases.

The information in a graph of this kind is gathered using a model of the airfoil in a [[wind tunnel]]. Because aircraft models are normally used, rather than full-size machines, special care is needed to make sure that data is taken in the same [[Reynolds number]] regime (or scale speed) as in free flight. The separation of flow from the upper wing surface at high angles of attack is quite different at low Reynolds number from that at the high Reynolds numbers of real aircraft. High-pressure wind tunnels are one solution to this problem. In general, steady operation of an aircraft at an angle of attack above the critical angle is not possible because, after exceeding the critical angle, the loss of lift from the wing causes the nose of the aircraft to fall, reducing the angle of attack again. This nose drop, independent of control inputs, indicates the pilot has actually stalled the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 5.28 and 16.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.D., ''A History of Aerodynamics'', pp. 296–311&lt;/ref&gt;

This graph shows the stall angle, yet in practice most pilot operating handbooks (POH) or generic flight manuals describe stalling in terms of [[airspeed]]. This is because all aircraft are equipped with an [[airspeed indicator]], but fewer aircraft have an angle of attack indicator. An aircraft's stalling speed is published by the manufacturer (and is required for certification by flight testing) for a range of weights and flap positions, but the stalling angle of attack is not published.

As speed reduces, angle of attack has to increase to keep lift constant until the critical angle is reached. The airspeed at which this angle is reached is the (1g, unaccelerated) stalling speed of the aircraft in that particular configuration. Deploying [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]]/slats decreases the stall speed to allow the aircraft to take off and land at a lower speed.

==Aerodynamic description==

===Fixed-wing aircraft===
A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] can be made to stall in any [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|pitch]] attitude or bank angle or at any airspeed but deliberate stalling is commonly practiced by reducing the speed to the unaccelerated stall speed, at a safe altitude. Unaccelerated (1g) stall speed varies on different fixed-wing aircraft and is represented by colour codes on the [[airspeed indicator]]. As the plane flies at this speed, the angle of attack must be increased to prevent any loss of altitude or gain in airspeed (which corresponds to the stall angle described above). The pilot will notice the [[aircraft flight control system|flight controls]] have become less responsive and may also notice some buffeting, a result of the turbulent air separated from the wing hitting the tail of the aircraft.

In most [[light aircraft]], as the stall is reached, the aircraft will start to descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight) and the nose will pitch down. Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, until smooth air-flow over the wing is restored. Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver is normally quite safe, and, if correctly handled, leads to only a small loss in altitude (20–30&amp;nbsp;m/50–100&amp;nbsp;ft). It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR part 61&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations Part25 section 201&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of an unfamiliar aircraft type. The only dangerous aspect of a stall is a lack of altitude for recovery.

A special form of asymmetric stall in which the aircraft also rotates about its yaw axis is called a [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]. A spin can occur if an aircraft is stalled and there is an asymmetric yawing moment applied to it.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt; This yawing moment can be aerodynamic (sideslip angle, rudder, adverse yaw from the ailerons), thrust related (p-factor, one engine inoperative on a multi-engine non-centreline thrust aircraft), or from less likely sources such as severe turbulence. The net effect is that one wing is stalled before the other and the aircraft descends rapidly while rotating, and some aircraft cannot recover from this condition without correct pilot control inputs (which must stop yaw) and loading.&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR part 23&lt;/ref&gt; A new solution to the problem of difficult (or impossible) stall-spin recovery is provided by the [[ballistic parachute]] recovery system.

The most common stall-spin scenarios occur on takeoff ([[departure resistance|departure]] stall) and during landing (base to final turn) because of insufficient airspeed during these maneuvers. Stalls also occur during a go-around manoeuvre if the pilot does not properly respond to the out-of-trim situation resulting from the transition from low power setting to high power setting at low speed.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Stall speed is increased when the wing surfaces are [[Atmospheric icing|contaminated with ice]] or frost creating a rougher surface, and heavier airframe due to ice accumulation.

Stalls occur not only at slow airspeed, but at any speed when the wings exceed their critical angle of attack. Attempting to increase the angle of attack at 1g by moving the control column back normally causes the aircraft to climb. However, aircraft often experience higher g-forces, such as when turning steeply or pulling out of a dive. In these cases, the wings are already operating at a higher angle of attack to create the necessary force (derived from lift) to accelerate in the desired direction. Increasing the g-loading still further, by pulling back on the controls, can cause the stalling angle to be exceeded, even though the aircraft is flying at a high speed.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These "high-speed stalls" produce the same buffeting characteristics as 1g stalls and can also initiate a spin if there is also any yawing.

===Symptoms of onset===
One symptom of an approaching stall is slow and sloppy controls. As the speed of the aircraft decreases approaching the stall, there is less air moving over the wing, and, therefore, less air will be deflected by the control surfaces (ailerons, elevator, and rudder) at this lower speed. Some buffeting may also be felt from the turbulent flow above the wings as the stall is reached. The stall warning will sound, if fitted, in most aircraft 5 to 10 knots above the stall speed.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations part 25 section 207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Different aircraft types have different stalling characteristics. A benign stall is one where the nose drops gently and the wings remain level throughout. Slightly more demanding is a stall in which one wing stalls slightly before the other, causing that wing to drop sharply, with the possibility of entering a spin. A dangerous stall is one in which the nose rises, pushing the wing deeper into the stalled state and potentially leading to an unrecoverable ''[[#Deep stall|deep stall]]''. This can occur in some T-tailed aircraft wherein the turbulent airflow from the stalled wing can blanket the control surfaces at the tail.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

This speed is called the "stall speed". An aircraft flying at its stall speed cannot climb, and an aircraft flying below its stall speed cannot stop descending. Any attempt to do so by increasing angle of attack, without first increasing airspeed, will result in a stall.

The actual stall speed will vary depending on the airplane's weight, altitude, configuration, and vertical and lateral acceleration. Guidelines for the case of zero acceleration are provided by the following [[V speeds]]:

While an aircraft's V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; speed is computed by design, its V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; speeds must be demonstrated empirically by flight testing.&lt;ref&gt;Flight testing of fixed wing aircraft.

==In accelerated and turning flight==
[[File:Accelerated stall.gif|thumb|350px|Illustration of a turning flight stall, occurring during a co-ordinated turn with progressively increasing angle of bank.]]
The normal stall speed, specified by the V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values above, always refers to straight and level flight, where the [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] is equal to 1g. However, if the aircraft is turning or pulling up from a dive, additional lift is required to provide the vertical or lateral acceleration, and so the stall speed is higher. An accelerated stall is a stall that occurs under such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Considering, for example, a [[banked turn#Aviation|banked turn]], the [[lift (force)|lift]] required is equal to the [[weight]] of the aircraft plus extra lift to provide the [[centripetal force]] necessary to perform the turn; that is:&lt;ref name=Clancy5.22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W. (1979), ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics and Flight Mechanics'', p. 464, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York {{ISBN|0-471-03032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = nW&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = lift
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = load factor (greater than 1 in a turn)
:&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = weight of the aircraft

To achieve the extra lift, the [[lift coefficient]], and so the angle of attack, will have to be higher than it would be in straight and level flight at the same speed. Therefore, given that the stall always occurs at the same critical angle of attack,&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 5.8 and 5.22&lt;/ref&gt; by increasing the load factor (e.g., by tightening the turn) such critical angle – and the stall – will be reached with the airspeed remaining well above the normal stall speed,&lt;ref name="Clancy5.22"&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.22&lt;/ref&gt; that is:&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Equation 14.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W.

The table that follows gives some examples of the relation between the [[angle of bank]] and the square root of the load factor. It derives from the trigonometric relation ([[Cosecant|secant]]) between &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in a turn with bank angle of 45°, V&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; is 19% higher than V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.

It should be noted that, according to [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called '''turning flight stall''', while the term ''accelerated'' is used to indicate an ''accelerated turning stall'' only, that is, a turning flight stall where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A notable example of air accident involving a low-altitude turning flight stall is the [[1994 Fairchild Air Force Base B-52 crash]].

==Types==

===Dynamic stall===
Dynamic stall is a non-linear unsteady aerodynamic effect that occurs when airfoils rapidly change the angle of attack. The rapid change can cause a strong [[vortex]] to be shed from the leading edge of the aerofoil, and travel backwards above the wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buchner |first1=A. J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |title=Measurements of the flow due to a rapidly pitching plate using time resolved high resolution PIV |journal=Aerospace Science and Technology |volume=44 |pages=4 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1270963814000789 |publisher=Aerospace Science and Technology |accessdate=18 October 2015 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.ast.2014.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vortex, containing high-velocity airflows, briefly increases the lift produced by the wing. As soon as it passes behind the trailing edge, however, the lift reduces dramatically, and the wing is in normal stall.&lt;ref name="Filippone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerodyn.org/Dstall/dstall.html |title=Dynamic Stall, Unsteady Aerodynamics |accessdate=March 25, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229110350/http://aerodyn.org/Dstall/dstall.html |archivedate=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic stall is an effect most associated with helicopters and flapping wings, though also occurs in wind turbines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/jfm.2018.112 |title=Dynamic stall in vertical axis wind turbines: Scaling and topological considerations |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=841 |pages=746-66 |year=2018 |last1=Buchner |first1=A-J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |last3=Honnery |first3=D. |last4=Smits |first4=A.J. |bibcode=2018JFM...841..746B }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and due to gusting airflow. During forward flight, some regions of a helicopter blade may incur flow that reverses (compared to the direction of blade movement), and thus includes rapidly changing angles of attack. Oscillating (flapping) wings, such as those of insects—including the most famous one, the [[bumblebee]]—may rely almost entirely on dynamic stall for lift production, provided the oscillations are fast compared to the speed of flight, and the angle of the wing changes rapidly compared to airflow direction.&lt;ref name="Filippone" /&gt;

Stall delay can occur on [[airfoils]] subject to a high angle of attack and a three-dimensional flow. When the angle of attack on an airfoil is increasing rapidly, the flow will remain substantially attached to the airfoil to a significantly higher angle of attack than can be achieved in steady-state conditions. As a result, the stall is delayed momentarily and a lift coefficient significantly higher than the steady-state maximum is achieved. The effect was first noticed on [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This is a single value of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, for a given aircraft configuration, where there is no pitching moment, i.e. a trim point.

Effects similar to deep stall had been known to occur on some aircraft designs before the term was coined. A prototype [[Gloster Javelin]] ([[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial]] ''WD808'') was lost in a crash on 11 June 1953, to a "locked in" stall&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=20519 ASN Wikibase Occurrence # 20519] Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Waterton&lt;ref name=waterton&gt;"The Quick and the Dead" W.A.Waterton, Frederick Mueller, London 1956, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; states that the trimming tailplane was found to be the wrong way for recovery.

The name "deep stall" first came into widespread use after [[1963 BAC One-Eleven test crash|the crash]] of the prototype [[BAC 1-11]] G-ASHG on 22 October 1963, which killed its crew.&lt;ref&gt;""Report on the Accident to B.A.C. One-Eleven G-ASHG at Cratt Hill, near Chicklade, Wiltshire on 22nd October 1963'', Ministry of Aviation C.A.P. 219, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; This led to changes to the aircraft, including the installation of a [[stick shaker]] (see below) to clearly warn the pilot of an impending stall. Stick shakers are now a standard part of commercial airliners. Nevertheless, the problem continues to cause accidents; on 3 June 1966, a [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] (G-ARPY), was [[1966 Felthorpe Trident crash|lost to deep stall]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19660603-1 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Hawker Siddeley HS-121 Trident 1C G-ARPY Felthorpe |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=1966-06-03 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; deep stall is suspected to be cause of another Trident (the [[British European Airways Flight 548]] ''G-ARPI'') crash – known as the "Staines Disaster" – on 18 June 1972 when the crew failed to notice the conditions and had disabled the stall recovery system.&lt;ref&gt;AIB Report 4/73, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 1980, a prototype of the [[Canadair Challenger]] [[business jet]] crashed after initially entering a deep stall from 17,000&amp;nbsp;ft and having both engines flame-out.

[[Canard (aeronautics)|Canard-configured]] aircraft are also at risk of getting into a deep stall.

===Tip stall===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Aircraft with a [[swept wing]] suffer from a particular form of stalling behaviour at low speed. At high speed the airflow over the wing tends to progress directly along the chord, but as the speed is reduced a sideways component due to the angle of the [[leading edge]] has time to build up. Airflow at the root is affected only by the angle of the wing, but at a point further along the span, the airflow is affected both by the angle as well as any sideways component of the airflow from the air closer to the root. This results in a pattern of airflow that is progressively "sideways" as one moves toward the wingtip.

As it is only the airflow along the chord that contributes to lift, this means that the wing begins to develop less lift at the tip than the root. In extreme cases, this can lead to the wingtip entering stall long before the wing as a whole. In this case the average lift of the wing as a whole moves forward; the inboard sections are continuing to generate lift and are generally in front of the [[center of gravity]] (C of G), while the tips are no longer contributing and are behind the C of G. This produces a strong nose-up pitch in the aircraft, which can lead to more of the wing stalling, the lift moving further forward, and so forth. This chain reaction is considered very dangerous and was known as the [[pitch-up]].

Tip stall can be prevented in a number of ways, at least one of which is found on almost all modern aircraft. An early solution was the addition of [[wing fence]]s to re-direct sideways moving air back towards the rear of the wing. A similar solution is the dog-tooth notch seen on some aircraft, like the [[Avro Arrow]]. A more common modern solution is to use some degree of [[Washout (aviation)|washout]].

==Warning and safety devices==
Fixed-wing aircraft can be equipped with devices to prevent or postpone a stall or to make it less (or in some cases more) severe, or to make recovery easier.
* An '''aerodynamic twist''' can be introduced to the wing with the leading edge near the wing tip twisted downward. This is called '''washout''' and causes the [[wing root]] to stall before the wing tip. This makes the stall gentle and progressive. Since the stall is delayed at the wing tips, where the [[aileron]]s are, roll control is maintained when the stall begins.
* A '''[[stall strip]]''' is a small sharp-edged device that, when attached to the leading edge of a wing, encourages the stall to start there in preference to any other location on the wing. If attached close to the wing root, it makes the stall gentle and progressive; if attached near the wing tip, it encourages the aircraft to drop a wing when stalling.
* A '''[[Wing fence|stall fence]]''' is a flat plate in the direction of the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] to stop separated flow progressing out along the wing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Transonic_Wings/TH20G6.htm |title=Stall fences and vortex generators |access-date=2009-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508032211/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Transonic_Wings/TH20G6.htm |archive-date=2009-05-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Vortex generator]]s''', tiny strips of metal or plastic placed on top of the wing near the leading edge that protrude past the [[boundary layer]] into the free stream. As the name implies, they energize the boundary layer by mixing free stream airflow with boundary layer flow thereby creating vortices, this increases the [[momentum]] in the boundary layer. By increasing the momentum of the boundary layer, airflow separation and the resulting stall may be delayed.
* An '''anti-stall strake''' is a [[leading edge extension]] that generates a [[vortex]] on the wing upper surface to postpone the stall.
* A '''[[stick pusher]]''' is a mechanical device that prevents the pilot from stalling an aircraft. It pushes the elevator control forward as the stall is approached, causing a reduction in the angle of attack. In generic terms, a stick pusher is known as a ''stall identification device'' or ''stall identification system''.&lt;ref&gt;US [[Federal Aviation Administration]], Advisory Circular 25-7A ''Flight Test Guide for Certification of Transport Category Airplanes'', paragraph 228&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[stick shaker]]''' is a mechanical device that shakes the pilot's controls to warn of the onset of stall.
* A '''stall warning''' is an electronic or mechanical device that sounds an [[buzzer|audible warning]] as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain some form of this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a ''stall warning horn'', which consists of either a [[pressure]] [[sensor]] or a movable metal tab that actuates a [[switch]], and produces an audible warning in response.
* An '''angle-of-attack indicator''' for light aircraft, the "AlphaSystemsAOA" and a nearly identical "'''Lift Reserve Indicator'''", are both pressure differential instruments that display margin above stall and/or angle of attack on an instantaneous, continuous readout. The General Technics CYA-100 displays true angle of attack via a magnetically coupled vane. An AOA indicator provides a visual display of the amount of available lift throughout its slow speed envelope regardless of the many variables that act upon an aircraft. This indicator is immediately responsive to changes in speed, angle of attack, and wind conditions, and automatically compensates for aircraft weight, altitude, and temperature.
* An '''angle of attack limiter''' or an "alpha" limiter is a flight computer that automatically prevents pilot input from causing the plane to rise over the stall angle. Some alpha limiters can be disabled by the pilot.

Stall warning systems often involve inputs from a broad range of sensors and systems to include a dedicated angle of attack sensor.

Blockage, damage, or inoperation of stall and angle of attack (AOA) probes can lead to unreliability of the stall warning, and cause the stick pusher, overspeed warning, autopilot, and yaw damper to malfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/harco-probes-still-causing-eclipse-airspeed-problems/ |title=Harco Probes Still Causing Eclipse Airspeed Problems |access-date=2008-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926190738/http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/harco-probes-still-causing-eclipse-airspeed-problems/ |archive-date=2008-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a forward [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] is used for pitch control, rather than an aft tail, the canard is designed to meet the airflow at a slightly greater angle of attack than the wing. Therefore, when the aircraft pitch increases abnormally, the canard will usually stall first, causing the nose to drop and so preventing the wing from reaching its critical AOA. Thus, the risk of main wing stalling is greatly reduced. However, if the main wing stalls, recovery becomes difficult, as the canard is more deeply stalled and angle of attack increases rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Airplane stability and control By Malcolm J. Abzug, E. Eugene Larrabee Chapter 17 {{ISBN|0-521-80992-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an aft tail is used, the wing is designed to stall before the tail. In this case, the wing can be flown at higher lift coefficient (closer to stall) to produce more overall lift.

Most military combat aircraft have an angle of attack indicator among the pilot's instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely how close to the stall point the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot's display, instead driving a stall warning indicator or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly by wire systems).

==Flight beyond the stall==
As a wing stalls, [[aileron]] effectiveness is reduced, making the plane hard to control and increasing the risk of a spin starting. [[Post stall]], steady flight beyond the stalling angle (where the coefficient of lift is largest) requires engine thrust to replace lift as well as alternative controls to replace the loss of effectiveness of the ailerons. For high-powered aircraft, the loss of lift (and increase in drag) beyond the stall angle is less of a problem than maintaining control. Some aircraft may be subject to [[post-stall gyration]] (e.g. the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]) or susceptible to entering a [[Spin (aerodynamics)#Unrecoverable spins|flat-spin]] (e.g. [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]). Control beyond-stall can be provided by reaction control systems (e.g. [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104A]]), vectored thrust, as well as a rolling [[stabilator]] (or taileron). The enhanced manoeuvering capability by flights at very high angles of attack can provide a tactical advantage for military fighters such as the [[F-22 Raptor]]. Short term stalls at 90–120° (e.g. [[Pugachev's Cobra]]) are sometimes performed at airshows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationfans.com/node/12 Pugachev's Cobra Maneuver]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest angle of attack in sustained flight so far demonstrated was 70 degrees in the [[X-31]] at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/X-31/HTML/EC94-42478-3.html X-31 EC94-42478-3: X-31 at High Angle of Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustained post-stall flight is a type of [[supermaneuverability]].

==Spoilers==
{{Main|Spoiler (aeronautics)}}
Except for flight training, airplane testing, and [[aerobatics]], a stall is usually an undesirable event. [[spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoilers]] (sometimes called lift dumpers), however, are devices that are intentionally deployed to create a carefully controlled [[flow separation]] over part of an aircraft's wing to reduce the lift it generates, increase the drag, and allow the aircraft to descend more rapidly without gaining speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spoilers|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/spoil.html|publisher=[[NASA]], [[Glenn Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoilers are also deployed asymmetrically (one wing only) to enhance roll control. Spoilers can also be used on aborted take-offs and after main wheel contact on landing to increase the aircraft's weight on its wheels for better braking action.

Unlike powered airplanes, which can control descent by increasing or decreasing thrust, gliders have to increase drag to increase the rate of descent. In high-performance gliders, spoiler deployment is extensively used to control the approach to landing.

Spoilers can also be thought of as  "lift reducers" because they reduce the lift of the wing in which the spoiler resides. For example, an uncommanded roll to the left could be reversed by raising the right wing spoiler (or only a few of the spoilers present in large airliner wings). This has the advantage of avoiding the need to increase lift in the wing that is dropping (which may bring that wing closer to stalling).

==History==
[[Otto Lilienthal]] died while flying in 1896 as the result of a stall. Wilbur Wright encountered stalls for the first time in 1901, while flying his second glider. Awareness of Lilienthal's accident and Wilbur's experience, motivated the [[Wright Brothers]] to design their plane in "[[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]]" configuration. This made recoveries from stalls easier and more gentle. The design saved the brothers' lives more than once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1900/designing.cfm Designing the 1900 Wright Glider] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002349/http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1900/designing.cfm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]] worked on his "[[Autogiro]]" project to develop a rotary wing aircraft which, he hoped, would be unable to stall and which therefore would be safer than aeroplanes. In developing the resulting "[[autogyro]]" aircraft, he solved many engineering problems which made the [[helicopter]] possible.

'''Sustainable agriculture''' is [[agriculture |farming]] in [[sustainability |sustainable]] ways based on an understanding of [[ecosystem services]], the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. 

==History of the term==
The phrase 'sustainable agriculture' was reportedly coined by the Australian agricultural scientist [[Gordon McClymont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Rural Science Graduates Association | year=2002 | url=http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html | title={{sic |In Memo |rium |hide=y |expected=In Memoriam}} - Former Staff and Students of Rural Science at UNE | publisher=[[University of New England (Australia) |University of New England]] | accessdate=21 October 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606220152/http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html | archivedate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wes Jackson is credited with the first publication of the expression in his 1980 book ''New Roots for Agriculture''.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Wes. ''New Roots for Agriculture''. Foreword by Wendell Berry. University of Nebraska Press. {{ISBN |0803275625}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term became popular in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschenmann, Frederick. [http://www.sehn.org/Volume_9-2.html A Brief History of Sustainable Agriculture], editor's note by Carolyn Raffensperger and Nancy Myers. The Networker, vol. 9, no. 2, March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term", for example to satisfy human food and fiber needs, to enhance [[environmental quality]] and the [[natural resource]] base upon which the agricultural economy depends, to make the most efficient use of [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] and on-farm resources and integrate natural biological cycles and controls, to sustain the economic viability of farm operations, and to enhance the [[quality of life]] for farmers and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M.

#The incorporation of biological and ecological processes into agricultural and food production practices. For example, these processes could include [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]], [[soil regeneration]], and [[nitrogen fixation]].
#Using decreased amounts of non-renewable and unsustainable inputs, particularly the ones that are environmentally harmful.
#Using the expertise of farmers to both productively work the land as well as to promote the self-reliance and self-sufficiency of farmers.
#Solving agricultural and natural resource problems through the cooperation and collaboration of people with different skills. The problems tackled include [[Pest control|pest management]] and [[irrigation]].

==Farming and natural resources==
[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods had a low [[carbon footprint]].]]

Sustainable agriculture can be understood as an ecosystem approach to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miguel Altieri |Altieri, Miguel A.]] (1995) ''Agroecology: The science of sustainable agriculture''. Westview Press, Boulder, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; Practices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage |tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity |salinization]]). [[Long-term experiments]] have provided some of the best data on how various practices affect soil properties essential to sustainability. In the United States a federal agency, USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, specializes in providing technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation and production agriculture as compatible goals.

[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]

The most important factors for an individual site are sun, air, soil, [[nutrient]]s, and [[water resources |water]]. Of the five, water and [[soil conservation |soil quality]] and quantity are most amenable to human intervention through time and labor.

Although air and sunlight are available everywhere on Earth, crops also depend on soil nutrients and the availability of water. When farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some of these nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield |yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] (used in converting atmospheric nitrogen into synthetic fertilizer), or mineral ores (e.g., phosphate). Possible sources of nitrogen that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:

#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure |human manure]]
#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation |nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]
#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using electricity (perhaps from solar cells or windmills)) or
#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.

The last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928–4932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.

More realistic, and often overlooked, options include [[shifting cultivation |long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients. Crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner with appropriate fertilizer management practices.

=== Water ===

In some areas sufficient [[rainfall]] is available for crop growth, but many other areas require [[irrigation]]. For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid [[Soil salinity |salinization]]) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a [[non-renewable resource]]. Improvements in water [[well drilling]] technology and [[submersible pump]]s, combined with the development of [[drip irrigation]] and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.

Several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in "normal" years with average rainfall. These measures include both policy and management actions:&lt;ref name=sarep&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm |title=What is Sustainable Agriculture? — ASI |publisher=Sarep.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2013-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421034222/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/concept.htm |archivedate=2007-04-21 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

# improving [[water conservation]] and storage measures,
# providing incentives for selection of [[drought-tolerant]] crop species,
# using reduced-volume irrigation systems,
# managing crops to reduce water loss, and
# not planting crops at all.
 
Indicators for sustainable water resource development are:&lt;ref name=faoWater&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4745e/w4745e0d.htm |title=Indicators for sustainable water resources development |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Internal renewable water resources. This is the average annual flow of rivers and [[groundwater]] generated from endogenous precipitation, after ensuring that there is no double counting. It represents the maximum amount of water resource produced within the boundaries of a country. This value, which is expressed as an average on a yearly basis, is invariant in time (except in the case of proved [[climate change]]). The indicator can be expressed in three different units: in absolute terms (km³/yr), in mm/yr (it is a measure of the [[humidity]] of the country), and as a function of population (m³/person per year).&lt;ref name=faoWater/&gt;
* Global renewable water resources. This is the sum of internal renewable water resources and incoming flow originating outside the country. Unlike internal resources, this value can vary with time if upstream development reduces [[water resources |water availability]] at the border. Treaties ensuring a specific flow to be reserved from upstream to downstream countries may be taken into account in the computation of global water resources in both countries.&lt;ref name=faoWater/&gt;
* Dependency ratio. This is the proportion of the global renewable water resources originating outside the country, expressed in percentage. It is an expression of the level to which the water resources of a country depend on neighbouring countries.&lt;ref name=faoWater/&gt;
* Water withdrawal. In view of the limitations described above, only gross water withdrawal can be computed systematically on a country basis as a measure of water use. Absolute or per-person value of yearly water withdrawal gives a measure of the importance of water in the country's economy. When expressed in percentage of water resources, it shows the degree of pressure on water resources. A rough estimate shows that if water withdrawal exceeds a quarter of global renewable water resources of a country, water can be considered a limiting factor to development and, reciprocally, the pressure on water resources can affect all sectors, from agriculture to environment and fisheries.&lt;ref name=faoWater/&gt;

=== Soil ===
[[File:Walls against water runoff.JPG|thumb|Walls built to avoid water run-off]]

[[Erosion |Soil erosion]] is fast becoming one of the world's severe problems. It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Musokotwane Environment Resource Centre for Southern Africa |title=CEP Factsheet |url=http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213002938/http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil erosion is occurring worldwide. The phenomenon is being called ''peak soil'' as present large-scale factory farming techniques are jeopardizing humanity's ability to grow food in the present and in the future. Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of [[Arable land |arable soil]] will become increasingly problematic.

=== Phosphate ===

Phosphate is a primary component in chemical fertilizer. It is the second most important nutrient for plant after nitrogen,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Atekan |first=A. |last2=Nuraini |first2=Y. |last3=Handayanto |first3=E. |last4=Syekhfani |first4=S. |date=2014-07-07 |title=The potential of phosphate solubilizing bacteria isolated from sugarcane wastes for solubilizing phosphate |url=http://jdmlm.ub.ac.id/index.php/jdmlm/article/view/73 |journal=Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=175–182 |doi=10.15243/jdmlm.2014.014.175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often a limiting factor.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Khan |first=Mohammad Saghir |last2=Zaidi |first2=Almas |last3=Wani |first3=Parvaze A. |date=2007-03-01 |title=Role of phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms in sustainable agriculture — A review |journal=Agronomy for Sustainable Development |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=29–43 |doi=10.1051/agro:2006011 |issn=1774-0746}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for sustainable agriculture as it can improve soil fertility and crop yields.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cordell |first=Dana |last2=White |first2=Stuart |date=2013-01-31 |title=Sustainable Phosphorus Measures: Strategies and Technologies for Achieving Phosphorus Security |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/3/1/86 |journal=Agronomy |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=86–116 |doi=10.3390/agronomy3010086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus is involved in all major metabolic processes including photosynthesis, energy transfer, signal transduction, macromolecular biosynthesis, and respiration. It is needed for root ramification and strength and seed formation, and can increase disease resistance.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sharma |first=Seema B. |last2=Sayyed |first2=Riyaz Z. |last3=Trivedi |first3=Mrugesh H. |last4=Gobi |first4=Thivakaran A. |date=2013-10-31 |title=Phosphate solubilizing microbes: sustainable approach for managing phosphorus deficiency in agricultural soils |journal=SpringerPlus |volume=2 |pages=587 |doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-587|pmid=25674415 |pmc=4320215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphorus is found in the soil in both inorganic and organic forms&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and makes up approximately 0.05% of soil biomass.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, only 0.1% of that phosphorus present can be absorbed by plants.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is due to poor solubility&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and phosphorus' high reactivity with elements in the soil such as aluminum, calcium, and iron, causing the phosphorus to be fixed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Long-term use of phosphate-containing chemical fertilizers cause [[eutrophication]] and deplete soil fertility, so people have looked to other sources.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

An alternative is rock phosphate, a natural source already in some soils.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=KAUR |first=Gurdeep |last2=REDDY |first2=Mondem Sudhakara |title=Effects of Phosphate-Solubilizing Bacteria, Rock Phosphate and Chemical Fertilizers on Maize-Wheat Cropping Cycle and Economics |journal=Pedosphere |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=428–437 |doi=10.1016/s1002-0160(15)30010-2|year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, there are almost 260 million tons of rock phosphate.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, rock phosphate is a non-renewable resource and it is being depleted by mining for agricultural use:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; reserves are expected to be exhausted in 50–100 years; [[peak phosphorus]] will occur in about 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800800099X |title=The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought|date=2009 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.009 |volume=19 |issue=2|journal=Global Environmental Change |pages=292–305 |year=2009 | last1=Cordell |first1=Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected to increase food prices as phosphate fertilizer costs increase.

A way to make rock phosphate more effective and last longer is to implement microbial inoculants such as phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms, known as PSMs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A source of these PSMs is compost or the recycling of human and animal waste.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specific PSMs can be added to soil.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These solubilize phosphorus already in the soil and use processes like organic acid production and ion exchange reactions to make that phosphorus available for plants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When these PSMs are present, there has been an increase in crop growth, particularly in terms of shoot height, dry biomass, and grain yield.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Phosphorus uptake is even more efficient with the presence of mycorrhizae in the soil.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant relationships|date=1997|publisher=Springer|others=Carroll, George C., 1940-, Tudzynski, P. (Paul)|isbn=9783662103722|location=Berlin|oclc=679922657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycorrhiza is a type of mutualistic symbiotic association between plants and fungi,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; which are well-equipped to absorb nutrients, including phosphorus, in soil.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shenoy|first=V.V.|last2=Kalagudi|first2=G.M.|title=Enhancing plant phosphorus use efficiency for sustainable cropping|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0734975005000984|journal=Biotechnology Advances|volume=23|issue=7–8|pages=501–513|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2005.01.004|pmid=16140488|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fungi can increase nutrient uptake in soil where phosphorus has been fixed by aluminum, calcium, and iron.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Mycorrhizae can also release organic acids that solubilize otherwise unavailable phosphorus.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Land ===
{{see also |Peak farmland}}

As the global population increases and demand for food increases, there is pressure on [[land resource]]s. In land use planning and management, considering the impacts of land use changes on factors such as soil erosion can support long-term agricultural sustainability, as shown by a study of Wadi Ziqlab, a dry area in the Middle East where farmers graze livestock and grow olives, vegetables, and grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mohawesh |first=Yasser |last2=Taimeh |first2=Awni |last3=Ziadat |first3=Feras |date=September 2015 |title=Effects of land use changes and soil conservation intervention on soil properties as indicators for land degradation under a Mediterranean climate. |url=https://www.solid-earth.net/6/857/2015/se-6-857-2015.pdf |journal=Solid Earth |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=857–868 |via= |doi=10.5194/se-6-857-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking back over the 20th century shows that for people in poverty, following environmentally sound land practices has not always been a viable option due to many complex and challenging life circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grimble |first=Robin |date=April 2002 |title=Rural Poverty and Environmental Management : A framework for understanding |journal=Transformation: An International Journal of Holistic Mission Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=120–132 |doi=10.1177/026537880201900206|oclc=5724786521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, increased [[land degradation]] in developing countries may be connected with rural poverty among smallholder farmers when forced into unsustainable agricultural practices out of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barbier |first=Edward B. |last2=Hochard |first2=Jacob P. |date=May 11, 2016 |title=Does Land Degradation Increase Poverty in Developing Countries? |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0152973|pmid=27167738 |pmc=4864404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Land is a finite resource on Earth. And although expansion of agricultural land can decrease [[biodiversity]] and contribute to [[deforestation]], the picture is complex; for instance, a study examining the introduction of sheep by Norse settlers (Vikings) to the Faroe Islands of the North Atlantic concluded that, over time, the fine partitioning of land plots contributed more to soil erosion and degradation than grazing itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Amanda |last2=Simpson |first2=Ian |last3=Brown |first3=Jennifer |date=October 2005 |title=Sustainable rangeland grazing in Norse Faroe. |url=http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/132/1/simpson-hecol-2005.pdf |journal=Human Ecology |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=737–761 |via= |doi=10.1007/s10745-005-7596-x|hdl=1893/132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and [[urban development]], along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the [[Biodiversity loss |loss of biodiversity]] and increased soil erosion.&lt;ref name="fao2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4252e/y4252e14.htm |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many tools will be called upon to offset these projections. In Europe, one such tool is a geo-spatial data system called SoilConsWeb&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.landconsultingweb.eu/EN_index.html |title=SoilConsWeb |last= |first= |date= |website= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is being developed to inform soil conservation minded decision making within agricultural sectors and other areas of land management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Terribile |first=Fabio |date=2015 |title=A Web-based spatial decision supporting system for land management and soil conservation |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276375502 |journal=Solid Earth |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=903–928 |via= |doi=10.5194/se-6-903-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
Energy is used all the way down the food chain from farm to fork. In industrial agriculture, energy is used in on-farm mechanisation, food processing, storage, and transportation processes.&lt;ref name=fao2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X8054E/x8054e05.htm#P363_53908 |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2454e/i2454e00.pdf |title=FAO 2011 Energy Smart Food |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals. The [[International Energy Agency]] projects higher prices of non-renewable energy resources as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted. It may therefore decrease global [[food security]] unless action is taken to 'decouple' fossil fuel energy from food production, with a move towards 'energy-smart' agricultural systems including [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="fao" /&gt;
The use of solar powered irrigation in [[Pakistan]] has come to be recognized as a leading example of energy use in creating a closed system for water irrigation in agricultural activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Advances in Sustainable Agriculture: Solar-powered Irrigation Systems in Pakistan |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/advances-sustainable-agriculture-solar-powered-irrigation-systems-pakistan-232929 | publisher=McGill University | date= 2014-02-12 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

Socioeconomic aspects of sustainability are also partly understood. Regarding less concentrated farming, the best known analysis is Netting's study on smallholder systems through history.&lt;ref&gt;Netting, Robert McC. (1993) Smallholders, Householders: Farm Families and the Ecology of Intensive, Sustainable Agriculture. Stanford Univ. Press, Palo Alto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the finite supply of [[natural resources]] at any specific cost and location, agriculture that is inefficient or damaging to needed resources may eventually exhaust the available resources or the ability to afford and acquire them. It may also generate negative [[externality]], such as pollution as well as financial and production costs. There are several studies incorporating these negative externalities in an economic analysis concerning ecosystem services, biodiversity, land degradation and [[sustainable land management]]. These include [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] study led by Pavan Sukhdev and the [[Economics of Land Degradation Initiative]] which seeks to establish an economic cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture.

The way that crops are [[selling |sold]] must be accounted for in the sustainability equation. [[Food]] sold locally does not require additional energy for transportation (including consumers). Food sold at a remote location, whether at a [[farmers' market]] or the [[supermarket]], incurs a different set of energy cost for materials, [[labour (economics) |labour]], and [[transport]].

Pursuing sustainable agriculture results in many localized benefits. Having the opportunities to sell products directly to consumers, rather than at wholesale or commodity prices, allows farmers to bring in optimal profit.

[[Triple bottom line]] frameworks (including social and environmental aspects alongside the financial) show that a sustainable company can be technologically and economically feasible. For this to happen, growth in material consumption and population need to be slowed down and there has to be a drastic increase in the efficiency of material and energy use. To make that transition, long- and short-term goals will need to be balanced enhancing [[Equality of outcome|equity]] and quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19921801530|title=Beyond the limits: global collapse or a sustainable future.|last=|first=|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Methods==
[[File:Polyculture.JPG|thumb|[[Polyculture]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]

What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice. Two of the many possible practices of sustainable agriculture are [[crop rotation]] and [[soil amendments |soil amendment]], both designed to ensure that crops being cultivated can obtain the necessary [[nutrient]]s for healthy growth. Soil amendments would include using locally available compost from community recycling centers. These community recycling centers help produce the compost needed by the local organic farms.

Using community recycling from yard and kitchen waste utilizes a local area's commonly available resources. These resources in the past were thrown away into large waste disposal sites, are now used to produce low cost organic compost for organic farming. Other practices includes growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field, each of which would grow in separate season so as not to compete with each other for natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landinstitute.org/pages/Glover-et-al-2007-Sci-Am.pdf |title=Glover et al. 2007. ''Scientific American'' |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil. [[Nitrogen fixation]] from legumes, for example, used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth, helps to allow the land to be reused annually. Legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate, and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest.

[[Monoculture]], a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, is a very widespread practice, but there are questions about its sustainability, especially if the same crop is grown every year. Today it is realized to get around this problem local cities and farms can work together to produce the needed compost for the farmers around them. This combined with growing a mixture of crops ([[polyculture]]) sometimes reduces disease or pest problems&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6797/abs/406718a0.html Nature 406, 718–722 Genetic diversity and disease control in rice], Environ. Entomol. 12:625)&lt;/ref&gt; but polyculture has rarely, if ever, been compared to the more widespread practice of growing different crops in successive years ([[crop rotation]]) with the same overall [[crop diversity]]. Such methods may also support sustainable weed management in that the development of herbicide-resistant weeds is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mortensen |first=David |date=January 2012 |title=Navigating a Critical Juncture for Sustainable Weed Management |url=http://www.miscugli.it/public/componenti/957/files/Sustainable%20Weed%20Management%20(SC%202857).pdf |journal=BioScience |volume=62 |pages=75–84 |doi=10.1525/bio.2012.62.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cropping systems that include a variety of crops (polyculture and/or rotation) may also replenish nitrogen (if [[legumes]] are included) and may also use resources such as sunlight, water, or nutrients more efficiently (Field Crops Res. 34:239).

Replacing a natural ecosystem with a few specifically chosen plant varieties reduces the genetic diversity found in wildlife and makes the organisms susceptible to widespread [[disease]]. The [[Great Irish Famine |Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]] is a well-known example of the dangers of [[monoculture]].
In practice, there is no single approach to sustainable agriculture, as the precise goals and methods must be adapted to each individual case. There may be some techniques of farming that are inherently in conflict with the concept of sustainability, but there is widespread misunderstanding on effects of some practices. Today the growth of local farmers' markets offer small farms the ability to sell the products that they have grown back to the cities that they got the recycled compost from. This will help move people away from the [[slash-and-burn]] or [[slash-and-char]] techniques that are the characteristic feature of [[shifting cultivation]]. These are often cited as inherently destructive, yet slash-and-burn cultivation has been practiced in the Amazon for at least 6000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sponsel | first1 = Leslie E | year = 1986 | title = Amazon ecology and adaptation | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 67–97 | doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.15.1.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious deforestation did not begin until the 1970s, largely as the result of Brazilian government programs and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Susanna and Alexander Cockburn (1989) The Fate of the Forest: developers, destroyers and defenders of the Amazon. New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many ways to practice sustainable animal husbandry. Some of the key tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called [[Field (agriculture) |paddocks]], lowering stock density, and moving the stock between paddocks frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/sustpast.html |title=Pastures: Sustainable Management |publisher=Attra.ncat.org |date=2013-08-05 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable intensification===
{{Main article |Intensive farming#Sustainable intensive farming}}

In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of synthetic, non renewable inputs whilst maintaining or even boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in the globally important irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. et al |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349 |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil treatment===
[[File:daempfen.jpg|thumb|[[Soil steam sterilization#Sheet steaming|Sheet steaming]] with a MSD/moeschle steam boiler (left side)]]

[[Soil steam sterilization |Soil steaming]] can be used as an ecological alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization. Different methods are available to induce steam into the soil in order to kill pests and increase soil health.

Solarizing is based on the same principle, used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/garden/soil-solarization |title=Soil Solarization |work=Rodale's Organic Life |accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain crops act as natural biofumigants, releasing pest suppressing compounds. Mustard, radishes, and other plants in the brassica family are best known for this effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/publications/Bulletins/Biomass%20Prod%20of%20Cover%20Crops_Mustard%20Radish%20Fact%20Sht_AG-782_Online_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There exist varieties of mustard shown to be almost as effective as synthetic fumigants at a similar or lesser cost.

== Off-farm impacts ==
A farm that is able to "produce perpetually", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is over-application of synthetic [[fertilizer]] or animal [[manure]]s, which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction, as in the case of [[slash and burn]] farming for livestock feed. In Asia, specific land for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereals productions lands for some cash crops and even recycling of related food crops. In some cases even a small unit of aquaculture is also included in this number (AARI-1996). 

Sustainability affects overall production, which must increase to meet the increasing food and fiber requirements as the world's human population expands to a projected 9.3 billion people by [[2050]]. Increased production may come from creating new farmland, which may [[wikt:amelioration |ameliorate]] carbon dioxide emissions if done through reclamation of desert as in [[Israel]] and [[Palestine (region) |Palestine]], or may worsen emissions if done through [[slash and burn]] farming, as in [[Brazil]].

== Anthropogenic changes ==
{{further|Climate change and agriculture}}
As the Earth is entering the [[Anthropocene]], an epoch characterized by human impacts such as [[climate change]], agriculture and agricultural development are at risk. Agriculture has an enormous environmental footprint, and is simultaneously leading to huge amounts of environmental changes globally and being hugely impacted by these global changes.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rockström|first=Johan|last2=Williams|first2=John|last3=Daily|first3=Gretchen|last4=Noble|first4=Andrew|last5=Matthews|first5=Nathanial|last6=Gordon|first6=Line|last7=Wetterstrand|first7=Hanna|last8=DeClerck|first8=Fabrice|last9=Shah|first9=Mihir|date=2016-05-13|title=Sustainable intensification of agriculture for human prosperity and global sustainability|journal=Ambio|volume=46|issue=1|pages=4–17|doi=10.1007/s13280-016-0793-6|pmid=27405653|pmc=5226894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the human population is continuing to grow rapidly at a rate which will require an increase in food production globally. This is complicated by the fact that the Earth is undergoing rising amounts of environmental risks. Sustainable agriculture provides a potential solution to enable agricultural systems to feed a growing population while successfully operating within the changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

== Social ==

=== Development ===
In 2007, the [[United Nations]] reported on "[[Organic farming |Organic Agriculture]] and [[Food security |Food Security]]",&lt;ref name="Dundon2009"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2055/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3234100270&amp;docType=Topic+overview&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3234100270&amp;searchId=R2&amp;userGroupName=puya65247&amp;inPS=true |title=Sustainable Agriculture |last=Stanislaus |first=Dundon |date=2009 |website=Gale Virtual Reference Library |access-date=}}{{dead link |date=October 2017 |bot=medic}}{{cbignore |bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that using organic and sustainable agriculture could be used as a tool to reach global food security without expanding land usage and reducing [[environmental impacts]]. Another way to define sustainable agriculture is to give attention to the "human and environmental aspects,"&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; because of the turn to a more unsustainable way of farming in U.S. agriculture. During the [[Great Depression in the United States |Great Depression]] in the United States many farming families were living in subhuman and hungry conditions and treated "sustainability as a resource-input and food-output equation." Though conditions have improved, the farming has not as much done so. There has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early 2000s stating that when people in their communities are not factored into the agricultural process that serious harm is done.&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; Although global [[food security]] would most likely not drastically fall, these practices would impact, first hand, local, rural farming communities, making them unable to feed themselves and their families. The [[Social science |social scientist]] Charles Kellogg has stated that, "In a final effort, exploited people pass their suffering to the land."&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; This turn to more unsustainable farming has seen suffering for many people. For if something is sustainable, it should be that way in all aspects of it, not just the crop yield or soil health. It has been seen in the [[developing country]] of [[Bangladesh]], the starving of [[Rural area |rural]] farming communities due to their unsustainable farming methods. Sustainable agriculture mean the ability to permanently and continuously "feed its constituent populations."&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt;

There are a lot of opportunities that can increase farmers’ profits, better communities, and continue sustainable practices. For example, in [[Uganda]] [[Genetically modified organism|Genetically Modified Organisms]] (GMOs) were originally illegal, however, under stressful circumstances where Banana Bacterial Wilt (BBW) has the potential to wipe out 90% of yield they decided to explore GMOs as a possible solution &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170203003800?via%3Dihub|title=Banana streak virus is very diverse in Uganda|journal=Virus Research|volume=100|issue=1|pages=51–56|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2003.12.024|pmid=15036835|year=2004|last1=Harper|first1=Glyn|last2=Hart|first2=Darren|last3=Moult|first3=Sarah|last4=Hull|first4=Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, as a result of the banana crisis in Uganda caused by the BBW, the government issued the National Biotechnology and Biosafety bill which will allow scientists that are part of the National Banana Research Program to start experimenting with genetically modified organisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Genetically engineered bananas resistant to Xanthomonas wilt disease and nematodes|journal=Food and Energy Security|volume=6|issue=2|pages=37–47|doi=10.1002/fes3.101|pmid=28713567|pmc=5488630|year = 2017|last1 = Tripathi|first1 = Leena|last2=Atkinson|first2=Howard|last3=Roderick|first3=Hugh|last4=Kubiriba|first4=Jerome|last5=Tripathi|first5=Jaindra N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This effort has the potential to help local communities because a significant portion live off the food they grow themselves and it will keep their economy in check because their main sources of produce will remain stable. 

=== Women ===
[[File:Woman at US farmer's market.jpg |thumb |Woman at an American farmers market]]

In the past 30 years (1978-2007) in the [[United States]] the number of women farm operators has tripled.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2189/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=66dc7c9e-72cf-458f-9af3-3837ba2bedcd%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4109&amp;bdata=JnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=101450507&amp;db=a9h |title=Beyond 'Inherit It or Marry It': Exploring How Women Engaged in Sustainable Agriculture Access Farmland. |last=Pilgeram |first=Ryanne |date=2015 |website=Academic Search Complete |access-date=13 March 2017}}{{dead link |date=October 2017 |bot=medic}}{{cbignore |bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, women operate 14 percent of farms, compared to five percent in 1978. Much of the growth is due to women farming outside the "male dominated field of conventional agriculture".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In community supported agriculture women represent 40 percent of [[farm]] operators, and 21 percent of [[Organic farming |organic farmers]]. With the change of laws in [[land ownership]] over the past century, [[Woman |women]] are now allowed all the same freedom of land ownership that [[Man |men]] have.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==International policy==
Sustainable agriculture has become a topic of interest in the international policy arena, especially with regards to its potential to reduce the risks associated with a changing climate and growing human population.

The [https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/10701 Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change], as part of its recommendations for policy makers on achieving food security in the face of climate change, urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy. The Commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields, necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience. It also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade, including in national research and development budgets, land rehabilitation, economic incentives, and infrastructure improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccafs.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/assets/docs/climate_food_commission-spm-nov2011.pdf |title=Achieving food security in the face of climate change: Summary for policy makers from the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change |publisher=CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy ethics ===

Most agricultural professionals agree that there is a "moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability."&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal. Because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. The best way to create policy for [[agriculture]] is to be free of any bias. A good review would be done with "practical wisdom,"&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; a virtue identified by [[Aristotle]], distinguishing practical wisdom from scientific knowledge, this coming from [[Nicomachean Ethics |Nichomachean Ethics]]. The science of agriculture is called "[[agronomy]]", the root of this word relating to scientific law.&lt;ref name="Dundon2009" /&gt; Although agriculture may not fit well under scientific law, and may not be designed to be treated as an [[Aristotelianism |Aristotelian]] scientific knowledge, but more practical wisdom. Practical wisdom requires recognition of past failures in agriculture to better attain a more sustainable [[Agricultural systems |agricultural system]].

==Urban planning==

The use of available city space (e.g., [[rooftop gardens]], [[community gardens]], [[garden sharing]], and other forms of [[urban agriculture]]) for cooperative food production may be able to contribute to sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes : Designing Urban Agriculture for Sustainable Cities |last= |first= |date=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |editor1=Viljoen, Andre|editor2=Howe, Joe |isbn=9781136414329 |oclc=742299840}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A recent idea (2014) is to create large, urban, technical facilities for [[Vertical farming]]. Potential advantages include year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling, and reduced transportation costs.&lt;ref name=Marks2014&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing threats of [[climate change]] have influenced cities and public offiials are thinking more proactively about the ways they can deliver services and food more efficiently. The environmental cost of transportation could be avoided if people take back their connection to fresh food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://urbanland.uli.org/news/urban-agriculture-practices-to-improve-cities/|title=Urban Agriculture: Practices to Improve Cities|last=|first=|date=2011-01-18|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises questions; however, about the excess environmental costs associated with local farming vs more large scale operations which offer food security around the world.

== Key debates ==
There are several key debates involving sustainable agriculture:

=== Ecocentric vs technocentric ===
The main debate on how sustainable agriculture might be achieved centers around two different approaches: an ecocentric approach and a technocentric approach.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Guy M.|date=2009-09-01|title=Towards Sustainable Agriculture: Current Debates|journal=Geography Compass|language=en|volume=3|issue=5|pages=1757–1773|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8198.2009.00268.x|issn=1749-8198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecocentric approach emphasizes no- or low-growth levels of human development, and focuses on [[Organic farming|organic]] and [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic farming]] techniques with the goal of changing consumption patterns, and resource allocation and usage. The technocentric approach argues that [[sustainability]] can be attained through a variety of strategies, from the view that state-led modification of the industrial system like conservation-oriented farming systems should be implemented, to the argument that [[biotechnology]] is the best way to meet the increasing demand for food.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Multifunctional agriculture vs ecosystem services ===
There are different scientific communities that are looking at the topic of sustainable agriculture through two separate lenses: multifunctional agriculture (MFA) and [[ecosystem services]] (ES)&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jiao|last2=Tichit|first2=Muriel|last3=Poulot|first3=Monique|last4=Darly|first4=Ségolène|last5=Li|first5=Shuangcheng|last6=Petit|first6=Caroline|last7=Aubry|first7=Christine|date=2014-10-16|title=Comparative review of multifunctionality and ecosystem services in sustainable agriculture|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=149|pages=138–147|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.10.020|pmid=25463579}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While both of these frameworks are similar, they look at the function of agriculture in different lights. Those that employ the multifunctional agriculture philosophy focus on farm-centered approaches, and define function as being the outputs of agricultural activity.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The central argument of MFA is that agriculture has other functions aside from the production of food and fiber, and therefore agriculture is a multifunctional enterprise. These additional functions include renewable natural resource management and conservation of landscape and biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Renting|first=H.|last2=Rossing|first2=W.A.H.|last3=Groot|first3=J.C.J|last4=Van der Ploeg|first4=J.D.|last5=Laurent|first5=C.|last6=Perraud|first6=D.|last7=Stobbelaar|first7=D.J.|last8=Van Ittersum|first8=M.K.|date=2009-05-01|title=Exploring multifunctional agriculture.

==Barriers==

Since World War II, dominant models of agriculture in the United States and the entire national food system have been characterized by a focus on monetary [[Profit (economics) |profitability]] at the expense of social and environmental integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schattman |first1=Rachel |title=Sustainable Food Sourcing and Distribution in the Vermont-Regional Food System |url=https://www.uvm.edu/sustainableagriculture/Documents/Schattman_localfoodsourcing.pdf |accessdate=22 January 2017 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202005131/https://www.uvm.edu/sustainableagriculture/Documents/Schattman_localfoodsourcing.pdf |archive-date=2017-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sustainable agriculture, changes in lower rates of soil and [[nutrient]] loss, improved [[soil structure]], and higher levels of beneficial [[microorganism]]s are not quick.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2186/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=958e803d-f9e5-4035-82f5-f53d11a21c82%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=21972513&amp;db=a9h |title=Do You See What I See?

In [[conventional agriculture]] the benefits are easily visible with no weeds, pests, etc. and the "process of externalization" hides the costs to soil and [[ecosystem]]s around it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A major barrier to sustainable agriculture is the lack of knowledge of its benefits. Many benefits are not visible, so they are often unknown.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end. Some foresee a true sustainable [[steady state economy]] that may be very different from today's: greatly reduced energy usage, minimal [[ecological footprint]], fewer [[consumer packaged goods]], [[local purchasing]]  with [[short food supply chains]], little [[processed foods]], more home and [[community garden]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kunstler | first=James Howard | title=Too Much Magic; Wishful Thinking, Technology, and the Fate of the Nation

A '''timeline''' is a display of a list of events in [[chronological]] order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grafton | first= Anthony| authorlink= Anthony Grafton |last2 = Rosenberg | first2 = Daniel | title = Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | year = 2010 | pages = 272 | isbn = 978-1-56898-763-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically a [[graphic design]] showing a long bar labelled with [[calendar date|dates]] alongside itself and usually events. A [[Gantt chart]] is a form of timeline used in [[project management]].

Timelines can use any time scale, depending on the subject and data. Most timelines use a [[linear]] scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A [[timeline of evolution]] can be over millions of years, whereas a [[timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks]] can take place over minutes, and an explosion over milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacex.com/news/2016/09/01/anomaly-updates|title=Anomaly Updates|last=plarson|date=2016-09-01|work=SpaceX|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most timelines use a linear timescale, for very large or small timespans, [[logarithmic timeline]]s use a logarithmic scale to depict time.

== Types ==
There are different types of timelines
* Text timelines, labeled as text
* Number timelines, the labels are numbers, commonly [[line graph]]s
* Interactive, clickable, zoomable

There are many methods of visualizations for timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on [[graphic design]], and the ability of the artist to visualize the data.

Timelines, no longer constrained by previous space and functional limitations, are now digital and interactive, generally created with computer software. [[ChronoZoom]] is an example of computer-aided interactive timeline software.

==Uses of timelines==
{{Nature timeline}}
{{main|List of timelines}}
Timelines are often used in education to help students and researchers with understanding the order or chronology of historical events and trends for a subject.  When showing time on a specific scale on an axis, a timeline can be used to visualize time lapses between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the simultaneity or overlap of spans and events.

=== In historical studies ===
Timelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for [[biography|biographies]]. Examples include:

* [[Timeline of the American Civil Rights Movement]]
* [[Timeline of European exploration]]
* [[Timeline of imperialism]]
* [[Timeline of Solar System exploration]]
* [[Timeline of United States history]]
* [[Timeline of World War I]]
* [[Timeline of religion]]

=== In natural sciences===
Timelines are also used in the natural world and sciences, for subjects such as [[astronomy]], [[biology]], and [[geology]]:

*[[2009 flu pandemic timeline]]
*[[Chronology of the universe]]
*[[Geologic time scale]]
*[[Timeline of evolutionary history of life]]

=== In project management===
Another type of timeline is used for [[project management]]. In these cases, timelines are used to help team members to know what milestones need to be achieved and under what time schedule. For example, in the case of establishing a project timeline in the implementation phase of the [[Systems development life-cycle|life cycle of a computer system]].

'''Underglaze''' is a method of decorating [[pottery]] in which painted decoration is applied to the surface before it is covered with a transparent [[ceramic glaze]] and fired in a kiln. Because the glaze subsequently covers it, such decoration is completely durable, and it also allows the production of pottery with a surface that has a uniform sheen. Underglaze decoration uses [[pigments]] derived from [[oxides]] which fuse with the [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] when the piece is fired in a [[kiln]].  It is also a cheaper method, as only a single firing is needed, whereas [[overglaze decoration]] requires a second firing at a lower temperature. 

However, because the main or [[glost firing]] is at a higher temperature than used in overglaze decoration, the range of available colours is more limited, and was especially so for [[porcelain]] in historical times, as the firing temperature required for the porcelain body is especially high. Early porcelain was largely restricted to underglaze blue, and a range of browns and reds. Other colours turned black in a high-temperature firing.

Examples of oxides that do not lose their colour during a glost firing are the cobalt blue made famous by Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] [[blue and white porcelain]] and the cobalt and turquoise blues, pale purple, sage green, and [[Armenian bole|bole red]] characteristic of [[İznik pottery]].  The painting styles used are covered at (among other articles): [[china painting]], [[blue and white pottery]], [[tin-glazed pottery]], [[maiolica]], Egyptian [[faience]], [[Delftware]].  In modern times a wider range of underglaze colours are available.

An [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]] at the [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site|Tongguan kiln Site]] proved that the technology of underglazed color figure arose in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties periods]] and originated from [[Tongguan Subdistrict|Tonguan]], [[Changsha]].&lt;ref name="Hunandaily"&gt;[http://hnrb.voc.com.cn/hnrb_epaper/html/2014-05/07/content_820950.htm?div=-1 Hunan Daily (2014-05-07)]&lt;/ref&gt;
