      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10072">'''Aerospace physiology''' is the study of the effects of high altitudes on the body, such as different pressures and levels of oxygen. At different altitudes the body may react in different ways, provoking more [[cardiac output]], and producing more [[erythrocytes]]. These changes cause more energy waste in the body, causing muscle fatigue, but this varies depending on the level of the altitude.

==Effects of altitude==
The physics that affect the body in the sky or in space are different from the ground.  For example, [[barometric pressure]] is different at different heights. At sea level barometric pressure is 760 mmHg; at 3.048&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, barometric pressure is 523 mmHg, and at 15.240&amp;nbsp;m, the barometric pressure is 87 mmHg.  As the [[barometric pressure]] decreases, atmospheric [[partial pressure]] decreases also. This pressure is always below 20% of the total barometric pressure. At sea level, alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is 104 mmHg, reaching 6000 meters above the sea level. This pressure will decrease up to 40 mmHg in a non-acclimated person, but in an acclimated person, it will decrease as much as 52 mmHg. This is because alveolar ventilation will increase more in the acclimated person.&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011;527&lt;/ref&gt; Aviation physiology can also include the effect in humans and animals exposed for long periods of time inside pressurized cabins&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011; 527&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main issue with altitude is hypoxia, caused by both the lack of barometric pressure and the decrease in oxygen as the body rises.&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011; 528&lt;/ref&gt; With exposure at higher altitudes, alveolar carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO2) decreases from 40 mmHg (sea level) to lower levels. With a person acclimated to sea level, ventilation increases about five times and the carbon dioxide partial pressure decreases up to 6 mmHg. In an altitude of 3040 meters, arterial saturation of oxygen elevates to 90%, but over this altitude arterial saturation of oxygen decreases rapidly as much as 70% (6000&amp;nbsp;m), and decreases more at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011;528&lt;/ref&gt;

==g-forces==
[[g-force]]s are mostly experienced by the body during flight, especially high speed flight and space travel. This includes positive g-force, negative g-force and zero g-force, caused by simple acceleration, deceleration and centrifugal acceleration. When an airplane turns, [[centrifugal acceleration]] is determined by ƒ=mv2/r. This indicates that if speed increases, centrifugal acceleration force also increases in proportion to the square of the speed.&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011;531&lt;/ref&gt;

When an aviator is submitted to positive g-force in acceleration, the blood will move to the inferior part of the body, meaning that if the g-force is elevated, all the blood pressure in veins will increase. This means less blood reaches the heart, affecting its ability to function, with decreased circulation.&lt;ref&gt;BORON, Walter. Et al. "Medical Physiology" 3 ed. España. Elsevier Saunders: 2012; 220&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects for negative g-force can be more dangerous producing hyperemia and also psychotic episodes. In space, G forces are almost zero, which is called microgravity, meaning that the person is floating in the interior of the vessel. This happens because the gravity acts on the spaceship and in the body equally, both are pulled with the same forces of acceleration and also in the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;BORON, Walter. Et al. Medical Physiology 3 ed. España. Elsevier Saunders: 2012; 224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypoxia (medical)==

===General effects===
[[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] occurs when the bloodstream lacks oxygen. In an aerospace environment, this occurs because there is little or no oxygen. The work capacity of the body is reduced, decreasing the movement of all muscles (skeletal and cardiac muscles). The decrease in work capacity is related to the decrease of the oxygen of transportation velocity.&lt;ref&gt;BEST &amp;TAYLOR. Bases fisiológicas de la práctica médica. 11 ed. España. gElservier Saunders: 2006; 230&lt;/ref&gt; Some acute effects from hypoxia include: dizziness, laxity, mental fatigue, muscle fatigue and euphoria. These effects will affect a non-acclimated person starting in an altitude of 3650 meters above sea level. These effects will increase and can result in cramps or convulsions at an altitude of 5500 meters and will end in an altitude at 7000 meters with a coma.&lt;ref&gt;BEST &amp;TAYLOR. Bases fisiológicas de la práctica médica. 11 ed. España. gElservier Saunders: 2006; 230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mountaineering disease===
One type of hypoxia related syndrome is [[mountaineering disease]]. A non-acclimated person that stays for a significant amount of time at a high altitude can develop high erythrocytes and [[hematocrit]]. Pulmonary arterial pressure will increase even if the person is acclimated, presenting dilatation of the right side of the heart. Peripheral [[arterial pressure]] is decreased, leading to congestive cardiac insufficiency, and death if exposure is long enough.&lt;ref&gt;BEST &amp;TAYLOR. Bases fisiológicas de la práctica médica. 11 ed. España. gElservier Saunders: 2006; 228&lt;/ref&gt; These effects are produced by a decrease of erythrocytes, which causes a significant increase of viscosity in blood. This causes diminished blood flow in tissues, so oxygen distribution decreases. The [[vasoconstriction]] of the pulmonary arterioles is caused by hypoxia in the right portion of the heart. Arteriole spasms include the major part of the blood flow through the pulmonary vessels, producing a short circuit in the blood flow giving less oxygen in blood. The person will recover if there is an administration of oxygen or if s/he is taken to low altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;DOUGLAS, C. R. Tratado De Fisiologia Aplicada As Ciencias Da Saude. 5 Ed. Sp. Robe Ed Belman Ed. Imp. Exp. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountaineering disease and pulmonary edema are most common in those who climb rapidly to a high altitude.This illness starts from a few hours up to two or three days after ascension to a high altitude. There exist two cases: acute cerebral edema and acute pulmonary edema. The first one is caused by the vasodilatation of the cerebral blood vessels produced by the hypoxia; the second one is caused by the vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arterioles, caused by the hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;BEST &amp;TAYLOR. Bases fisiológicas de la práctica médica. 11 ed. España. gElservier Saunders: 2006; 228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation to low oxygen environments==
Hypoxia is the principal stimulus that increases the number of erythrocytes, increasing the hematocrit from 40 up to 60%, with an increase of the hemoglobin concentration in blood from 15 g/dl up to 20-21 g/dl. Also the blood volume increases 20% producing an increase of the corporal hemoglobin up 15% or more.&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011; 528&lt;/ref&gt; A person that stays for a period of time at higher altitudes acclimates, producing fewer effects over the human body.&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011; 528&lt;/ref&gt; There are several mechanisms that help with acclimation, which are an increase of pulmonary ventilation, higher erythrocytes levels, increase of the pulmonary diffusion capacity and increase of the vascularization of the peripheral tissues.&lt;ref&gt;BORON, Walter. Et al. Medical Physiology 3 ed. España. Elsevier Saunders: 2012;221&lt;/ref&gt;

Arterial chemical receptors are stimulated by exposure to a low partial pressure and hence increase alveolar ventilation, up to a maximum of 1.65 times. Almost immediately, compensation for the higher altitude begins with an increase of pulmonary ventilation eliminating a large amount CO2. Carbon dioxide partial pressure reduces and corporal fluids pH increase. These actions inhibit the respiratory center of the encephalic trunk, but later this inhibition disappears and the respiratory center responds to the stimulation of the peripheral chemical receptors because of the hypoxia increasing ventilation up to six times.&lt;ref&gt;BORON, Walter. Et al. Medical Physiology 3 ed. España. Elsevier Saunders: 2012; 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiac output increases up to 30% after a person rises to a high altitude, but it will decrease back to normal levels, depending on the increase of the hematocrit. The quantity of oxygen that goes to the peripheral tissues its relatively normal. Also a disease called “angiogenia” appears.&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011; 530&lt;/ref&gt;

The kidneys respond to low carbon dioxide partial pressure by decreasing the secretion of [[hydrogen ion]]s, and increasing the excretion of [[bicarbonate]]. This [[respiratory alkalosis]] reduces the concentration of HCO3 and return plasma pH to normal levels. The respiratory center responds to the stimulation of the peripheral chemical receptors produced by the hypoxia after the kidneys have recover the alkalosis.&lt;ref&gt;GUYTON, A.C., HALL, J.E “Tratado De Fisiologia Médica” 10. Ed. Rj . Elsevier Saunders: 2011; 532&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262640201_Brain_Emotional_Learning-Inspired_Models Brain Emotional Learning-inspired Models]''' or '''BELiMs''' can be considered as a primary step to take inspiration from emotional systems to form new computational Intelligence (CI)  models. BELIMs have been inspired by [[fear conditioning]] that is one of the emotional systems in [[mammalians]] and is a mechanism by which a [[biological system]] learns how to predict aversive events.&lt;ref&gt;M. Parsapoor, “Brain Emotional Learning-Inspired Models. Licentiate dissertation”, Halmstad University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis behind the development of BELiMs is that "the neural structure of fear conditioning can be considered as a natural system that consists of some components (e.g., the amygdala, thalamus, and the sensory cortex) and whose functionality is fulfilled through interaction among its components. Fear conditioning as a system shows an intelligent behavior by learning how to respond to fear-induced stimuli and thus can be utilized to design new CI models for prediction and decision-making applications" &lt;ref&gt;[2]M. Parsapoor, ‘Towards Emotion inspired Computational Intelligence (EiCI)’, PhD dissertation, Halmstad University Press, Halmstad, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29914">Formerly known as the '''World Life Issues on Environment and Development''' (WCED), the mission of the '''Brundtland Commission''' is to unite countries to pursue [[sustainable development]] together. The Chairperson of the Commission, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], was appointed by [[United Nations]] [[UNSG|Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] in December 1983. At the time, the [[UN General Assembly]] realized that there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. To rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development together, the UN decided to establish the '''Brundtland Commission'''. Gro Harlem Brundtland was the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] and was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and [[public health]]. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing ''[[Our Common Future]]'', also known as the ''[[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]]'', in October 1987. The document popularized (and defined) the term 
"[[Sustainable Development]]". ''[[Our Common Future]]'' won the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web|title=1991- The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103112536/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|archivedate=2013-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization Center for Our Common Future was started in April 1988 to take the place of the Commission.

==History==
Ten years after the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], a number of global environmental challenges had clearly not been adequately addressed.  In several ways, these challenges had grown. Particularly, the underlying problem of how to reduce poverty in low-income countries through more productive and industrialized economy without, in the process, exacerbating the global and local environmental burdens, remained unresolved. Neither high-income countries in the North nor low-income countries in the South were willing to give up an economic development based on growth, but environmental threats, ranging from pollution, acid rain, deforestation and desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, to early signs of climate change, were impossible to overlook and increasingly unacceptable. There was a tangible need for a developmental concept that would allow reconciling economic development with [[environmental protection]]. Views differed on several questions: were local environmental problems the result of local developments or of a global economic system that forced particularly low-income countries to destroy their environmental basis? Did environmental burdens result mainly from destructive economic growth-based development or from a lack of economic development and modernization? Would reconciling the economy and the environment require mainly technical means by using more resource-efficient technologies or mainly social and structural changes that would include political decision-making as well as changes in private consumption patterns?
The 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]], was the first report that included a very brief chapter on a concept called "sustainable development". It focused on global structural changes and was not widely read. The UN initiated an independent commission, which was asked to provide an analysis of existing problems and ideas for their solution, similar to earlier commissions such as the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (Brandt Commission) and the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues (Palme Commission).&lt;ref&gt;Iris Borowy, Defining Sustainable Development: the World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission), Milton Park: earthscan/Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], asked the Prime Minister of Norway, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], to create an organization independent of the UN to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the General Assembly resolution in the fall of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|title=History of Sustainability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230314/http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new organization was the Brundtland Commission, or more formally, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). The Brundtland Commission was first headed by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as Chairman and [[Mansour Khalid]] as Vice-Chairman.

The organization aimed to create a united international community with shared sustainability goals by identifying sustainability problems worldwide, raising awareness about them, and suggesting the implementation of solutions. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published the first volume of “[[Our Common Future]],” the organization’s main report. “[[Our Common Future]]” strongly influenced the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 and the third UN Conference on Environment and Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002. Also, it is credited with crafting the most prevalent definition of sustainability, as seen below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623004236/http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 June 2010|title=This Norwegian's past may connect with your future|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events before Brundtland===

During the 1980s it had been revealed that the [[World Bank]] had started to experience an expanded role in intervening with the economic and social policies of the [[Third World]]. This was most notable through the events at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1945. The ideas of [[neoliberalism]] and the institutions promoting [[economic globalization]] dominated the political agenda of the world's then leading trading nations: the United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the United Kingdom under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], both classical liberals.

These events led into an era of [[free market]]s built on a distortion of the international order forged in 1945 at Bretton Woods. Bretton Woods was transformed through the 1980s and 1990s, finally ending in 1995 with the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] ushered in by United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Bretton Woods was formed as an arrangement among the industrialized nation states, but was transformed into a global regime of ostensibly free markets that privileged [[multinational corporations]] and actually undermined the [[sovereignty]] of the very national communities that established Bretton Woods.

The Brundtland Report was intended as a response to the conflict between the nascent order promoting globalized economic growth and the accelerating ecological degradation occurring on a global scale. The challenge posed in the 1980s was to harmonize prosperity with ecology. This postulated finding the means to continue economic growth without undue harm to the environment. To address the urgent needs of developing countries (Third World), the United Nations saw a need to strike a better balance of human and environmental well-being. This was to be achieved by redefining the concepts of "economic development" as the new idea of "sustainable development" - as it was called in the Brundtland Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|title=ProfWork / PreludeToBrundtland|work=pbworks.com|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118221135/http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand this paradigm shift, we start with the meaning of the key term: development

===Resolution establishing the Commission===

The 1983 [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed Resolution 38/161 "Process of preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond", establishing the Commission.&lt;ref name="estabRes"/&gt; In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly:

:"8. Suggests that the Special Commission, when established, should focus mainly on the following terms of reference for its work:

::(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond;

::(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment and development;

::(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more effectively with environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;

::(d) To help to define shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate efforts needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in 1982;"&lt;ref name="estabRes"&gt;United Nations. 1983.

==Modern definition of sustainable development==
{{Main|Sustainable development}}
The Brundtland Commission draws upon several notions in its definition of [[sustainable development]], which is the most frequently cited definition of the concept to date.

A key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development. The Brundtland Commission argues against the assertions of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and provides an alternative perspective on sustainable development, unique from that of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The Brundtland Commission pushed for the idea that while the "environment" was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action, and while "development" was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress, it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other (We can better understand the environment in relation to development and we can better understand development in relation to the environment, because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities). Brundtland argues:

"...the "environment" is where we live; and "development" is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable."

The Brundtland Commission insists upon the environment being something beyond physicality, going beyond that traditional school of thought to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation.

The term sustainable development was coined in the paper ''Our Common Future'', released by the Brundtland Commission.
Sustainable development is the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The two key concepts of sustainable development are:
• the concept of "needs" in particular the essential needs of the world's poorest people, to which they should be given overriding priority; and
• the idea of limitations which is imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet both present and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|title=Environment Magazine - What Is Sustainable Development? Goals, Indicators, Values, and Practice|first=Environment Magazine - Taylor and|last=Francis|work=environmentmagazine.org|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118214557/http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agree that the central idea of the Brundtland Commission's definition of "sustainable development" is that of intergenerational equity. In sum, the "needs" are basic and essential, economic growth will facilitate their fulfillment, and equity is encouraged by citizen participation. Therefore, another characteristic that really sets this definition apart from others is the element of humanity that the Brundtland Commission integrates.

The particular ambiguity and openness-to-interpretation of this definition has allowed for widespread support from diverse efforts, groups and organizations. However, this has also been a criticism; perceived by some notable commentators as "self-defeating and compromised rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Manns, .J., "Beyond Brudtland's Compromise", Town &amp; Country Planning, August 2010, pp.337-340 {{cite web |url=http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416182659/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It nonetheless lays out a core set of guiding principles that can be enriched by an evolving global discourse. As a result of the work of the Brundtland Commission, the issue of sustainable development is on the agenda of numerous international and national institutions, as well as corporations and city efforts. The definition gave light to new perspectives on the sustainability of an ever-changing planet with an ever-changing population.

-Brundtland commission
(Our Common Future)
The Report of the Brundtland Commission, Our Common Future, was published by Oxford University Press in 1987, and was welcomed by the General Assembly Resolution 42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. One version with links to cited documents Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987. Published as Annex to General Assembly document A/42/427, Development and International Co-operation is available.

The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world.

The Brundtland Commission's mandate was to: “[1] re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; [2] strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and [3] raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). “The Commission focused its attention on the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” (1987: 27).

The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. As such, the Report offered “the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987:16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded; this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development.

The report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving it. The definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited:

:"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". It contains two key concepts:
:*the concept of "needs", in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
:*the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs."

==Structure==
The Brundtland Commission was chaired by former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Politicians, civil servants, and environmental experts make up the majority of the members. Members of the commission represent 21 different nations (both developed and developing countries are included). Many of the members are important political figures in their home country. One example is [[William Ruckelshaus]], former head of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. All members of the commission were appointed by both Gro Harlem Brundtland and [[Mansour Khalid]], the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

The commission focuses on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship. Most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities. One such network is Bill Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development. In this council government and business leaders come together to share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The 1992 and 2002 [[Earth Summit]]s were the direct result of the Brundtland Commission. The international structure and scope of the Brundtland Commission allow multiple problems (such as [[deforestation]] and [[ozone depletion]]) to be looked at from a holistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=17 April 2012|website=archive.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131934/http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability efforts==
The three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. While many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainability, it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiatives for the three pillars in countries' policies worldwide. With the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering, especially with the overall well being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. The Brundtland Commission has put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. Implementing sustainable development globally is still a challenge, but because of the Brundtland Commission's efforts, progress has been made. After releasing their report, ''Our Common Future'', the Brundtland Commission called for an international meeting to take place where more concrete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. This meeting was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. A comprehensive plan of action, known as [[Agenda&amp;nbsp;21]], came out of the meeting. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 entailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on Earth more sustainable going into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405221844/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=5 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Growth===
Economic Growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. In trying to build their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainability. While the Commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future. So much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focus cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 reinforces the importance of finding ways to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. Through various trade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408182141/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Protection===
Environmental Protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20&amp;nbsp;years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. For the second year in a row in 2010, the United States and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. In 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118220031/http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. Eco-city development occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart grids with renewable energy sources, LED street lights and energy efficient building. The consumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that "roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world's population". This level is striking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321094820/http://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Equality===
The Social Equality and Equity as pillars of sustainable development focus on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households.This is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where majority live from land. Global inequality has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s wealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Brundtland Commission made a significant impact trying to link environment and development and thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. The Commission has thus reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be, as many can approach the environment and use it.These achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

'''Burra Katha''', also spelled Burrakatha, is an [[oral storytelling]] technique in the [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha]] tradition, performed in villages of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a [[Hindu]] mythological story ([[Jangam|Jangam Katha]]) or a contemporary social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Burrakatha loses sheen sans patronage| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-14/visakhapatnam/36332535_1_artistes-burrakatha-art-form |date=Jan 14, 2013| accessdate = 2013-09-02
| publisher = [[The Times of India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Burra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4U5AAAAIAAJ|title=Vidya Bharathi|last=Lectures|first=Bangalore University Dept of Publications and Extension|date=1977-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.

==Etymology==
"Burra" is referred to [[Tanpura|tambura]], a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. "Katha" means story.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burrakatha.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Burrakatha photo from Vepachedu research foundation]] --&gt;
Burra means a skull in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The shell resembles a [[human skull]]. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to [[veena]] and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.

==Alternative names==
Burrakatha refers to the art throughout [[Andhra Pradesh]], and there are local names in each region.
* Coastal region: Tamboora or Jangam or Tandanana Katha
* Rayalaseema: Tamboora or Tandana katha or suddulu
* Telangana: Tamboora or Sarada katha

==History==
Burrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as [[Jangam]] Katha. The [[jangam|jangams lingayats]] were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of [[Shiva|Lord Siva]]. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.

Popular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.

==Modern form==
The main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently.  The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.

The right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to "Wow!" "Aha!" and "That is it."

Whenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with "vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara" followed by the co-performers singing "tandhana tane tandhana na." It is also called 'tandana katha.'

==Significance==
Burra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during [[Navratri|Dussehra]] or [[Sankranti]] festival seasons to describe events in epics like [[Ramayan]] and [[Mahabharat]] and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.

It played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Burrakatha was banned in [[Madras]] by the British government and in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.

==Present==
Burrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.
That's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.
In past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.

So these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.

[[Daroji Eramma]] was a performer of Burra katha from [[Karnataka]].

==History==
The Chartered Institution of Building Services (CIBS) was formed by the 1976 merger of the '''Institution of Heating and [[Ventilation (architecture)|Ventilating]] Engineers''' (founded in 1897) and the '''Illuminating Engineering Society''' (founded in 1909), receiving a [[Royal Charter]] in the same year. The word 'Engineers' was added in 1985, and hence the Institution became CIBSE.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web

| title      = What is CIBSE?
| publisher  = CIBSE
| accessdate = 2009-08-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Institution's objective, as defined in the Royal Charter, is to "support the Science, Art and Practice of [[building services engineering]], by providing our members and the public with first class information and education services and promoting the spirit of fellowship which guides our work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.cibse.org/about-cibse
| title      = About CIBSE
| publisher  = CIBSE
| accessdate = 2009-08-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Institution is primarily focused on:
*Promoting competence through education, training and registration.
*Delivering up-to-date knowledge of the art, science and engineering of the built environment through its membership networks, publications and research.
With a dual focus on both the engineering and the construction sectors of the economy, CIBSE provides a coordinating role
for the application of multi-discipline science and engineering principles in the built environment and promotes the delivery
of integrated projects by working with others in construction.&lt;ref name="CIBSE Strategic Plan 2011-16"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIBSE Strategic Plan 2011–16|url=http://www.cibse.org/about-cibse/cibse-strategic-plan-2011-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
As of May 2018, CIBSE claimed a membership of over 20,800, from 94 countries. The Institution is organised on a regional basis; with 16 regions in the United Kingdom and four regions overseas:

*Australia and New Zealand
*Hong Kong
*Republic of Ireland
*United Arab Emirates

There are also CIBSE International Chapters in:

*Canada
*China (Shanghai and Chongqing)
*Qatar
*Singapore
*Sri Lanka

CIBSE has eight grades of membership, with the upper four granting designatory [[postnominal]]s. These are:
*Fellow (FCIBSE)
*Member (MCIBSE)
*Associate (ACIBSE)
*Licentiate (LCIBSE)

Below this there are four grades of membership with no designatory [[postnominal]]s:
*Graduate 
*Student - full and part-time
*Affiliate

==Societies==
Four societies and one institute exist within CIBSE to reflect special areas of expertise that exist within the field of building services:

*'''Society of Facade Engineering (SFE)''' was set up in 2003 as a Society of CIBSE but with the support of the [[IStructE]] and [[RIBA]]. Its aim is to advance knowledge of and practice in [[facade engineering]].
*'''Society of Light and Lighting (SLL)''' acts as the professional body for [[lighting]] in the UK. It represents the interests of those involved in the art, science and engineering of light and lighting in their widest definition and has over 2,000 members in the UK and worldwide.
*'''Society of Public Health Engineers (SoPHE)''' is to provide a higher profile and focus for public health engineers within CIBSE.
*'''Institute of Local Exhaust Ventilation Engineers (ILEVE)''' was established in 2011 to promote air quality in the workplace and to reduce ill health and death due to airborne contamination and hazardous substances in the working environment.
*'''Society of Digital Engineering  (SDE)''' was formed to provide a home for those involved in digitising the built environment, either as designers, contractors, manufacturers, clients, facility managers or software vendors

==Special interest groups==

==Certification==
In recent years there has been an increasing focus on sustainability and green design by the UK government. The implementation of
[[Building regulations in the United Kingdom#Part L. Conservation of fuel and power|Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power)]] of the U.K. Building Regulations in 2006 led CIBSE to set up the Low Carbon Consultants Register to ensure that a body of competent and trained professionals was available to implement the various requirements of the regulations, specifically in undertaking the relevant calculations to demonstrate the required reduction in carbon emissions from buildings both in design and operation. Members of the Register must undertake specific training and examinations to demonstrate their competence in various aspects of the regulations.

The CIBSE scheme further offers accreditation as a Low Carbon Energy Assessor (LCEA), again subject to specific training and examinations, who are then able to provide the [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s (EPCs) and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s (DECs), as required under the [[Directive on the energy performance of buildings|Energy Performance in Buildings Regulations]] (EPB Regulations).  These certificates can only be provided by accredited energy assessors who are members of an approved scheme such as the Low Carbon Energy Assessors Register. Furthermore, assessors are required to update their training regularly to ensure that continued high standards of competency are met.

The LCC scheme has been expanded in recent years to include for the grade of Low Carbon Consultant: Energy Management Systems, these LCC's having been trained and tested by CIBSE to ensure they have the relevant competencies to assist organisations to implement BS EN 16001.

CIBSE also offers certification for Air Conditioning Inspectors, to perform inspections as required by the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007.

On 17 May 2012, CIBSE Certification was approved as a Certification Body for [[Green Deal]] Organisations and their Advisors.&lt;ref name="CIBSE Certification is approved for Green Deal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Building Services|url=http://www.modbs.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/10601/CIBSE_Certification_is_approved_for_Green_Deal.html|accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will enable CIBSE Certification to offer training and certification to professionals wanting to offer advice under the Green Deal.

==Training==
Many training options are available through CIBSE, with the aim of providing specialised courses, conferences and seminars for those within the building services industry. Mid Career College (MCC) is a branch of CIBSE which focuses on providing [[Continuing Professional Development]] (CPD) training, to improve and enhance the skills required to be engineering professional.  Included are a range of courses from fire safety and mechanical and electrical services courses, to facilities management and business skills-focused training. Online modules can also be completed which can be used to contribute towards the Edexcel Advanced Professional Diploma in Building Services Engineering.

==Publications==
CIBSE publishes several guides to building services design, which include for various recommended design criteria and standards, some of which are cited within the UK building regulations and therefore form a legislative requirement for major building services works. The main guides are:
* Guide A: Environmental Design
* Guide B: Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration
* Guide C: Reference Data
* Guide D: Transportation systems in Buildings
* Guide E: Fire Safety Engineering
* Guide F: Energy Efficiency in Buildings
* Guide G: Public Health Engineering
* Guide H: Building Control Systems
* Guide J: Weather, Solar and Illuminance Data
* Guide K: Electricity in Buildings
* Guide L: Sustainability
* Guide M: Maintenance Engineering and Management
In November 2011 CIBSE made its full range of published guidance (including all the CIBSE Guides, CIBSE Commissioning Codes, Applications Manuals, Technical Memoranda, Lighting Guides) available for free to its members through the Knowledge Portal.&lt;ref name="Knowledge is Power"&gt;{{cite web|title=Knowledge is Power|url=http://content.yudu.com/A1vt76/CIBSEMar12/resources/20.htm|work=CIBSE Journal|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIBSE publishes a monthly magazine, the ''CIBSE Journal'' (formerly the ''Building Services Journal''). Two quarterly technical journals are published in association with [[SAGE Publications|Sage]]: ''Building Services Engineering Research &amp; Technology'' (BSERT) is free online to all CIBSE members and'' Lighting Research &amp; Technology Journal'' (LR&amp;T) which is free for Society of Light and Lighting members only.&lt;ref name="CIBSE Technical Journals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Resources|url=http://www.cibse.org/knowledge/technical-journals/technical-journals-bsert-lr-t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6975">[[Cultural identity]] refers to a person's sense of belonging to a particular [[culture]] or group.  This process involves learning about and accepting [[traditions]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[language]], [[religion]], [[ancestry]], [[aesthetics]], thinking patterns, and [[social structure]]s of a culture.  Normally, people internalize the beliefs, values, norms, and social practices of their culture and identify themselves with that culture.  The culture becomes a part of their [[self-concept]] (Lustig, 2013).  However, some studies have noted that existing cultural identity theory may not account for the fact that different individuals and groups may not react to or interpret events, happenings, attitudes, etc. in the same ways as other individuals or groups.

Myron Lustig notes that cultural identities are central to a person’s sense of self.  That is because cultural identities “are central, dynamic, and multifaceted components of one’s self concept” (Lustig, 133).  Lustig also points out that cultural identities are dynamic, and they exist within a changing social context.  As a result, a person’s identity changes as do one’s ongoing experiences in life (Lustig, 135).  Other researchers describe cultural identity as referring to the content of values as guiding principles, to meaningful symbols, and to life styles that individuals share with others, though not necessarily within recognizable groups (Boski et al., 2004).  In addition, Boski et al. point out that most books and studies have ignored cultural identity as a theoretical construct in the field of [[cross-cultural psychology]].  Instead, books and journals report works on the theme of social identity.  [[Social identity]] is described as a sense of “We-ness,” or attachment to a group that one is a member of, and by comparison to others.  The sense of “We-ness” remains culturally empty, however.  Even with natural groups, it is portrayed in trait-attributes, “which is not different from those used to characterize individuals” (Boski et al., 2004).  There is, however, research evidence about the social (ethnic) vs. cultural distinction (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2000).  This study found that the task-oriented cultural style was generally more favored than the task-plus interpersonal alternative, particularly among Anglo-American participants, for whom ethnicity did not matter.  Mexican and Latino participants, however, showed some degree of favoritism toward ethnically similar participants (Sanchez-Burks et all, 2000).

It seems that there are different viewpoints regarding cultural and social identities.  Cultural identity is defined as the identity of a group or culture or of an individual as far as one is influenced by one’s belonging to a group or culture.  Further, Cultural identity is similar to, and overlaps with, [[identity politics]].  New forms of identification have been suggested to break down the understanding of the individual as a whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers.  Such identifiers can result from various conditions including: location, gender, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and even food.  In places like the U.S. and Canada, where the people are ethnically diverse, social unity is primarily based on common social values and beliefs.  However, some critics of cultural identity declare that cultural identity based upon difference is a divisive force in society.  In addition, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media.  Therefore, instead of learning behavior and knowledge from cultural or religious groups, people may be learning social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.  Language may also be an important factor in culture identity.  The communication that comes with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.

	When young people are severed from the ideals and positively sanctioned statuses, feelings of alienation or social isolation may develop.  These feelings can result in undesired treatment and status.  This process results in personal marginalization, and it may lead to social marginalization which includes that person’s relative economic, employment, educational, and cultural loss compared to those around him.  This provides a second source of alienation from mainstream society.  This can cause an individual to experience extreme discomfort called ego identity discomfort.  Because external sources have too much control, the individual cannot construct a personal definition of him/her self.  The person is then motivated to identify with an alternative social group such as a drug subcultural group.  Such groups provide opportunities to resolve identity problems.   Identification with such a group reduces the person’s ego identity discomfort, or it helps to solve identity problems.  Scholars today are focusing on the basic elements of social organization (race, ethnicity, gender, and social class) in their theory and research.  In the case of drug subcultures, it is reported that Anderson (1998) discovered that the composition of the drug subcultural groups differed between blacks and whites.  Blacks described neighborhood and school based groups as securing an improved social status and reputation.  On the other hand, Anderson (1998) found that the drug subcultural groups reported by whites differed.  These groups were located at nightclubs, bars, colleges, high schools and around the neighborhood.  Some of these groups were “other” activity oriented, such as college groups or the entertainment industry, and these groups had a “very strong” interest in drugs.  Whites reported using many different drugs, from alcohol and cocaine to marijuana and heroin.  These differences are significant, and such differences could alter the cultural identity theory. This is because different groups, such as blacks and whites, perceive events and problems in different ways.

'''DNA profiling''' (also called '''DNA fingerprinting''') is the process of determining an individual's [[DNA]] characteristics, which are as unique as [[fingerprint]]s. DNA analysis intended to identify a species, rather than an individual, is called [[DNA barcoding]].

DNA profiling is a [[Forensic science|forensic]] technique in [[criminal investigation]]s, comparing criminal suspects' profiles to DNA evidence so as to assess the likelihood of their involvement in the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Erin|date=2017-10-13|title=Forensic DNA Typing|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092127|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092127|issn=2572-4568}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[parentage testing]],&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, K., J..

==Background==
The process of DNA profiling was developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/dna-fingerprinting-alec-jeffreys|title=Eureka moment that led to the discovery of DNA fingerprinting|last=|first=|date=24 May 2009|work=The Observer|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz D | authorlink = Diethard Tautz | year = 1989 | title = Hypervariability of simple sequences as a general source for polymorphic DNA markers | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 6463–6471 | doi=10.1093/nar/17.16.6463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patent Jäckle H &amp; Tautz D (1989) "Process For Analyzing Length Polymorphisms in DNA Regions" europäische Patent Nr. 0 438 512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/dna-fingerprinting-alec-jeffreys Eureka moment that led to the discovery of DNA fingerprinting | Science | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://investigativegenetics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-2223-4-21 The man behind the DNA fingerprints: an interview with Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys | Investigative Genetics | Full Text&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while working in the Department of Genetics at the [[University of Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/genetics/jeffreys Alec Jeffreys and Genetic Fingerprinting — University of Leicester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process, developed by Jeffreys in conjunction with Peter Gill and Dave Werrett of the [[Forensic Science Service]] (FSS), was first used forensically in the solving of the murder of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. In the subsequent murder inquiry, led by Detective [[David Baker (detective)|David Baker]], the DNA contained within blood samples obtained voluntarily from around 5,000 local men who willingly assisted [[Leicestershire Police|Leicestershire Constabulary]] with the investigation, resulted in the exoneration of Richard Buckland, an initial suspect who had actually confessed to one of the crimes, and the subsequent conviction of [[Colin Pitchfork]] on January 2, 1988. Pitchfork, a worker at a local bakery, had persuaded a friend to stand-in for him when providing a blood sample using Pitchfork's identity. The deception was discovered when the friend was overheard boasting of the deception in a local pub. Pitchfork was then questioned by police and his DNA sampled, which confirmed his presence at both murder scenes. Aware of the implications of the incontrovertibility of the DNA technique which had been widely reported in the media, he quickly confessed to committing both murders.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are [[monozygotic twins|monozygotic ("identical") twins]].&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BA/Use_of_DNA_Identification.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426014318/http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BA/Use_of_DNA_Identification.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-26 |title=Use of DNA in Identification |publisher=Accessexcellence.org |accessdate=2010-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling uses repetitive ("repeat") sequences that are highly variable,&lt;ref name="Lander"/&gt; called [[variable number tandem repeat]]s (VNTRs), in particular short tandem repeats (STRs), also known as [[microsatellite]]s, and [[minisatellite]]s. VNTR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] are similar between closely related individuals, but are so variable that unrelated individuals are unlikely to have the same VNTRs.

==DNA profiling process==
[[Image:D1S80Demo.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Variations of [[VNTR]] allele lengths in 6 individuals.&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|[[Alec Jeffreys]], the pioneer of DNA profiling.]]
The process begins with a sample of an individual's DNA (typically called a "reference sample"). Reference samples are usually collected through a [[buccal swab]]. When this is unavailable (for example, when a court order is needed but unobtainable) other methods may be needed to collect a sample of [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[semen]], [[vaginal lubrication]], or other fluid or tissue from personal use items (for example, a toothbrush, razor) or from stored samples (for example, banked [[spermatozoon|sperm]] or [[biopsy]] tissue). Samples obtained from blood relatives can indicate an individual's profile, as could previous profiled human remains.  A reference sample is then analyzed to create the individual's DNA profile using one of the techniques discussed below.  The DNA profile is then compared against another sample to determine whether there is a genetic match.

=== [[DNA extraction|DNA Extraction]] ===
When a sample such as blood or saliva is obtained, the DNA is only a small part of what is present in the sample. Before the DNA can be analyzed, it must be [[DNA extraction|extracted]] from the cells and purified. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but all methods follow the same basic procedure. The cell and nuclear membranes need to be broken up to allow the DNA to be free in solution. Once the DNA is free, it can be separated from all other cellular components. After the DNA has been separated in solution, the remaining cellular debris can then be removed from the solution and discarded, leaving only DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/dna-extraction|title=ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common methods of DNA extraction include [[Phenol-chloroform extraction|organic extraction]] (also called phenol chloroform extraction), [[Chelex 100|Chelex extraction]], and [[solid phase extraction]]. [[Differential extraction]] is a modified version of extraction in which DNA from two different types of cells can be separated from each other before being purified from the solution. Each method of extraction works well in the laboratory, but an analyst typically selects their preferred method based on factors such as the cost, the time involved, the quantity of DNA yielded, and the quality of DNA yielded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123448124|title=Forensic DNA typing : biology, technology, and genetics of STR markers|last=1969-|first=Butler, John M.

===RFLP analysis===
{{Main|Restriction fragment length polymorphism}}
The first methods for finding out genetics used for DNA profiling involved '''RFLP analysis'''. DNA is collected from cells and cut into small pieces using a [[restriction enzyme]] (a restriction digest). This generates DNA fragments of differing sizes as a consequence of variations between DNA sequences of different individuals. The fragments are then separated on the basis of size using [[gel electrophoresis]].

The separated fragments are then transferred to a [[nitrocellulose]] or nylon filter; this procedure is called a [[Southern blot]]. The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]]. [[Radiolabeled]] probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the [[genome]] that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called [[variable number tandem repeat]] sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules hybridize to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluoresent bands on the film.

The Southern blot technique requires large amounts of non-degraded sample DNA. Also, Karl Brown's original technique looked at many [[minisatellite]] loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but making it hard to discern individual [[allele]]s (and thereby precluding [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]]). These early techniques have been supplanted by [[PCR]]-based [[assay]]s.

===Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis===
{{Main|Polymerase chain reaction}}
Developed by [[Kary Mullis]] in 1983, a process was reported by which specific portions of the sample DNA can be amplified almost indefinitely (Saiki et al. 1985, 1985) The process,  [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), mimics the biological process of [[DNA replication]], but confines it to specific DNA sequences of interest. With the invention of the PCR technique, DNA profiling took huge strides forward in both discriminating power and the ability to recover information from very small (or degraded) starting samples.

PCR greatly amplifies the amounts of a specific region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual [[polynucleotide]] strands through heating. Two [[oligonucleotide]] DNA [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of each primer (that is, the 3’ end) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the thermostable [[Taq polymerase]]. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.

Early assays such as the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]-[[HLA-DQA1|DQ alpha]] [[Allele specific oligonucleotide|reverse]] [[dot blot]] strips grew to be very popular due to their ease of use, and the speed with which a result could be obtained. However, they were not as discriminating as RFLP analysis. It was also difficult to determine a DNA profile for mixed samples, such as a vaginal swab from a [[sexual assault]] victim.

However, the PCR method was readily adaptable for analyzing [[VNTR]], in particular [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] loci. In recent years, research in human DNA quantitation has focused on new "real-time" quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques. Quantitative PCR methods enable automated, precise, and high-throughput measurements. Inter-laboratory studies have demonstrated the importance of human DNA quantitation on achieving reliable interpretation of STR typing and obtaining consistent results across laboratories.

===STR analysis===
{{Main|Short tandem repeats}}
The system of DNA profiling used today is based on [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and uses simple sequences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz D. | authorlink = Diethard Tautz | year = 1989 | title = Hyper-variability of simple sequences as a general source for polymorphic DNA markers | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 6463–6471 | doi=10.1093/nar/17.16.6463}}&lt;/ref&gt; or short tandem repeats (STR). This method uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the most common is 4 bases repeated, but there are other lengths in use, including 3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units, STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals. These STR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] (locations on a chromosome) are targeted with sequence-specific primers and amplified using PCR. The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using [[electrophoresis]]. There are two common methods of separation and detection, [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) and gel electrophoresis.

Each STR is polymorphic, but the number of alleles is very small. Typically each STR allele will be shared by around 5 - 20% of individuals. The power of STR analysis comes from looking at multiple STR loci simultaneously. The pattern of alleles can identify an individual quite accurately. Thus STR analysis provides an excellent identification tool. The more STR regions that are tested in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes.

From country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use. In North America, systems that amplify the [[CODIS]] 20&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis|title=Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; core loci are almost universal, whereas in the United Kingdom the [[DNA-17]] 17 loci system (which is compatible with The [[National DNA Database]]) is in use, and Australia uses 18 core markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Conversastion|access-date=October 14, 2017|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever system is used, many of the STR regions used are the same. These DNA-profiling systems are based on multiplex reactions, whereby many STR regions will be tested at the same time.

The true power of [[STR analysis]] is in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are [[independent assortment|independently assorted]] (having a certain number of repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the [[Bayes' theorem#Bayes' theorem derived via conditional probabilities|product rule for probabilities]] can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, we can say that the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Felch|first = Jason|title = FBI resists scrutiny of 'matches'|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|pages = P8|date = July 20, 2008|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/20/local/me-dna20|accessdate =March 18, 2010 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, since there are about 12 million [[monozygotic twins]] on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.

In practice, the risk of contaminated-matching is much greater than matching a distant relative, such as contamination of a sample from nearby objects, or from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. The risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: Everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested in order to ensure that they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full DNA profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person was not actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.

===AmpFLP===
{{Main|Amplified fragment length polymorphism}}

Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified fragment length polymorphism was also put into practice during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used [[PCR]] to amplify DNA samples. It relied on [[variable number tandem repeat]] (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a [[polyacrylamide gel]] using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by [[silver staining]] the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together at the top of the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of [[phylogenetic]] trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.

===DNA family relationship analysis===

Using [[PCR]] technology, DNA analysis is widely applied to determine genetic family relationships such as paternity, maternity, siblingship and other kinships.

During conception, the father’s sperm cell and the mother’s egg cell, each containing half the amount of DNA found in other body cells, meet and fuse to form a fertilized egg, called a [[zygote]]. The zygote contains a complete set of DNA molecules, a unique combination of DNA from both parents. This zygote divides and multiplies into an embryo and later, a full human being.

At each stage of development, all the cells forming the body contain the same DNA—half from the father and half from the mother. This fact allows the relationship testing to use all types of all samples including loose cells from the cheeks collected using buccal swabs, blood or other types of samples.

There are predictable inheritance patterns at certain locations (called loci) in the human genome, which have been found to be useful in determining identity and biological relationships. These loci contain specific DNA markers that scientists use to identify individuals. In a routine DNA paternity test, the markers used are [[short tandem repeats]] (STRs), short pieces of DNA that occur in highly differential repeat patterns among individuals.

Each person’s DNA contains two copies of these markers—one copy inherited from the father and one from the mother. Within a population, the markers at each person’s DNA location could differ in length and sometimes sequence, depending on the markers inherited from the parents.

The combination of marker sizes found in each person makes up his/her unique genetic profile. When determining the relationship between two individuals, their genetic profiles are compared to see if they share the same inheritance patterns at a statistically conclusive rate.

For example, the following sample report from this commercial DNA paternity testing laboratory Universal Genetics signifies how relatedness between parents and child is identified on those special markers:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! DNA marker
! Mother
! Child
! Alleged father
|-
| D21S11
| 28, 30
| 28, 31
| 29, 31
|-
| D7S820
| 9, 10
| 10, 11
| 11, 12
|-
| TH01
| 14, 15
| 14, 16
| 15, 16
|-
| D13S317
| 7, 8
| 7, 9
| 8, 9
|-
| D19S433
| 14, 16.2
| 14, 15
| 15, 17
|}

The partial results indicate that the child and the alleged father’s DNA match among these five markers. The complete test results show this correlation on 16 markers between the child and the tested man to enable a conclusion to be drawn as to whether or not the man is the biological father.

Each marker is assigned with a Paternity Index (PI), which is a statistical measure of how powerfully a match at a particular marker indicates paternity. The PI of each marker is multiplied with each other to generate the Combined Paternity Index (CPI), which indicates the overall probability of an individual being the biological father of the tested child relative to a randomly selected man from the entire population of the same race. The CPI is then converted into a Probability of Paternity showing the degree of relatedness between the alleged father and child.

The DNA test report in other family relationship tests, such as grandparentage and siblingship tests, is similar to a paternity test report. Instead of the Combined Paternity Index, a different value, such as a Siblingship Index, is reported.

The report shows the genetic profiles of each tested person. If there are markers shared among the tested individuals, the probability of biological relationship is calculated to determine how likely the tested individuals share the same markers due to a blood relationship.

===Y-chromosome analysis===
Recent innovations have included the creation of primers targeting polymorphic regions on the Y-chromosome ([[Y-STR]]), which allows resolution of a mixed DNA sample from a male and female or cases in which a [[differential extraction]] is not possible. Y-chromosomes are paternally inherited, so Y-STR analysis can help in the identification of paternally related males. Y-STR analysis was performed in the [[Sally Hemings]] controversy to determine if [[Thomas Jefferson]] had sired a son with one of his slaves.
The analysis of the Y-chromosome yields weaker results than autosomal chromosome analysis. The Y male sex-determining chromosome, as it is inherited only by males from their fathers, is almost identical along the patrilineal line. This leads to a less precise analysis than if autosomal chromosomes were testing, because of the random matching that occurs between pairs of chromosomes as zygotes are being made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nij.gov/journals/267/extending-str.htm] "STR Analysis"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitochondrial analysis===
{{Main|Mitochondrial DNA}}

For highly degraded samples, it is sometimes impossible to get a complete profile of the 13 CODIS STRs. In these situations, [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is sometimes typed due to there being many copies of mtDNA in a cell, while there may only be 1-2 copies of the nuclear DNA. Forensic scientists amplify the HV1 and HV2 regions of the mtDNA, and then sequence each region and compare single-nucleotide differences to a reference. Because mtDNA is maternally inherited, directly linked maternal relatives can be used as match references, such as one's maternal grandmother's daughter's son. In general, a difference of two or more nucleotides is considered to be an exclusion. [[Heteroplasmy]] and poly-C differences may throw off straight sequence comparisons, so some expertise on the part of the analyst is required. mtDNA is useful in determining clear identities, such as those of missing people when a maternally linked relative can be found. mtDNA testing was used in determining that [[Anna Anderson]] was not the Russian princess she had claimed to be, [[Anastasia Romanov]].

mtDNA can be obtained from such material as hair shafts and old bones/teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ravikumar|first=Dhanalakshmi|last2=Gurunathan|first2=Deepa|last3=Gayathri|first3=R|last4=Priya|first4=V Vishnu|last5=Geetha|first5=R V|date=2018-01-01|title=DNA profiling of Streptococcus mutans in children with and without black tooth stains: A polymerase chain reaction analysis|url=https://doaj.org/article/d03de98b62944e3fb3e9eac391b4e76c|journal=Dental Research Journal|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|issn=1735-3327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control mechanism based on interaction point with data.

==Issues with Forensic DNA Samples==
When people think of DNA analysis they often think about shows like NCIS or CSI, which portray DNA samples coming into a lab and then instantly analyzed. With a picture of the suspect being able to be pulled up in minutes. Reality however is not like TV, and perfect DNA samples are often not collected from the scene of a crime. Homicide victims are frequently left exposed to harsh conditions before they are found and objects used to commit crimes have often been handled by more than one person. The two most prevalent issues that forensic scientists encounter when analyzing DNA samples are degraded samples and DNA mixtures.

===Degraded DNA===

In the real world DNA labs often have to deal with DNA samples that are less than ideal. DNA samples taken from crime scenes are often degraded, which means that the DNA has started to break down into smaller fragments [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_fragmentation]. Victims of homicides might not be discovered right away, and in the case of a mass casualty event it could be hard to get DNA samples before the DNA has been exposed to degradation elements.

Degradation or fragmentation of DNA at crime scenes can occur because of a number of reasons, with environmental exposure often being the most common cause. Biological samples that have been exposed to the environment can get degraded by water and enzymes called nucleases [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclease]. Nucleases essentially ‘chew’ up the DNA into fragments over time and are found everywhere in nature.

Before modern PCR methods existed it was almost impossible to analyze degraded DNA samples. Methods like restriction fragment length polymorphism or RFLP [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism], which was the first technique used for DNA analysis in forensic science, required high molecular weight DNA in the sample in order to get reliable data. High molecular weight DNA however is something that is lacking in degraded samples, as the DNA is too fragmented to accurately carry out RFLP. It wasn’t until modern day PCR techniques were invented that analysis of degraded DNA samples were able to be carried out [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction]. Multiplex PCR in particular made it possible to isolate and amplify the small fragments of DNA still left in degraded samples. When multiplex PCR methods are compared to the older methods like RFLP a vast difference can be seen. Multiplex PCR can theoretically amplify less than 1&amp;nbsp;ng of DNA, while RFLP had to have a least 100&amp;nbsp;ng of DNA in order to carry out an analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing |date=2001 |publisher=Accademic Press |location=Chapter 7 |pages=99–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of a forensic approach to a degraded DNA sample, STR loci [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STR_analysis] are often amplified using PCR-based methods. Though STR loci are amplified with greater probability of success with degraded DNA, there is still the possibility that larger STR loci will fail to amplify, and therefore, would likely yield a partial profile, which results in reduced statistical weight of association in the event of a match.

====MiniSTR Analysis====

In instances where DNA samples are degraded, like in the case of intense fires or if all that remains are bone fragments, standard STR testing on these samples can be inadequate.  When standard STR testing is done on highly degraded samples the larger STR loci often drop out, and only partial DNA profiles are obtained. While partial DNA profiles can be a powerful tool, the random match probabilities will be larger than if a full profile was obtained.  One method that has been developed in order to analyse degraded DNA samples is to use miniSTR technology. In this new approach, primers are specially designed to bind closer to the STR region.&lt;ref name="Coble 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coble |first1=Michael D. |last2=Butler |first2=John M. |title=Characterization of New MiniSTR Loci to Aid Analysis of Degraded DNA |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |date=January 2005 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=43–53 |doi=10.1520/JFS2004216|pmid=15830996 |url=https://strbase.nist.gov/pub_pres/Coble2005miniSTR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In normal STR testing the primers will bind to longer sequences that contain the STR region within the segment. MiniSTR analysis however will just target the STR location, and this results in a DNA product that is much smaller.&lt;ref name="Coble 2005" /&gt;

By placing the primers closer to the actual STR regions, there is a higher chance that successful amplification of this region will occur. Successful amplification of these STR regions can now occur and more complete DNA profiles can be obtained.  The success that smaller PCR products produce a higher success rate with highly degraded samples was first reported in 1995, when miniSTR technology was used to identify victims of the Waco fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitaker |first1=JP |last2=Clayton |first2=TM |last3=Millican |first3=ES |last4=Downes |first4=TJ |last5=Kimpton |first5=CP |title=Short tandem Repeat typing of bodies from a mass disaster: high success rate and characteristic amplification patterns in highly degraded samples |journal=BioTechniques |date=1995 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=670–677|pmid=7598902}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the fire at destroyed the DNA samples so badly that normal STR testing did not result in a positive ID on some of the victims.

===DNA Mixtures===
Mixtures are another common issue that forensic scientists face when they are analyzing unknown or questioned DNA samples. A mixture is defined as a DNA sample that contains two or more individual contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Chapter 7 |pages=99–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can often occur when a DNA sample is swabbed from an item that is handled by more than one person, or in the case were a sample contains both the victim and assailants DNA. The presence of more then one individual in a DNA sample can make it challenging to detect individual profiles and interpretation of mixtures should only be done by highly trained individuals. Mixtures that contain two or three individuals can be interpreted, though it will be difficult. While mixtures that contain four or more individuals are much too convoluted to get individual profiles. One common scenario in which a mixture is often obtained is in the case of sexual assault.A sample may be collected that contained material from the victim, the victims consensual sexual partners, and the perpetrator(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weir |first1=BS |last2=Triggs |first2=CM |last3=Starling |first3=L |last4=Stowell |first4=LI |last5=Walsh |first5=KA |last6=Buckleton |first6=J |title=Interpreting DNA Mixtures |journal=Journal of Forensic Science |date=1997 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=213–222 |url=https://projects.nfstc.org/workshops/resources/articles/Interpreting%20DNA%20Mixtures.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As detection methods in DNA profiling advance, forensic scientist are seeing more DNA samples that contain mixtures, as even the smallest contributor is now able to be detected by modern tests. The ease in which forensic scientists have in interpenetrating DNA mixtures largely depends on ratio of DNA present from each individual, the genotype combinations, and total amount of DNA amplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Chapter 7 |pages=99–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA ratio is often the most important aspect to look at in determining if a mixture can be interpreted. For example in the case were a DNA sample had two contributors, it would be easy to interpret individual profiles if the ratio of DNA contributed by one person was much higher then the second person. When a sample has three or more contributors it starts to enter a realm were its almost impossible to determine individual profiles, fortunately new advancement in probabilistic genotyping could make this possible in the future. Probabilistic genotyping uses complex computer software to run through thousands of mathematical computations in order to produce statistical likelihoods of individual genotypes found in a mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Indiana State Police Laboratory |title=Introduction to STRmix and Likelifood Ratios |url=https://www.in.gov/isp/labs/files/STRmix_and_Likelihood_Ratios_IPAC%20and_Defense_Council_Training_2017.pdf |website=In.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probabilistic genotyping software that are often used in labs today include STRmix and TrueAllele.

==DNA databases==
{{Main|National DNA database}}
An early application of a [[DNA database]] was the compilation of a Mitochondrial DNA Concordance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Kevin|title=Mitochondrial DNA Concordance|url=http://www.bioanth.cam.ac.uk/mtDNA/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030122010149/http://www.bioanth.cam.ac.uk/mtDNA/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared by Kevin W. P. Miller and John L. Dawson at the University of Cambridge from 1996 to 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=K.W.P.|author2=Dawson, J.L. |author3=Hagelberg, E. |title=A concordance of nucleotide substitutions in the first and second hypervariable segments of the human mtDNA control region|journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine|year=1996|volume=109|pages=107–113|doi=10.1007/bf01369668}}&lt;/ref&gt; from data collected as part of Miller's PhD thesis. There are now several [[DNA database]]s in existence around the world. Some are private, but most of the largest databases are government-controlled. The [[United States]] maintains the largest [[DNA database]], with the [[Combined DNA Index System]] (CODIS) holding over 13 million records as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis/ndis-statistics |title=CODIS&amp;nbsp;— National DNA Index System |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306181537/http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/national.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] maintains the [[United Kingdom National DNA Database|National DNA Database]] (NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this database, and its rate of growth, are giving concern to [[civil liberties]] groups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions#Section_82:_Restrictions_on_use_and_destruction_of_fingerprints_and_samples |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223205051/http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions#Section_82:_Restrictions_on_use_and_destruction_of_fingerprints_and_samples |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-02-23 |title=Restrictions on use and destruction of fingerprints and samples |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition partially addressed these concerns with part 1 of the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]], under which DNA samples must be deleted if suspects are acquitted or not charged, except in relation to certain (mostly serious and/or sexual) offences.

The [[USA PATRIOT Act|U.S. Patriot Act]] of the United States provides a means for the U.S. government to get DNA samples from suspected terrorists. DNA information from crimes is collected and deposited into the [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] database, which is maintained by the [[FBI]]. CODIS enables law enforcement officials to test DNA samples from crimes for matches within the database, providing a means of finding specific biological profiles associated with collected DNA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/jud/rpt/2003-R-0411.htm|title=DNA Testing Provisions in Patriot Act|first1=Susan |last1=Price-Livingston|date=5 June 2003|access-date=18 January 2018|publisher=Connecticut General Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a match is made from a national DNA databank to link a crime scene to an offender having provided a DNA sample to a database, that link is often referred to as a ''cold hit''. A cold hit is of value in referring the police agency to a specific suspect but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made from outside the DNA Databank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=DNA: A Practical Guide|authors=Rose &amp; Goos|publisher=Carswell Publications|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI agents cannot legally store DNA of a person not convicted of a crime. DNA collected from a suspect not later convicted must be disposed of and not entered into the database. In 1998, a man residing in the UK was arrested on accusation of burglary. His DNA was taken and tested, and he was later released. Nine months later, this man's DNA was accidentally and illegally entered in the DNA database. New DNA is automatically compared to the DNA found at cold cases and, in this case, this man was found to be a match to DNA found at a rape and assault case one year earlier. The government then prosecuted him for these crimes. During the trial the DNA match was requested to be removed from the evidence because it had been illegally entered into the database. The request was carried out.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/double-helix-jeopardy] "Double Helix Jeopardy"&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA of the perpetrator, collected from victims of rape, can be stored for years until a match is found. In 2014, to address this problem, Congress extended a bill that helps states deal with "a backlog" of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress OKs bill to cut rape evidence backlog |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CONGRESS_RAPE_BACKLOG_BILL?SITE=NHCON&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-09-18-18-43-47 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140919001749/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CONGRESS_RAPE_BACKLOG_BILL?SITE=NHCON&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-09-18-18-43-47 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2014 |work=Associated Press |accessdate=18 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations when evaluating DNA evidence==
As DNA profiling became a key piece of evidence in the court, defense lawyers based their arguments on statistical reasoning. For example: Given a match that had a 1 in 5 million probability of occurring by chance, the lawyer would argue that this meant that in a country of say 60 million people there were 12 people who would also match the profile. This was then translated to a 1 in 12 chance of the suspect's being the guilty one. This argument is not sound unless the suspect was drawn at random from the population of the country. In fact, a jury should consider how likely it is that an individual matching the genetic profile would also have been a suspect in the case for other reasons. Also, different DNA analysis processes can reduce the amount of DNA recovery if the procedures are not properly done. Therefore, the number of times a piece of evidence is sampled can
diminish the DNA collection efficiency. Another spurious statistical argument is based on the false assumption that a 1 in 5 million probability of a match automatically translates into a 1 in 5 million probability of innocence and is known as the [[prosecutor's fallacy]].

When using [[RFLP]], the theoretical risk of a coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because [[monozygotic twins]] are 0.2% of the human population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures do not reflect the theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in ''precisely'' the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates, which may be cause for concern.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Paton Walsh [https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,2763,640157,00.html False result fear over DNA tests] [[The Observer]], Sunday 27 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309053951/html/35.html The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence] 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.

Since 1998, the DNA profiling system supported by The National DNA Database in the UK is the [[SGM+]] DNA profiling system that includes 10 STR regions and a sex-indicating test. [[Short tandem repeat|STRs]] do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar power of discrimination (1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; for unrelated individuals if using a full [[SGM+]] profile). Figures of this magnitude are not considered to be statistically supportable by scientists in the UK; for unrelated individuals with full matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, [[chimerism]] is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.

===Evidence of genetic relationship===
It is possible to use DNA profiling as evidence of genetic relationship, although such evidence varies in strength from weak to positive. Testing that shows no relationship is absolutely certain. Further, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, ultra-rare individuals, known as "[[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]]", have at least two different sets of genes. There have been two cases of DNA profiling that falsely suggested that a mother was unrelated to her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693 |title=Two Women Don't Match Their Kids' DNA |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens when two eggs are fertilized at the same time and fuse together to create one individual instead of twins.

==Fake DNA evidence==
In one case, a criminal planted fake DNA evidence in his own body: [[John Schneeberger]] raped one of his sedated patients in 1992 and left semen on her underwear. Police drew what they believed to be Schneeberger's blood and compared its DNA against the crime scene semen DNA on three occasions, never showing a match. It turned out that he had surgically inserted a [[Penrose drain]] into his arm and filled it with foreign blood and [[anticoagulant]]s.

The functional analysis of genes and their coding sequences (open reading frames [ORFs]) typically requires that each ORF be expressed, the encoded protein purified, antibodies produced, phenotypes examined, intracellular localization determined, and interactions with other proteins sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James L. Hartley |author2=Gary F. Temple |author3=Michael A. Brasch |title=DNA Cloning Using In Vitro Site-Specific Recombination|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by the life science company Nucleix and published in the journal Forensic Science International, scientists found that an [[in vitro]] synthesized sample of DNA matching any desired genetic profile can be constructed using standard [[molecular biology]] techniques without obtaining any actual tissue from that person. Nucleix claims they can also prove the difference between non-altered DNA and any that was synthesized.&lt;ref&gt;

In the case of the [[Phantom of Heilbronn]], police detectives found DNA traces from the same woman on various crime scenes in Austria, Germany, and France—among them murders, burglaries and robberies. Only after the DNA of the "woman" matched the DNA sampled from the burned body of a ''male'' asylum seeker in France did detectives begin to have serious doubts about the DNA evidence. It was eventually discovered that DNA traces were already present on the [[cotton swab]]s used to collect the samples at the crime scene, and the swabs had all been produced at the same factory in Austria. The company's product specification said that the swabs were guaranteed to be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]], but not DNA-free.

===Familial DNA searching===
Familial DNA searching (sometimes referred to as "familial DNA" or "familial DNA database searching") is the practice of creating new investigative leads in cases where DNA evidence found at the scene of a crime (forensic profile) strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a state DNA database but there is not an exact match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-dimond/searching-the-family-dna-_b_845340.html|title = Searching the Family DNA Tree to Solve Crime|date = April 12, 2011|accessdate = April 17, 2011|website = HuffPost Denver|publisher = The Huffington Post|last = Diamond|first = Diane|authorlink = Diane Diamond|type = Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Bieber Frederick|year = 2006|title = Finding Criminals Through DNA of Their Relatives|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/312/5778/1315.short|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5778|pages = 1315–16|doi = 10.1126/science.1122655|display-authors = etal|pmid=16690817}}{{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all other leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software to compare the forensic profile to all profiles taken from a state's DNA database to generate a list of those offenders already in the database who are most likely to be a very close relative of the individual whose DNA is in the forensic profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dnaforensics.com/FamilialSearches.aspx|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101107011011/http://dnaforensics.com/FamilialSearches.aspx|dead-url = yes|archive-date = November 7, 2010|title = Familial searches allows law enforcement to identify criminals through their family members|accessdate = December 7, 2015|website = DNA Forensics|last = Staff|at = United Kingdom – A Pioneer in Familial Searches|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate the majority of this list when the forensic DNA is a man's, crime lab technicians conduct [[Y-STR]] analysis. Using standard investigative techniques, authorities are then able to build a family tree. The family tree is populated from information gathered from [[public records]] and criminal justice records. Investigators rule out family members' involvement in the crime by finding excluding factors such as sex, living out of state or being incarcerated when the crime was committed. They may also use other leads from the case, such as [[witness]] or victim statements, to identify a suspect. Once a suspect has been identified, investigators seek to legally obtain a DNA sample from the suspect. This suspect DNA profile is then compared to the sample found at the crime scene to definitively identify the suspect as the source of the crime scene DNA.

Familial DNA database searching was first used in an investigation leading to the conviction of Jeffrey Gafoor of the [[murder of Lynette White]] in the United Kingdom on 4 July 2003. DNA evidence was matched to Gafoor's nephew, who at 14 years old had not been born at the time of the murder in 1988. It was used again in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4908-killer-convicted-thanks-to-relatives-dna/|title = Killer convicted thanks to relative’s DNA|last = Bhattacharya|first = Shaoni|date = April 20, 2004|journal = [[New Sci.|New Scientist]]|doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 17, 2011|department = Daily News}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find a man who threw a brick from a motorway bridge and hit a lorry driver, killing him. DNA found on the brick matched that found at the scene of a car theft earlier in the day, but there were no good matches on the national DNA database. A wider search found a partial match to an individual; on being questioned, this man revealed he had a brother, Craig Harman, who lived very close to the original crime scene. Harman voluntarily submitted a DNA sample, and confessed when it matched the sample from the brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/event/264460/media/slspublic/Greely.pdf|title = Family Ties: The Use of DNA Offender Databases to Catch Offenders' Kin|last = Greely|first = Henry T.|date = Summer 2006|journal = Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|doi = 10.1111/j.1748-720x.2006.00031.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Riordan|first2 = Daniel P.|last3 = Garrison|last4 = Mountain|first3 = Nanibaa' A.|first4 = Joanna L.|pages = 248–62|department = Symposium|issn = 1748-720X|publisher = Wiley for American Society of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, familial DNA database searching is not conducted on a national level in the United States, where states determine how and when to conduct familial searches.

At a press conference in Virginia on March 7, 2011, regarding the [[East Coast Rapist]], Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert and Fairfax County Police Detective John Kelly said the case would have been solved years ago if Virginia had used familial DNA searching.

Critics of familial DNA database searches argue that the technique is an invasion of an individual's [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murphy Erin Elizabeth | year = 2009 | title = Relative Doubt: Familial Searches of DNA Databases | url = http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/109/3/murphy.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101201110255/http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/109/3/murphy.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-12-01 | format = PDF | journal = Michigan Law Review | volume = 109 | issue = | pages = 291–348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy advocates are petitioning for DNA database restrictions, arguing that the only fair way to search for possible DNA matches to relatives of offenders or arrestees would be to have a population-wide DNA database.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Some scholars have pointed out that the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are similar in some respects to other police search techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Suter Sonia | year = 2010 | title = All in The Family: Privacy and DNA Familial Searching | url = http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v23.2/23HarvJLTech309.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607082902/http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v23.2/23HarvJLTech309.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-06-07 | format = PDF | journal = Harvard Journal of Law and Technology | volume = 23 | issue = | page = 328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most have concluded that the practice is constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, David H., (2013).

Pool'' (vacated as moot) suggested that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating that it looked like the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/14/09-10303.pdf "US v. Pool"] Pool 621F .3d 1213.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether familial DNA searching was the method used to identify the suspect, authorities always conduct a normal DNA test to match the suspect's DNA with that of the DNA left at the crime scene.

Critics also claim that racial profiling could occur on account of familial DNA testing. In the United States, the conviction rates of racial minorities are much higher than that of the overall population. It is unclear whether this is due to discrimination from police officers and the courts, as opposed to a simple higher rate of offence among minorities. Arrest-based databases, which are found in the majority of the United States, lead to an even greater level of racial discrimination. An arrest, as opposed to conviction, relies much more heavily on police discretion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

For instance, investigators with Denver District Attorney's Office successfully identified a suspect in a property theft case using a familial DNA search. In this example, the suspect's blood left at the scene of the crime strongly resembled that of a current [[Colorado Department of Corrections]] prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Pankratz, Howard.[http://www.denverpost.com/denver/ci_13801125 "Denver Uses 'Familial DNA Evidence' to Solve Car Break-Ins"]. ''The Denver Post'', accessed April 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Using publicly available records, the investigators created a family tree. They then eliminated all the family members who were incarcerated at the time of the offense, as well as all of the females (the crime scene DNA profile was that of a male). Investigators obtained a court order to collect the suspect's DNA, but the suspect actually volunteered to come to a police station and give a DNA sample. After providing the sample, the suspect walked free without further interrogation or detainment. Later confronted with an exact match to the forensic profile, the suspect pleaded guilty to criminal trespass at the first court date and was sentenced to two years probation.

In Italy a familiar DNA search has been done to solve the case of the [[murder of Yara Gambirasio]] whose body was found in the bush{{clarify|reason=in ''a'' bush, or in the country? The latter is Australian slang, doesn't normally apply to Italy|date=August 2017}} three months after her disappearance. A DNA trace was found on the underwear of the murdered teenage near and a DNA sample was requested from a person who lived near the municipality of [[Brembate di Sopra]] and a common male ancestor was found in the DNA sample of a young man not involved in the murder. After a long investigation the father of the supposed killer was identified as Giuseppe Guerinoni, a deceased man, but his two sons born from his wife were not related to the DNA samples found on the body of Yara. After three and a half years the DNA found on the underwear of the deceased girl was matched with Massimo Giuseppe Bosetti who was arrested and accused of the murder of the 13-year-old girl.In the summer of 2016 Bosetti was found guilty and sentenced to life by the [[Corte d'assise]] of Bergamo.

Partial DNA matches are not searches{{clarify|date=February 2018}} themselves, but are the result of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one [[allele]] at every [[locus (genetics)|locus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090718171602/http://www.chromosomal-labs.com/files/FindingCriminals.pdf "Finding Criminals Through DNA Testing of Their Relatives"] Technical Bulletin, Chromosomal Laboratories, Inc. accessed April 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Partial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the UK and United States, or additional [[Y-STR]] analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in the UK and United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverda.org/DNA/Familial_DNA_Database_Searches.htm "Denver District Attorney DNA Resources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324020014/http://www.denverda.org/dna/Familial_DNA_Database_Searches.htm |date=2011-03-24 }} accessed April 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. [[Darryl Hunt]] was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070828152727/http://www.innocenceproject.org/news/Blog-Search.php?check=true&amp;tag=134 "Darryl Hunt, The Innocence Project"].&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The partial match led investigators to the felon’s brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case against Hunt.
In Italy, partial matching has been used in the controversial [[murder of Yara Gambirasio]], a child found dead about a month after her presumed kidnapping. In this case, the partial match has been used as the only incriminating element against the defendant, Massimo Bossetti, who has been subsequently condemned for the murder (waiting appeal by the Italian Supreme Court).

===Surreptitious DNA collecting===
Police forces may collect DNA samples without a suspect's knowledge, and use it as evidence. The legality of the practice has been questioned in [[Australia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In the United States, it has been accepted, courts often ruling that there is no [[expectation of privacy]], citing ''[[California v. Greenwood]]'' (1988), in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] does not prohibit the [[Search warrant|warrantless]] search and seizure of [[Waste|garbage]] left for collection outside the [[curtilage]] of a [[home]]. Critics of this practice underline that this analogy ignores that "most people have no idea that they risk surrendering their genetic identity to the police by, for instance, failing to destroy a used coffee cup. Moreover, even if they do realize it, there is no way to avoid abandoning one's DNA in public."&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy Harmon]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/science/03dna.html "Lawyers Fight DNA Samples Gained on Sly"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Maryland v. King]]'' (2013) that DNA sampling of prisoners arrested for serious crimes is constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Supreme Court allows DNA sampling of prisoners|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/06/03/US-Supreme-Court-allows-DNA-sampling-of-prisoners/UPI-45601370271128/#ixzz2VBFXuZve|publisher=UPI|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf|title=SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES - Syllabus: MARYLAND v.

In the [[UK]], the ''[[Human Tissue Act 2004]]'' prohibits private individuals from covertly collecting biological samples (hair, fingernails, etc.) for DNA analysis, but exempts medical and criminal investigations from the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080306151453/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Scientificdevelopmentgeneticsandbioethics/Tissue/TissueGeneralInformation/DH_4102169 Human Tissue Act 2004], UK, available in PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from an expert who has compared DNA samples must be accompanied by evidence as to the sources of the samples and the procedures for obtaining the DNA profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

The judge must also ensure that the jury does not confuse the match probability (the probability that a person that is chosen at random has a matching DNA profile to the sample from the scene) with the probability that a person with matching DNA committed the crime.

{{quote|Members of the Jury, if you accept the scientific evidence called by the Crown, this indicates that there are probably only four or five white males in the United Kingdom from whom that semen stain could have come. The Defendant is one of them. If that is the position, the decision you have to reach, on all the evidence, is whether you are sure that it was the Defendant who left that stain or whether it is possible that it was one of that other small group of men who share the same DNA characteristics.}}

Juries should weigh up conflicting and corroborative evidence, using their own common sense and not by using mathematical formulae, such as [[Bayes' theorem]], so as to avoid "confusion, misunderstanding and misjudgment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII

====Presentation and evaluation of evidence of partial or incomplete DNA profiles====
In ''R v Bates'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = R v Bates | link =  | country =  | court = EWCA | division = Crim | year = 2006 | num = 1395 | para =  | eucase =  | parallelcite =  | date = 7 July 2006 | courtname = [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] | juris = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore-Bick LJ said:

{{quote|We can see no reason why partial profile DNA evidence should not be admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to evaluate it. There may be cases where the match probability in relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by case basis. However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a "missing" allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence. In many there is a possibility (at least in theory) that evidence that would assist the accused and perhaps even exculpate him altogether exists, but that does not provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate that evidence properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=DNA_profiling#Presentation_and_evaluation_of_evidence_of_partial_or_incomplete_DNA_profiles |title=WikiCrimeLine DNA profiling |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022013511/http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=DNA_profiling#Presentation_and_evaluation_of_evidence_of_partial_or_incomplete_DNA_profiles |archivedate=2010-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===DNA testing in the United States===
[[File:CBP chemist reads a DNA profile.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|CBP]] chemist reads a DNA profile to determine the origin of a commodity.]]
There are state laws on DNA profiling in all 50 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthanddna.com/dna-learning/book-dna-testing.html |title=Genelex: The DNA Paternity Testing Site |publisher=Healthanddna.com |date=1996-01-06 |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229000534/http://www.healthanddna.com/dna-learning/book-dna-testing.html |archivedate=2010-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed information on database laws in each state can be found at the [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Donna Lyons — Posted by Glenda |url=http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/CivilandCriminalJustice/StateLawsonDNADataBanks/tabid/12737/Default.aspx |title=State Laws on DNA Data Banks |publisher=Ncsl.org |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of artificial DNA===
In August 2009, scientists in [[Israel]] raised serious doubts concerning the use of DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper published in the journal ''Forensic Science International: Genetics'', the Israeli researchers demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture DNA in a laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the supposed donor of the blood and saliva.&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18dna.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=DNA Evidence Can Be Fabricated, Scientists Show|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=August 18, 2009|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also showed that, using a DNA database, it is possible to take information from a profile and manufacture DNA to match it, and that this can be done without access to any actual DNA from the person whose DNA they are duplicating. The synthetic DNA oligos required for the procedure are common in molecular laboratories.&lt;ref name="pollack"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted the lead author, Daniel Frumkin, saying, "You can just engineer a crime scene ... any biology undergraduate could perform this".&lt;ref name="pollack"/&gt; Frumkin perfected a test that can differentiate real DNA samples from fake ones. His test detects [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] modifications, in particular, [[DNA methylation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://ejfs.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41935-018-0042-1&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy percent of the DNA in any human genome is methylated, meaning it contains [[methyl group]] modifications within a [[CpG dinucleotide]] context. Methylation at the promoter region is associated with gene silencing. The synthetic DNA lacks this [[epigenetic]] modification, which allows the test to distinguish manufactured DNA from genuine DNA.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

It is unknown how many police departments, if any, currently use the test. No police lab has publicly announced that it is using the new test to verify DNA results.&lt;ref name="frumkin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsigenetics.com/article/S1872-4973(09)00099-4/abstract |title=Elsevier |publisher=Fsigenetics.com |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases===
*In 1986, Richard Buckland was exonerated, despite having admitted to the rape and murder of a teenager near [[Leicester]], the city where DNA profiling was first developed. This was the first use of DNA fingerprinting in a criminal investigation, and the first to prove a suspect's innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8245312.stm|work=BBC News|title=DNA pioneer's 'eureka' moment|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified as the perpetrator of the same murder, in addition to another, using the same techniques that had cleared Buckland.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Wambaugh, ''The Blooding'' (New York, New York: A Perigord Press Book, 1989), 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1988, [[Timothy Wilson Spencer]] was the first man in [[Virginia]] to be sentenced to death through DNA testing, for several rape and murder charges. He was dubbed "The South Side Strangler" because he killed victims on the south side of Richmond, Virginia. He was later charged with rape and first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. He was executed on April 27, 1994. David Vasquez, initially convicted of one of Spencer's crimes, became the first man in [[United States|America]] exonerated based on DNA evidence.
*In 1989, [[Chicago]] man [[Gary Dotson]] was the first person whose conviction was overturned using DNA evidence.
*In 1991, [[Allan Legere]] was the first [[Canadians|Canadian]] to be convicted as a result of DNA evidence, for four murders he had committed while an escaped prisoner in 1989. During his trial, his defense argued that the relatively shallow gene pool of the region could lead to false positives.

*In 1993, [[Kirk Bloodsworth]] was the first person to have been convicted of [[murder]] and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], whose conviction was overturned using DNA evidence.
*The 1993 rape and murder of [[Mia Zapata]], lead singer for the Seattle punk band [[The Gits]], was unsolved nine years after the murder. A database search in 2001 failed, but the killer's DNA was collected when he was arrested in Florida for burglary and domestic abuse in 2002.
*The science was made famous in the [[United States]] in 1994 when prosecutors heavily relied on DNA evidence allegedly linking [[O. J. Simpson]] to a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|double murder]]. The case also brought to light the laboratory difficulties and handling procedure mishaps that can cause such evidence to be significantly doubted.
*In 1994, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) detectives successfully tested hairs from a cat known as [[Snowball the Cat|Snowball]], and used the test to link a man to the murder of his wife, thus marking for the first time in forensic history the use of non-human animal DNA to identify a criminal (plant DNA was used in 1992, see above).
*In 1994, the claim that [[Anna Anderson]] was [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]] was tested after her death using samples of her tissue that had been stored at a Charlottesville, Virginia hospital following a medical procedure.

He was allegedly found alive eight months later in the custody of William Cantwell Walters, but another woman claimed that the boy was her son, Bruce Anderson, whom she had entrusted in Walters' custody. The courts disbelieved her claim and convicted Walters for the kidnapping. The boy was raised and known as Bobby Dunbar throughout the rest of his life. However, DNA tests on Dunbar's son and nephew revealed the two were not related, thus establishing that the boy found in 1912 was not Bobby Dunbar, whose real fate remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-05-05-1914-dna_x.htm DNA clears man of 1914 kidnapping conviction]", ''[[USA Today]]'', (May 5, 2004), by Allen G. Breed, [[Associated Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2005, Gary Leiterman was convicted of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a law student at the [[University of Michigan]], after DNA found on Mixer's [[pantyhose]] was matched to Leiterman. DNA in a drop of blood on Mixer's hand was matched to John Ruelas, who was only four years old in 1969 and was never successfully connected to the case in any other way. Leiterman's defense unsuccessfully argued that the unexplained match of the blood spot to Ruelas pointed to cross-contamination and raised doubts about the reliability of the lab's identification of Leiterman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/22/48hours/main1066064.shtml CBS News] story on the Jane Mixer murder case; March 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/earlyshow/main3065082.shtml CBS News] story on the Mixer case; July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyisinnocent.org/ An advocacy site] challenging Leiterman's conviction in the Mixer murder.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In December 2005, Evan Simmons was proven innocent of a 1981 attack on an Atlanta woman after serving twenty-four years in prison. Mr. Clark is the 164th person in the United States and the fifth in Georgia to be freed using post-conviction DNA testing.
*In November 2008, [[Anthony Curcio]] was arrested for masterminding one of the most elaborately planned armored car heists in history.  DNA evidence linked Curcio to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doughery|first1=Phil|title=D.B.

*In March 2009, [[Sean Hodgson]]—convicted of 1979 killing of Teresa De Simone, 22, in her car in [[Southampton]]—was released after tests proved DNA from the scene was not his. It was later matched to DNA retrieved from the exhumed body of David Lace. Lace had previously confessed to the crime but was not believed by the detectives. He served time in prison for other crimes committed at the same time as the murder and then committed suicide in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Jenny|title=Police name David Lace as true killer of Teresa De Simone|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6838034.ece|website=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2012, familial DNA profiling led to Alice Collins Plebuch's unexpected discovery that her ancestral bloodline was not purely Irish, as she had previously been led to believe, but that her heritage also contained European Jewish, Middle Eastern and Eastern European. This led her into an extensive genealogy investigation which resulted in her uncovering the genetic family of her adopted father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who Was She?

*In 2016 Anthea Ring, abandoned as baby, was able to use a DNA sample and DNA matching database to discover her deceased mother’s identity and roots in County Mayo, Ireland. A recently developed forensic test was subsequently used to capture DNA from saliva left on old stamps and envelopes by her suspected father, uncovered through painstaking genealogy research. The DNA in the first three samples was too degraded to use. However, on the fourth, more than enough DNA was found. The test, which has a degree of accuracy acceptable in UK courts, proved that a man named Patrick Coyne was her biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who were my parents - and why was I left on a hillside to die?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43420678|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livingdna.com/blog/306/living-dna-provide-closure-lifetime-search-biological-father|title=Living DNA provide closure on lifetime search for biological father|date=March 19, 2018|website= Living DNA|access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">A '''Darwin machine''' (a 1987 coinage by [[William H. Calvin]], by [[analogy]] to a [[Turing machine]]) is a machine that, like a Turing machine, involves an [[iteration]] process that yields a high-quality result, but, whereas a Turing machine uses [[logic]], the Darwin machine uses rounds of variation, [[Selection (biology)|selection]], and [[inheritance]].
 
In its original connotation, a Darwin machine is any process that [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]]s quality by utilizing all of the six essential features of a Darwinian process:  A ''pattern'' is ''copied'' with ''variations'', where populations of one variant pattern ''compete'' with another population, their relative success biased by a ''multifaceted environment'' ([[natural selection]]) so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation (Darwin's ''inheritance principle'').

More loosely, a Darwin machine is a process that utilizes some subset of the Darwinian essentials, typically [[natural selection]] to create a non-reproducing pattern, as in [[neural Darwinism]]. Many aspects of [[neural development]] utilize overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern, but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies.

''Darwin machine'' has been used multiple times to name computer programs after [[Charles Darwin]].

A '''double inverted pendulum''' is the combination of the [[inverted pendulum]] and the [[double pendulum]]. The double inverted pendulum is unstable, meaning that it will fall down unless it is controlled in some way. The two main methods of controlling a double inverted pendulum are moving the base, as with the inverted pendulum, or by applying a torque at the pivot point between the two pendulums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[music]], the '''dynamics''' of a piece is the variation in [[loudness]] between [[note (music)|notes]] or [[phrase (music)|phrases]]. Dynamics are indicated by specific [[musical notation]], often in some detail. However, dynamics markings still require interpretation by the performer depending on the musical context: for instance a ''piano'' (quiet) marking in one part of a piece might have quite different objective loudness in another piece, or even a different section of the same piece. The execution of dynamics also extends beyond loudness to include changes in [[timbre]] and sometimes [[tempo rubato]].
==Purpose and interpretation==
Dynamics are one of the [[musical expression|expressive elements of music]]. Used effectively, dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance, and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling.

Dynamic markings are always relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thiemel|first1=Matthias|title=Dynamics|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08458|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 July 2017|ref=Grove Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{serif|'''''p'''''}} never indicates a precise level of [[loudness]], it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be considerably quieter than {{serif|'''''f'''''}}. There are many factors affecting the interpretation of a dynamic marking. For instance, the middle of a [[phrase (music theory)|musical phrase]] will normally be played louder than the beginning or ending, to ensure the phrase is properly shaped, even where a passage is marked {{serif|'''''p'''''}} throughout.  Similarly, in [[polyphony|multi-part music]], some [[part (music)|voices]] will naturally be played louder than others, for instance to emphasis the melody and the bass line, even if a whole passage is marked at one dynamic level. Some instruments are naturally louder than others - for instance, a [[tuba]] playing ''piano'' will likely be louder than a [[guitar]] playing ''fortissimo'', while a high-pitched instrument like the [[piccolo]] playing in its upper register can usually sound loud even when its actual decibel level is lower than that of other instruments.

Further, a dynamic marking does not necessarily only affect loudness of the music. A ''forte'' passage is not usually "the same as a ''piano'' passage but louder". Rather, a musician will often use a different approach to other aspects of expression like [[timbre]] or [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] to further illustrate the differences. Sometimes this might also extend to [[tempo]]. It's important for a performer to be able to control dynamics and tempo independently, and thus novice musicians are often instructed "don't speed up just because it's getting louder!". However, in some circumstances, a dynamic marking might also indicate a change of tempo.{{efn|For instance, in Schubert's string quartet ''[[Death and the Maiden Quartet|Death and the Maiden]]'', the ''dimenuendo'' marking is followed by ''[[a tempo]]'', indicating that the dimenuendo is a reduction in speed as well as in loudness. In the same work Schubert uses ''decrescendo'' to indicate a reduction in loudness with no change in speed.}}

In some [[scorewriter|music notation program]]s, there are default [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] key velocity values associated with these indications, but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed. Apple's [[Logic Pro]] 9 (2009-2013) and Avid's [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] 5 (2007-2009) use the following values: Sibelius 5 defines the following values, though these may be adjusted in Sibelius, within the range 0-127:

The two basic dynamic indications in music are:

More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by:
* {{serif|'''''mp'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-piano'',  meaning "half soft".
* {{serif|'''''mf'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-forte'',  meaning "half loud".&lt;ref name="vtd"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dynamics  | work=Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary | url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/Dynamics.html  | accessdate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'', standing for ''più piano'' and meaning "softer".
* ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', standing for ''più forte'' and meaning "louder".

Use of up to three consecutive {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s or {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s is also common:
* {{serif|'''''pp'''''}}, standing for ''pianissimo'' and meaning "very soft".
* {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}, standing for ''fortissimo'' and meaning "very loud".
* {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, standing for ''pianississimo'' and meaning "more than very soft".
* {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, standing for ''fortississimo'' and meaning "more than very loud".&lt;ref name="vtd" /&gt;

{{redirect-multi|2|Crescendo|Diminuendo}}

[[Image:Dynamic's Note Velocity.svg|thumb|350px|Note Velocity is a [[MIDI]] measurement of the speed that the key travels from its rest position to completely depressed, with 127, the largest value in a 7-bit number, being instantaneous, and meaning as strong as possible. {{audio|MIDI dynamics fff to ppp.mid|Play a C major chord at each dynamic from fff to ppp}}]]

Three Italian words are used to show gradual changes in volume:

* '''''crescendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|cresc.}}'') translates as "increasing" (literally "growing").
* '''''decrescendo''''' (abbreviated to ''{{serif|decresc.}}'') translates as "decreasing".
* '''''diminuendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|dim.}}'') translates as "diminishing".

Signs sometimes referred to as "[[hairpin]]s"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael and Bourne, Joyce: ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'' (1996), entry "Hairpins".&lt;/ref&gt; are also used to stand for these words (See image). If the angle lines open up ([[File:Music-crescendo.svg|15x15px]]), then the indication is to get louder; if they close gradually ([[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|15x15px]]), the indication is to get softer. The following notation indicates music starting moderately strong, then becoming gradually stronger and then gradually quieter:

Hairpins are usually written below the [[staff (music)|staff]] (or between the two staves in a [[grand staff]]), but are sometimes found above, especially in music for [[singer]]s or in music with multiple melody lines being played by a single performer. They tend to be used for dynamic changes over a relatively short space of time (at most a few [[bar (music)|bars]]), while ''{{serif|cresc.}}'', ''{{serif|decresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|dim.}}'' are generally used for changes over a longer period. Word directions can be extended with dashes to indicate over what time the event should occur, which may be as long as multiple pages. The word ''morendo'' ("dying") is also sometimes used for a gradual reduction in dynamics (and tempo).

For greater changes in dynamics, ''{{serif|cresc. molto}}'' and ''{{serif|dim. molto}}'' are often used, where the ''molto'' means "much". Similarly, for more gradual changes ''{{serif|poco cresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|poco dim.}}'' are used, where "poco" translates as ''a little'', or alternatively with ''poco a poco'' meaning "little by little''.

Sudden changes in dynamics may be notated by adding the word ''subito'' (meaning "suddenly") as a prefix or suffix to the new dynamic notation. ''Subito piano (''abbreviated ''{{serif| sub. '''p'''}}'') ("suddenly soft") indicates that the dynamics quickly, almost abruptly, lower the volume to approximately the {{serif|'''''p'''''}} range. It is often purposefully used to subvert the listeners expectation and will signify an intimacy expression. Although it uses the ''piano'' {{serif|'''''p'''''}} dynamic symbol, the performer has slight freedom in their interpretation, causing it to vary based on the preceding loudness or character of the piece.

{{anchor|Sudden_changes_and_accented_notes}}
[[Accent (music)|Accented notes]] can be notated  ''sforzando'', ''sforzato'', ''forzando'' or ''forzato'' (abbreviated {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}) ("forcing" or "forced"), or using the sign '''&gt;''', placed above or below the head of the note.

''Sforzando'' (or ''sforzato'', ''forzando'', ''forzato'') indicates a forceful accent and is abbreviated as {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}} or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}. There is often confusion surrounding these markings and whether or not there is any difference in the degree of accent. However, all of these indicate the same expression, depending on the dynamic level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gerou |first=Tom |first2=Linda |last2= Lusk |title= Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation |year=1996 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |location= Van Nuys, CA |isbn= 978-0882847306 |pages=37–38 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=6PELtxxrz_QC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=sf+sfz+fz#v=onepage&amp;q=sf%20sfz%20fz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent of the ''sforzando'' is determined purely by the performer.

The [[fortepiano (musical dynamic)|fortepiano]] notation {{serif|'''''fp'''''}} indicates a ''forte'' followed immediately by ''piano''. By contrast, {{serif|'''''pf'''''}} is an abbreviation for ''poco forte'', literally "a little loud" but (according to Brahms) meaning ''with the character of forte, but the sound of piano'', though rarely used because of possible confusion with ''[[#Words and phrases indicating changes of dynamics|pianoforte]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreysolow.com/Writings/AnEnigmaticMarkingExplainedVcS.doc An Enigmatic Marking Explained], by Jeffrey Solow, Violoncello Society Newsletter, Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

While the typical range of dynamic  markings is from {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, some pieces use additional markings of further emphasis. Extreme dynamic markings imply an extreme range of loudness, or, alternatively, imply an extremely subtle distinction between very small differences of loudness within a normal range. This kind of usage is most common in orchestral works from the late 19th-century onwards. Generally, these markings are supported by the [[orchestration]] of the work, with heavy forte markings brought to life by having many loud instruments like brass and percussion playing at once.

In [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', {{serif|'''''ffff'''''}} occurs twice in "Mars" and once in "Uranus", often punctuated by organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/5/59/IMSLP05396-Holst_-_THE_PLANETS_-_Suite_for_Large_Orchestra_-_Partitur.pdf|title=The Planets|last=Holst|first=Gustav|publisher=Goodwin &amp; Tabb|year=1921|isbn=|location=London|pages=29, 42, 159|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] marks a bassoon solo {{serif|'''''pppppp'''''}} (6 {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s) in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|''Pathétique'' Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/b/b5/IMSLP504312-PMLP2511-Tchaikovsky_-_Symphony_No.6_in_B_minor,_Op.74;_TH_30;_CW_27,_'Pathetic'.pdf|title=Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Symphonies in Full Score|last=Tchaikovsky|first=Peter Ilyitch|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1979|isbn=048623861X|location=New York|page=First movement, just before Allegro vivo|nopp=y|oclc=6414366}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses {{serif|'''''ffff'''''}} in passages of his ''[[1812 Overture]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/f/f1/IMSLP01078-Tchaikovsky_-_1812_Overture.pdf|title=P.I.

==History==
''On Music'', one of the ''[[Moralia]]'' attributed to the philosopher [[Plutarch]] in the first century AD, suggests that ancient Greek musical performance included dynamic transitions – though dynamics receive far less attention in the text than does [[rhythm]] or [[harmony]].

The [[renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[composer]] [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] was one of the first to indicate dynamics in [[music notation]], but dynamics were used sparingly by composers until the late 18th century. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] used some dynamic terms, including ''forte'', ''piano'', ''più piano'', and ''pianissimo'' (although written out as full words), and in some cases it may be that {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} was considered to mean ''pianissimo'' in this period.

The fact that the [[harpsichord]] could play only "terraced" dynamics (either loud or soft, but not in between), and the fact that composers of the period did not mark gradations of dynamics in their scores, has led to the "somewhat misleading suggestion that [[Baroque music|baroque]] dynamics are 'terraced dynamics'," writes [[Robert Donington]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Donington|Donington, Robert]]: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, baroque musicians constantly varied dynamics: in 1752, [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] wrote that "Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft."&lt;ref&gt;Donington, Robert: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the [[harpsichord]] in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture (four notes are louder than two). This allowed composers like J.S. Bach to build dynamics directly into their compositions, without the need for notation.

In the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]], composers greatly expanded the vocabulary for describing dynamic changes in their scores. Where [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] specified six levels ({{serif|'''''pp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}), [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] used also {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}} (the latter less frequently), and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] used a range of terms to describe the dynamics he wanted. In the slow movement of Brahms's [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|trio for violin, horn and piano (Opus 40)]], he uses the expressions {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, ''molto piano'', and ''[[quasi niente]]'' to express different qualities of quiet. Many Romantic and later composers added ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'' and ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', making for a total of ten levels between {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}.

== Relation to audio dynamics ==
The introduction of modern recording techniques has provided alternative ways to control the dynamics of music. [[Dynamic range compression]] is used to control the [[Dynamic range#Music|dynamic range]] of a recording, or a single instrument. This can affect loudness variations, both at the micro-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering Audio|last=Katz|first=Robert|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=0-240-80545-3|location=Amsterdam: Boston|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and macro scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/dynamic-range-loudness-war|title='Dynamic Range' &amp; The Loudness War|last=Deruty|first=Emmanuel|date=September 2011|work=Sound on Sound|access-date=2018-01-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many contexts, the meaning of the term ''dynamics'' is therefore not immediately clear. To distinguish between the different aspects of dynamics, the term ''performed dynamics'' can be used to refer to the aspects of music dynamics that is controlled exclusively by the performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elowsson|first=Anders|last2=Friberg|first2=Anders|date=|title=Predicting the perception of performed dynamics in music audio with ensemble learning|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/4106.pdf|journal=The Acoustical Society of America|volume=141 |issue=3|pages=2224–2242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VibratingGlassBeam.jpg|thumb|290px|right|This vibrating glass beam may be modeled as a cantilever beam with acceleration, variable linear density, variable section modulus, some kind of dissipation, springy end loading, and possibly a point mass at the free end.]]

'''Euler–Bernoulli beam theory''' (also known as '''engineer's beam theory''' or '''classical beam theory''')&lt;ref name=Timoshenko&gt;Timoshenko, S., (1953), ''History of strength of materials'', McGraw-Hill New York&lt;/ref&gt; is a simplification of the linear [[theory of elasticity]] which provides a means of calculating the load-carrying and [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] characteristics of [[Beam (structure)|beams]]. It covers the case for small deflections of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] that are subjected to lateral loads only. It is thus a special case of [[Timoshenko beam theory]]. It was first enunciated circa 1750,&lt;ref name=Truesdell&gt;Truesdell, C., (1960), ''The rational mechanics of flexible or elastic bodies 1638–1788'', Venditioni Exponunt Orell Fussli Turici.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not applied on a large scale until the development of the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Ferris wheel]] in the late 19th century. Following these successful demonstrations, it quickly became a cornerstone of engineering and an enabler of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].

Additional analysis tools have been developed such as [[plate theory]] and [[finite element analysis]], but the simplicity of beam theory makes it an important tool in the sciences, especially [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

[[File:Poutre definitions en.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of cross-section of a bent beam showing the neutral axis.]]
Prevailing consensus is that [[Galileo Galilei]] made the first attempts at developing a theory of beams, but recent studies argue that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was the first to make the crucial observations. Da Vinci lacked [[Hooke's law]] and [[calculus]] to complete the theory, whereas Galileo was held back by an incorrect assumption he made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Bernoulli beam is named after [[Jacob Bernoulli]], who made the significant discoveries.  [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]] were the first to put together a useful theory circa 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

At the time, science and [[engineering]] were generally seen as very distinct fields, and there was considerable doubt that a mathematical product of academia could be trusted for practical safety applications. Bridges and buildings continued to be designed by precedent until the late 19th century, when the [[Eiffel Tower]] and [[Ferris wheel]] demonstrated the validity of the theory on large scales.

== Static beam equation ==

The Euler–Bernoulli equation describes the relationship between the beam's [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] and the applied load:&lt;ref name=Gere&gt;Gere, J. M. and Timoshenko, S. P., 1997, ''Mechanics of Materials'', PWS Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\left(EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\right) = q\,&lt;/math&gt;

The curve &lt;math&gt;w(x)&lt;/math&gt; describes the deflection  of the beam in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction at some position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (recall that the beam is modeled as a one-dimensional object). &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a distributed load, in other words a force per unit length (analogous to [[pressure]] being a force per area); it may be a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, or other variables.

Note that &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elastic modulus]] and that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]] of the beam's cross-section. &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; must be calculated with respect to the axis which passes through the centroid of the cross-section and which is perpendicular to the applied loading.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;For an Euler–Bernoulli beam not under any axial loading this axis is called the [[neutral axis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly, for a beam whose axis is oriented along ''x'' with a loading along ''z'', the beam's cross-section is in the ''yz'' plane, and the relevant second moment of area is
:&lt;math&gt; I = \iint z^2\; dy\; dz,&lt;/math&gt;
where it is assumed that the centroid of the cross-section occurs at ''y''&amp;nbsp;= ''z''&amp;nbsp;= 0.

Often, the product ''EI'' (known as the [[flexural rigidity]]) is a constant, so that

:&lt;math&gt;EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} = q(x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation, describing the deflection of a uniform, static beam, is used widely in engineering practice.  Tabulated expressions for the deflection &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; for common beam configurations can be found in engineering handbooks.  For more complicated situations the deflection can be determined by solving the Euler–Bernoulli equation using techniques such as the "[[slope deflection method]]", "[[moment distribution method]]", "[[Moment-area theorem|moment area method]], "[[conjugate beam method]]", "[[virtual work|the principle of virtual work]]", "[[Direct integration of a beam|direct integration]]", "[[Castigliano's method]]", "[[Macaulay's method]]" or the "[[direct stiffness method]]".

Sign conventions are defined here since different conventions can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;  In this article, a [[Right-hand rule|right-handed]] coordinate system is used as shown in the figure, Bending of an Euler–Bernoulli beam.  In this figure, the x and z direction of a right-handed coordinate system are shown.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_z} \times \mathbf{e_x} =  \mathbf{e_y}  &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_y}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_z}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors in the direction of the x, y, and z axes respectively, the y axis direction is into the figure. Forces acting in the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; directions are assumed positive.  The sign of the bending moment &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is positive when the torque vector associated with the bending moment on the right hand side of the section is in the positive y direction (i.e. so that a positive value of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; leads to a compressive stress at the bottom fibers).  With this choice of bending moment sign convention, in order to have &lt;math&gt; dM = Qdx &lt;/math&gt;, it is necessary that &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; the shear force acting on the right side of the section be positive in the z direction so as to achieve static equilibrium of moments.  To have force equilibrium with &lt;math&gt; dQ = qdx &lt;/math&gt;, q, the loading intensity must be positive in the minus z direction.  In addition to these sign conventions for scalar quantities, we also sometimes use vectors in which the directions of the vectors is made clear through the use of the unit vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_y}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Successive derivatives of the deflection ''w'' have important physical meanings: d''w''/d''x'' is the slope of the beam,
:&lt;math&gt; M = -EI \frac{d^2w}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[bending moment]] in the beam, and
:&lt;math&gt;Q = -\frac{d}{d x}\left(EI\frac{d^2 w}{d x^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Shearing (physics)|shear force]] in the beam.
[[File:Euler-Bernoulli beam theory-2.svg|thumb|350px|Bending of an Euler–Bernoulli beam. Each cross-section of the beam is at 90 degrees to the neutral axis.]]
The stresses in a beam can be calculated from the above expressions after the deflection due to a given load has been determined.

=== Derivation of bending moment equation ===

Because of the fundamental importance of the bending moment equation in engineering, we will provide a short derivation.  The length of the neutral axis in the figure is &lt;math&gt;\rho d \theta.&lt;/math&gt; The length of a fiber with a radial distance, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, below the neutral axis is  &lt;math&gt;(\rho + e)d \theta.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, the strain of this fiber is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {\left(\rho + e - \rho \right ) \ d \theta} {\rho \ d \theta} = \frac {e} {\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;

The stress of this fiber is &lt;math&gt; E\tfrac {e} {\rho}&lt;/math&gt; where E is the [[elastic modulus]] in accordance with [[Hooke's Law]].  The differential force vector, &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt; resulting from this stress is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{F} = E \frac{e}{\rho} dA \mathbf{e_x}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the differential force vector exerted on the right hand side of the section shown in the figure.  We know that it is in the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_x}&lt;/math&gt; direction since the figure clearly shows that the fibers in the lower half are in tension. &lt;math&gt;dA&lt;/math&gt; is the differential element of area at the location of the fiber. The differential bending moment vector, &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{M} &lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{M} = -e\mathbf{e_z} \times  d\mathbf{F} = -\mathbf{e_y} E \frac {e^2} {\rho} dA. &lt;/math&gt;

This expression is valid for the fibers in the lower half of the beam. The expression for the fibers in the upper half of the beam will be similar except that the moment arm vector will be in the positive z direction and the force vector will be in the -x direction since the upper fibers are in compression.  But the resulting bending moment vector will still be in the -y direction since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e_z} \times -\mathbf{e_x} =  -\mathbf{e_y}.&lt;/math&gt;  Therefore, we integrate over the entire cross section of the beam and get for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; the bending moment vector exerted on the right cross section of the beam the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} =\int d\mathbf{M} = -\mathbf{e_y} \frac {E} {\rho} \int {e^2} \ dA = -\mathbf{e_y} \frac {EI} {\rho},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]]. From calculus, we know that when &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dw}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is small as it is for an Euler–Bernoulli beam, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\rho} = \tfrac{d^2w}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius of curvature]]).  Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = -\mathbf{e_y} EI {d^2w \over dx^2} &lt;/math&gt;

== Dynamic beam equation ==
[[File:Beam mode 6.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[Finite element method]] model of a vibration of a wide-flange beam ([[I-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]]).]]
The dynamic beam equation is the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] for the  following action
:&lt;math&gt;
  S = \int_0^L \left[ \frac{1}{2} \mu \left( \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} EI \left( \frac{ \partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} \right)^2 + q(x) w(x,t)\right] dx.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first term represents the kinetic energy where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mass per unit length; the second one represents the potential energy due to internal forces (when considered with a negative sign) and the third term represents the potential energy due to the external load &lt;math&gt; q(x) &lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] is used to determine the function that minimizes the functional &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  For a dynamic Euler–Bernoulli beam, the Euler–Lagrange equation is
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:300px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\partial^2 }{\partial x^2}\left(EI\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\right) = - \mu\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} + q(x)
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of Euler–Lagrange equation for beams
|-
|Since the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathcal{L} := \tfrac{1}{2} \mu \left( \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} \right)^2 - \tfrac{1}{2} EI \left( \frac{ \partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} \right)^2 + q(x) w(x,t) = \tfrac{\mu}{2}\dot{w}^2 - \tfrac{EI}{2}w_{xx}^2 + qw \equiv \mathcal{L}(x, t, w, \dot{w}, w_{xx})
 &lt;/math&gt;
the corresponding [[Euler–Lagrange equation#Single function of two variables with higher derivatives|Euler–Lagrange equation]] is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial w} - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{w}}\right)  + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{xx}}\right) = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial w} = q ~;~~ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{w}} = \mu\dot{w}
   ~;~~ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{xx}} = -EI w_{xx} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Plugging into the Euler–Lagrange equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   q - \mu\ddot{w} - (EI w_{xx})_{xx} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\partial^2 }{\partial x^2}\left(EI\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\right) = - \mu\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} + q
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
which is the governing equation for the dynamics of an Euler–Bernoulli beam.
|}
When the beam is homogeneous, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are independent of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the beam equation is simpler:
:&lt;math&gt;
  EI\cfrac{\partial^4 w}{\partial x^4} = - \mu\cfrac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} + q \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Free vibration ===
In the absence of a transverse load, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, we have the '''free vibration''' equation.  This equation can be solved using a Fourier decomposition of the displacement into the sum of harmonic vibrations of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   w(x,t) = \text{Re}[\hat{w}(x)~e^{-i\omega t}]
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of vibration.  Then, for each value of frequency, we can solve an ordinary differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;
   EI~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 \hat{w}}{\mathrm{d}x^4} + \mu\omega^2\hat{w} = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The general solution of the above equation is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{w} = A_1\cosh(\beta x) + A_2\sinh(\beta x) + A_3\cos(\beta x) + A_4\sin(\beta x) \quad \text{with} \quad \beta := \left(\frac{\mu\omega^2}{EI}\right)^{1/4}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4&lt;/math&gt; are constants.  These constants are unique for a given set of boundary conditions.  However, the solution for the displacement is not unique and depends on the frequency.  These solutions are typically written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{w}_n = A_1\cosh(\beta_n x) + A_2\sinh(\beta_n x) + A_3\cos(\beta_n x) + A_4\sin(\beta_n x) \quad \text{with} \quad \beta_n := \left(\frac{\mu\omega_n^2}{EI}\right)^{1/4}\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The quantities &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''natural frequencies''' of the beam.  Each of the displacement solutions is called a '''mode''' and the shape of the displacement curve is called the '''mode shape'''.

==== Example: Cantilevered beam ====
[[File:BeamVibrationPlot.svg|thumb|400px|right|Mode shapes for the first four modes of a vibrating cantilever beam.]]
The boundary conditions for a cantilevered beam of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (fixed at &lt;math&gt; x = 0&lt;/math&gt;) are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   &amp;\hat{w}_n = 0 ~,~~ \frac{d\hat{w}_n}{dx} = 0 \quad \text{at} ~~ x = 0 \\
   &amp;\frac{d^2\hat{w}_n}{dx^2} = 0 ~,~~ \frac{d^3\hat{w}_n}{dx^3} = 0 \quad \text{at} ~~ x = L \,.
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we apply these conditions, non-trivial solutions are found to exist only if
&lt;math&gt;
   \cosh(\beta_n L)\,\cos(\beta_n L) + 1 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
This nonlinear equation can be solved numerically. The first few roots are ''β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 0.59686..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 1.49418..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 2.50025..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 3.49999..., ...

The corresponding natural frequencies of vibration are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_1 = \beta_1^2 \sqrt{\frac{EI}{\mu}} = \frac{3.5161}{L^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{\mu}} ~,~~ \dots
&lt;/math&gt;
The boundary conditions can also be used to determine the mode shapes from the solution for the displacement:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \hat{w}_n = A_1 \Bigl[(\cosh\beta_n x - \cos\beta_n x) +
      \frac{\cos\beta_n L + \cosh\beta_n L}{\sin\beta_n L + \sinh\beta_n L}(\sin\beta_n x - \sinh\beta_n x)\Bigr]
 &lt;/math&gt;
The unknown constant (actually constants as there is one for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, which in general is complex, is determined by the initial conditions at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; on the velocity and displacements of the beam. Typically a value of &lt;math&gt;A_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; is used when plotting mode shapes.  Solutions to the undampened forced problem have unbounded displacements when the driving frequency matches a natural frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the beam can '''resonate'''.  The natural frequencies of a beam therefore correspond to the frequencies at which '''resonance''' can occur.

==== Example: unsupported (free-free) beam ====

[[File:FreeBeamVibrationPlot.svg|thumb|400px|The first four modes of a vibrating free-free Euler-Bernoulli beam.]]

A free-free beam is a beam without any supports.&lt;ref name="???"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys1240/phys1240_fa15/homelabs/Beam_vibration_Mauro%20Caresta_UNSW.pdf |title=Vibrations of a Free-Free Beam |last1=Caresta |first1=Mauro |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary conditions for a free beam of length ''L'' extending from ''x''=0 to ''x''=L is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2\hat{w}_n}{dx^2} = 0 ~,~~ \frac{d^3\hat{w}_n}{dx^3} = 0 \quad \text{at} ~~ x = 0  \,\text{and} \, L \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
If we apply these conditions, non-trivial solutions are found to exist only if
&lt;math&gt;
   \cosh(\beta_n L)\,\cos(\beta_n L) - 1 = 0 \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

This nonlinear equation can be solved numerically. The first few roots are ''β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 1.50562..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 2.49975..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 3.50001..., ''β&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; L/π'' = 4.50000...

The corresponding natural frequencies of vibration are:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_1 = \beta_1^2 \sqrt{\frac{EI}{\mu}} = \frac{22.3733}{L^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{\mu}} ~,~~ \dots
&lt;/math&gt;
The boundary conditions can also be used to determine the mode shapes from the solution for the displacement:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \hat{w}_n = A_1 \Bigl[  (\sin\beta_n x+\sinh\beta_n x )-
      \frac{\sin\beta_n L - \sinh\beta_n L}{\cos\beta_n L - \cosh\beta_n L}(\cos\beta_n x + \cosh\beta_n x)\Bigr]
 &lt;/math&gt;
As with the cantilevered beam, the unknown constants are determined by the initial conditions at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; on the velocity and displacements of the beam. Also, solutions to the undampened forced problem have unbounded displacements when the driving frequency matches a natural frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Stress ==
Besides deflection, the beam equation describes [[force]]s and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] and can thus be used to describe [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]]. For this reason, the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation is widely used in [[engineering]], especially civil and mechanical, to determine the strength (as well as deflection) of beams under bending.

Both the [[bending moment]] and the [[shear force]] cause stresses in the beam. The stress due to shear force is maximum along the [[neutral axis]] of the beam (when the width of the beam, t, is constant along the cross section of the beam; otherwise an integral involving the first moment and the beam's width needs to be evaluated for the particular cross section), and the maximum tensile stress is at either the top or bottom surfaces. Thus the maximum [[principal stress]] in the beam may be neither at the surface nor at the center but in some general area. However, shear force stresses are negligible in comparison to bending moment stresses in all but the stockiest of beams as well as the fact that [[stress concentration]]s commonly occur at surfaces, meaning that the maximum stress in a beam is likely to be at the surface.

=== Simple or symmetrical bending ===
[[File:BeamBendingUpdated.svg|thumb|350px|Element of a bent beam: the fibers form concentric arcs, the top fibers are compressed and bottom fibers stretched.]]
For beam cross-sections that are symmetrical about a plane perpendicular to the neutral plane, it can be shown that the tensile stress experienced by the beam may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{Mz}{I} = -zE ~ \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the neutral axis to a point of interest; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the bending moment. Note that this equation implies that [[pure bending]] (of positive sign) will cause zero stress at the neutral axis, positive (tensile) stress at the "top" of the beam, and negative (compressive) stress at the bottom of the beam; and also implies that the maximum stress will be at the top surface and the minimum at the bottom. This bending stress may be superimposed with axially applied stresses, which will cause a shift in the neutral (zero stress) axis.

=== Maximum stresses at a cross-section ===
[[File:SectionModulusOfBeam.svg|thumb|220px|Quantities used in the definition of the section modulus of a beam.]]
The maximum tensile stress at a cross-section is at the location &lt;math&gt;z = c_1&lt;/math&gt; and the maximum compressive stress is at the location &lt;math&gt;z = -c_2&lt;/math&gt; where the height of the cross-section is &lt;math&gt; h = c_1 + c_2 &lt;/math&gt;.  These stresses are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_1 = \cfrac{Mc_1}{I} = \cfrac{M}{S_1} ~;~~ \sigma_2 = -\cfrac{Mc_2}{I} = -\cfrac{M}{S_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The quantities &lt;math&gt;S_1,S_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[section modulus|section moduli]]&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt; and are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   S_1 = \cfrac{I}{c_1} ~;~~ S_2 = \cfrac{I}{c_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The section modulus combines all the important geometric information about a beam's section into one quantity.  For the case where a beam is doubly symmetric, &lt;math&gt;c_1 = c_2&lt;/math&gt; and we have one section modulus &lt;math&gt;S = I/c&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Strain in an Euler–Bernoulli beam ===&lt;!-- It's pronounced "oiler"; DO NOT write "a Euler"; it's "an Euler". --&gt;
We need an expression for the [[infinitesimal strain theory|strain]] in terms of the deflection of the neutral surface to relate the stresses in an Euler–Bernoulli beam to the deflection.  To obtain that expression we use the assumption that normals to the neutral surface remain normal during the deformation and that deflections are small.  These assumptions imply that the beam bends into an arc of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (see Figure 1) and that the neutral surface does not change in length during the deformation.&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt; be the length of an element of the neutral surface in the undeformed state.  For small deflections, the element does not change its length after bending but deforms into an arc of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle subtended by this arc, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x = \rho~\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us now consider another segment of the element at a distance &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; above the neutral surface. The initial length of this element is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;.  However, after bending, the length of the element becomes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x' = (\rho-z)~\mathrm{d}\theta = \mathrm{d}x - z~\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  The strain in that segment of the beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \varepsilon_x = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}x'-\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}x} = -\cfrac{z}{\rho} = -\kappa~z
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[curvature]] of the beam.  This gives us the axial strain in the beam as a function of distance from the neutral surface.  However, we still need to find a relation between the radius of curvature and the beam deflection &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Relation between curvature and beam deflection ===
Let P be a point on the neutral surface of the beam at a distance &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from the origin of the &lt;math&gt;(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system.  The slope of the beam is approximately equal to the angle made by the neutral surface with the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis for the small angles encountered in beam theory.  Therefore, with this approximation,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \theta(x) = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, for an infinitesimal element &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;, the relation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x = \rho~\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \cfrac{1}{\rho} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}x} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = \kappa
 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence the strain in the beam may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{x} = -z\kappa
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Stress-strain relations ===
For a homogeneous [[isotropy|isotropic]] [[linear elasticity|linear elastic]] material, the stress is related to the strain by &lt;math&gt;\sigma = E\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Young's modulus]].  Hence the stress in an Euler–Bernoulli beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_x = -zE\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Note that the above relation, when compared with the relation between the axial stress and the bending moment, leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = -EI\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since the shear force is given by &lt;math&gt;Q = \mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;, we also have
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q = -EI\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3w}{\mathrm{d}x^3}
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Boundary considerations ==
The beam equation contains a fourth-order derivative in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  To find a unique solution &lt;math&gt;w(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; we need four boundary conditions.  The boundary conditions usually model ''supports'', but they can also model point loads, distributed loads and moments.  The ''support'' or displacement boundary conditions are used to fix values of displacement (&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;) and rotations (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}w/\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;) on the boundary.  Such boundary conditions are also called [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]].  Load and moment boundary conditions involve higher derivatives of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and represent [[flux|momentum flux]].  Flux boundary conditions are also called [[Neumann boundary condition]]s.

As an example consider a [[cantilever]] beam that is built-in at one end and free at the other as shown in the adjacent figure.  At the built-in end of the beam there cannot be any displacement or rotation of the beam.  This means that at the left end both deflection and slope are zero.  Since no external bending moment is applied at the free end of the beam, the bending moment at that location is zero.  In addition, if there is no external force applied to the beam, the shear force at the free end is also zero.

Taking the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of the left end as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and the right end as &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (the length of the beam), these statements translate to the following set of boundary conditions (assume &lt;math&gt;EI&lt;/math&gt; is a constant):

:&lt;math&gt;w|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad ; \quad \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\bigg|_{x = 0} = 0 \qquad \mbox{(fixed end)}\,&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Cantilever Beam.svg|thumb|400px|right|A cantilever beam.]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\bigg|_{x = L} = 0 \quad ; \quad \frac{\partial^3 w}{\partial x^3}\bigg|_{x = L} = 0 \qquad \mbox{(free end)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

A simple support (pin or roller) is equivalent to a point force on the beam which is adjusted in such a way as to fix the position of the beam at that point. A fixed support or clamp, is equivalent to the combination of a point force and a point torque which is adjusted in such a way as to fix both the position and slope of the beam at that point. Point forces and torques, whether from supports or directly applied, will divide a beam into a set of segments, between which the beam equation will yield a continuous solution, given four boundary conditions, two at each end of the segment. Assuming that the product ''EI'' is a constant, and defining &lt;math&gt;\lambda=F/EI&lt;/math&gt; where ''F'' is the magnitude of a point force, and &lt;math&gt;\tau=M/EI&lt;/math&gt; where ''M'' is the magnitude of a point torque, the boundary conditions appropriate for some common cases is given in the table below. The change in a particular derivative of ''w'' across the boundary as ''x'' increases is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; followed by that derivative. For example, &lt;math&gt;\Delta w''=w''(x+)-w''(x-)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;w''(x+)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;w''&lt;/math&gt; at the lower boundary of the upper segment, while &lt;math&gt;w''(x-)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of &lt;math&gt;w''&lt;/math&gt; at the upper boundary of the lower segment. When the values of the particular derivative are not only continuous across the boundary, but fixed as well, the boundary condition is written e.g., &lt;math&gt;\Delta w''=0^*&lt;/math&gt; which actually constitutes two separate equations (e.g., &lt;math&gt;w''(x-) = w''(x+)&lt;/math&gt; = fixed).

Note that in the first cases, in which the point forces and torques are located between two segments, there are four boundary conditions, two for the lower segment, and two for the upper. When forces and torques are applied to one end of the beam, there are two boundary conditions given which apply at that end. The sign of the point forces and torques at an end will be positive for the lower end, negative for the upper end.

== Loading considerations ==
Applied loads may be represented either through boundary conditions or through the function &lt;math&gt;q(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; which represents an external distributed load. Using distributed loading is often favorable for simplicity. Boundary conditions are, however, often used to model loads depending on context; this practice being especially common in vibration analysis.

By nature, the distributed load is very often represented in a piecewise manner, since in practice a load isn't typically a continuous function. Point loads can be modeled with help of the [[Dirac delta function]]. For example, consider a static uniform cantilever beam of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with an upward point load &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; applied at the free end. Using boundary conditions, this may be modeled in two ways.  In the first approach, the applied point load is approximated by a shear force applied at the free end.  In that case the governing equation and boundary conditions are:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  &amp; EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} = 0 \\
  &amp; w|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad ; \quad \frac{\mathrm{d} w}{\mathrm{d} x}\bigg|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad ; \quad
  \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\bigg|_{x = L} = 0 \quad ; \quad -EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^3 w}{\mathrm{d} x^3}\bigg|_{x = L} = F\,
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively we can represent the point load as a distribution using the Dirac function.  In that case the equation and boundary conditions are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  &amp; EI \frac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} = F \delta(x - L) \\
  &amp; w|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad ; \quad \frac{\mathrm{d} w}{\mathrm{d} x}\bigg|_{x = 0} = 0 \quad; \quad
  \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\bigg|_{x = L} = 0\,
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that shear force boundary condition (third derivative) is removed, otherwise there would be a contradiction. These are equivalent [[boundary value problem]]s, and both yield the solution

:&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{F}{6 EI}(3 L x^2 - x^3)\,~.&lt;/math&gt;

The application of several point loads at different locations will lead to &lt;math&gt;w(x)&lt;/math&gt; being a piecewise function. Use of the Dirac function greatly simplifies such situations; otherwise the beam would have to be divided into sections, each with four boundary conditions solved separately. A well organized family of functions called [[Singularity function]]s are often used as a shorthand for the Dirac function, its [[derivative]], and its [[antiderivatives]].

Dynamic phenomena can also be modeled using the static beam equation by choosing appropriate forms of the load distribution. As an example, the free [[vibration]] of a beam can be accounted for by using the load function:

:&lt;math&gt;q(x, t) = \mu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[linear mass density]] of the beam, not necessarily a constant. With this time-dependent loading, the beam equation will be a [[partial differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \left( EI \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} \right) = -\mu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another interesting example describes the deflection of a beam rotating with a constant [[angular frequency]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;q(x) = \mu \omega^2 w(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[centripetal force]] distribution. Note that in this case, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the displacement (the dependent variable), and the beam equation will be an autonomous [[ordinary differential equation]].

== Examples ==

=== Three-point bending ===
The [[three point flexural test|three point bending test]] is a classical experiment in mechanics. It represents the case of a beam resting on two roller supports and subjected to a concentrated load applied in the middle of the beam.  The shear is constant in absolute value: it is half the central load, P / 2. It changes sign in the middle of the beam. The bending moment varies linearly from one end, where it is 0, and the center where its absolute value is PL / 4, is where the risk of rupture is the most important.
The deformation of the beam is described by a polynomial of third degree over a half beam (the other half being symmetrical).

Solutions for several other commonly encountered configurations are readily available in textbooks on mechanics of materials and engineering handbooks.

=== Statically indeterminate beams ===
The [[bending moment]]s and [[shear force]]s in Euler–Bernoulli beams can often be determined directly using static balance of [[force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moments]].  However, for certain boundary conditions, the number of reactions can exceed the number of independent equilibrium equations.&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;  Such beams are called ''[[statically indeterminate]]''.

The built-in beams shown in the figure below are statically indeterminate.  To determine the stresses and deflections of such beams, the most direct method is to solve the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation with appropriate boundary conditions.  But direct analytical solutions of the beam equation are possible only for the simplest cases.  Therefore, additional techniques such as linear superposition are often used to solve statically indeterminate beam problems.

The superposition method involves adding the solutions of a number of statically determinate problems which are chosen such that the boundary conditions for the sum of the individual problems add up to those of the original problem.

|}

Another commonly encountered statically indeterminate beam problem is the [[cantilever|cantilevered beam]] with the free end supported on a roller.&lt;ref name=Gere /&gt;  The bending moments, shear forces, and deflections of such a beam are listed below.

== Extensions ==

The kinematic assumptions upon which the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory is founded allow it to be extended to more advanced analysis.  Simple superposition allows for three-dimensional transverse loading.  Using alternative [[constitutive equation]]s can allow for [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] or [[plastic bending|plastic]] beam deformation.  Euler–Bernoulli beam theory can also be extended to the analysis of curved beams, [[Buckling|beam buckling]], composite beams, and geometrically nonlinear beam deflection.

Euler–Bernoulli beam theory does not account for the effects of transverse [[Shear stress|shear]] strain.  As a result, it underpredicts deflections and overpredicts natural frequencies.  For thin beams (beam length to thickness ratios of the order 20 or more) these effects are of minor importance.  For thick beams, however, these effects can be significant.  More advanced beam theories such as the [[Timoshenko beam theory]] (developed by the Russian-born scientist [[Stephen Timoshenko]]) have been developed to account for these effects.

=== Large deflections ===
[[File:EulerBernoulliBeam.png|right|thumb|400px|Euler–Bernoulli beam]]
The original Euler–Bernoulli theory is valid only for [[infinitesimal strain theory|infinitesimal strains]] and small rotations.  The theory can be extended in a straightforward manner to problems involving moderately large rotations provided that the strain remains small by using the [[Theodore von Kármán|von Kármán]] strains.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;Reddy, J. N., (2007), ''Nonlinear finite element analysis'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Euler–Bernoulli hypotheses that plane sections remain plane and normal to the axis of the beam lead to displacements of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
v_1 = v_0(x) - z \cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x} ~;~~v_2 = 0 ~;~~ v_3 = w_0(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the definition of the Lagrangian Green strain from [[finite strain theory]], we can find the ''von Karman strains'' for the beam that are valid for large rotations but small strains.  These strains have the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}u_0}{dx_1} - x_3\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1^2} +
\frac{1}{2}\left[
\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}u_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}-x_3\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1^2}\right)^2 +
 \left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}\right)^2\right] \\
\varepsilon_{22} &amp; = 0 \\
\varepsilon_{33} &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}\right)^2 \\
\varepsilon_{23} &amp; = 0 \\
\varepsilon_{31} &amp; =
\frac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}-\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}\right) -
 \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}u_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}-x_3\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1^2}\right)
 \left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x_1}\right)\right] \\
\varepsilon_{12} &amp; = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
From the [[principle of virtual work]], the balance of forces and moments in the beams gives us the equilibrium equations
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\cfrac{\mathrm{d}N_{xx}}{\mathrm{d}x} + f(x) &amp; = 0 \\
\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2M_{xx}}{\mathrm{d}x^2} + q(x) +
 \cfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(N_{xx}\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x}\right) &amp; = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the axial load, &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the transverse load, and
:&lt;math&gt;
N_{xx} = \int_A \sigma_{xx}~ \mathrm{d}A  ~;~~ M_{xx}  = \int_A z\sigma_{xx}~ \mathrm{d}A
&lt;/math&gt;
To close the system of equations we need the [[constitutive equations]] that relate stresses to strains (and hence stresses to displacements).  For large rotations and small strains these relations are
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
N_{xx} &amp; =
 A_{xx}\left[\cfrac{\mathrm{d}u_0}{dx} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)^2 \right] -
 B_{xx}\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x^2} \\
M_{xx} &amp; =
 B_{xx}\left[\cfrac{du_0}{\mathrm{d}x} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_0}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)^2 \right] -
 D_{xx}\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2w_0}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{xx}  = \int_A E~\mathrm{d}A ~;~~ B_{xx}  = \int_A zE~\mathrm{d}A ~;~~ D_{xx}  = \int_A z^2E~\mathrm{d}A ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The quantity &lt;math&gt;A_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[stiffness|extensional stiffness]]'',&lt;math&gt;B_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; is the coupled ''extensional-bending stiffness'', and &lt;math&gt;D_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[bending stiffness]]''.

For the situation where the beam has a uniform cross-section and no axial load, the governing equation for a large-rotation Euler–Bernoulli beam is
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:400px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   EI~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d}x^4} - \frac{3}{2}~EA~\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w}{\mathrm{d}x}\right)^2\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d}x^2}\right) = q(x)
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[scientific research]], an '''experimental system'''  is the physical, technical and procedural basis for an [[experiment]] or series of experiments.  Historian of science [[Hans-Jörg Rheinberger]] defines an experimental system as: "A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] aspects."&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scientists]] (particularly laboratory biologists) and [[historians]] and [[philosophers]] of [[biology]] have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular [[model organism]] or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century.  The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results.  In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be "[[black-boxed]]" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems.  Rheinberger divides experimental systems into two parts: the part under investigation ("epistemic things") and the well-understood part that provides a stable context for experimentation ("technical objects").&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 24-31. Note that the translation from German language introduces an ambiguity, or a possible misunderstanding. The meaning of ''Experimentalsystem'', referring to a system that is the site for experiments, whereas an ''experimentelles System'' is a system that is unfinished and under experimental investigation. Rheinberger uses the former term.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of experimental systems in biology often requires the "[[domestication]]" of a particular organism for the laboratory environment, including the creation of relatively homogeneous lines or [[Strain (biology)|strains]] and the tailoring of conditions to highlight the variable aspects that scientists are interested in.&lt;ref&gt;See Kohler, ''Lords of the Fly''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific technologies, similarly, often require the development of a full experimental system to go from a viable concept to a technique that works in practice on a usefully consistent basis.  For example, the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is generally attributed to [[Kary Mullis]], who came up with the concept in 1983, but the process of development of PCR into the revolutionary technology it became by the early 1990s took years of work by others at [[Cetus Corporation]]&amp;mdash;and the basic components of the system had been known since the 1960s DNA synthesis work of [[Har Gobind Khorana]]&amp;mdash;making "who invented PCR?" a complicated question.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, ''Making PCR'', pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[real estate development]] at the '''graduate school''' level has taken many forms, giving rise to various educational models in different countries. The decision for individuals pursuing higher education in this field often comes down to choosing between a traditional degree with a focus on [[real estate]] (e.g., [[MBA]] with concentration in real estate) or an interdisciplinary, comprehensive degree (e.g., [[Master of Real Estate Development]]) focused wholly on real estate studies.

Students who opt to study in a full-time Master of Real Estate program, should expect to take courses in topics such as financial analysis, market analysis, contracts and deal-making, construction, design fundamentals,  asset (property) management, construction management, building technology and design fundamentals.  Some programs offer studio, capstone, or workshop courses in which students engage actual real estate development projects. Some also provide access to internships. There is no established accreditation system in the United States in real estate development education, so students should investigate offerings in each program.

While there are many real estate ''finance'' programs available to students around the country, there are only a handful of real estate '''''development''''' graduate programs that tackle the broader educational task of engaging the full range of '''real estate development''' (e.g., Master of Real Estate Development) --from property acquisition to planning and permitting, law and finance, design and construction, and culminating in marketing, commercial leasing, property, portfolio and asset management.

==History==
Historically, graduate level coursework in real estate was limited to a major or minor in business, or training in architecture and urban planning schools. While [[Business school]] programs might emphasize the business side of real estate, MBA students typically lack adequate understanding of real estate principles and processes. Over the last several decades, the real estate industry has matured to one with great complexity and an increasingly institutional ownership structure. The increased complexity of the industry created a demand for practitioners who possessed a comprehensive knowledge of real estate beyond that of traditional MBA generalists. One and two-year graduate level real estate degree programs originated with the founding of the [[New York University]] Real Estate Institute in (1967)&lt;ref name="History and Mission of NYU Schack "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scps.nyu.edu/academics/departments/schack/about/history.html| title= History and Mission | publisher= New York University | accessdate=2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate) and in 1983 with the formation of the [[MIT]] [http://mitcre.mit.edu/ Center for Real Estate]. Soon after, other schools followed with [[Harvard University]] (1983) [[Texas A&amp;M University]] (1984), [[Columbia University]] (1985), the [[University of Southern California]] (1986), [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1989), and [[Cornell University]] (1996) all forming professional graduate programs focused solely on real estate education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

According to the [[Urban Land Institute]], during the mid-1990s strong academic interest in real estate "was never greater, whether for repositioning products, redeveloping inner cities, or developing more affordable housing. Students seemed to be acting on the notion that it's a temporary downturn and graduate school is a good place for the moment."&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, Teaching Real Estate Today, April 1992, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  As enrollment grew, real estate programs responded by adding more course offerings to satisfy the demand..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the early 2000s, prior to the [[Great Recession]], the industry again acknowledged increasing need for graduates with superior qualifications — providing the research-based expertise necessary to solve complex problems in contemporary real estate development..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The late 2000s saw significant expansion of real estate programs to second-tier universities such as [[George Mason University]], as well as additional coursework added by [[MBA]] programs that commonly did not have an emphasis on real estate. To deal with the complexity of the field and its far-reaching effects, today's industry professionals require advanced training to prepare them to operate in increasingly technical and interrelated areas..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

As education needs have changed, business schools such as the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[University of California, Berkeley]] continue to cater to students interested in the flexibility of an MBA. Wharton's real estate program, for example, takes advantage of being housed in one of the top business schools in the United States and having some of the top real estate professionals in the world as advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, October 1991, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate-level education rankings in the US==
Rankings for graduate level education are not specifically formal as other professional disciplines. [[MBA]] programs with concentrations in real estate may be ranked according to organizations such as ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' or ''[[Business Week]]'', but are not relative to the depth of the real estate industry studied in an MBA concentration compared with a specialized master's degree in real estate or real estate development. Real estate education has increased in recent years to fill the demand for well-educated practitioners in the industry. However, there has been a great deal of debate on what elements should be an essential part of a graduate program in order to help students succeed in the industry. Rankings have been conducted by editorial board representation of faculty members at university real estate departments, however, these results prove to be ineffective in judging the program as a whole. Many graduate programs utilize adjunct professors or guest speakers from the industry, which do not sit on editorial boards of scholarly real estate journals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Currently there are no rankings of graduate degree programs in real estate development. The best method to evaluate the various degree programs is through due diligence by individual applicants, including a review of each program's curriculum and how it applies to the students academic and career goals. While there are no formal rankings for graduate real estate education, and programs are subject to greater locational impact factors than are MBA programs (due to regional and local policy influence).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ULI Hines Student Competition===

A separate metric to evaluate the success of graduate real estate programs is the review of past winners in the [[Urban Land Institute]] [[Gerald D. Hines]] Student Competition. The Urban Land Institute is a non-profit research and education organization with membership by real estate developers, urban planners, architects and allied professionals. Each year graduate-level students form their own multidisciplinary teams (from real estate, urban planning and business schools) and have two weeks to devise a comprehensive design and development program for a real, large-scale site full of challenges and opportunities. Submissions will consist of boards that include drawings, site plans, tables, and a myriad of market-feasible financial data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uli.org/programs/awards-competitions/hines-student-design-competition/about-the-competition/ |title=Gerald D. Hines Student Urban Design Competition &amp;#124; Urban Land Institute |publisher=Udcompetition.org |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams are not limited to including students from [[real estate development]] graduate programs. Students may also come from [[Master of Landscape Architecture]], [[Master of Architecture]], [[Master of Urban Planning]], [[Master of Urban Design]] or [[MBA]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ARGUS Software University Challenge===
An additional measure of the reputations of graduate real estate programs is the ARGUS Software University Challenge, which has been held in 2009, 2011 and every year thereafter. In the challenge, participating teams from universities around the world are required to simulate a comprehensive real-life development analysis of a fictitious [[commercial real estate]] project by modeling the provided assumptions specifically using ARGUS software. Team submissions are judged by a panel of industry and academic professionals. The winning teams receive cash prizes.

===Kellogg Real Estate Venture Competition===

The Kellogg Real Estate Conference and Venture Competition is hosted by the Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research and the Kellogg Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative.  The Conference will provide industry and research updates and relevant market information.  The Venture Competition showcases MBA students, who have the opportunity to pitch to a high-profile panel of judges. The winning team not only receives $100,000 in cash and prizes, but also the opportunity to secure as much as $10,000,000 in equity funding. The primary purpose of the competition is to encourage entrepreneurial real estate ventures. The event also serves as an opportunity to promote top student talent before prominent industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/departments/real-estate/events-activities/real-estate-venture-competition/previous.aspx/|title=Previous Competitions - Kellogg School of Management - Northwestern University|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Real Estate Challenge ===
The National Real Estate Challenge, a 20 team invitation-only real estate case competition hosted annually by the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, is yet another metric to compare graduate real estate programs. The competition tests teams from universities across the United States on issues regarding real estate finance and private equity. The event is sponsored by firms such as [[JP Morgan]], [[Equity Office Properties]], and Hines. The 19 universities that competed in 2014 included: Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, Michigan, MIT, Northwestern, NYU, Rice, UCLA, UNC-Chapel Hill, USC, UT, Vanderbilt, Wharton, Wisconsin and Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Centers/REFIC/Real-Estate-Challenge.aspx |title=National Real Estate Challenge |publisher=mccombs.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The CASE at MIT ===
Arguably the most prestigious competition to gauge the quality of graduate real estate programs in the world, the CASE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu/s/1314/clubs-classes-interior.aspx?sid=1314&amp;gid=175&amp;pgid=3053 |title=The CASE - MIT Center for Real Estate Alumni Association |publisher=aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual real estate competition that provides current graduate student teams from the world's top universities an opportunity to compete against one another, showcase their knowledge, and learn from each other through the analysis of a complex real world development site. The CASE is organized and hosted by the Alumni Association of the MIT Center for Real Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitcre.mit.edu |title=MIT Center for Real Estate |publisher=mitcre.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other master's degree competitions, The CASE focuses on real estate acquisition, development programming and financial underwriting at the asset level. The competition mimics the professional circumstances and assignments that students interested in real estate finance, acquisitions and development are likely to encounter after graduation. Past finalists included: Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia, Yale, NYU, MIT, Cornell, Wharton at UPenn, London Business School, Cambridge and Hong Kong Institute of Technology.

==Undergraduate real estate education==
As with many [[MBA]] programs, undergraduate real estate education is commonly offered as a concentration, or focused area of study. Very few universities with varying academic reputation offer a bachelor's degree with a concentration in real estate (typically two courses during the senior year). An undergraduate degree in real estate is not a prerequisite for admission to a graduate real estate development program. Students from diverse backgrounds in [[geography]], [[urban planning]], business, economics, [[liberal arts]], architecture or seeking a career change are encouraged to apply.

{{See also| Undergraduate real estate programs}}

==Graduate real estate programs==
There are twenty-one multi-disciplinary real estate programs which focus on the academic study of real estate primarily, the '''Master of Real Estate Development''', while the majority of the other programs typically housed as part of a business school offer a more focused degree on finance and investment. Graduate real estate programs may award any number of degrees (e.g. [[Master of Real Estate Development]], [[Master of Science in Real Estate]], [[Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate]], Master of Design Studies in Real Estate), however, the key is to review each degree curricula independent of their respective naming conventions, as there are broad differences in their content and foci that may not necessarily be reflected in the degree's name.

Two examples of graduate real estate degree naming conventions include:

===Master in Real Estate Development (MRED or MSRED)===
The Master of Real Estate Development degree (MRED) (or sometimes called the Master of Science in Real Estate Development (MSRED)) largely focuses on specific areas within real estate rather than taking a more generalist approach. Areas of concentration may include: [[real estate development]], [[finance]] and [[investment]], [[planning]] and [[policy]], [[infrastructure]] and [[construction]], [[market analysis]], and [[real estate law]]. Students are generally exposed to the full range of functions and most real estate product types (e.g. residential, retail, office, hospitality, and industrial). MRED programs typically teach the subject matter through case studies and field experiences and by way of traditional class lectures. Whether in the context of urban redevelopment, historic preservation, or suburban growth, MRED students learn from both the investor's and developer's perspective, the importance of relevant issues in law, economics, finance, market analysis, negotiation, lease analysis, architecture, planning, and management.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Land Magazine'' School for Developers, c, D.C.: Urban Institute, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many focus on the entire spectrum of the real estate development process-from dirt-to-deal, finance to façade-and include industry topics presented by leading local and national developers, financiers, and other players in the market. Included in this is the analysis of existing real estate assets and partnership structures.

===Master of Science in Real Estate (MSRE)===
The Master of Science in Real Estate degree (MSRE) often combines learning comprehensive business management skills with the understanding of how real estate markets work. Graduate programs that award a Master of Science in Real Estate degree are sometimes the expansion of real estate courses in a [[Business school]] into a degree of increased specialty or they are organically formed real estate centers within a larger college. Students who complete Master of Science in Real Estate degrees oftentimes go on to careers as real estate "project managers, asset management advisors, analysts, planners, and others." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carey.jhu.edu/academics/master-of-science/ms-in-real-estate-infrastructure |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Carey School of Business |publisher=carey.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master of Science in Real Estate degrees are completed in one year though two year options with the opportunity to complete a summer internship between the first and second year are available (e.g. the [[University of Washington]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.washington.edu/academics/masters-of-real-estate/ |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Runstad Center for Real Estate Studies |publisher=realestate.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate is also similarly found here, as it is simply a naming convention at [[Georgetown University]] and [[Cornell University]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Coursework===
The course work in real estate programs varies among universities. Many programs utilize [[Harvard Business School|HBS]]-style [[case studies]] of complex real estate scenarios to heighten the student's knowledge and strategic decision-making skills. Program lengths range from 30 to 72 credit hours. Programs that have more than 33 hours will sometimes allow its students to add a concentration. A required core curriculum is typical with the core curriculum's size and makeup being largely dependent on the length and focus of the program.

Example core curriculum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |title=Academics - MRED - W. P. Carey School of Business |publisher=Wpcarey.asu.edu |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2013-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601131326/http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Market Segmentation]] and Analysis
*Real Estate Finance and Analysis
*Real Estate Development Project Management
*Advanced Real Estate Finance
*Real Estate Site Analysis and Design
*Public [[Entitlement]] Process

In addition to the core curriculum, most two-year programs and some one-year programs offer students the opportunity to pursue a concentration, a focus on a specialized area of interest within the real estate industry. Concentrations differ between programs and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |title=Real Estate Development - Academics - Courses |publisher=arch.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221010354/http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |archivedate=December 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some programs, such as the MS in Real Estate Development at [[George Mason University]],&lt;ref name="gmu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://som.gmu.edu/real-estate-development/|title=Masters in Real Estate Development Program – George Mason University|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer students the opportunity to combine elective coursework from several disciplines including business management, public policy and civil engineering.

=== Design education related to real estate development ===
The practice of real estate development requires practitioners to work with selecting building types and designs, determining appropriate dimensions, programming internal spaces, shaping the site, and appropriately fitting the project to surrounding contexts.  Some programs, including Harvard University's Master of Design and Columbia University's MSRED include design education in the study of real estate development.  A new program established at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in 2015 emphasizes a capstone studio-workshop in which a multidisciplinary group of students under faculty supervision engage an actual real estate development problem for organizations acting as clients.&lt;ref name="ap.buffalo.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title = Master of Science specializing in Real Estate Development - B/a+p|url = http://ap.buffalo.edu/real-estate-development.html|website = ap.buffalo.edu|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive programs in real estate==

Executive degree programs in real estate offer practicing professionals the opportunity to learn while they are working. These programs are distinguished from distance programs through their uniquely blended model of residency classroom experience, distance education modules, and executive field study courses. Classes meet at the beginning of every semester, usually from five to seven days, and then complete the coursework through synchronous webinars, asynchronous discussion boards, and video lectures. [[Executive education]] in real estate is taught at numerous accredited institutions such as [[Auburn University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mred.auburn.edu/ |title=Auburn University Executive MRED |publisher=Mred.auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of graduate real estate programs outside the United States===

{{Main| Graduate real estate programs outside the United States}}

A number of universities around the world offer graduate degrees in real estate and related subjects. See the list in [[Graduate real estate programs outside the United States]].

==Nationally recognized research centers==
Real estate programs and alumni donors sponsor research by real estate faculty in numerous areas of real estate including the economics of property markets, the impacts of regulation, and the sources of equity and debt financing. Additional research, in the form of faculty-supervised student thesis work, contributes to a growing inventory of new information. The research program is essential to promoting new knowledge, advancing teaching techniques, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. Not all graduate real estate programs conduct research.

==Related graduate program offerings==
Professionals in real estate often hold degrees in related fields such as [[city planning]], construction management, accounting, property management, architecture or law. One of the most common programs continues to be a [[Master of City Planning]], regional planning, or urban planning degree with a real estate emphasis. Planning programs tend to emphasize land use planning, transportation or infrastructure development, land use law and policy and other planning topics; students who take a concentration in real estate development will learn how it relates to planning.

===MBA with Real Estate Concentration===
Business degrees with real estate concentrations generally provide students with the opportunity to pursue a general management degree, but to specialize in real estate development or some segment of the real estate industry through a sequence or group of electives. For a long time, those wishing to study real estate had to content themselves with primarily pursuing a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree, perhaps with the option of concentration in real estate, and usually with a focus in finance. These [[MBA]] programs typically only include one or two courses focused in real estate. Many MBA programs do not specialize in real estate.

For those weighing an MBA versus graduate real estate education, there are some issues to consider:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! '''MBA'''
!'''Graduate Real Estate (MSRE, MSRED, MRED, MPS/RE)'''
|-
|'''Timeframe''' || 2 years full-time || 1 or 2 years; part or full-time
|-
|'''Curriculum''' || 1st year - Business Basics; 2nd year - Specialization largely focused on finance-related areas || Real estate focus and specialization throughout
|-
|'''Specialization''' || Real Estate in MBA programs is very rare. Specialization tends to be finance focused || Broad-based real estate education in design, management, law, development, economics and significant focus on finance, e.g., real estate finance, capital markets
|-
|'''Program size''' || Typically, the programs are large with real estate students representing a relatively small (2% - 3%) percentage || Small groups, with commonly 25 to 50 students
|-
|'''Industry Commitment''' || Students pursuing an MBA may not be committed to a real estate career; therefore they are seeking a broader base || All students are committed to the real estate industry and many have real-estate related experience prior to coming to the program. An important part of the programs are the learning between students.
|-
|'''Career opportunities''' || Varied but with a heavy concentration in finance-related areas of the real estate industry || Significant representation in project management, development, finance-related areas, acquisitions, entrepreneurship and government
|-
|'''Thesis''' || Generally, not required || Typically required, usually as a professional publication or a real-life capstone competition
|-
|'''Alumni network''' || Usually extensive, but predominantly outside of the real estate industry || Alumni are involved in all facets of the industry and located throughout the world
|-
|'''Recruitment''' || Limited recruitment by real estate companies || Many students seeking employment find opportunities through peers, professors or on-site recruitment
|}

====MBA real estate concentration offerings====
A limited number of MBA programs offer courses in real estate as part of the typical study in business.

'''Habitat conservation''' is a management practice that seeks to [[Conservation (ethic)|conserve]], protect and restore [[habitat]] areas for wild [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, especially [[conservation reliant species]], and prevent their [[extinction]], [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] or reduction in [[Range (biology)|range]].&lt;ref name="CDFG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/habcon/|title=Habitat Conservation|last=Habitat Conservation Planning Branch|publisher=California Department of Fish &amp; Game|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a priority of many groups that cannot be easily characterized in terms of any one [[ideology]].

==History of the conservation movement==

For much of human history, ''nature'' had been seen as a [[natural resource|resource]], one that could be controlled by the government and used for personal and [[profit (economics)|economic gain]]. The idea was that plants only existed to feed animals and animals only existed to feed humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Keith|title=Man and the Natural World: A History of the Modern Sensibility|year=1983|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The land itself had limited value only extending to the resources it could provide such as [[mining|minerals]] and [[mineral oil|oil]].

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries social views started to change and scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the [[forest]]s of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[Civic engagement|civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting Pbnjbthis ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale [[deforestation]] and [[desiccation]], and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of [[forest conservation]] activities in British India through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDYlNljAP5AC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|author=Greg Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

Rather than focusing on the economic or material benefits associated with nature, humans began to appreciate the value of nature itself and the need to protect pristine wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BC Spaces|url=http://spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 20th century countries such as the United States, Canada, and Britain understood this appreciation and instigated laws and legislation in order to ensure that the most fragile and beautiful environments would be protected for generations to come. 
Today with the help of NGO’s, [[not-for profit]] organizations and governments worldwide there is a stronger [[environmental movement|movement]] taking place, with a deeper understanding of habitat conservation with the aim of protecting delicate habitats and preserving [[biodiversity]] on a global scale.  The commitment and actions of small volunteering association in villages and towns, that endeavour to emulate the work done by well known Conservation Organisations, is paramount in ensuring generations that follow understand the importance of conserving natural resources.  A village conservation group with the mission statement "We are committed to protecting and enhancing the natural environment in and around the adjoining villages of [[Ouston, County Durham|Ouston]] and Urpeth." may one day inspire a child who becomes the employee of a worldwide conservation organisation.

== Values of natural habitat ==
{{See also|Environmental Economics}}

The [[natural environment]] is a source for a wide range of resources that can be exploited for [[economic]] profit, for example timber is harvested from forests and clean water is obtained from natural streams. However, [[land development]] from anthropogenic economic growth often causes a decline in the ecological integrity of nearby natural habitat. For instance, this was an issue in the northern rocky mountains of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prato|first=T|title=Evaluating Tradeoffs Between Economic Value and Wildlife Habitat Suitability in Buffer Zones for Protected Areas in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA|journal=Mountain Research and Development|year=2009|volume=29|issue=1|pages=44–58|doi=10.1659/mrd.992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is also economic value in conserving natural habitats. Financial profit can be made from tourist revenue, for example in the tropics where species diversity is high, or in recreational sports which take place in natural environments such as [[hiking]] and [[mountain biking]]. The cost of repairing damaged ecosystems is considered to be much higher than the cost of conserving natural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noidoo|first=R|author2=Adamowicz|title=Economic benefits of biodiversity exceed costs of conservation at an African rainforest reserve|journal=PNAS|year=2005|volume=102|issue=46|pages=16712–16716|bibcode = 2005PNAS..10216712N |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0508036102|pmid=16267131|pmc=1283836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring the worth of conserving different habitat areas is often criticized as being too utilitarian from a philosophical point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=P J|author2=Abivardi|title=The value of biodiversity: where ecology and economy blend|journal=Biological Conservation|year=1998|volume=83|issue=3|pages=239–246|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(97)00141-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
Habitat conservation is important in maintaining [[biodiversity]], an essential part of global food security. There is evidence to support a trend of accelerating erosion of the genetic resources of agricultural plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on Biological Diversity|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-14/information/sbstta-14-inf-34-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in genetic similarity of agricultural plants and animals means an increased risk of food loss from major epidemics. Wild species of agricultural plants have been found to be more resistant to disease, for example the wild corn species Teosinte is resistant to 4 corn diseases that affect human grown crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why should we care about biodiversity?|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/bsp/bcn/why/biodvr2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of seed banking and habitat conservation has been proposed to maintain plant diversity for food security purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Seed Bank Partnership|url=http://www.seedpartnership.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classifying environmental values ==
Pearce and Moran outlined the following method for classifying environmental uses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=David|title=The economic value of biodiversity|year=1994|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:PQ5mPZssFVsJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi%3D10.1.1.22.2066%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+pearce+moran+economics+biodiversity&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=au&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESix7X9nKfRp-D9TYQecQSHQtQMnMJuslfDbAGoOmSAzf-E8yOWUn46b3o02guIUpP1fVGVn9i7VyiIAndu5URorZ_Gox05eOs_JO2p6UMiWumHIarvabB47HvFBU9jMlrZZFD71&amp;sig=AHIEtbRS7HHK6rvUQecNYPJumgtdCmDstQ&amp;pli=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Direct extractive uses: e.g. timber from forests, food from plants and animals
* Indirect uses: e.g. ecosystem services like flood control, pest control, erosion protection
* Optional uses: future possibilities e.g. unknown but potential use of plants in chemistry/medicine
* Non-use values:
**[[Bequest value]] (benefit of an individual who knows that others may benefit from it in future)
**Passive use value (sympathy for natural environment, enjoyment of the mere existence of a particular species)

== Impacts ==

=== Natural causes ===
[[Habitat loss]] and destruction can occur both naturally and through anthropogenic causes. Events leading to natural habitat loss include climate change, catastrophic events such as volcanic explosions and through the interactions of invasive and non-invasive species. Natural climate change, events have previously been the cause of many widespread and large scale losses in habitat. For example, some of the mass extinction events generally referred to as the "Big Five" have coincided with large scale such as the Earth entering an ice age, or alternate warming events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilf|first=P|title=Correlated terrestrial and marine evidence for global climate changes before mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary|journal=PNAS|year=2003|volume=100|issue=2|pages=599–604|doi=10.1073/pnas.0234701100|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100..599W|pmid=12524455|pmc=141042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events in the big five also have their roots in natural causes, such as volcanic explosions and meteor collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hut|first=P|title=Comet showers as a cause of mass extinction|journal=Nature|year=1987|volume=329|issue=10|pages=118–126|doi=10.1038/329118a0|bibcode = 1987Natur.329..118H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=G|title=Chicxulub impact pre-dates the K-T boundary mass extinction|journal=PNAS|year=2004|volume=101|issue=11|pages=3753–3758|pmid=15004276|doi=10.1073/pnas.0400396101|pmc=374316|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.3753K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact is one such example, which has previously caused widespread losses in habitat as the Earth either received less sunlight or grew colder, causing certain fauna and flora to flourish whilst others perished.  Previously known warm areas in the tropics, the most sensitive habitats on Earth, grew colder, and areas such as Australia developed radically different flora and fauna to those seen today. The big five mass extinction events have also been linked to sea level changes, indicating that large scale marine species loss was strongly influenced by loss in marine habitats, particularly shelf habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallam|first=A|authorlink= Anthony Hallam|title=Mass extinctions and sea-level changes|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|year=1999|volume=48|pages=217–250|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(99)00055-0|bibcode=1999ESRv...48..217H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methane-driven oceanic eruptions have also been shown to have caused smaller mass extinction events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryskin|first=G|title=Methane-driven oceanic eruptions and mass extinctions|journal=Geology|year=2003|volume=31|issue=9|pages=741–744|doi=10.1130/G19518.1|bibcode = 2003Geo....31..741R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human impacts ===
Humans have been the cause of many species’ extinction. Due to humans’ changing and modifying their environment, the habitat of other species often become altered or destroyed as a result of human actions. Even before the modern industrial era, humans were having widespread, and major effects on the environment. A good example of this is found in Aboriginal Australians and [[Australian megafauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=G|title=Ecosystem Collapse in Pleistocene Australia and a Human Role in Megafaunal Extinction|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=309|pages=287–290|doi=10.1126/science.1111288|pmid=16002615|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..287M|issue=5732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal hunting practices, which included burning large sections of forest at a time, eventually altered and changed Australia’s vegetation so much that many herbivorous megafauna species were left with no habitat and were driven into extinction. Once herbivorous megafauna species became extinct, carnivorous megafauna species soon followed.
In the recent past, humans have been responsible for causing more extinctions within a given period of time than ever before. [[Deforestation]], [[pollution]], anthropogenic [[climate change]] and human settlements have all been driving forces in altering or destroying habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnosky|first=A|title=Has the Earth’s sixth mass extinction already arrived?|journal=Nature|year=2011|volume=471|pages=51–57|bibcode = 2011Natur.471...51B |doi = 10.1038/nature09678|pmid=21368823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of ecosystems such as rainforests has resulted in countless habitats being destroyed. These [[biodiversity hotspots]] are home to millions of habitat specialists, which do not exist beyond a tiny area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N|title=Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities|journal=Nature|year=2000|volume=403|pages=853–858|doi=10.1038/35002501|pmid=10706275|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..853M|issue=6772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once their habitat is destroyed, they cease to exist.This destruction has a follow-on effect, as species which coexist or depend upon the existence of other species also become extinct, eventually resulting in the collapse of an entire ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=T|title=Habitat Loss and Extinction in the Hotspots of Biodiversity|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2002|volume=16|issue=4|pages=909–923|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00530.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=R|title=The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists?|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=2009|volume=276|issue=1670|pages=3037–3045|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0413|pmid=19474041|pmc=2817118}}&lt;/ref&gt; These time-delayed extinctions are referred to as the extinction debt, which is the result of destroying and fragmenting habitats.
As a result of anthropogenic modification of the environment, the extinction rate has climbed to the point where the Earth is now within a sixth mass extinction event, as commonly agreed by biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCallum|first=M|title=Amphibian Decline or Extinction? Current Declines Dwarf Background Extinction Rate|journal=Journal of Herpetology|year=2007|volume=41|issue=3|pages=483–491|doi=10.1670/0022-1511(2007)41[483:ADOECD]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly evident, for example, in the rapid decline in the number of [[amphibian]] species worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wake|first=D|title=A view from the world of amphibians|journal=PNAS|year=2008|volume=105|pages=11466–11473|bibcode = 2008PNAS..10511466W |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0801921105|pmid=18695221|pmc=2556420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches and methods of habitat conservation ==
Determining the size, type and location of habitat to conserve is a complex area of conservation biology. Although difficult to measure and predict, the conservation value of a habitat is often a reflection of the quality (e.g. species abundance and diversity), endangerment of encompassing ecosystems, and spatial distribution of that habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hierfl|first=L. A.|title=Assessing and Prioritizing Ecological Communities for Monitoring in a Regional Habitat Conservation Plan|journal=Environmental Management|year=2008|volume=42|pages=165–179|bibcode = 2008EnMan..42..165H |doi = 10.1007/s00267-008-9109-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying priority habitats for conservation ==
Habitat conservation is vital for protecting species and ecological processes. It is important to conserve and protect the space/ area in which that species occupies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shwartz|first=M. W.|title=Choosing the appropriate scale of reserves for conservation|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=1999|volume=30|pages=83–108|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.30.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, areas classified as ‘biodiversity hotspots’, or those in which a flagship, umbrella, or endangered species inhabits are often the habitats that are given precedence over others. Species that possess an elevated risk of extinction are given the highest priority and as a result of conserving their habitat, other species in that community are protected thus serving as an element of gap analysis. In the United States of America, a [[Habitat Conservation Plan]] (HCP) is often developed to conserve the environment in which a specific species inhabits. Under the U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) the habitat that requires protection in an HCP is referred to as the ‘critical habitat’. Multiple-species HCPs are becoming more favourable than single-species HCPs as they can potentially protect an array of species before they warrant listing under the ESA, as well as being able to conserve broad ecosystem components and processes . As of January 2007, 484 HCPs were permitted across the United States, 40 of which covered 10 or more species.The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP) encompasses 85 species in a total area of 26,000-km2. Its aim is to protect the habitats of multiple species and overall biodiversity by minimizing development in sensitive areas. Hi

HCPs require clearly defined goals and objectives, efficient monitoring programs, as well as successful communication and collaboration with stakeholders and land owners in the area. Reserve design is also important and requires a high level of planning and management in order to achieve the goals of the HCP. Successful reserve design often takes the form of a hierarchical system with the most valued habitats requiring high protection being surrounded by buffer habitats that have a lower protection status. Like HCPs, hierarchical reserve design is a method most often used to protect a single species, and as a result habitat corridors are maintained, edge effects are reduced and a broader suite of species are protected.

== How much habitat is needed ==
A range of methods and models currently exist that can be used to determine how much habitat is to be conserved in order to sustain a [[viable population]], including [[Resource Selection Function]] and Step Selection models. Modelling tools often rely on the spatial scale of the area as an indicator of conservation value. There has been an increase in emphasis on conserving few large areas of habitat as opposed to many small areas. This idea is often referred to as the "single large or several small", [[SLOSS debate]], and is a highly controversial area among [[conservation biologist]]s and [[ecologist]]s. The reasons behind the argument that "larger is better" include the reduction in the negative impacts of patch edge effects, the general idea that species richness increases with [[habitat area]] and the ability of larger habitats to support greater populations with lower extinction probabilities. Noss &amp; Cooperrider support the "larger is better" claim and developed a model that implies areas of habitat less than 1000ha are "tiny" and of low conservation value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noss|first=R. F.|title=Saving Nature's Legacy, Protecting and Restoring Biodiveristy|year=1994|publisher=Washington, DC|pages=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shwartz suggests that although "larger is better", this does not imply that "small is bad". Shwartz argues that human induced habitat loss leaves no alternative to conserving small areas. Furthermore, he suggests many endangered species which are of high conservation value, may only be restricted to small [[habitat fragmentation|isolated patches]] of habitat, and thus would be overlooked if larger areas were given a higher priority. The shift to conserving larger areas is somewhat justified in society by placing more value on larger vertebrate species, which naturally have larger habitat requirements.

== Examples of current conservation organizations ==

=== The Nature Conservancy ===
Since its formation in 1951 [[The Nature Conservancy]] has slowly developed into one of the world’s largest conservation organizations. Currently operating in over 30 countries, across 5 continents worldwide, The Nature Conservancy aims to protect nature and its assets for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization purchases land or accepts land donations with the intension of conserving its natural resources.  In 1955 The Nature Conservancy purchased its first 60-acre plot near the New York/Connecticut border in the United States of America. Today the Conservancy has expanded to protect over 119 million acres of land, 5,000 river miles as well as participating in over 1000 marine protection programs across the globe .
Since its beginnings The Nature Conservancy has understood the benefit in taking a scientific approach towards habitat conservation. For the last decade the organization has been using a collaborative, scientific method known as ‘Conservation by Design’. By collecting and analyzing scientific data The Conservancy is able to holistically approach the protection of various ecosystems. This process determines the habitats that need protection, specific elements that should be conserved as well as monitoring progress so more efficient practices can be developed for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy |url=http://www.nature.org/ourscience/conservationbydesign/index.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916210409/http://www.nature.org/ourscience/conservationbydesign/index.htm |archivedate=2011-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nature Conservancy currently has a large number of diverse projects in operation. They work with countries around the world to protect forests, river systems, oceans, deserts and grasslands.  In all cases the aim is to provide a sustainable environment for both the plant and animal life forms that depend on them as well as all future generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; turtles

=== World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ===
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) was first formed in after a group of passionate conservationists signed what is now referred to as the Morges Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWF is currently operating in over 100 countries across 5 continents with a current listing of over 5 million supporters. 
One of the first projects of WWF was assisting in the creation of the Charles Darwin Research Foundation which aided in the protection of diverse range of unique species existing on the Galápagos’ Islands, Ecuador.  It was also a WWF grant that helped with the formation of the College of African Wildlife Management in Tanzania which today focuses on teaching a wide range of protected area management skills in areas such as ecology, range management and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/50_years_of_achievements/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WWF has since gone on to aid in the protection of land in Spain, creating the [[Coto Doñana National Park]] in order to conserve migratory birds and The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], home to the world’s largest protected wetlands. The WWF also initiated a debt-for-nature concept which allows the country to put funds normally allocated to paying off national debt, into conservation programs that protect its natural landscapes. Countries currently participating include [[Madagascar]], the first country to participate which since 1989 has generated over $US50 million towards preservation, [[Bolivia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[Gabon]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Zambia]].

=== Rare Conservation ===
Rare has been in operation since 1973 with current global partners in over 50 countries and offices in the United States of America, Mexico, the Philippines, China and Indonesia. Rare focuses on the human activity that threatens biodiversity and habitats such as overfishing and unsustainable agriculture.  By engaging local communities and changing behaviour Rare has been able to launch campaigns to protect areas in most need of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Conservation|url=http://rareconservation.org/about}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The key aspect of Rare’s methodology is their "Pride Campaign’s".  For example, in the Andes in South America, Rare has incentives to develop watershed protection practices.  In the Southeast Asia’s "coral triangle" Rare is training fishers in local communities to better manage the areas around the coral reefs in order to lessen human impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Conservation|url=http://rareconservation.org/empowering-local-communities-solve-global-conservation-challenges}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such programs last for three years with the aim of changing community attitudes so as to conserve fragile habitats and provide ecological protection for years to come.

=== WWF Netherlands ===
WWF Netherlands, along with ARK Nature, Wild Wonders of Europe and Conservation Capital have started the Rewilding Europe project. This project intents to rewild several areas in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rewildingeurope.com/ Rewilding Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HubbleTuningFork.jpg|thumb|350px|Tuning-fork style diagram of the Hubble sequence]]

Hubble’s scheme divides regular galaxies into three broad classes – [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] and [[spiral galaxy|spirals]] – based on their visual appearance (originally on [[photographic plate]]s). A fourth class contains galaxies with an [[irregular galaxy|irregular]] appearance. To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in [[amateur astronomy]].

==Classes of galaxies==

===Ellipticals===

[[Image:Abell S740, cropped to ESO 325-G004.jpg|thumb|The giant elliptical galaxy ESO 325-G004.]]
On the left (in the sense that the sequence is usually drawn) lie the [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]]. Elliptical galaxies have relatively smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in photographic images. They are denoted by the letter E, followed by an integer ''n'' representing their degree of [[Flattening|ellipticity]] in the sky. By convention, ''n'' is ten times the ellipticity of the galaxy, rounded to the nearest integer, where the ellipticity is defined as {{nowrap|''e'' {{=}} 1 − {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} for an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axes of lengths ''a'' and ''b'' respectively.&lt;ref name="binney_merrifield"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |authorlink=James Binney |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |date=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ellipticity increases from left to right on the Hubble diagram, with near-circular (E0) galaxies situated on the very left of the diagram. It is important to note that the ellipticity of a galaxy on the sky is only indirectly related to the true 3-dimensional shape (for example, a flattened, discus-shaped galaxy can appear almost round if viewed face-on or highly elliptical if viewed edge-on). Observationally, the most flattened "elliptical" galaxies have ellipticities ''e'' = 0.7 (denoted E7).  However, from studying the light profiles and the ellipticity profiles, rather than just looking at the images, it was realised in the 1960s that the E5–E7 galaxies are probably misclassified lenticular galaxies with large-scale disks seen at various inclinations to our line-of-sight.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Liller (1966), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966ApJ...146...28L The Distribution of Intensity in Elliptical Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster.

===Lenticulars===
[[Image:Ngc5866 hst big rotated.jpg|thumb|The [[NGC 5866|Spindle Galaxy]] (NGC 5866), a lenticular galaxy with a prominent [[dust lane]] in the [[Draco (constellation)|constellation of Draco]].]]
At the centre of the Hubble tuning fork, where the two spiral-galaxy branches and the elliptical branch join, lies an intermediate class of galaxies known as [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] and given the symbol S0. These galaxies consist of a bright central [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], similar in appearance to an [[elliptical galaxy]], surrounded by an extended, [[galaxy disk|disk]]-like structure. Unlike [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity. 

When simply looking at a galaxy's image, lenticular galaxies with relatively face-on disks are difficult to distinguish from ellipticals of type E0–E3, making the classification of many such galaxies uncertain. When viewed edge-on, the disk becomes more apparent and prominent dust-lanes are sometimes visible in [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] at optical wavelengths.

At the time of the initial publication of Hubble's galaxy classification scheme, the existence of lenticular galaxies was purely hypothetical. Hubble believed that they were necessary as an intermediate stage between the highly flattened "ellipticals" and spirals. Later [[observational astronomy|observations]] (by Hubble himself, among others) showed Hubble's belief to be correct and the S0 class was included in the definitive exposition of the Hubble sequence by [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref name="sandage"&gt;{{cite conference |first = A. |last = Sandage |authorlink = Allan Sandage |date = 1975 |title = Classification and Stellar Content of Galaxies Obtained from Direct Photography |booktitle = Galaxies and the Universe |editor = A. Sandage |others = M. Sandage and J. Kristian |url = http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sandage/frames.html |accessdate = 2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missing from the Hubble sequence are the early-type galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, in between the E and S0 type, Martha Liller denoted them '''ES''' galaxies in 1966.

Lenticular and spiral galaxies, taken together, are often referred to as [[disk galaxy|disk galaxies]].  The bulge-to-disk flux ratio in lenticular galaxies can take on a range of values, just as it does for each of the spiral galaxy morphological types (Sa, Sb, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graham |first=A. |author2=Worley, C. |date=August 2008 |title=Inclination- and dust-corrected galaxy parameters: bulge-to-disc ratios and size-luminosity relations |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=388 |issue=4 |pages=1708–1728 |bibcode=2008MNRAS.388.1708G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13506.x|arxiv = 0805.3565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirals===
[[Image:M101 hires STScI-PRC2006-10a.jpg|thumb|The [[Pinwheel Galaxy]] (Messier 101/NGC 5457): a spiral galaxy classified as type Scd on the Hubble sequence]]
[[Image:Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg|thumb|right|The barred spiral galaxy [[NGC 1300]]: a type SBbc]]
On the right of the Hubble sequence diagram are two parallel branches encompassing the [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]. A spiral galaxy consists of a flattened [[galaxy disk|disk]], with [[star]]s forming a (usually two-armed) [[spiral]] structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]]. Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge, at the ends of which the spiral arms begin. In the tuning-fork diagram, the regular spirals occupy the upper branch and are denoted by the letter S, while the lower branch contains the barred spirals, given the symbol SB. Both type of spirals are further subdivided according to the detailed appearance of their spiral structures. Membership of one of these subdivisions is indicated by adding a lower-case letter to the morphological type, as follows:
* Sa (SBa) – tightly wound, smooth arms; large, bright central bulge
* Sb (SBb) – less tightly wound spiral arms than Sa (SBa); somewhat fainter bulge
* Sc (SBc) – loosely wound spiral arms, clearly resolved into individual stellar clusters and nebulae; smaller, fainter bulge

Hubble originally described three classes of spiral galaxy. This was extended by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]]&lt;ref name="devaucouleurs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs |date=1959 |title=Classification and Morphology of External Galaxies |journal=Handbuch der Physik |volume=53 |pages=275 |bibcode=1959HDP....53..275D |last2=Oemler |first2=Augustus, Jr. |last3=Butcher |first3=Harvey R. |last4=Gunn |first4=James E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include a fourth class:
* Sd (SBd) – very loosely wound, fragmentary arms; most of the luminosity is in the arms and not the bulge

Although strictly part of the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs system]] of classification, the Sd class is often included in the Hubble sequence. The basic spiral types can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance. For example, spiral galaxies whose appearance is intermediate between two of the above classes are often identified by appending two lower-case letters to the main galaxy type (for example, Sbc for a galaxy that is intermediate between an Sb and an Sc).

Our own [[Milky Way]] is generally classed as SBb or SBc&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hodge (1983), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983PASP...95..721H The Hubble type of the Milky Way Galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;, making it a barred spiral with well-defined arms. 

Examples of regular spiral galaxies: [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] (Andromeda Galaxy), [[Messier 74|M74]], [[Messier 81|M81]], [[Sombrero Galaxy|M104]] (Sombrero Galaxy), [[Whirlpool Galaxy|M51a]] (Whirlpool Galaxy), [[NGC 300]], [[NGC 772]].

Examples of barred spiral galaxies: [[Messier 91|M91]], [[Messier 95|M95]], [[NGC 1097]], [[NGC 1300]], [[NGC1672]], [[NGC 2536]], [[NGC 2903]].

===Irregulars===
[[Image:large.mc.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC) - a dwarf [[irregular galaxy]]]]
Galaxies that do not fit into the Hubble sequence, because they have no regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal), are termed [[irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]]. Hubble defined two classes of irregular galaxy:&lt;ref name="longair"&gt;{{cite book |last=Longair |first=M. S. |authorlink=Malcolm Longair |title=Galaxy Formation |date=1998 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3-540-63785-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Irr I galaxies have asymmetric profiles and lack a central bulge or obvious spiral structure; instead they contain many individual clusters of young stars
* Irr II galaxies have smoother, asymmetric appearances and are not clearly resolved into individual stars or stellar clusters
In his extension to the Hubble sequence, de Vaucouleurs called the Irr I galaxies 'Magellanic irregulars', after the [[Magellanic Clouds]] – two satellites of the Milky Way which Hubble classified as Irr I. The discovery of a faint spiral structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs |date=1955 |title=Studies of Magellanic Clouds. I. Dimensions and structure of the Large Cloud |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=160 |pages=126–140 |bibcode=1955AJ.....60..126D |doi=10.1086/107173 |last2=Oemler |first2=Augustus, Jr. |last3=Butcher |first3=Harvey R. |last4=Gunn |first4=James E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] led de Vaucouleurs to further divide the irregular galaxies into those that, like the LMC, show some evidence for spiral structure (these are given the symbol Sm) and those that have no obvious structure, such as the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (denoted Im). In the extended Hubble sequence, the Magellanic irregulars are usually placed at the end of the spiral branch of the Hubble tuning fork.

Examples of irregular galaxies: [[Messier 82|M82]], [[NGC 1427A]], [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], [[Small Magellanic Cloud]].

==Physical significance==

Elliptical and lenticular galaxies are commonly referred to together as “early-type” galaxies, while spirals and irregular galaxies are referred to as “late types”. This nomenclature is the source of the common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldry |first=I. K. |date=2008 |title=Hubble's Galaxy Nomenclature |journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=5.25 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4004.2008.49525.x |bibcode=2008A&amp;G....49e..25B|arxiv = 0809.0125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but erroneous, belief that the Hubble sequence was intended to reflect a supposed [[evolution (term)|evolutionary]] sequence, from [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] through [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] to either [[barred spiral galaxy|barred]] or [[spiral galaxy|regular spirals]]. In fact, Hubble was clear from the beginning that no such interpretation was implied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The nomenclature, it is emphasized, refers to position in the sequence, and temporal connotations are made at one's peril. The entire classification is purely empirical and without prejudice to theories of evolution...&lt;ref name="hubble27"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1927 |title=The Classification of Spiral Nebulae |journal=The Observatory |volume=50 |pages=276 |bibcode=1927Obs....50..276H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The evolutionary picture appears to be lent weight by the fact that the disks of spiral galaxies are observed to be home to many young [[star]]s and regions of active [[star formation]], while elliptical galaxies are composed of predominantly old stellar populations. In fact, current evidence suggests the opposite: the early Universe appears to be dominated by spiral and irregular galaxies. In the currently favored picture of [[galaxy formation]], present-day ellipticals formed as a result of mergers between these earlier building blocks; while some lenticular galaxies may have formed this way, others may have accreted their disks around pre-existing spheroids.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Alister W.; Dullo, Bililign T.; Savorgnan, Giulia A. D. (2015), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...804...32G Hiding in Plain Sight: An Abundance of Compact Massive Spheroids in the Local Universe]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some lenticular galaxies may also be evolved spiral galaxies, whose gas has been stripped away leaving no fuel for continued star formation&lt;ref name="ChristensenMartin2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lars Lindberg Christensen|author2=Davide de Martin|author3=Raquel Yumi Shida|title=Cosmic Collisions: The Hubble Atlas of Merging Galaxies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhRAokTI2RYC&amp;pg=PA24|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-93855-4|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the galaxy [[LEDA 2108986]] opens the debate on this.


==Shortcomings==

A common criticism of the Hubble scheme is that the criteria for assigning galaxies to classes are subjective, leading to different observers assigning galaxies to different classes (although experienced observers usually agree to within less than a single Hubble type).&lt;ref name=dressler_et_al&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dressler|first=A. |last2=Oemler, Jr.|first2=A. |last3=Butcher|first3=H. R. |last4=Gunn|first4=J. E. |date=July 1994 |title=The morphology of distant cluster galaxies. 1: HST observations of CL 0939+4713 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=430 |issue=1 |pages=107–120 |bibcode=1994ApJ...430..107D | doi = 10.1086/174386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lahav, O., et al. (1995), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Sci...267..859L Galaxies, Human Eyes, and Artificial Neural Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not really a short-coming, since the 1961 Hubble Atlas of Galaxies, the primary criteria used to assign the morphological type (a, b, c, etc.) has been the nature of the spiral arms, rather than the bulge-to-disk flux ratio, and thus a range of flux ratios exist for each morphological type&lt;ref&gt;Allan Sandage (1961), [The Hubble Atlas of Galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov, B. A.; Arkhipova, V. P. (1962), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962MCG...C01....0V Morphological catalogue of galaxies. Part 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov, B. A.; Noskova, R. I. (1973) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973SvA....16..824V Photometric Parameters of Flat Galaxies.]&lt;/ref&gt;, as with the lenticular galaxies.

Another criticism of the Hubble classification scheme is that, being based on the appearance of a galaxy in a two-dimensional image, the classes are only indirectly related to the true physical properties of galaxies. In particular, problems arise because of [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] effects. The same galaxy would look very different, if viewed edge-on, as opposed to a face-on or ‘broadside’ viewpoint.  As such, the early-type sequence is poorly represented: the ES galaxies are missing from the Hubble sequence, and the E5–E7 galaxies are actually S0 galaxies.  Furthermore, the barred ES and barred S0 galaxies are also absent.

Visual classifications are also less reliable for faint or distant galaxies, and the appearance of galaxies can change depending on the [[wavelength]] of light in which they are observed.

Nonetheless, the Hubble sequence is still commonly used in the field of [[extragalactic astronomy]] and Hubble types are known to correlate with many physically relevant properties of galaxies, such as [[Luminosity|luminosities]], colours, masses (of stars and gas) and star formation rates.&lt;ref name=roberts_haynes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=M. S. |author2=Haynes, M. P. |date=1994 |title=Physical Parameters along the Hubble Sequence |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=115–152 |bibcode=1994ARA&amp;A..32..115R |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.32.090194.000555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Institute of Remote Sensing''' is a premier institute for research, higher education and training in the field of Remote Sensing, Geoinformatics and GPS Technology for Natural Resources, Environmental and Disaster Management under the [[Department of Space|Indian Department of Space]], which was established in the year 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iirs.gov.in/about-iirs|title=About IIRS - Welcome to Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)|website=www.iirs.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the city of [[Dehradun]], [[Uttarakhand]].

==History==
Formerly known as Indian Photo-interpretation Institute (IPI), the Institute was founded on 21 April 1966 under the aegis of Survey of India (SOI). It was established with the collaboration of the Government of The Netherlands on the pattern of Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) of the University of Twente, formerly known as International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences, The Netherlands. The original idea of setting the Institute came from India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru during his visit to The Netherlands in 1957.

The Institute's building at Kalidas Road, Dehradun was inaugurated on 27 May 1972. Since its founding, the Institute has been playing a key role in capacity building in remote sensing and geoinformatics technology and their applications for the benefit of the user community from India and abroad. Today, it has programmes for all levels of users, i.e. mid-career professionals, researchers, academia, fresh graduates and policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iirs.gov.in/historyandobjectives ]{{cite web|url=https://www.iirs.gov.in/historyandobjectives#|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NRSA converted into a government entity under DOS/ISRO===
NRSA is closely associated with various programmes of the Department of Space (DOS)/Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), in particular, the Earth Observation Programme, Disaster Management Support and other programmes of national importance. To enable NRSA to carry out its responsibilities in a more effective manner, the Government has after careful consideration, decided to convert it into a Government entity, to be called a National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), a Centre under DOS/ISRO, effective 1 September 2008.

===Reorganisation of the IIRS as independent unit of ISRO===
Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun has been premier institute responsible for capacity building in the field of Remote Sensing and GIS applications. It has grown manifolds and establish itself as an institute of repute both nationally and internationally. Realising the potential of Earth Observation System and ISRO’s forthcoming initiatives in the areas of Natural Resource Survey, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Oceanography, Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, Chairman ISRO has reorganised IIRS as a separate entity of ISRO w.e.f. 30 April 2011. IIRS will continue its Training, Education and Research programmes with enhanced focus on Microwave Remote Sensing, Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and Climate studies.

The institute will be guided by a Management Council which will provide overall direction for the development of the institute. Dr. P.S. Roy, Outstanding Scientist has been appointed as first Director of IIRS w.e.f 30 April 2011.

==Courses==
The focus of the IIRS is training and education in the field of [[geoinformatics]]. Technology and applications of Remote Sensing, GIS and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] are taught in the form of training and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iirs.gov.in/node/#|title=Welcome to Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)|website=www.iirs.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justin L. Barrett''' (born 1971) is an [[Americans|American]] [[cognitive scientist]], Director of the Thrive Center for Human Development in [[Pasadena, California]], Thrive Professor of Developmental Science, and Professor of Psychology at Fuller Graduate School of Psychology. He previously held a post as senior researcher of the Centre for Anthropology and Mind and The Institute for Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at [[Oxford University]].

==Career==
Barrett earned a B.A. in [[psychology]] from [[Calvin College]] and a Ph.D in experimental psychology (cognitive and developmental focus) from [[Cornell University]]. He served on the psychology faculties of Calvin College and the [[University of Michigan]] (Ann Arbor), and as a research fellow of the [[Institute for Social Research]].

Dr. Barrett is a founding editor of the ''Journal of Cognition &amp; Culture'' and is author of numerous articles and chapters concerning the [[cognitive science of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutionofreligion.org/speakers.php?s=Justin+Barrett Speakers Bio Hawaii conference of the evolution of religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/staff/publications/justin.barrett.shtml Barrett's Selected Publications] at the [[University of Oxford]] website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728102522/http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/staff/publications/justin.barrett.shtml |date=July 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on evolution of religious belief==
Barrett is described in the [[New York Times]] as a  "prominent member of the byproduct camp" and "an observant Christian who believes in “an all-knowing, all-powerful, perfectly good God who brought the universe into being,” [and] “that the purpose for people is to love God and love each other.” He considers that “[[Christian theology]] teaches that people were crafted by God to be in a loving relationship with him and other people, Why wouldn’t God, then, design us in such a way as to find belief in divinity quite natural?” Having a scientific explanation for mental phenomena does not mean we should stop believing in them. “Suppose science produces a convincing account for why I think my wife loves me — should I then stop believing that she does?”&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html?pagewanted=11&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;em&amp;en=166dbd9e75680e73&amp;ex=1173243600 Darwin's God] March 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?''==
In  his book ''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?'' he suggests that "belief in God is an almost inevitable consequence of the kind of minds we have. Most of what we believe comes from mental tools working below our conscious awareness. And what we believe consciously is in large part driven by these unconscious beliefs." and "that beliefs in gods match up well with these automatic assumptions; beliefs in an all-knowing, all-powerful God match up even better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altamirapress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB/CATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0759106673 Book description ] - see also the preface [http://www.altamirapress.com/Chapters/Index.shtml?SKU=0759106673&amp;Site=altamirapress&amp;Title=Why%20Would%20Anyone%20Believe%20in%20God%3F&amp;FileType=PDF online here]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202081331/http://www.altamirapress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB%2FCATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0759106673 |date=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''laconic phrase''' or '''laconism''' is a concise or [[wikt:terse|terse]] statement, especially a [[wikt:blunt|blunt]] and [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptical]] rejoinder.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms'', 1984, ''s.v.'' 'concise' [https://books.google.com/books?id=8N4UReTJYhUC&amp;pg=PA172 p. 172].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Percy Smith, ''Synonyms Discriminated'' (1904) [https://books.google.com/books?id=17sXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA541 p. 541].&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Laconia]], the region of Greece including the city of [[Sparta]], whose ancient inhabitants had a reputation for verbal austerity and were famous for their blunt and often [[wikt:pithy|pithy]] remarks.

==Uses==
A laconic phrase may be used for efficiency (as in [[military jargon]]), for emphasis, for philosophical reasons (especially among thinkers who believe in minimalism, such as [[Stoicism|Stoics]]), or to better deflate a pompous individual.

[[File:Philip-ii-of-macedon.jpg|thumb|138px|left|[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] ([[Hellenistic art#Later Roman copies|Roman copy]] of a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] bust)]]
A prominent example involves [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] of [[Macedon]]. After invading southern Greece and receiving the submission of other key [[city-state]]s, he turned his attention to Sparta and asked menacingly whether he should come as friend or foe. The reply was "''Neither''."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 233e [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html 1] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0198:chapter=69&amp;highlight=neither%2Cphilip 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Losing patience, he sent the message: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5n4iLuNvHlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0199766495&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikk--Mr6bXAhVJ7GMKHRt2BxEQ6AEIKDAA#v=snippet&amp;q=raze&amp;f=false ''The Animal Spirit Doctrine and the Origins of Neurophysiology''], C.U.M. Smith, ''et al., Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Spartan [[ephor]]s again replied with a single word: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If.''&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De garrulitate'', 17 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0288%3Asection%3D17 1] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_garrulitate*.html 2] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20140804211840/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/49190/ 3].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Subsequently, neither Philip nor his son [[Alexander the Great]] attempted to capture the city.{{refn|group=note|Sparta then declined to participate in Macedon's [[Wars of Alexander the Great#Persia|invasion of the Persian Empire]], a fact memorialized in a proclamation Alexander sent to Athens with armor captured at the [[Battle of the Granicus]]: [[:wikiquote:Macedonia#Historians|"Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the foreigners inhabiting Asia."]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'', I, 16, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Clear}}

===In humor===
The Spartans were especially famous for their dry, understated wit,&lt;ref name="Stuttard2014"&gt;{{cite book|first= David|last= Stuttard|title=A History of Ancient Greece in Fifty Lives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VAc7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;q=laconic+wit|date=14 October 2014| publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn= 978-0-500-77221-8|page= 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now known as "laconic humor". This can be contrasted with the "[[Attic Greek|Attic]] salt" or "Attic wit" {{ndash}} the refined, poignant, delicate humour of Sparta's chief rival, [[Classical Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref name="Belfield1897"&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry H.|last= Belfield|title= Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son and godson|url=

==History==
[[File:Chilon of Sparta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chilon of Sparta]]]]
Spartans paid less attention than other [[ancient Greeks]] to the development of [[Education in ancient Greece|education]], [[Ancient Greek art|arts]], and [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Hippias Major]]'' 285b–d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some view this as having contributed to the characteristically blunt Laconian speech. However, [[Socrates]], in [[Plato]]'s dialogue [[Protagoras (dialogue)|''Protagoras'']], appears to reject the idea that Spartans' economy with words was simply a consequence of poor literary education: "... they conceal their wisdom, and pretend to be blockheads, so that they may seem to be superior only because of their [[Spartan army|prowess in battle]] ... This is how you may know that I am speaking the truth and that the Spartans are the best educated in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy]] and [[rhetoric|speaking]]: if you talk to any ordinary Spartan, he seems to be stupid, but eventually, like an expert marksman, he shoots in some brief remark that proves you to be only a child".&lt;ref&gt;''Protagoras'' 342b, d–e, from the translation given at the end of the section on Lycurgus in [https://web.archive.org/web/20050207014704/http://www.e-classics.com/index.html e-classics.com].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|An alternative translation based on those by A. Beresford and R.E. Allen is as follows: "...they claim not to have any interest in [philosophy] and put on this big show of being morons...because...they want people to think that their superiority rests on fighting battles and being manly... You can tell that what I say is true, and that Spartans are the best educated in philosophy and argument, by this: if one associates with the most inferior Spartan, one at first finds him somewhat inferior in speech; but then at some chance point in the discussion he throws in a remark worthy of noticing, brief and terse, like a skilled marksman, so that the person he's talking to appears no better than a child."&lt;ref name = "Beresford2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, R.E.|title=The Dialogues of Plato| volume= 3: Ion, Hippias Minor, Laches, and Protagoras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7StRBqCrebwC&amp;pg=203|year=1984|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300074383|pages=202-203}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Socrates was known to have admired Spartan laws,&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Crito]]'' 52e.&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Laconophilia#Ancient Laconophilia|many other Athenians]],&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 544c.&lt;/ref&gt; but modern scholars have doubted the seriousness of his attribution of a secret love of philosophy to Spartans.&lt;ref name = "Taylor1949"&gt;[[A.E. Taylor|Taylor, A.E.]], [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sb8KR_jVAy0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Plato:  The Man and His Work''], Meridian Books, 6th ed., 1949; on [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sb8KR_jVAy0C&amp;pg=PA255 p. 255] Taylor suggests Socrates is mocking, in jest, other Greeks who affect a Spartan lifestyle as the epitome of rugged manliness for not realizing their models are closet intellectuals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Taylor2002"&gt;Taylor, C.C.W., [https://books.google.com/books?id=mXkxAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=9780199555659&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+ordinary+Spartan ''Plato: Protagoras''], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199555659}}, 2009; pp. 43, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Beresford2005"&gt;Beresford, A., [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Uvfd2dixgMC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Plato: Protagoras and Meno''], Penguin Books 2005, p. 151.; see [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Uvfd2dixgMC&amp;q=Contemporary%20readers#v=snippet&amp;q=Contemporary%20readers commentary] (click on "61" link).&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the Spartans [[Myson of Chenae]] and [[Chilon of Sparta]] have traditionally been counted among the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; both were famous for many laconic sayings.{{refn|group=note|Examples include "We should not investigate facts by the light of arguments, but arguments by the light of facts" for Myson,&lt;ref name="laertius"&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iHpVDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Lives of the Eminent Philosophers]''. Translated by Pamela Mensch.

In general, however, Spartans were expected to be men of few words, to hold rhetoric in disdain, and to stick to the point. Loquacity was considered frivolous and unbecoming of sensible, down-to-earth [[Spartiate|Spartan peers]]. A Spartan youth was reportedly liable to have his thumb bitten as punishment for too verbose a response to a teacher's question.&lt;ref name="Cartledge2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Cartledge|title=Spartan Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgFlxZ14hkoC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=2012-12-13|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23124-5|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Lycurgus.jpg|thumb|[[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]]]
[[File:Helmed Hoplite Sparta.JPG|thumb|[[Leonidas (sculpture)|''Leonidas'']], a sculpture (c. 475 BC) unearthed in Sparta in 1926 ([[Archaeological Museum of Sparta]])]]
===Spartan===
*A [[wit]]ticism attributed to [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]], the possibly legendary lawgiver of Sparta, was a response to a proposal to set up a [[democracy]] there: "Begin with your own family."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Lycurgus'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html 1] [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14033/14033-h/14033-h.htm#LIFE_OF_LYKURGUS 2] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lycurgus*.html 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
*On another occasion, Lycurgus was reportedly asked the reason for the less-than-extravagant size of Sparta's [[sacrifice]]s to the [[Religion in ancient Greece|gods]]. He replied, "So that we may always have something to offer."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*When he was consulted on how Spartans might best forestall invasion of their homeland, Lycurgus advised, "By remaining poor, and each man not desiring to possess more than his fellow."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*When asked whether it would be prudent to build a [[defensive wall]] enclosing the city, Lycurgus answered, "A city is well-fortified which has a wall of men instead of brick."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt; (When another Spartan was later shown an Asian city with impressive fortifications, he remarked, "Fine quarters for women!"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 230c.&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Responding to a visitor who questioned why they put their fields in the hands of the [[helots]] rather than cultivate them themselves, [[Anaxandridas II|Anaxandridas]] explained, "It was by not taking care of the fields, but of ourselves, that we acquired those fields."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica'' (Sayings of Spartans), 217a. This work may or may not be by Plutarch himself, but is included among the ''[[Moralia]],'' a collection of works attributed to him but outside the collection of his most famous works, the ''[[Parallel Lives]].''&lt;/ref&gt;
*King [[Demaratus]], being pestered by someone with a question concerning who the most exemplary Spartan was, answered "He that is least like you."&lt;ref name="Lycurgus"/&gt;
*On her husband [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]]'s departure for battle with the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] at [[Thermopylae]], [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta]] asked what she should do. He advised her: "Marry a good man and bear good children."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Apophthegmata Laconica,'' 225a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lacaenarum Apophthegmata'' (Sayings of Spartan Women), 240e. This work may or may not be by Plutarch himself, but is included among the ''[[Moralia]],'' a collection of works attributed to him but outside the collection of his most famous works, the ''[[Parallel Lives]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other historical examples===
[[File:Pyrrhus.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]]]
* When [[Ben-Hadad I]], king of [[Aram-Damascus]], attacked [[Ahab]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], he sent a message: "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in [[Samaria]] to give each of my men a handful." Ahab replied, "One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off."&lt;ref&gt;[[I Kings]] 20:10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A traveler from [[Sybaris]], a city in southern Italy (which gave rise to the word ''[[:wikt:sybarite|sybarite]]'') infamous in the ancient world for its luxury and gluttony, was invited to eat in a Spartan [[Syssitia|mess hall]] and tasted their [[black broth]]. Disgusted, he remarked, "No wonder Spartans are the bravest of men. Anyone in their right mind would rather die a thousand times than live like this."&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' Book IV, 138d; Book XII, 518e; trans. quoted in [[Andrew Dalby|Dalby, A.]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?ei=qZe4TquzL6qIiAK09KnwBA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=wtLgAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=senses+would+rather+die Siren Feasts: A History of Food and Gastronomy in Greece]''. London: Routledge, 1996. {{ISBN|0-415-15657-2}}, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When news of the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] reached Athens in 336&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[strategos]] [[Phocion]] banned all celebratory sacrifice, saying: "The army which defeated us at [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Chaeronea]] has lost just one man."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Phocion|"Phocion"]], 16.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The heavy price of defeating the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the [[Battle of Asculum (279 BC)]] prompted [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] to respond to an offer of congratulations with "If we win one more battle we will be doomed" ("One more [[Pyrrhic victory|such victory]] and the cause is lost"; in Greek: Ἂν ἔτι μίαν μάχην νικήσωμεν, ἀπολώλαμεν ''Án éti mían máchēn nikḗsōmen, apolṓlamen'').&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Pyrrhus|"Pyrrhus"]], 21.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6838">In [[signal processing]], '''Lulu [[smoothing]]''' is a [[nonlinear]] mathematical technique for removing impulsive [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] from a data sequence such as a [[time series]]. It is a nonlinear equivalent to taking a [[moving average]] (or other smoothing technique) of a time series, and is similar to other [[nonlinear smoothing]] techniques, such as Tukey&lt;ref name="Tukey" /&gt; or [[Median filter|median smoothing]].[[File:LUSmoother width=1.png|thumb|LU smoother of width 1 applied to a noisy sequence]] LULU smoothers are compared in detail to median smoothers by Jankowitz&lt;ref name="jankowitz2007some" /&gt; and found to be superior in some aspects, particularly in mathematical properties like [[idempotence]].

== Properties ==
Lulu operators have a  number of attractive mathematical properties, among them [[idempotence]] – meaning that repeated application of the operator yields the same result as a single application – and co-idempotence. 
An interpretation of idempotence is that: 'Idempotence means that there is no “noise” left in the smoothed data and co-idempotence means that there is no “signal” left in the residual.'&lt;ref name="conradie2006exact" /&gt;

When studying smoothers there are four properties that are useful to optimize:&lt;ref name="rohwer2005nonlinear" /&gt;

# Effectiveness
# Consistency
# Stability
# Efficiency

The operators can also be used to decompose a signal into various subcomponents&lt;ref name="fabris2009lulu" /&gt; similar to wavelet or Fourier decomposition.

== History ==
Lulu smoothers were discovered  by C. H. Rohwer&lt;ref name="Rohwer1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohwer" /&gt; and have been studied for the last 30 years. Their exact and asymptotic distributions have been derived.&lt;ref name="conradie2006exact" /&gt;

== Operation ==
Applying a Lulu smoother consists of repeated applications of the min and max operators over a given subinterval of the data.
As with other smoothers, a width or interval must be specified. The Lulu smoothers are composed of repeated applications of the ''L'' (lower) and ''U'' (Upper) operators, which are defined as follows:

=== L operator ===
For an L operator of width ''n'' over an infinite sequence of ''x''s (..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,...), the operation on ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated as follows:

# Firstly we create (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) mini-sequences of length (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) each.  Each of these mini-sequences contains the element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, for width 1, we create 2 mini-sequences of length 2 each. For width 1 these mini sequences are (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;). For width 2, the mini-sequences are (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+2&lt;/sub&gt;). For width 2, we refer to these mini-sequences as seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;
# Then we take the minimum of each of the mini sequences. Again for width 2 this gives: (Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;)). This gives us (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) numbers for each point.
# Lastly we take the maximum of (the minimums of the mini sequences), or Max(Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;)) and this becomes ''L''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)

Thus for width 2, the ''L'' operator is:

: ''L''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) =  Max(Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;))

=== U Operator ===
This is identical to  the L operator, except that the order of Min and Max is reversed, i.e. for width 2:

: ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) =  Min(Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;))

=== Examples ===
Examples of the ''U'' and ''L'' operators, as well as combined ''UL'' and ''LU'' operators on a sample data set are shown in the following figures.

[[File:LSmoother width=1.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|L Smoother width 1]]
[[File:USmoother width=1.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|U Smoother width 1]]

It can be seen that the results of the ''UL'' and ''LU'' operators can be different. The combined operators are very effective at removing impulsive noise, the only cases where the noise is not removed effectively is where we get multiple noise signals very close together, in which case the filter 'sees' the multiple noises as part of the signal.

A '''mechanical biological treatment''' system is a type of waste processing facility that combines a sorting facility with a form of biological treatment such as [[composting]] or [[anaerobic digestion]]. MBT plants are designed to process [[municipal solid waste|mixed household waste]] as well as [[commercial waste|commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]s.

==Process==
[[File:Mechanical biological treatment flowchart.svg|right|thumbnail|350px|Process flow chart]]
The terms ''mechanical biological treatment'' or ''mechanical biological pre-treatment'' relate to a group of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|solid waste treatment systems]]. These systems enable the recovery of materials contained within the [[mixed waste]] and facilitate the stabilisation of the [[biodegradable]] component of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Enviros (2006) [http://www.mbt.landfill-site.com/ Mechanical biological treatment website], ''www.mbt.landfill-site.com'', Waste Technology Home Page, Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juniper (2005) [http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html MBT: A Guide for Decision Makers – Processes, Policies &amp; Markets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817181127/http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html |date=2007-08-17 }}, ''www.juniper.co.uk'', (Project funding supplied by Sita Environmental Trust), Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

The sorting component of the plants typically resemble a [[materials recovery facility]]. This component is either configured to recover the individual elements of the waste or produce a [[refuse-derived fuel]] that can be used for the generation of power.

The components of the mixed waste stream that can be recovered include:
*[[Ferrous metal]]
*[[Non-ferrous metal]]
* [[Plastic]]
* [[Glass]]

==Terminology==
MBT is also sometimes termed biological mechanical treatment (BMT), however this simply refers to the order of processing (i.e., the biological phase of the system precedes the mechanical sorting). MBT should not be confused with [[mechanical heat treatment]] (MHT).

== Mechanical sorting ==
{{See also|Materials recovery facility}}
[[Image:MBT sorting.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Wet material recovery facility, [[Hiriya]], [[Israel]] ]]

The "mechanical" element is usually an automated mechanical [[sorting]] stage. This either removes [[recyclable]] elements from a mixed waste stream (such as metals, plastics, glass, and paper) or processes them. It typically involves factory style [[conveyor]]s, industrial [[magnet]]s, [[eddy current separators]], [[trommel]]s, [[Industrial shredder|shredders]], and other tailor made systems, or the sorting is done manually at hand picking stations. The mechanical element has a number of similarities to a [[materials recovery facility]] (MRF).&lt;ref&gt;Sita (2004) [http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf Sita Mechanical Biological Treatment Position Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908000656/http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf |date=2006-09-08 }}, ''www.sita.co.uk'', Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems integrate a wet MRF to separate by density and flotation and to recover and wash the recyclable elements of the waste in a form that can be sent for recycling. MBT can alternatively process the waste to produce a high calorific fuel termed [[refuse derived fuel]] (RDF). RDF can be used in [[cement kiln]]s or thermal [[Combustion power plant|combustion power plants]] and is generally made up from plastics and biodegradable organic waste. Systems which are configured to produce RDF include the Herhof and Ecodeco processes. It is a common misconception that all MBT processes produce RDF; this is not the case, and depends strictly on system configuration and suitable local markets for MBT outputs.

== Biological processing ==
{{See also|composting|anaerobic digestion}}

[[Image:MBT anaerobicdigesters.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Twin stage &amp; [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB) [[anaerobic digester]]s]]

The "biological" element refers to either:
*[[Anaerobic digestion]]
*[[Composting]]
*[[Biodrying]]

Anaerobic digestion harnesses anaerobic microorganisms to break down the [[biodegradable waste|biodegradable]] component of the waste to produce [[biogas]] and [[digestate|soil improver]]. The biogas can be used to generate [[electricity]] and [[heat]].

Biological can also refer to a composting stage. Here the organic component is broken down by naturally occurring aerobic microorganisms. They breakdown the waste into carbon dioxide and compost. There is no green energy produced by systems employing only composting treatment for the biodegradable waste.

In the case of biodrying, the waste material undergoes a period of rapid heating through the action of aerobic microbes. During this partial composting stage the heat generated by the microbes result in rapid drying of the waste. These systems are often configured to produce a refuse-derived fuel where a dry, light material is advantageous for later transport and combustion.

Some systems incorporate both anaerobic digestion and composting. This may either take the form of a full anaerobic digestion phase, followed by the maturation (composting) of the digestate. Alternatively a partial anaerobic digestion phase can be induced on water that is percolated through the raw waste, dissolving the readily available sugars, with the remaining material being sent to a [[windrow composting]] facility.

By processing the biodegradable waste either by anaerobic digestion or by [[compost]]ing MBT technologies help to reduce the contribution of [[greenhouse gas]]es to [[global warming]].

Usable wastes for this system:
*[[Municipal solid waste]]
*[[Commercial waste|Commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]
*[[Sewage sludge]]

Possible products of this system:
* Renewable fuel (biogas) leading to renewable power
* Recovered recycable materials such as metals, paper, plastics, glass etc.
*[[Digestate]] - an organic fertiliser and soil improver
*[[Carbon credit|Carbon credits]] – additional revenues
* High calorific fraction [[Refuse-derived fuel|refuse derived fuel]] - renewable fuel content dependent upon biological component
* Residual unusable materials prepared for their final safe treatment (e.g., [[incineration]] or [[gasification]]) and/or [[landfill]]

Further advantages:
* Small fraction of inert [[residual waste]]
* Reduction of the waste volume to be deposited to at least a half (density &gt; 1.3 t/m³), thus the lifetime of the landfill is at least twice as long as usually
* Utilisation of the [[leachate]] in the process
* [[Landfill gas]] not problematic as biological component of waste has been stabilised
* Daily covering of landfill not necessary

== Consideration of applications ==
MBT systems can form an integral part of a region's waste treatment infrastructure. These systems are typically integrated with [[kerbside collection]] schemes. In the event that a refuse-derived fuel is produced as a by-product then a combustion facility would be required. This could either be an incineration facility or a gasifier.

Alternatively MBT solutions can diminish the need for home separation and kerbside collection of recyclable elements of waste. This gives the ability of local authorities, municipalities and councils to reduce the use of waste vehicles on the roads and keep recycling rates high.

==Position of environmental groups==
[[Friends of the Earth]] suggests that the best environmental route for [[municipal solid waste|residual waste]] is to firstly maximise removal of remaining recyclable materials from the waste stream (such as metals, plastics and paper). The amount of waste remaining should be composted or anaerobically digested and disposed of to [[landfill]], unless sufficiently clean to be used as compost.

A report by Eunomia&lt;ref&gt;Eunomia (2006) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/changing_climate.pdf A changing climate for energy from waste?]&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a detailed analysis of the climate impacts of different residual waste technologies. It found that an MBT process that extracts both the metals and plastics prior to landfilling is one of the best options for dealing with our residual waste, and has a lower impact than either MBT processes producing RDF for incineration or incineration of waste without MBT.

Friends of the Earth does not support MBT plants that produce refuse derived fuel (RDF), and believes MBT processes should occur in small, localised treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth (2008) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/mchnical_biolo_treatmnt.pdf Mechanical Biological Treatment Briefing], ''www.foe.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitigated speech''' is a [[linguistic]] term describing deferential or indirect speech inherent in communication between individuals of perceived [[Geert Hofstede|High Power Distance]] which has been in use for at least two decades with many published references.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Sik H. and Bradac, James J. : ''Power in Language: Verbal Communication and Social Influence (Language and Language Behavior)''  Sage Publications, Inc (May 25, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William Peter and Tajfel, Henri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=toHSl37qbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Ng++Bradac+Power+in+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o27ICSXtLK&amp;sig=tHbmqXj0s68-p-ye1JD9ereSDjs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZTQSdGMCs6dkAXf9-jZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA193,M1 Social Groups and Identities] Routledge (1996) Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Gabriele and Blum-Kulka, Shoshana: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAsbd2oi7LMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mitigated+speech%22+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbqYXTVmQU&amp;sig=VrYIEFLQ8TkAo9UnsZS70QHJKRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7pPQScSEJ4iMkAWllOTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" Interlanguage Pragmatics] Oxford (1993). Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hare, D., and Roscoe, S. ''Flightdeck performance - the human factor''. Ames: Iowa State University Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was popularized by  [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', where he defines mitigated speech as "any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm: ''Outliers: The Story of Success'', Penguin (2008) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with reference to Fischer and Orasanu,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Ute and Orasanu, Judith: ''Cultural Diversity and Crew Communication'', paper presented at Astronautical Congress, Amsterdam; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe 6 degrees of mitigation with which we make suggestions to authority: 

# '''Command''' – "Strategy X is going to be implemented" 
# '''Team Obligation Statement'''  – "We need to try strategy X" 
# '''Team Suggestion''' – "Why don't we try strategy X?" 
# '''Query''' – "Do you think strategy X would help us in this situation?" 
# '''Preference''' – "Perhaps we should take a look at one of these Y alternatives" 
# '''Hint''' – "I wonder if we could run into any roadblocks on our current course" 

Gladwell brings up the concept in the context of how crews relate to each other in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, graphically illustrating the degree to which mitigated speech can be detrimental in high-risk situations which require clear communication.

'''Museum anthropology''' is a domain of scholarship and professional practice in the discipline of [[anthropology]].

==Characteristics==
A distinctive characteristic of museum anthropology is that it cross-cuts anthropology's sub-fields ([[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]]) as these are understood in North American anthropology. All of these areas are sometimes pursued in museum contexts (usually on the basis of research work with systematic collections) and all can be (and are) explicated in museum-based exhibitions and public programs. Some museum anthropologists work full or part-time in museum contexts while others are anthropologists (employed in diverse settings) interested in studying museums as social institutions in cultural and historical context. These two sets of concerns—collections-based scholarship and the study of museums—provide the core around which the domain of museum anthropology has self-organized.

One theme prominent in recent museum anthropology research concerns reconnecting older collections of ethnographic objects curated in museum contexts with the present-day source communities from which these objects were gathered.&lt;ref&gt;Laura L. Peers and Alison K. Brown, eds. (2003) ''Museums and Source Communities: A Routledge Reader''. (London: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison K. Brown and Laura L. Peers (2006) ''Pictures Bring Us Messages: Photographs and Histories from the Kainai Nation''. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is the development of museums and cultural centers by indigenous peoples in their own home communities.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Pierce Erikson with Helma Ward and Kirk Wachendorf (2002) ''Voices of a Thousand People: The Makah Cultural and Research Center''. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyneira Isaac (2007) ''Mediating Knowledges: Origins of a Zuni Tribal Museum''. (Tucson: University of Arizona Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly Christen (2007) Following the Nyinkka: Relations of Respect and Obligations to Act in the Collaborative Work of Aboriginal Cultural Centers. ''Museum Anthropology'' 30(2):101–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other relationships==
There is much traffic between museum anthropology and the related, overlapping, and neighboring domains of (general) [[archaeology]], [[museum folklore]], [[material culture studies]], [[historical anthropology]], [[visual anthropology]], the [[anthropology of art]], and the [[history of anthropology]], as well as the [[art history]] of non-western societies and the field of [[museum studies]].

==Journals==
The journals ''[[Museum Anthropology (journal)|Museum Anthropology]]'', ''Journal of Museum Ethnography'', ''[[Gradhiva]]'', and ''[[Museum Anthropology Review]]'' are closely identified with museum anthropology as a field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0892-8339 Museum Anthropology]. Wiley.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gradhiva.revues.org/ Gradhiva]. Gradhiva.revues.org.

Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum anthropology and ethnography==
Drawing upon critiques of ethnographic representation in written genres, museum anthropologists have asked questions about the strategies used to represent histories and cultures in museum exhibitions and related forms of display (such as worlds fairs).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Handler and Eric Gable (1997) ''The New History in an Old Museum: Creating the Past at Colonial Williamsburg''. (Durham: Duke University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (1998) ''Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage''. (Berkeley: University of California Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Related is historical work in which museum anthropologists seek to better understand the contexts, histories and biographies that shaped both the field and the collections that contemporary curators steward.&lt;ref&gt;Amiria Henare (2005) ''Museums, Anthropology and Imperial Exchange''. (New York: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepard Krech III, ed. (1999) ''Collecting Native America, 1870–1960''. (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ira Jacknis (2002) ''The Storage Box of Tradition: Kwakiutl Art, Anthropologists, and Museums, 1881–1981''. (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Such historical concerns in turn intersect with work addressing repatriation claims and broader cultural property issues as these relate to museums.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen S. Fine-Dare (2002) ''Grave injustice: The American Indian Repatriation Movement and NAGPRA''. (Lincoln : University of Nebraska Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Brown (2003) ''Who Owns Native Culture?'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of museum collections as a resource for research aimed at understanding ethnographic and culture historical questions in the lives of particular communities has long been the core motivation for collecting by anthropology museums. Such work has been central throughout the history of the field, but new developments in digital technologies (and the rise of the so-called [[digital humanities]]) together with the transformations that have motivated the new research interests just mentioned have generated an intensification of such work. A general revitalization of material culture studies is a further factor conditioning the renewal of collections-based research in the present period. The fruits of this work include new digital archives and databases, as well as published studies focusing on particular groups, object forms, and collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chacoarchive.org/ The Chaco Research Archive].

== United Kingdom and North America ==
Professional organizations central to the museum anthropology domain include the [[Council for Museum Anthropology]] (a section of the American Anthropological Association) in the United States and the [[Museum Ethnographers Group]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.museumethnographersgroup.org.uk/ Making connections through world collections].

Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom and in North America, most universities that possess both anthropology degree programs and campus-based museums of anthropology will also offer specific training and coursework in museum anthropology. Specialized training for graduate students in collections-based research in museum anthropology (focusing on ethnographic rather than archaeological, biological, or linguistics collections) is provided in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology (SIMA), an initiative funded by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.si.edu/summerinstitute/index.htm Smithsonian Institution Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology].

[[File:Variety of glycans.svg|upright=2|thumb|The different types of glycans produced in different organisms.]]
'''''N''-linked glycosylation''', is the attachment of the sugar molecule [[oligosaccharide]] known as [[glycan]] to a nitrogen atom (the [[amide]] nitrogen of an [[asparagine]] (Asn) residue of a [[protein]]), in a process called '''''N''-glycosylation''', studied in [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/manual/carbohyd|title=Glycosylation|website=UniProt: Protein sequence and functional information}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of linkage is important for both the structure&lt;ref name="Imperiali_1999"/&gt; and function&lt;ref name="Patterson_20056"/&gt; of some eukaryotic proteins. The ''N''-linked [[glycosylation]] process occurs in [[eukaryotes]] and widely in [[archaea]], but very rarely in [[bacteria]]. The nature of ''N''-linked glycans attached to a glycoprotein is determined by the protein and the cell in which it is expressed.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt; It also varies across [[species]]. Different species synthesize different types of ''N''-linked glycan.

== Energetics of bond formation ==
There are two types of bonds involved in a glycoprotein: bonds between the [[saccharides]] residues in the glycan and the linkage between the glycan chain and the protein molecule.

The sugar [[moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] are linked to one another in the glycan chain via [[glycosidic bonds]]. These bonds are typically formed between [[carbon]]s 1 and 4 of the sugar molecules. The formation of glycosidic bond is energetically unfavourable, therefore the reaction is coupled to the [[hydrolysis]] of two [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;

On the other hand, the attachment of a glycan residue to a protein requires the recognition of a [[consensus sequence]]. N-linked glycans are almost always attached to the [[nitrogen]] atom of an asparagine (Asn) side chain that is present as a part of Asn&amp;ndash;X&amp;ndash;[[serine|Ser]]/[[threonine|Thr]] consensus sequence, where X is any amino acid except [[proline]] (Pro).&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;

In animal cells, the glycan attached to the asparagine is almost inevitably [[N-Acetylglucosamine|''N''-acetylglucosamine]] (GlcNAc) in the β-configuration.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt; This β-linkage is similar to glycosidic bond between the sugar moieties in the glycan structure as described above. Instead of being attached to a sugar [[hydroxyl]] group, the [[anomeric carbon]] atom is attached to an amide nitrogen. The energy required for this linkage comes from the [[hydrolysis]] of a [[pyrophosphate]] molecule.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;

== Biosynthesis ==
[[File:Biosynthesis of N-glycan.svg|upright=2|thumb|Biosynthesis pathway of N-linked glycoproteins: The synthesis of N-linked glycan starts in the endoplasmic reticulum, continues in the Golgi and ends at the plasma membrane, where the N-linked glycoproteins are either secreted or becomes embedded in the plasma membrane.]]

The biosynthesis of N-linked glycans occurs via 3 major steps:&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;
#Synthesis of dolichol-linked precursor oligosaccharide
#En bloc transfer of precursor oligosaccharide to protein
#Processing of the oligosaccharide

Synthesis, en bloc transfer and initial trimming of precursor [[oligosaccharide]] occurs in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). Subsequent processing and modification of the oligosaccharide chain is carried out in the [[Golgi apparatus]].

The synthesis of glycoproteins is thus spatially separated in different cellular compartments. Therefore, the type of N-glycan synthesised, depends on its accessibility to the different enzymes present within these cellular compartments.

However, in spite of the diversity, all N-glycans are synthesised through a common pathway with a common core glycan structure.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;
The core glycan structure is essentially made up of two N-acetyl glucosamine and three [[mannose]] residues. This core glycan is then elaborated and modified further, resulting in a diverse range of N-glycan structures.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;

=== Synthesis of precursor oligosaccharide ===

The process of N-linked glycosylation starts with the formation of [[dolichol]]-linked GlcNAc sugar. Dolichol is a [[lipid]] molecule composed of repeating [[isoprene]] units. This molecule is found attached to the membrane of the ER. Sugar molecules are attached to the dolichol through a pyrophosphate linkage&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt; (one [[phosphate]] was originally linked to dolichol, and the second phosphate came from the [[nucleotide]] sugar). The oligosaccharide chain is then extended through the addition of various sugar molecules in a step-wise manner to form a precursor oligosaccharide.

The assembly of this precursor oligosaccharide occurs in two phases: Phase I and II.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt; Phase I takes place on the [[cytoplasmic]] side of the ER and Phase II takes place on the [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] side of the ER.

The precursor molecule, ready to be transferred to a protein, consist of 2 GlcNAc, 9 mannose and 3 [[glucose]] molecules.

[[File:N-glycan precursor synthesis in the ER lumen.png|upright=1.6|left|thumb|Step-by-step synthesis of the precursor oligosaccharide in the ER lumen during N-linked glycosylation: the diagram illustrates the steps occurring in both the Phase I and Phase II as described in the table.]]

|-
!colspan="2" | &lt;center&gt; Phase I &lt;/center&gt;
|-
! &lt;center&gt; Steps &lt;/center&gt; !! &lt;center&gt; Location &lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 
&lt;center&gt; 
*Two [[UDP-GlcNAc]] residues are attached to the dolichol molecule embedded in the ER membrane. The sugar and dolichol form a pyrophosphate linkage. 
*Five [[GDP-Man]] residues are attached to the GlcNAc [[disaccharide]] .These steps are performed by [[glycosyltransferases]]. 
*Product: Dolichol - GlcNAc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - Man&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/center&gt; 
||
&lt;center&gt; Cytoplasmic side of ER &lt;/center&gt;
|-
| colspan="2"|
&lt;center&gt; At this point, the lipid-linked glycan is [[Protein translocation|translocated]] across the membrane making it accessible to enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. This translocation process is still poorly understood, but it is suggested to be performed by an enzyme known as [[flippase]]. &lt;/center&gt;
|-
!colspan="2" | Phase II
|-
| 
&lt;center&gt; 
*The growing glycan is exposed on the luminal side of the ER membrane and subsequent sugars (4 mannose and 3 glucose) are added. Dol-P-Man 
is the Mannose residue donor(formation : Dol-P + GDP-Man ----&gt; Dol-P-Man + GDP) and Dol-P-Gluc is the glucose residue donor 
(formation : Dol-P + UDP-Glc ----&gt; Dol-P-Glc + UDP).
*These additional sugars are transported into the lumen from the cytoplasm of the ER via attachment to the dolichol molecule and subsequent translocation into the lumen with the help of flippase enzyme. (Various dolichols in the membrane are used to translocate multiple sugars at once).
*Product: Dolichol - GlcNAc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – Man&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;-Glc&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
 ||&lt;center&gt; Luminal side of ER &lt;/center&gt;
|}

=== Transfer of glycan to protein ===

Once the precursor oligosaccharide is formed, the completed glycan is then transferred to the nascent [[polypeptide]] in the lumen of  the ER membrane. This reaction is driven by the energy released from the cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond between the dolichol-glycan molecule.
There are three conditions to fulfill before a glycan is transferred to a nascent polypeptide:&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;

*Asparagine must be located in a specific consensus sequence in the [[primary structure]] (Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr or in rare instances Asn-X-Cys).&lt;ref name="Mellquist_1998"/&gt;
*Asparagine must be located appropriately in the three dimensional structure of the protein (Sugars are [[polar molecules]] and thus need to be attached to asparagine located on surface of the protein and not buried within the protein) 
*Asparagine must be found in the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum for N-linked glycosylation to be initiated. Target residues are either found in secretory proteins or in the regions of [[transmembrane protein]] that faces the lumen.
[[Oligosaccharyltransferase]] is the enzyme responsible for the recognition of the consensus sequence and the transfer of the precursor glycan to a polypeptide acceptor which is being translated in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. N-linked glycosylation is therefore, is a co-translational event

=== Processing of glycan ===

[[File:Glycan processing in the ER and Golgi.png|upright= 2|left|thumb|Glycan processing in the ER and Golgi.]]

N-glycan processing is carried out in endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi body. Initial trimming of the precursor molecule occurs in the ER and the subsequent processing occurs in the Golgi.

Upon transferring the completed glycan onto the nascent polypeptide, three glucose residues are removed from the structure. Enzymes known as glycosidases remove some sugar residues. These enzymes can break glycosidic linkages by using a water molecule. These enzymes are exoglycosidases as they only work on [[monosaccharide]] residues located at the non-reducing end of the glycan.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt; This initial trimming step is thought to act as a quality control step in the ER to monitor [[protein folding]].

Once the protein is folded correctly, the three glucose residues are removed by [[glucosidase]] I and II. The removal of the final glucose residue signals that the glycoprotein is ready for transit from the ER to the ''cis''-Golgi.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt; However, if the protein is not folded properly, the glucose residues are not removed and thus the glycoprotein can’t leave the endoplasmic reticulum. A [[chaperone (protein)|chaperone]] protein ([[calnexin]]/[[calreticulin]]) binds to the unfolded or partially folded protein to assist protein folding.

The next step involves further addition and removal of sugar residues in the Golgi. These modifications are catalyzed by glycosyltransferases and glycosidases respectively. In the ''cis''-Golgi, a series of mannosidases remove some or all of the four mannose residues in α-1,2 linkages.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt; Whereas in the medial portion of the Golgi, glycosyltransferases add sugar residues to the core glycan structure, giving rise to the three main types of glycans: high mannose, hybrid and complex glycans.

[[File:Types of glycans.svg|upright=1.4|thumb|The three major types of glycans.]]

*High-mannose is, in essence, just two N-acetylglucosamines with many mannose residues, often almost as many as are seen in the precursor oligosaccharides before it is attached to the protein.
*Complex oligosaccharides are so named because they can contain almost any number of the other types of saccharides, including more than the original two N-acetylglucosamines.
*Hybrid oligosaccharides contain a mannose residues on one side of the branch, while on the other side a N-acetylglucosamine initiates a complex branch.

The order of addition of sugars to the growing glycan chains is determined by the substrate specificities of the enzymes and their access to the substrate as they move through [[secretory pathway]]. Thus, the organization of this machinery within a cell plays an important role in determining which glycans are made.

==== Enzymes in the Golgi ====
Golgi enzymes play a key role in determining the synthesis of the various types of glycans. The order of action of the enzymes is reflected in their position in the Golgi stack:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Enzymes !! Location within Golgi
|-
| Mannosidase I || ''cis''-Golgi 
|-
| GlcNAc transferases || medial Golgi
|-
| [[Galactosyltransferase]] and [[Sialyltransferase]] || ''trans''-Golgi

|}

=== In archaea and prokaryotes ===
Similar N-glycan biosynthesis pathway have been found in prokaryotes and Archaea.&lt;ref name="Klaus_1977"/&gt; However, compared to eukaryotes, the final glycan structure in eubacteria and archaea does not seem to differ much from the initial precursor made in the endoplasmic reticulum. In eukaryotes, the original precursor oligosaccharide is extensively modified en route to the cell surface.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;

== Function ==

N-linked glycans have intrinsic and extrinsic functions.&lt;ref name="Drickamer_2006"/&gt;

Within the immune system the N-linked glycans on an immune cell's surface will help dictate that migration pattern of the cell, e.g. immune cells that migrate to the skin have specific glycosylations that favor homing to that site.&lt;ref name = "Maverakis_2015"/&gt; The glycosylation patterns on the various immunoglobulins including IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgG bestow them with unique effector functions by altering their affinities for Fc and other immune receptors.&lt;ref name = "Maverakis_2015"/&gt;  Glycans may also be involved in "self" and "non self" discrimination, which may be relevant to the pathophysiology of various autoimmune diseases.&lt;ref name = "Maverakis_2015"/&gt;

== Clinical significance ==
Changes in N-linked glycosylation has been associated with different diseases including [[rheumatoid arthritis]],&lt;ref name = "Nakagawa_2007" /&gt; [[type 1 diabetes]],&lt;ref name = "Bermingham_2018" /&gt; [[Crohn's disease]],&lt;ref name = "Trbojević_2015" /&gt; and cancers.&lt;ref name = "Kodar_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chen_2013" /&gt;
 
Mutations in eighteen genes involved in N-linked glycosylation result in a variety of diseases, most of which involve the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Patterson_20056"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chen_2013" /&gt;

== Importance in therapeutic proteins ==

Many “blockbuster” [[therapeutic]] proteins in the market are [[antibody|antibodies]], which are N-linked glycoproteins. For example, [[Etanercept]], [[Infliximab]] and [[Rituximab]] are N-glycosylated therapeutic proteins.

[[File:Difference between animal and human.svg|thumb|The difference between the glycan produced by humans and animal cells. Human cells lack the Neu5Gc cap.]]

The importance of N-linked glycosylation is becoming increasingly evident in the field of [[pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref name="Dalziel_2014" /&gt; Although bacterial or yeast [[protein production]] systems have significant potential advantages such as high yield and low cost, problems arise when the protein of interest is a glycoprotein. Most prokaryotic expression systems such as ''[[E.coli]]'' cannot carry out [[post-translational modifications]]. On the other hand, eukaryotic expression hosts such as yeast and animal cells, have different glycosylation patterns. The proteins produced in these expression hosts are often not identical to human protein and thus, causes [[immunogenic]] reactions in patients. For example, ''[[S.cerevisiae]]'' (yeast) often produce high-mannose glycans which are immunogenic.

Non-human mammalian expression systems such as [[Chinese hamster ovary cell|CHO]] or [[NS0 cell]]s have the machinery required to add complex, human-type glycans. However, glycans produced in these systems can differ from glycans produced in humans, as they can be capped with both [[N-glycolylneuraminic acid]] (Neu5Gc) and [[N-acetylneuraminic acid]] (Neu5Ac), whereas human cells only produce glycoproteins containing N-acetylneuraminic acid. Furthermore, animal cells can also produce glycoproteins containing the [[galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose]] epitope, which can induce serious allergenic reactions, including [[anaphylactic shock]], in people who have [[Alpha-gal allergy]].

These drawbacks have been addressed by several approaches such as eliminating the pathways that produce these glycan structures through genetic knockouts. Furthermore, other expression systems have been genetically engineered to produce therapeutic glycoproteins with human-like N-linked glycans. These include yeasts such as ''[[Pichia pastoris]]'',&lt;ref name="Hamilton_2003"/&gt; insect cell lines, green plants,&lt;ref name = "Strasser_2014"/&gt; and even bacteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18996">'''Neoabolitionist''' (or '''neo-abolitionist''' or '''new abolitionism''') is  a term used in [[historiography]] to characterize historians of race relations motivated by the spirit of racial equality typified by the abolitionists who fought to abolish slavery in the mid-19th century.  They write especially about [[African-American]] history, slavery, the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]].

As abolitionists had worked in the 19th century to end slavery and provide equal rights under the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] to blacks, the new activists worked to enforce constitutional rights for all citizens and restore equality under the law for African Americans, including [[suffrage]] and [[civil rights]].

In the late 20th century some historians emphasized the worlds of African Americans in their own words, in their own communities, to recognize them as agents, not victims. Publishing in the mid-1960s and through the 20th century, a new generation of historians began to revise traditional accounts of slavery in the United States, reconstruction, [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] laws. Some major historians began to apply the term "neoabolitionist" to such historians, and some of this group identified as such.

==Early 20th century: Dunning School==
{{main|Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)}}
Many early 20th-century histories of the abolitionists and of the Reconstruction Era gave harsh assessments to the movement and the attempts by the federal government to force a transition in the South to a new social system. For instance, what was called the [[Dunning School]], an influential group of white historians led by [[William Archibald Dunning]] at [[Columbia University]], assessed Reconstruction as marred by African-American participation, saying that all the state legislatures were dominated by freedmen, that they were incompetent to govern; that they had been misled by northern carpetbaggers; and that these governments of the postwar decades were unusually corrupt.

In the 19th century after Reconstruction, former abolitionists, especially [[African American]]s such as [[Frederick Douglass]], presented positive views of its achievements: gaining of [[civil rights]] for African Americans, and expanded [[suffrage]] to include poor whites. In the early 20th century, [[Fisk University]] historian [[Alrutheus Taylor]] described the period of Reconstruction in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] in several books and articles. [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a leading Marxist historian, published his ''Black Reconstruction in America'' in 1935, challenging the Dunning School. Du Bois stressed biracial cooperation and noted the achievements of biracial Reconstruction legislatures: establishment of public education in the South for the first time, founding of hospitals, asylums, and charitable institutions to improve general welfare. He said the higher taxes were needed to finance the new infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Milton Stampp|author2=Leon F.

==New views of race and slavery==
Beginning in the 1960s, historians writing about slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, emphasized the human advancement achieved by the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of those who had been enslaved. Historians such as [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] and [[Martin Duberman]] admired the abolitionists and wrote studies of them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Duberman, ed.

They evaluated the postwar period as not more corrupt than many times of social change and turmoil in American history.

[[John Hope Franklin]]  argued that Reconstruction had positive elements: most significantly, the [[enfranchisement]] of African Americans, both those already free before the war and former slaves; the extension of citizenship and civil rights to four million African Americans; and the introduction of public schools throughout the South where such schools generally had not existed. Franklin, for example, points to the founding of [[Howard University|Howard]] and [[Fisk University|Fisk]], [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black universities]] that educated generations, as two major successes of Reconstruction.

They went far beyond that in looking at slavery in detail, with changes in ideas about relations between masters and enslaved, and the various forms of resistance the latter used. The development of African-American communities, education and political culture has been intensively studied.

Historians argued that depriving African Americans of suffrage and civil rights, as was done in the South following Reconstruction, was itself a terrible form of corruption. They considered it a violation of the tenets of [[representative government]], as African Americans had been effectively excluded from political participation and public life for decades.

In his 1988 book [[Eric Foner]] dated the beginning of Reconstruction in 1863, emphasizing the significance of emancipation and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. His title, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'' (1988), emphasized the "unfinished" theme in its subtitle, explicitly connecting Reconstruction to the [[American Revolution]], which had been based on ideas about human liberty and equality. His work suggested that Reconstruction had not completed the work of providing equality and rights to all American citizens, even after constitutional amendments to provide freedmen with citizenship. That work was continuing in the 20th century. His book was published after the civil rights movement gained federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights of suffrage and equal treatment under the law for African Americans and overturn state discrimination. Foner did not identify as a "neoabolitionist" in this work, nor did he refer to other historians by that term.

==Usage history==
* The newly founded [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) in 1910 called itself a "New Abolition Movement." Historian [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] often used the term, as did newspapers in writing about the organization.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1975), pp 5, 390&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1952, [[Kenneth M. Stampp]], discussing the new generation of revisionist historians of slavery (including himself), described them as "scholarly descendants of the northern abolitionists." &lt;ref&gt;Stampp, "The Historian and Southern Negro Slavery", ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 57, No. 3. (April 1952), pp. 613-624&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1964, historian [[George Tindall]] said that in the 1920s, writer [[H. L. Mencken]] was the "guiding genius" behind "the neoabolitionist myth of the Savage South." That is, Mencken was breaking with the "[[Lost Cause]]" heroic image of the South and sharply criticizing it.&lt;ref&gt;Tindall, "Mythology: A New Frontier in Southern History," in Frank E. Vandiver, ed., ''The Idea of the South: Pursuit of a Central Theme'' (1964), pp 5&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt;
* In  the early 1960s, says [[Peter Novick]], many historians dedicated to racial equality "were called 'neo-abolitionists'--a not unfriendly characterization, and one which many so-designated embraced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Novick|title=That Noble Dream: The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA351|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=351n}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Howard Zinn]] described [[SNCC]] activists in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as the "new abolitionists" in the title of his 1964 book about the organization. Zinn did not use the term "neoabolitionist," nor did he apply the term to historians.
* In 1969, [[Don E. Fehrenbacher]] in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' discussed "today's neoabolitionist historians, whose own social roles often intensify their sense of identity with the antislavery radicals."&lt;ref&gt;Review by Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''American Historical Review'' (Oct., 1969) 75#1 pp. 212-213   [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1842054 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1974, [[C. Vann Woodward]], a historian of the South, noted that, "by the 1950s a neoabolitionist mood prevailed among historians of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;review by C. Vann Woodward, ''American Historical Review,'' (April 1974), p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1975, [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson's]] book, ''Abolitionist Legacy,'' used "neo-abolitionist" more than 50 times to characterize 20th-century activists and historians.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=sWfgQto81NsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:legacy+inauthor:james+inauthor:mcpherson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F_lDU5FGs5DJAeSkgJgM&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=neo-abolitionist&amp;f=false 57 citations]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1986, historian Jack Temple Kirby wrote, "''Neo-abolitionist'' includes both popular and scholarly liberalism and black history in race relations imagery and scholarship, and a certain cynicism toward white southern elites."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Temple Kirby, ''Media-Made Dixie: The South in the American Imagination'' (1986), p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David W. Blight]] wrote in his book, ''Race and Reunion'' (2001):
::In the end this is a story of how the forces of reconciliation overwhelmed the emancipationist vision in the national culture, how the inexorable drive for reunion both used and trumped race. But the story does not merely dead-end in the bleakness of the age of segregation; so much of the emancipationist vision persisted in American culture during the early twentieth century, upheld by blacks and a fledgling neo-abolitionist tradition, that it never died a permanent death on the landscape of Civil War memory. That persistence made the revival of the emancipationist memory of the war and the transformation of American society possible in the last third of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Blight /&gt;
* In 2003, the conservative ''[[National Review]]'' commented in 2003 "[t]his general perspective on the sectional conflict is already well represented by the Neoabolitionist school of Early American historians, and informs important works by scholars such as Paul Finkelman, Leonard Richards, Donald Robinson, and William Wiecek."[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_24_55/ai_n13606723]{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--who wrote the quote? What article?--&gt;
*According to historian Harvard Sitkoff in his 2001 article on books about African-American education, the term neoabolition or neo-abolitionist is sometimes considered derisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harvard Sitkoff|title=Segregation, Desegregation, Resegregation: African American Education, A Guide to the Literature|year=2001|publisher=Organization of American Historians.|issn=0882-228X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michael Fellman in his 2006 book wrote: 
::Starting in the late 1950s and continuing through the next decade, in tandem with the rise of the civil rights movement, many progressive historians reevaluated the abolitionists, even referring to the contemporary movement for change in America's perception of race as the "new abolitionism."&lt;ref&gt;Fellman, ''Prophets of Protests'' (2006), pp ix-x&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historian Christopher Metress in ''The American Historical Review'' in 2005 asserted, "the iconoclastic historian [[Stanley M. Elkins]] reinterpreted the rebellious slave as a neoabolitionist fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;Review by: Christopher Metress, ''American Historical Review,'' (February 2005) 110#1 p 155 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/531186 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fredrickson in 2008 wrote that "the most thorough and influential of the neo-abolitionist works of the 1960s was [[James M. McPherson]] ''The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionist and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (1964)." He notes that much neo-abolitionist historiography "clearly sides with the radicals against Lincoln," and that in later works, McPherson was more sympathetic to Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George M Fredrickson|title=Big Enough to Be Inconsistent: Abraham Lincoln Confronts Slavery and Race|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDpnUEpbfVwC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=131 note 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Winthrop Jordan]] in his 2008 book on slavery and the South examines a contemporary group of "neo-abolitionist" historians who are "taking seriously again the critiques of black and white abolitionists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winthrop D. Jordan|title=Slavery and the American South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPPdbQQt_rUC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2008|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-199-6|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zeus Leonardo wrote in 2009 the term had uses beyond historiography, saying, "Neo-abolitionist [[pedagogy]] suggests that teachers and students work together to name, reflect on, and dismantle discourses of [[whiteness]]. It means disrupting white discourses and unsettling their codes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zeus Leonardo|title=Race, Whiteness, and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3fzFqjR92esC&amp;pg=PA169|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* [[Allen C. Guelzo]] (2009) notes that Lincoln's hesitation regarding emancipation, "has earned him the execration of every abolitionist and neo-abolitionist, from Garrison to (most recently) ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' editor [[Lerone Bennett]], whose book ''[[Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream]]'' depicts Lincoln as a callous white racist, the kind of fence straddler 'we find in almost all situations of oppression or it.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen C.

*In his 2010 study of 20th-century American literature, David Seed classifies the novel, ''This Child's Gonna Live'' (1969), by Sarah E Wright, as a "neo-abolitionist" novel that "borrows from black nationalist discourse in its bold exploration of the loss of social ground gained in the Reconstruction South."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Seed|title=A Companion to Twentieth-Century United States Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4R0B0rSKmxUC&amp;pg=PA86|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Miller (2012) notes "the neo-abolitionist tone of nearly all the academic literature" on slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph C. Miller|title=The Problem of Slavery As History: A Global Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vtgD3W8sl8C&amp;pg=PA120|year=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=120, also pp 1, 9, 38, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abolitionism in the United States originally related to the abolition of slavery of African-descended peoples. In the 21st century, Lawrance and Roberts have applied the term "neoabolitionist" to opponents of contemporary sexual slavery, whose victims include people from every continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin N. Lawrance|author2=Richard L. Roberts|title=Trafficking in Slavery's Wake: Law and the Experience of Women and Children in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6IMgDjAgBgC&amp;pg=PA164|year=2012|publisher=Ohio University Press|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014, historian Yonatan Eyal argued that starting in the 1950s with Kenneth Stampp "the neo-abolitionist school diametrically flipped the views of the revisionists. It earned moral credibility in doing so, maturing as it did during the upheavals of the 1960s, yet at the same time lost the ability to explain the appeal of Union and compromise as formative influences on America's past." By 2008, Eyal continues: "More Americans identify with the Civil War as a struggle for a 'new birth of freedom,' rather than for the Union, and neo-abolitionist historiography has contributed to that sense over the past several decades."&lt;ref&gt;Yonatan Eyal, "Franklin Pierce, Democratic Partisan ," in [[Joel H. Silbey]], ed. '' A Companion to the Antebellum Presidents 1837-1861''  (2014) p 347&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4727">'''Parts stress modelling''' is a method in [[engineering]] and especially [[electronics]] to find an expected value for the rate of [[failure]] of the mechanical and electronic components of a system. It is based upon the idea that the more components that there are in the system, and the greater stress that they undergo in operation, the more often they will fail.

'''Parts count modelling''' is a simpler variant of the method, with component stress not taken into account.

Various organisations have published standards specifying how parts stress modelling should be carried out. Some from electronics are:

* MIL-HDBK-217 (US Department of Defense)
* SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-332&amp; SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* HRD-4 ([[British Telecom]])
* SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-1171&amp; SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;
* and many others

These "standards" produce different results, often by a factor of more than two, for the same modelled system. The differences illustrate the fact that this modelling is not an exact science. System designers often have to do the modelling using a standard specified by a customer, so that the customer can compare the results with other systems modelled in the same way.

All of these standards compute an expected overall failure rate for all the components in the system, which is not necessarily the rate at which the system as a whole fails. Systems often incorporate [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] or [[fault tolerance]] so that they do not fail when an individual component fails.

Several companies provide programs for performing parts stress modelling calculations. It's also possible to do the modelling with a [[spreadsheet]].

All these models implicitly assume the idea of "random failure". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate, analogous to the process of [[nuclear decay]]. One justification for this idea is that components fail by a process of wearout, a predictable decay after manufacture, but that the wearout life of individual components is scattered widely about some very long mean. The observed "random" failures are then just the extreme outliers at the early edge of this distribution. However, this may not be the whole picture.

All the models use basically the same process, with detailed variations.
* Identify the components in the system
** Such as R123, 10kOhm carbon film resistor
* For each component, determine the '''component model''' to use from the standard
** Such as "resistor, film, &lt; 1 Megohm" or "Connector, multi-pin"
* From the standard's component model, discover what, if any, '''complexity''' parameter is needed, and find the value of that parameter for this component
** Such as pin count for a connector or gate count for a chip
* From the standard's component model, discover what '''thermal stress curve''' applies, and find the value of the '''temperature''' in operation for this component
** The failure rate of connectors may change little with temperature, while that of capacitors may change greatly
* From the standard's component model, discover what, if any, '''part stress''' parameter is needed, what '''part stress curve''' applies, and find the value of that part stress parameter for this component in this application
** A part stress might be the applied power as a fraction of the component's rated power, or the applied voltage as a fraction of the rated voltage
* From the standard's component model, find the '''base failure rate''' for this component, and modify that according to the complexity parameter, the [[operating temperature]] and thermal stress curve, the part stress parameter and part stress curve, with arithmetic specified by the standard. This now is the expected failure rate for this component in this application
* Add up all the results for every component in the system to find the overall failure rate for all components in this system.

Other global modification parameters can be employed, which are assumed to have the same effect on every component failure rate. The most usual are the environment, such as '''ground benign''' or '''airborne, commercial''', and the purchasing quality assurance process. The standards specify overall multiplier factors for these various choices.

'''Photometric stereo''' is a technique in [[computer vision]] for estimating the [[surface normals]] of objects by observing that object under different lighting conditions. It is based on the fact that the amount of light reflected by a surface is dependent on the orientation of the surface in relation to the light source and the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~yingwu/teaching/EECS432/Notes/lighting.pdf
  |title=Radiometry, BRDF and Photometric Stereo
  |author=Ying Wu
  |publisher=Northwestern University
  |accessdate=2015-03-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring the amount of light reflected into a camera, the space of possible surface orientations is limited. Given enough light sources from different angles, the surface orientation may be constrained to a single orientation or even overconstrained.

The technique was originally introduced by Woodham in 1980.&lt;ref name="Woodham1980"&gt;Woodham, R.J. 1980. Photometric method for determining surface orientation from multiple images.  Optical Engineerings 19, I, 139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;  The special case where the data is a single image is known as '''shape from shading''', and was analyzed by B. K. P. Horn in 1989.&lt;ref name="BKPHorn89"&gt;B. K. P. Horn, 1989. Obtaining shape from shading information. In B. K. P. Horn and M. J. Brooks, eds., Shape from Shading, pages 121–171. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Photometric stereo has since been generalized to many other situations, including extended light sources and non-[[Lambertian]] surface finishes.  Current research aims to make the method work in the presence of projected shadows, highlights, and non-uniform lighting.

==Basic Method==
Under Woodham's original assumptions — [[Lambertian reflectance]], known point-like distant light sources, and uniform [[albedo]] — the problem can be solved by inverting the linear equation &lt;math&gt;I = L \cdot n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a (known) vector of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; observed intensities, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the (unknown) surface normal, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a (known) &lt;math&gt;3 \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix of normalized light directions.

This model can easily be extended to surfaces with non-uniform albedo, while keeping the problem linear.&lt;ref name="BarskyPetrou03"&gt;S. Barsky and Maria Petrou, 2003. The 4-source photometric stereo technique for 3-dimensional surfaces in the presence of highlights and shadows. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 25, issue 10, pages 1239-1252. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an albedo reflectivity of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the formula for the reflected light intensity becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;I = k (L \cdot n)&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is square (there are exactly 3 lights) and non-singular, it can be inverted, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;L^{-1} I = k n&lt;/math&gt;

Since the normal vector is known to have length 1, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; must be the length of the vector &lt;math&gt;k n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the normalised direction of that vector.
If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is not square (there are more than 3 lights), a generalisation of the inverse can be obtained using the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~csverma/CS766_09/Stereo/stereo.html
  |title=Photometric Stereo
  |author=Chaman Singh Verma and Mon-Ju Wu
  |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison
  |accessdate=2015-03-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; by simply multiplying both sides with &lt;math&gt;L^T&lt;/math&gt; giving:

:&lt;math&gt;L^T I = L^T k (L \cdot n)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(L^T L)^{-1} L^T I = k n&lt;/math&gt;

After which the normal vector and albedo can be solved as described above.

==Non-Lambertian surfaces==
The classical photometric stereo problem concerns itself only with [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surfaces]], with perfectly diffuse reflection. This is unrealistic for many types of materials, especially metals, glass and smooth plastics, and will lead to aberrations in the resulting normal vectors.

Many methods have been developed to lift this assumption. In this section, a few of these are listed.

===Specular reflections===
Historically, in [[computer graphics]], the commonly used model to render surfaces started with Lambertian surfaces and progressed first to include simple [[Specular reflection|specular reflections]]. Computer vision followed a similar course with photometric stereo. Specular reflections were among the first deviations from the Lambertian model. These are a few adaptations that have been developed.

* Many techniques ultimately rely on modelling the reflectance function of the surface, that is, how much light is reflected in each direction.&lt;ref&gt;Hemant D. Tagare and Rui J.P. de Figueiredo, 1991. A Theory of Photometric Stereo for a Class of Diffuse Non-Lambertian Surfaces. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 13, no. 2. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; This reflectance function has to be [[Inverse function|invertible]]. The reflected light intensities towards the camera is measured, and the inverse reflectance function is fit onto the measured intensities, resulting in a unique solution for the normal vector.

===General BRDFs and beyond===
According to the [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) model, a surface may distribute the amount of light it receives in any outward direction. This is the most general known model for [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] surfaces. Some techniques have been developed to model (almost) general BRDFs. In practice, all of these require many light sources to obtain reliable data. These are methods in which surfaces with general BRDFs can be measured.

* Determine the explicit BRDF prior to scanning.&lt;ref&gt;Katsushi Ikeuchi, 1981. Determining Surface Orientations of Specular Surfaces by Using the Photometric Stereo Method. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. PAMI-3, issue 6, pages 661-669. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, a different surface is required that has the same or a very similar BRDF, of which the actual geometry (or at least the normal vectors for many points on the surface) is already known.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Hertzmann and Steven M. Seitz, 2005. Example-Based Photometric Stereo: Shape Reconstruction with General, Verying BRDFs. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 27, no. 8. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; The lights are then individually shone upon the known surface, and the amount of reflection into the camera is measured. Using this information, a look-up table can be created that maps reflected intensities for each light source to a list of possible normal vectors. This puts constraints on the possible normal vectors the surface may have, and reduces the photometric stereo problem to an interpolation between measurements. Typical known surfaces to calibrate the look-up table with are spheres for their wide variety of surface orientations.
* Restricting the BRDF to be symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holroyd, Jason Lawrence, Greg Humphreys and Todd Zickler, 2008. A Photometric Approach for Estimating Normals and Tangents. In ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2008 Papers, pages 133:1-133:9. ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; If the BRDF is symmetrical, the direction of the light can be restricted to a cone about the direction to the camera. Which cone this is depends on the BRDF itself, the normal vector of the surface, and the measured intensity. Given enough measured intensities and the resulting light directions, these cones can be approximated and therefore the normal vectors of the surface.

Some progress has been made towards modelling an even more general surfaces, such as [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function#Related functions|Spatially Varying Bidirectional Distribution Functions]] (SVBRDF), [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|Bidirectional surface scattering reflectance distribution functions]] (BSSRDF), and accounting for [[Diffuse reflection#Interreflection|interreflections]].&lt;ref&gt;Shree K. Nayar, Katsushi Ikeuchi and Takeo Kanade, 1991. Shape from interreflections. In International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 6, number 3, pages 173-195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miao Liao, Xinyu Huang and Ruigang Yang, 2011. Interreflection Removal for Photometric Stereo by Using Spectrum-dependent Albedo. In 2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 689-696. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such methods are still fairly restrictive in photometric stereo. Better results have been achieved with [[structured light]].&lt;ref&gt;Tongbo Chen, Hendrik Lensch, Christian Fuchs and H.P. Seidel, 2007. Polarization and Phase-shifting for 3D Scanning of Translucent Objects. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2007, pages 1-8. IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pragmatic sanction''' is a sovereign's solemn decree on a matter of primary importance and has the force of fundamental law. In the late history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] it referred more specifically to an edict issued by the Emperor.

When used as a proper noun, and the year is not mentioned, it usually refers to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], a legal mechanism designed to ensure that the Austrian throne and Habsburg lands would be inherited by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI's]] daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]].

Pragmatic sanctions tend to be issued at times in which the theoretically ideal situation is untenable, and a change of the rules is called for.
*The Pragmatic Sanction of [[Justinian I]], promulgated in August 554, on the reorganization of [[Italy]] following the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]].
*The so-called Pragmatic Sanction of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], purporting to have been issued in March 1269, regarding various clerical reforms, was a forgery fabricated in the 15th century.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges]], issued on July 7, 1438 by King [[Charles VII of France]], limited the authority of the pope over the Church within France.
*The German [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1439]], issued by German ruling princes March 26, 1439, accepted some of the decrees of the [[Council of Basel]] with modifications. It has been argued that the name ''Pragmatic Sanction'' is not properly applied to this document, as it was issued by princes subordinate to the emperor without the emperor's endorsement.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], issued by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], established the [[Seventeen Provinces]] as an entity. 
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] issued by Emperor Charles VI on April 19, 1713, by which the Habsburg hereditary possessions (Austria, Bohemia, Hungary, and various other smaller lands) were allowed to pass to a woman (specifically [[Maria Theresa]]) if [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] had no male heirs.
**The Croatian [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1712]], passed by the [[Sabor|Diet]] of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and predating the Austrian decree, allowing the Croatian throne to pass to the female line of the House of Habsburg.
**The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1723]] passed by the Hungarian Parliament, accepting female inheritance in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Charles VI had permitted Hungary to revert to elective monarchy should he die without a male heir; this instrument signalled the Hungarian parliament's acceptance of his choice of successor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt R. W. SETON -WATSON: The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy page 22]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Naples]], issued October 6, 1759, by King [[Charles III of Spain]], governed the succession to the thrones of Naples, Sicily, and Spain, and forbade the union of Spain and the Two Sicilies.
*The Spanish [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830]], issued March 29, 1830 by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], ratified a Decree of 1789 by [[Charles IV of Spain]], which had replaced the semi-[[Salic law|Salic]] system established by Philip V with the [[male-preference primogeniture]] system that had historically characterized the Castilian monarchy (upon which the Spanish monarchy draws its traditions), as exemplified by the inheritance by queens regnant [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]], [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]], and [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]].

[[File:Female pubic Hair (natural, untrimmed) 03.jpg|thumb|280px|Female pubic hair]]

'''Pubic hair fetishism''',  or '''pubephilia''', is where a person becomes [[Sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] by the sight or feel of human [[pubic hair]]. Others may consider pubic hair to be [[aesthetic]] and a characteristic of maturity.

== Culture ==

===Social conditioning===
At puberty, many girls find the sudden sprouting of pubic hair disturbing, and sometimes as unclean, because in many cases young girls have been screened by their family and by society from the sight of pubic hair.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Naked Woman]]|last=Morris|first=Desmond|authorlink=Desmond Morris|chapter=The Pubic Hair|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wa9zntiEKeAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=pubic+hair|pages=192–202|year=2007|isbn=0-09-945358-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young boys, on the other hand, tend not to be similarly disturbed by the development of their pubic hair, usually having seen body hair on their fathers.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; However, to a young boy, the sight of the female pubic region is usually a mystery, and young girls are taught to "guard" their "private area" from inquisitive young eyes and hands. Young girls{{where?|date=June 2013}} are also taught that the sight of a boy's pubic area is rude, immoral and even repulsive.

A United States study by [[Alfred Kinsey]] found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sexual Development in Childhood|author=John Bancroft|pages=146–147|year=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34243-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1080/00224499509551774 | last1 = Okami | first1 = P. | year = 1995 | title = Childhood exposure to parental nudity‚ parent-child co-sleeping‚ and 'primal scenes': A review of clinical opinion and empirical evidence | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 51–64 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1023/A:1018736109563 | last1 = Okami | first1 = P. | last2 = Olmstead | first2 = R. | last3 = Abramson | first3 = P. | last4 = Pendleton | first4 = L. | year = 1998 | title = Early childhood exposure to parental nudity and scenes of parental sexuality ('primal scenes'): An 18-year longitudinal study of outcome | url = http://www.taasa.org/library/pdfs/TAASALibrary52.pdf | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 361–384 | pmid = 9681119 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
In ancient Egyptian art, female pubic hair is indicated in the form of painted triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stuckey | first1 = Johanna | year = 2007 | title = The "Holy One | url = http://www.matrifocus.com/LAM07/spotlight.htm | journal = Cross Quarterly for the Goddess Woman | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval and classical European art, it was very rarely depicted, and male pubic hair was often, but not always, omitted.&lt;ref&gt;Barcan, Ruth (2004). ''Nudity: a cultural anatomy.'' Berg. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1-85973-872-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form, as was the case with [[Greece|Greek]] graphic art.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, Anne (1993). ''Seeing through clothes." University of California Press. p. 136. {{ISBN|978-0-520-08231-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true in much [[Indian art]], and in other Eastern portrayals of the nude. In 16th century southern Europe [[Michelangelo]] showed the [[man|male]] [[David (Michelangelo)|David]] with stylized pubic hair, but female bodies remained hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo’s male nudes on the [[Sistine chapel ceiling]] display no pubic hair. In [[Renaissance]] northern Europe, pubic hair was more likely to be portrayed than in the south, more usually male, but occasionally female.

By the early 17th century, female pubic hair appear in pornographic drawing and other forms of art, such as those by [[Agostino Carracci]]. By the late 18th century female pubic hair was depicted in Japanese [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] (erotica), especially in the [[ukiyo-e]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, Timon (1999). ''Sex and the floating world: erotic images in Japan, 1700-1820.'' Reaktion Books. {{ISBN|978-1-86189-030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hokusai]]'s picture ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', depicting a woman having an erotic fantasy, is a well-known example. [[Fine art]] paintings and [[sculpture]] created before the 20th century in the Western tradition usually depicted [[Woman|women]] without pubic hair or a visible [[vulva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intimatehair.com/Pubic-Hair---Art_1.html]. Retrieved June 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Goya]]'s [[La Maja Desnuda|''The Nude Maja'']] in the late 18th century has been considered as probably the first European painting to show a woman's pubic hair. The painting was considered pornographic for the time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruce|first1=Teresa M|title=Pornophobia, pornophilia, and the need for a middle path|journal=Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law|date=1997|volume=5|issue=2|pages=393–406|url=https://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/genderlaw/05/bruce.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121195746/http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/genderlaw/05/bruce.pdf|archivedate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave Courbet]]'s ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'' (''The Origin of the World'', 1866), was also considered pornographic because it showed the exposed female genitals in their totality with thick pubic hair.

In more recent times, female adult entertainers who appear nude on stage, film or photography more commonly remove their pubic hair. The presentation is regarded as more erotic and aesthetic, while others consider the appearance as unnatural.

=== Literature ===
In the erotic novel ''[[My Secret Life (erotica)|My Secret Life]]'' the narrator "Walter", an evident connoisseur of female pubic hair, talks with clear delight of a fine bush of a [[Scotswoman|Scotswoman's]] thick red pubic hair:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The bush was long and thick, twisting and curling in masses half-way up to her navel, and it spread about up her buttocks, gradually getting shorter there."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another part of his autobiography Walter remarks that he has seen those "bare of hair, those with but hairy stubble, those with bushes six inches long, covering them from bum bone to navel." And he adds reflectively – "there is not much that I have not seen, felt or tried, with respect to this supreme female article."

In like vein, in the "[[The Memoirs of Dolly Morton|Memories of Dolly Morton]]", an American erotic classic, the attributes of Miss Dean are noted with some surprise (she is stripped and beaten for helping runaway slaves) – her spot was covered with a "thick forest of glossy dark brown hair," with locks nearly two inches long. One man remarked,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But Gosh! I've never seen such a fleece between a woman's legs in my life. Darn me if she wouldn't have to be sheared before man could get into her."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book relates the misadventures of Dolly Morton and her companion Miss Dove who venture into the [[Southern United States|American South]] to help with an [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Erotique noire | first1=Miriam | last1=DeCosta-Willis | first2=Reginald | last2=Martin | first3=Roseann P. | last3=Bell | publisher=Doubleday | year=1992 | isbn=0-385-42308-X | page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are [[wikt:Special:Search/capture|captured]], [[flagellated]] and [[raped]], and Dolly Morton is forced to be the [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of a plantation owner.&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite book | author=Library Company of Philadelphia | title= 1995 Annual Report | publisher=Library Company of Philadelphia | isbn=1-4223-6128-4 | year=1996 | page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is written as the memoirs of Dolly Morton after she has become a [[madam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Joseph W. | last=Slade | title=Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | year=2001 | isbn=0-313-31519-1 | page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society ==
Among the upper class in 19th century [[Victorian Britain]], pubic hair from a lover was frequently collected as a souvenir. The curls were, for instance, worn like [[cockade]]s in men's hats as potency talismans, or exchanged among lovers as tokens of affection.&lt;ref name="Slate 2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2238342/entry/2238343/|title=Secrets of the Great British Sex Clubs|last=Perrottet|first=Tony|date=December 14, 2009|work=[[Slate Magazine]]|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum of [[St. Andrews University]] in Scotland has in its collection a [[snuff box]] full of pubic hair of one of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]'s mistresses, possibly [[Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham|Elizabeth Conyngham]], which the notoriously lascivious monarch donated to the [[Fife]] sex club, [[The Beggar's Benison]].&lt;ref name="Slate 2009" /&gt;

Within the contemporary gay community, so-called ''[[Bear (gay culture)|bears]]'' have a distinctive preference for all types of male body hair, including pubic hair, as the shaving/waxing ("[[Manscaping]]") of any part of a man's body is generally frowned upon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Pubic Hair Female and Vagina Labeled infographic.png|thumb|Female pubic hair and [[vulva]] labeled infographics|330px]]
Pubic hair covers the frontal genital area of adult females and males and adolescent females and males, as pubic hair is located on and around the [[sex organ]]s of females and males, the [[groin|crotch]], and on the inner-[[thigh]]s (or [[femur]]) at the top of the inside of the legs; these areas form the [[urogenital triangle|urogenital triangle pubic hair region]] and [[Hypogastrium|hypogastrium pubic hair region]] around the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis bone]]. Although fine [[vellus hair]] is present in the area in adolescent, pubic hair is heavier, longer and coarser hair that develops during [[puberty]] as an effect of rising levels of [[androgen]]s. Pubic hair is an [[androgenic hair]] (or body hair) and is a [[secondary sex characteristic]].&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt;

Male and female pubic hair texture varies from tightly curled to entirely straight. Also, pubic hair varies in colour as pubic hair does not always match head-hair.  Curly or wavy pubic hair is common, even if head-hair is straight, although in the [[far east]] where black straight head-hair is common it is matched by pubic hair that can be described as 'black, short, straight and not thick but rather sparse'.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;&lt;ref name=sherrow&gt;Sherrow, Victoria (2006). ''Encyclopedia of hair: a cultural history.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pubic hair patterns can also vary due to [[genetic admixture]] and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name="Morris"/&gt; Patterns of pubic hair vary between sexes. On the majority of females, the pubic hair patch is triangular and lies over the [[vulva]] and [[mons pubis]]. On the majority of males, the pubic hair patch tapers upwards to a line of hair pointing towards the [[navel]] (see [[abdominal hair]]), roughly a more upward-pointing triangle.&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt; As with [[underarm hair]] (or auxiliary hair), pubic hair is associated with a concentration of [[sebaceous gland]]s in the area.

'''RV ''Song of the Whale''''' is a research vessel owned by Marine Conservation Research International and operated by Marine Conservation Research Ltd. The 70-foot vessel was designed specifically to carry out research on cetaceans (and other marine fauna) using benign research techniques such as passive acoustic monitoring.

==Description==
''Song of the Whale'' is a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter-rigged]] steel-hulled research vessel commissioned by the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] (IFAW) and built in 2004. The vessel was designed by Rogers Yacht Design of [[Lymington]] and built to [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's]] Special Service Craft Rules for world-wide service - the first sailing vessel to meet those standards for 30 years.&lt;ref name="IBI Plus"/&gt;  Ordered from Blondecell Ltd, the subcontracted steel hull was fabricated by [[Tata Steel Europe|Corus Steel]] and assembled by Riverside Fabrication at [[Falmouth, Cornwall]]. The addition of the [[Composite material|composite]] superstructure and the full outfitting was carried out at Blondecell's facility at Cracknore Hard, [[Marchwood]], Hampshire.&lt;ref name="MJ 2002"&gt;{{cite news|title=Steel Shipkit In Tune With 'Song of the Whale II'|url=http://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/vessel-build-and-maintenance/ship-and-boatbuilding/steel_shipkit_in_tune_with_song_of_the_whale_ii|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=Maritime Journal|date=1 June 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112191717/http://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/vessel-build-and-maintenance/ship-and-boatbuilding/steel_shipkit_in_tune_with_song_of_the_whale_ii#|archive-date=12 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel cost £1.5 million.&lt;ref name="IBI Plus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foxwell|first=David|title=Blondecell-built ''Song of the Whale'' delivered to IFAW|url=https://plus.ibinews.com/2004/04/19/Blondecell_built_i_Song_of_the_Whale_i_delivere/|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=IBI Plus|date=19 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
''Song of the Whale'' was formerly owned by IFAW until 14 March 2014 when the vessel was granted to Marine Conservation Research International of [[Kelvedon]], UK. &lt;ref name="IFAW"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramage|first=Patrick|title=A tale of two whale ships|url=http://www.ifaw.org/united-kingdom/news/video-tale-two-whale-ships|accessdate=10 April 2014|website=IFAW|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is based at [[Ipswich]] and continues to carry out the research for which she designed, using benign techniques. She replaced a smaller vessel of the same name, a converted 46-foot luxury yacht, which had been in service for 17 years.&lt;ref name="IBI Plus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;

''Song of the Whale'' carries out most of its research under sail to reduce the impact on the whales and other marine mammals being researched. The focus is on their movement and behaviour. Noise suppression is particularly important when assessing populations of whales as the researchers can listen to their sounds up to 20 miles away using [[hydrophone]] [[Microphone array|arrays]], not relying solely on surface sightings.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; Research undertaken includes work on the problems of whales becoming entangled in fishing gear or in collisions with ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IFAW research vessel to study endangered whales in U.S. waters|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ifaw-research-vessel-to-study-endangered-whales-in-us-waters-158555925.html|publisher=PR Newswire/IFAW|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marston|first=James|title=Our battle for giants of the deep|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/features_2_511/our_battle_for_giants_of_the_deep_1_170862|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=Ipswich Star (UK)|date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Road curves''' are regular bends in [[roads]] to bring a gradual change of direction. Similar curves are on [[railways]] and [[canals]].

Curves provided in the horizontal plane are known as horizontal curves and are generally circular or parabolic.

Four types of circular curves are on roads:
* Simple curve
* Compound curve
* Reverse or serpentine curve
* Deviation curve

==Simple curve==
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-57.jpg|thumb|Diagram of simple curve]]
A simple curve has the same [[radius]] throughout and is a single [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of a [[circle]], with two [[tangent]]s meeting at the intersection (B in this diagram).

==Compound curve==
[[File:Road curve 2014-08-18 12-16.jpg|thumb|Diagram of compound curve]]
A compound curve has two or more simple curves with different radii that bend the same way and are on the same side of a common tangent. In this diagram, MN is the common tangent.

==Reverse curve==
{{main article|Reverse curve}}
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-52.jpg|thumb|Diagram of reverse curve]]
Also called a serpentine curve, it is the reverse of a compound curve, and two simple curves bent in opposite directions are on opposite sides of the common tangent.

==Deviation curve==
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-19.jpg|thumb|Diagram of deviation curve]]
A deviation curve is simply a combination of two reverse curves. It is used when it is necessary to deviate from a given straight path to avoid intervening obstructions such as a building, a body of water, or other significant site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30346">Dr Robert Brill is in the field of archaeological science, best known for his work on the chemical analysis of ancient [[glass]]. Born in the United States of America in 1929, Brill attended West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, before going on to study for his B.S. degree at Upsala College, also New Jersey (Brill 1993a, Brill 2006, Getty Conservation Institute 2009). Having completed his Ph.D in Physical Chemistry at [[Rutgers University]] in 1954, Brill was to return to Upsala College to teach chemistry himself until 1960 when he joined the staff of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] as their second research scientist (Corning Museum of Glass, 2009)

Throughout his lengthy career at Corning, where a four-year directorship punctuated his time as a research scientist, Brill was a forerunner in the scientific investigation of glass, glazes and colorants, developing and challenging the usefulness of emerging techniques. His pioneering work with the application of lead and oxygen [[isotope analysis]] in archaeology led him occasionally to add the investigation of metal objects to his portfolio so that, together, his published works number more than 160 (Brill and Wampler 1967). Perhaps the most famous of these is his ''Chemical Analyses of Early Glass'', a sum of his 39 years of work and now a seminal reference guide in the field (Brill 1999).

Brill is a strong proponent of interdisciplinary cooperation as well as the collaboration between scientists across the world, and has served since 1982 on the [[International Commission on Glass]]. Within this he founded TC17, the technical committee for the Archaeometry of Glass, which lists among its aims the ‘promotion of collaboration among glass specialists in widely separated countries’ and the stimulation and encouragement of glass scientists ‘in developing countries’  (Archaeometry of Glass 2005). His internationalism is aptly demonstrated by his study of glasses from around the world, with his attentions most recently being focused on those from the Silk Road. Here, as with other areas of Brill's remarkable career, it seems he was attracted by the lack of previous study and the need for further development in the field. Seeing a disparity between contemporary knowledge of glasses from the western world and those from East Asia, Brill was keen to add insight to a hitherto unexploited field and, as such, has gone on to contribute a great deal to Silk Road studies (Brill 1993b).

The broad span of Brill's career allows this paper to provide only an abridged synopsis of his métier and published works to date. Focusing on Brill's achievements during the decades after he joined the Corning Museum in February 1960, it aims to highlight areas in which Brill pioneered new techniques and improved existing ones, offering summaries of major publications and proposing sources the interested reader may turn to for more information (Brill 1999).

==The 1960s==
The 1960s saw Brill beginning to develop the analytical techniques that would define the early years of his career at Corning, and yet the scope of his interest within glass remained vast. Indeed, 1961 saw Brill pen a letter to Nature with a colleague, that was a ‘bombshell’, according to Newton, in the field of glass-dating (1971, 3). Here Brill suggested that the rather enigmatic weathering crust found to form on buried glass objects over time could be used to date the object in a method rather similar to [[dendrochronology]], using the separate layers of the shiny lamination (Brill 1961, Brill and Hood 1961, Newton 1971). Whilst in dendrochronology the tree-rings account simply for the tree's annual growth, in the weathering crust on glass Brill suggested the accumulation of a layer of laminate might respond to some kind of annual event of climatic change (Brill 1961). Unfortunately, despite the examples of the method's successful applications provided by Brill, such as the almost accurate count of 156 layers on a bottle-base from the York River submerged in 1781 and excavated in 1935, the technique largely failed to convince and did not see widespread adoption (Brill 1961, Newton 1971).

===Isotope analysis===
The most important of these techniques would prove to be Brill's pioneering application of lead isotope analysis, hitherto used only in [[geology]], to archaeological objects. Brill first presented this idea at the 1965 Seminar in Examination of Works of Art, held at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, but the first widely published account of the method seems to be Brill and Wampler's 1967 article in the ''American Journal of Archaeology''. Here, Brill and Wampler outlined how the technique could be used to [[provenance]] the lead contents of archaeological objects to lead ore sources around the world, based on the isotopic signature of various leads, which relates them to ‘ores occurring in different geographical areas’ (1967, 63). These different areas have different signatures because they are of varying geological age, something reflected by the individual lead isotopes which form only after the radioactive decay of [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] (Brill et al. 1965, Brill and Wampler 1967). While the lead isotope ratios used for provenancing are different, they are not unique: areas geologically similar will yield similar lead isotope signatures (Brill 1970). Furthermore, if leads were salvaged and mixed in ancient times, the isotope ratio will be compromised (Brill 1970). Aside from these two limitations, there is little else that could affect the lead isotope reading an object would yield. As such, Brill's method was greeted enthusiastically and he went on to develop the technique, as well as oxygen isotope analysis, in his 1970 publication. Here he demonstrated how the technique could be used both to classify early glasses and to a certain extent characterize the ingredients from which they were made (1970, 143).

===Chemical-analytical round robin===
Returning to 1965, this year saw Brill launch another important innovation in glass analysis, the comparison of interlaboratory experiments in order to verify analytical results (Brill 1965). ‘Originally inspired by a plea from W E S Turner’, according to Freestone, Brill first mooted his idea at the ''VIIth International Congress on Glass'', in Brussels (Brill 1965a, I. Freestone, ''pers. comm.'' 2009). It wasn’t until the ''VIIIth International Congress on Glass'' in 1968, however, that Brill fully launched his concept of an ‘analytical [[round robin test|round robin]]’, having distributed a number of reference glasses to be tested in different laboratories using a range of current techniques including [[X-ray fluorescence]] and [[neutron activation analysis]] (1968, 49). When discussing his motive for the experiment, Brill aptly stated: 'The truth is that the chemical analysis of glasses is a difficult undertaking and still remains in some senses an art' (1968, 49). By conducting the round robin experiment, Brill hoped the results gathered from different laboratories would help ‘correlate [...] earlier results’ and ‘[[calibrate]] future analyses in reference to one another’, as well as suggest which out of the analytical procedures used was the most accurate and effective (1968, 49). The results of the round robin were presented at the 'IXth International Congress on Glass' in 1971, and showed that, as Brill suspected, there was poor agreement between certain identified elements, and therefore these might be ‘troublesome’ generally across analyses (1971, 97). These included calcium, aluminium, lead and barium, among others (Brill 1971). Aside from their correctional potential, the results, from 45 different laboratories in 15 countries, also provided an enormous data set from which, Brill suggested, the participants could ‘evaluate their own methods and procedures against the findings of other analysts’ (1971, 97). At the time, Brill could hardly have suspected that the data would go on to have such great import, but Croegaard's generation of preferred glass compositions, from statistical analysis of the data, were used successfully by many people until Brill's own reference guide was published in 1999 (I. Freestone, 'pers. comm.', 2009).

===The Middle East===
It should not be thought that Brill spent the entire decade ensconced in the Corning laboratory; he made various forays to the Middle East, including accompanying Wertime's 1968 survey of the ancient technologies of Iran, alongside other great minds such as the noted ceramicist, Frederick Matson (UCL Institute for Archaeo-Metallurgical Studies 2007). In the years 1963-1964, the Corning Museum of Glass and the University of Missouri, following a long history of excavation at the necropolis of Beth She'Arim, conducted an examination of a huge slab of glass, some 2000 years old, that had been languishing in an ancient cistern (Brill and Wosinski 1965). Brill cannot recall who first suggested this slab, measuring 3.4m by 1.94m, could be made of glass, but the only way to test it was to drill a core through its 45&amp;nbsp;cm thickness and analyse it (Brill 1967, Brill and Wosinski 1965). On analysis of the core, Brill found that the glass was devitrified and stained, and not very homogenous, with a presence of wollastonite crystals throughout (1965, 219.2). Investigation of the manufacture technology required to produce the slab, suggested that in order to produce such a slab of glass, it would have been necessary to heat over eleven tons of batch material, and sustain it at around 1050˚C for between five and ten days (Brill 1967)! His initial interpretation was that the glass must have been heated either from above or from the sides using a kind of tank furnace; a hypothesis that was proven accurate when excavation underneath the slab suggested it had been melted ''in situ'', in a tank whose floor was a bed of limestone blocks with a thin parting layer of clay (Brill and Wosinski 1965, Brill 1967). Brill's interpretation, that the slab and its surroundings suggest ‘some early form of [[reverberatory furnace]]’ was the first suggestion of the use of tank furnaces in early glassmaking (1967, 92). The evidence at Beth She’arim encouraged further innovative thought because whilst the slab represented glass production on a grand scale, no associated evidence for glass working was found. Brill had already suspected that historical glassmaking occurred in two phases, the heavy ‘engineering’ stage when the glass is formed from the batch ingredients and the ‘crafting’ stage when the glass is formed into artefacts (Brill, pers. comm., 2009). These stages could occur in combination at one location, or at two differing locales, and the time span of production after the initial glass melt is highly flexible. For Brill, the idea of this ‘dual nature of all glassmaking’ was ‘crystallized’ at Beth She’Arim, where only the raw glass production was represented, and would be reinforced later by the contrasting evidence, where working was favoured over production, found at Jalame, as discussed below (Brill, pers. comm., 2009).

==The 1970s==
Aside from the aforementioned published results of his analytical round robin and his lead and oxygen isotope studies in the early 1970s, the decade saw Brill publish comparatively little, perhaps due to his post as director at The Corning Museum of Glass. Those publications he did pen are largely concerned with the development of lead isotope analysis and are listed in the further reading section. Alas, before Brill could be named Director, however, the museum was to be blighted by an enormous flood, ‘possibly the greatest single catastrophe borne by an American museum’ according to Buechner, Brill's successor in 1976 (1977, 7).

===The Corning flood===
The flood was brought to Corning by [[Hurricane Agnes]], a tropical storm that filled the Chemung River system to bursting until, on the morning of June 23, 1972, the river breached its banks and decimated the town (Martin and Edwards 1977). The Corning Glass Centre was under around twenty feet of water on the lower level's west side, while the museum itself was filled to a water-level of five feet and four inches (Martin and Edwards 1977). 528 of the museum's objects were damaged, the library's rare books were ruined and paper index systems, data and catalogues were all lost (Martin and Edwards 1977). In the wake of this destruction, Brill was named Director, so that his time holding this position, from 1972-1975, would be spent overseeing the complete restoration of the museum. Buechner praises how Brill 'painstakingly' prepared the insurance claim that would support the museum throughout the renovation process and facilitate the replacement of many wonderful objects (1977, 7). Under Brill's auspices, the Corning Museum of Glass was reopened just thirty-nine days after the event, on the 1st August, but it would be another four years before the collection and library were restored to their former glory (Buechner 1977).

==The 1980s==
In 1982, Brill joined the International Commission on Glass, ‘the world’s leading organization of glass scientists and technologists’ according to the Corning Museum (2009). The International Commission functions through various technical committees, among which Brill saw an opening for TC17, the committee for the Archaeometry of Glass, which he founded shortly after joining. The main purpose of TC17, whose members met for the first time in Beijing in 1984, is ‘to bring together glass scientists, archaeologists and museum curators to present and discuss the results of research on early glass and glassmaking and on the conservation of historical glass objects’, as expressed in their mission statement (Archaeometry of Glass 2005). Brill was to chair this committee until 2004 and received the W E S Turner Award from the International Commission of Glass on his departure, in recognition of his contribution as founder (Corning Museum of Glass 2009).

===Jalame===
One of the on-running projects of the Corning Museum of Glass published the excavation report from their many field seasons at the ancient glass factory in Jalame, in Late Roman Palestine (Brill 1988, Schreurs and Brill 1984). Brill was called upon to conduct scientific investigations of the huge amount of material generated at the site, in order to exploit the full potential of the artefacts; after all, the site was being excavated specifically because of its role as a glass factory (Brill 1988). Of the vast quantity of glass fragments from Jalame, both vessel sherds and [[cullet]], most were aqua and green and all were soda-lime-silica glasses melted in highly [[Redox|reducing]] conditions (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Where the melting conditions had been increasingly reducing, a ferri-sulfide [[chromophore]] complex was shown to have formed, thus changing the bluey-aqua colour of the glass to an olive, or even an amber shade (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Despite these colour variations, Brill's further chemical analysis showed the vessel glasses to be highly homogeneous in composition, apart from a clear divide where around 40 glasses demonstrated the intentional addition of [[manganese]] (Brill 1988). Brill conducted an investigation of the furnace at Jalame, nicknamed the Red Room, in which there was a mysterious absence of glass finds of any kind (Brill 1988). Whilst work at Beth She’Arim had eventually found there to be five firing chambers responsible for heating the one tank, the fragmentary remains at Jalame made it very difficult to interpret the furnace set-up, apart from the fact that they believed there to have been only one firing chamber (Brill 1988).

===The Institute of Nautical Archaeology===
In the late eighties Brill was to contribute various studies to the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, following the excavation of a number of exciting shipwrecks including the ''Serçe Liman'', and the ''Ulu Burun'' (Barnes et al. 1986, Brill 1989). Here Brill's own technique of lead isotope analysis was to provide a means for provenancing items aboard ship, and thus determine the ship's origin and her ports-of-call. The excavators of the ''Serçe Liman'' wanted to know whether she was [[Byzantine]] or Islamic, a complicated question for lead isotope analysis as the lead ores of the Eastern Mediterranean share geographical characteristics and therefore overlap (Barnes et al. 1986). Using 900 lead net sinkers divided into six loose groupings, Brill found groups III, V and VI to be Byzantine, that is with ores found in modern-day Turkey (Barnes et al. 1986). Group I, however, was taken to be most indicative of the ship's origin; this group contained net sinkers, but also two ceramic glazes and three glass vessels, all sharing virtually identical lead ores with only one isotopic match, ‘an ore from Anguran, northwest of [[Tehran]]’ according to Barnes et al. (1986, 7).

===The origins of Silk Road research===
Brill's submissions to the ''XIVth International Congress on Glass'', which took place in [[New Delhi]] in 1986, can be seen to represent the origins of his work on the Great Silk Road, the impressive trade route carrying goods from the East through India to Europe. Here, chemical analysis of Early Indian glasses would help Brill not just to determine the ingredients and techniques of production, but ‘to make certain broad generalizations as to regions or periods of manufacture’, and therefore to follow an object's movement along the trade route (1987, 1). For the XIVth Congress, Brill conducted [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) on samples of 38 glasses from India, and the success of his method was made clear when he was able to separate 21 samples away from those made in the Middle East and Europe (Brill 1987). Here the glasses were shown to have mixed alkali compositions, a feature that is ‘rare among glasses from more westerly sources’, and therefore Brill concluded that they had definitely been manufactured in India (1987, 4). Brill also collaborated with Mckinnon to conduct chemical analyses of some glass samples from [[Sumatra]], Indonesia, the results of which would be the ‘first data of their kind from this island’ (1987, 1). The results of the study, which also used samples from Java, another important location for the Silk Road, were hoped by McKinnon and Brill to ‘stimulate a greater awareness of glass in the economy [...] of ancient Sumatra and further new lines of research in the archaeology of the region’ (1987, 1).

==The 1990s==
The beginning of the 1990s saw Brill accorded the Archaeological Institute of America's Pomerance Award for scientific contributions to archaeology; however the decade mostly reflects Brill's continuing dedication to Asian glasses and the study of the Silk Road (Archaeological Institute of America 2009). In ''Scientific Research in Early Chinese Glass'', Brill reflected that in comparison to the knowledge of glassmaking in the West, ‘little is known about Chinese glass and about the role it played in the overall unfolding of glass history on a worldwide basis’ (1991, vii). One reason for this is that glass was never produced in the East in such great quantities as it was in the West but also that archaeological Chinese glasses are often prone to problems (Brill 1991). The difficulties of analysing Chinese glasses were reflected later in the publication where, following the chemical investigation of 71 samples, Brill found that identifying the ‘basic formulation’, or ‘any of the primary batch materials’ of the glasses was still almost impossible (Brill et al. 1991). Brill had greater success in differentiating between Chinese glass samples when using lead isotope analysis, a method that has proven effective in the first instance of identifying Chinese glass as the leads used here are different from those anywhere else in the world (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991). Brill found his Chinese samples to fall into two distinct groups, possessing on one hand the highest, and on the other the lowest, lead isotope ratios he had ''ever'' encountered (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991). As such, he was able to show that despite the striking similarity in the glasses’  chemical composition and appearance, the ores from which their leads were sourced must have been from very geologically-different mines (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991).

Brill conducted further investigations of ancient Asian glasses for the Nara Symposium on the Silk Road's maritime route in 1991, ‘to demonstrate [...] that chemical analyses can be useful for learning how glass was traded along the Desert, Steppe, and Maritime Routes of the Silk Road’ (1993a, 71), as well as providing a more technical discussion on glass and glassmaking in China for the Glass Art Society's Toledo Conference in 1993 (Brill 1993b). Further lead isotope analysis, this time on Chinese and central Asian pigments, was conducted with a larger team for the Getty's Conservation of Ancient Sites on the Silk Road, which saw Brill et al. launching studies that held incredible potential for understanding ‘chronological or stylistic differences among Buddhist cave paintings’, or ‘distinguish[ing] between original and repainted parts of individual works’ (1993, 371).

===''Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses''===
In 1999, Brill published the sum of 39 years worth of results from his chemical investigations at Corning in two volumes of reference material with a third forthcoming (Brill 1999). Brill was reluctant to publish the data without any accompanying interpretation, but he felt that the most important factor was to quickly release the material into a wider sphere, made ‘readily accessible to the scientific community’ (1999, 8). Of Corning's 10,000 research artefacts, the master catalogue contains 6,400 samples, an abbreviated catalogue, or AbbCat, of which is presented in the two volumes (1999, 11). Nineteen geographical, typological or chronological categories of glass samples are recorded, spanning Brill's various research projects and collaborations, from Egypt to the East (Brill 1999). It also records the results of oxygen isotope analyses, reminding us that Brill was ever one for the integration of different investigative methods.

==Brill's legacy==
Since 2000, Dr Brill's interest in Silk Road studies and ancient glass compositions has continued, but his publication rate has slowed somewhat. His years of prolific publication, however, and his willingness to analyse glass from almost every situation have provided the archaeometry of glass with a bounty of reference material, as reflected by the ''Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses''.  Despite his official retirement from the Corning Museum of Glass on May 31, 2008, he returned to the laboratory the next day and continues to work, showing no intention of enjoying a retirement proper any time soon (Brill, ''pers. comm.'', 2009).

'''"Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration's Misuse of Science"''' is the title of a report published by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] in February, 2004. The report was the culmination of an investigation of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s objectivity in [[science]], and ultimately a [[critic]]ism thereof.&lt;ref name="UCS2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Integrity in Policy Making (2004)|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/reports-scientific-integrity.html|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (After it was published, the report's existence was fairly well-publicized by the [[United States]]' [[mass media]].)

== "Suppression and distortion of research findings" ==
[[File:Condoleezza_Rice_Colin_Powell_George_W._Bush_Donald_Rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|200px|Rice, Powell, Bush, and Rumsfeld]]
A central thesis of the report, according to the Executive Summary (on page 2 of the text), was that the Bush administration had behaved in ways considered to be consistent with the following three situations.

# Epidemic altering and concealing of scientific [[information]] by senior officials in various federal [[Government agency|agencies]]
# Active censorship of scientific information that the administration considered threatening to its own [[Philosophy|philosophies]]
# Restriction of the ability of government-supported scientists to freely communicate scientific [[idea]]s related to "sensitive" issues

== "An unprecedented pattern of behavior" ==

In "Part III", the text of the report posits that the aforementioned activities are unprecedented in the [[history of the United States]]. The report lists the following persons and organization who had supposedly acted or made statements to support this claim.

''This list is sorted first by category, then by the order in which the persons or organizations are mentioned in the report.''

* Organization
** [[REP America]]
* Persons
** [[William Ruckelshaus|Ruckelshaus, William]]
** [[Russell Train|Train, Russell]]

** [[Donald Kennedy|Kennedy, Donald]]
** [[D. Allan Bromley|Bromley, Dr. D. Allan]]
** [[Lewis M. Branscomb|Branscomb, Professor Lewis M.]]
** [[Lynn Goldman|Goldman, Dr. Lynn]]

== Recommendations by the Union ==

Page 29 of the report states: "This behavior by the administration violates the central premise of the [[scientific method]], and is therefore of particularly grave concern to the scientific community." It then goes on, in a short section titled "Conclusions and Recommendations: What's at Stake" at the end of the report, to provide recommendations for "restoring scientific integrity to federal policymaking" (page 30). These recommendations (on pages 30–31) include a suggestion for the [[President of the United States]] to issue [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s, and other actions, that would prevent further "abuse"; for the [[United States Congress]] to hold appropriate [[Hearing (law)|hearing]]s, consider the consequences of [[statutory law]] under its influence, increase the amount of publicly available scientific information, and establish an organization to guide Congress in its deliberations in technical matters; for scientists to raise awareness of the aforementioned issues and provide public policy recommendations; for the public to exercise its political influence in a constructive manner.

== Response ==
On April 2, 2004, the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] issued a statement by [[John Marburger|Dr. John Marburger]], the director of OSTP, that claims the descriptions of the incidents in the UCS report are all "false," "wrong," or "a distortion." He said he was disappointed with the report and dismissed it as "biased."[https://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,62339,00.html].

In [[software engineering]], '''service virtualization''' is a method to emulate the behavior of specific components in heterogeneous component-based applications such as [[API]]-driven applications, [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-based applications and [[service-oriented architecture]]s.
It is used to provide [[software development]] and [[Software quality assurance|QA/testing]] teams access to dependent system components that are needed to exercise an application under test (AUT), but are unavailable or difficult-to-access for development and testing purposes. With the behavior of the dependent components "virtualized", testing and development can proceed without accessing the actual live components.
Service virtualization is recognized by vendors, industry analysts, and industry publications as being different than mocking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/04/Service-Virtualization Service Virtualization as an Alternative to Mocking], by Jonathan Allen, eBizQ April 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=searchsoa&gt;[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/2240150279/Service-virtualization-arises-to-meet-services-testing-obstacles Service virtualization arises to meet services testing obstacles], by George Lawton, SearchSOA May 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Service virtualization emulates the behavior of software components to remove dependency constraints on development and testing teams. Such constraints occur in complex, interdependent environments when a component connected to the application under test is:
* Not yet completed
* Still evolving
* Controlled by a third-party or partner
* Available for testing only in limited capacity or at inconvenient times
* Difficult to provision or configure in a test environment
* Needed for simultaneous access by different teams with varied test data setup and other  requirements
* Restricted or costly to use for load and performance testing &lt;ref name="virtual-strategy.com"&gt;[http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2010/11/28/service-virtualization-modern-applications Service Virtualization for Modern Applications] by Gaurish Hattangadi, Virtual Strategy Magazine, November 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term "service virtualization" reflects the technique's initial focus on virtualizing [[web service]]s, service virtualization extends across all aspects of composite applications: services, [[database]]s, [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[Enterprise service bus|ESBs]], and other components that communicate using common messaging protocols.&lt;ref name="testenvsyscon"&gt;[http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/2112838  Managing Test Environments] by Liz McMillan, Cloud Computing Journal, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abvsyscon"&gt;[http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/2110733 Application Behavior Virtualization] by Elizabeth White, Cloud Computing Journal, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stpdbvirt"&gt;[http://www.softwaretestpro.com/Item/5463/Database-Virtualization-For-Development-and-Test/STQA-Magazine-Development Database Virtualization For Development and Test] by Wayne Ariola, ST &amp; QA Magazine, March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar tools are called [[Application programming interface|API]] simulators, API mocking tools, over the wire [[Test Double|test doubles]].

Service virtualization emulates only the behavior of the specific dependent components that developers or testers need to exercise in order to complete their end-to-end transactions. 
Rather than virtualizing entire systems, it virtualizes only specific slices of dependent behavior critical to the execution of development and testing tasks. This provides just enough application logic so that the developers or testers get what they need without having to wait for the actual service to be completed and readily available. For instance, instead of virtualizing an entire database (and performing all associated test data management as well as setting up the database for every test session), you monitor how the application interacts with the database, then you emulate the related database behavior (the [[SQL]] queries that are passed to the database, the corresponding result sets that are returned, and so forth).&lt;ref name="webservices"&gt;[http://www.webservices.org/index.php/weblog/john_michelsen/an_intro_to_soa_and_virtualization An Intro to SOA and Virtualization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122114856/http://webservices.org/index.php/weblog/john_michelsen/an_intro_to_soa_and_virtualization |date=2011-11-22 }} by John Michelsen, WebServices.org, August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="abv"&gt;[http://virtualization.sys-con.com/node/1905782 The Next Generation of Test Environment Management] by Wayne Ariola, Virtualization Journal, July 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Service virtualization involves creating and deploying a "virtual asset" that simulates the behavior of a real component which is required to exercise the application under test, but is difficult or impossible to access for development and testing purposes.

A virtual asset stands in for a dependent component by listening for requests and returning an appropriate response—with the appropriate performance. For a database, this might involve listening for a SQL statement, then returning data source rows. For a web service, this might involve listening for an [[XML]] message over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[Java Message Service|JMS]], or [[IBM WebSphere MQ|MQ]], then returning another XML message. The virtual asset's functionality and performance might reflect the actual functionality/performance of the dependent component, or it might simulate exceptional conditions (such as extreme loads or error conditions) to determine how the application under test responds under those circumstances.

Virtual assets are typically created by:
* Recording live communication among components as the system is exercised from the application under test (AUT)
* Providing logs representing historical communication among components
* Analyzing service interface specifications (such as a [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]])
* Defining the behavior manually with various interface controls and data source values

They are then further configured to represent specific data, functionality, and response times.

Virtual assets are deployed locally or in the cloud (public or private). With development/test environments configured to use the virtual assets in place of dependent components, developers or testers can then exercise the application they are working on without having to wait for the dependent components to be completed or readily accessible.&lt;ref name="testenvsyscon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abvsyscon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abv"/&gt;

Industry analysts report that service virtualization is best suited for "IT shops with significant experience with 'skipping' integration testing due to 'dependent software', and with a reasonably sophisticated test harness.&lt;ref name="kernochan"&gt;[http://waynekernochanblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/parasoft-and-service-virtualization.html  Parasoft and "Service Virtualization" Testing: A Good Idea] by  Wayne Kernochan, Thoughts From a Software IT Analyst, February 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to stubbing and mocking==
An alternative approach to working around the test environment access constraints outlined in this article's introduction is for team members to develop [[method stub]]s or [[mock object]]s that substitute for dependent resources. The shortcoming of this approach became apparent in the early 2000s with the rise of [[Service-oriented architecture]].&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/10tr011.pdf Testing in Service-Oriented Environments] by Ed Morris et al, Software Engineering Institute, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of [[Composite applications]] that rely on numerous dependent services, plus the rise of [[Agile software development]] following the 2001 publication of the Agile Manifesto, made it increasingly difficult for developers or testers to manually develop the number, scope, and complexity of stubs or mocks required to complete development and testing tasks for modern enterprise application development.&lt;ref name="ovum"&gt;[http://www.ovum.com/service-virtualization-is-helping-organizations-realize-business-value-from-testing/ Service virtualization is helping organizations realize business value from testing] by Chandranshu Singh, ovum, March 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in the evolution from stubbing to service virtualization was the technology packaged in SOA testing tools since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/id=356258 Parasoft's Web Service Testing Tool Should Aid Development] by Theresa Lanowitz [http://www.gartner.com Gartner], May 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;   The earliest implementations of service virtualization were designed to automate the process of developing simple stub-like emulations so that composite applications could be tested more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/1283954/SOA-virtualization-gets-real SOA virtualization gets real] by Rich Seeley, SearchSOA, November 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As enterprise systems continued to grow increasingly complex and distributed, software tool vendors shifted focus from stubbing to the more environment-focused service virtualization.&lt;ref name="virtual-strategy.com"/&gt; While stubbing can still be completed through manual development and management of stubs, what has become known as "service virtualization" is completed by using one of the available [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial off the shelf (COTS)]] service virtualization technologies as a platform for the development and deployment of their "service virtualization assets".&lt;ref name="ovum"/&gt;

==Agile and DevOps==
The increasing popularity&lt;ref&gt;[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=devops,agile Agile &amp; DevOps Google Trends]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Agile software development]] and [[DevOps]] has created demand for a new set of tools to deliver service virtualization to communities that work in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dzone.com/articles/the-future-of-service-virtualization-and-api-mocki Next Gen Service Virtualization Forum, 13th of September 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Practices such as [[Continuous delivery]] and moving away from [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[Monolithic application|monolith]] development to more distributed [[Microservices|microservice]]-based architectures fit well with the capabilities of service virtualization. Agile and DevOps teams prefer to work with lightweight tools that have less accumulated bloat and no cumbersome licensing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/big-enterprise-solutions Thought Works Technology Radar: Big enterprise solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sex, Slander, and Salvation (Investigating The Family/Children of God)''''' was a 1994 book edited by [[J. Gordon Melton]] and  [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], on the [[Family International]].&lt;ref name='JSSR'&gt;{{cite journal | first = Robert | last = Balch | authorlink =Robert Balch| title = Sex, Slander, and Salvation (Investigating The Family/Children of God) [Book Review] | date = March 1996 | publisher = [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]] | jstor = 1386398 | work = [[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] | pages = 72 | volume=35 | doi=10.2307/1386398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='OCORT'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/famlove3.htm | title = ABOUT "THE FAMILY" Persecution Recent developments Is it a cult? | accessdate = 2010-11-03 | work = [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] Website | publisher = [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sex, Slander, and Salvation'' consists of 17 chapters made up of essays and research papers revolving around the Family International religious movement.
The introduction was written by [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]].

==Critical reception==
[[Robert Balch]], critiquing the book in a 1996 issue of ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', wrote that the book suffered from a "methodological flaw running throughout the book."&lt;ref name="JSSR"/&gt; According to Balch sources of information were limited exclusively to committed members and Family literature failing to triangulate it with ex-member testimony.&lt;ref name="JSSR"/&gt; Balch also expressed concern about the scholars being subjected to [[impression management]] by the Family thus skewing their research data.&lt;ref name="JSSR"/&gt; Balch concluded that it was a book worth having for the information on the Family but also for the "serious questions it raises about bias in the way new religions are studied."&lt;ref name="JSSR"/&gt;

Richard Singelenberg discussed the book in a review he wrote for the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]''; he wrote favorably on it but identified two flaws he found in the book.
&lt;ref name='JofContempRelgio'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sex, Slander, and Salvation (Investigating The Family/Children of God) [Book Review] | first9 = Richard | last10 = Goddard | first10 = Hugh | last11 = Morgan | first11 = Peggy | last12 = McKay | first12 = Heather A. | last13 = Chalcraft | first13 = David | last14 = Coleman | first14 = Simon M. | last9 = Singelenberg | first8 = Martyn | last8 = Percy | author8-link = Martyn Percy| first7 = B.

Singelenberg lamented the fact that ''Sex, Slander, and Salvation'' was published just before [[David Berg|David Berg's]] death and the [[Family International#The Family (1995–2003)|Love Charter]]'s reorganization of the [[Family International]].&lt;ref name="JofContempRelgio"/&gt; Singelenberg emphasized the two events would be sure to have "profound effects" on the Family.&lt;ref name="JofContempRelgio"/&gt;

James D. Chancellor, a Christian researcher who undertook his own study of The Family, wrote in ''Toward Reflexive Ethnography: Participating, Observing, Narrating'' (2001) that "a number of insightful articles" in ''Sex, Slander and Salvation'' were among "the most useful sources" he had consulted at the beginning of his own research.&lt;ref name="BromleyCarter2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David G.

Bromley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]] in the 2001 book ''[[Misunderstanding Cults]]'' characterized the work as "made-to-order [[Public relations|PR]] efforts (with a few scholarly papers which got in by honest mistakes on the part of both authors and editors)" and just one of the "extreme examples of the literature of [[Cult apologist|apologetics]] that has dominated [[New religious movements|NRM]] research for years."&lt;ref name='integrity'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beit-Hallahmi | first1 = Benjamin | authorlink1 = Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi | title = 'Misunderstanding cults: searching for objectivity in a controversial field | chapter = 1 | editors = Benjamin David Zablocki, [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Thomas Robbins]] | work = O Truant Muse': Collaborationism and Research Integrity | publisher = [[University of Toronto Press]] | date =  | year = 2001 | pages = 48–49| isbn = 978-0-8020-8188-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media Homes===
[[Stephen A. Kent]] and  [[Theresa Krebs]] would later allege the use of "media homes" during the course of the researchers' studies for ''Sex, Slander and Salvation''. "Media homes" were described by Kent and Krebs as follows: "Hand-picked individuals living in these well-funded facilities went through rehearsals about how to portray themselves and the group to media, scholars, and others who might scrutinize them." Kent and Krebs also noted question-and-answer pamphlets produced by the group to prevent members from "revealing sensitive information about the group."&lt;ref name='Compromised'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Academic Compromise in the Social Scientific Study of Alternative Religions | journal = [[Nova Religio]] | date = October 1998 | first = Stephen A. | last = Kent | authorlink =Stephen A.

'''Strephosymbolia''' is a term coined in 1925 by [[Samuel Orton]] to distinguish between itself and "[[dyslexia|word-blindness]]". No reasons were given for what these distinctions arise from, or what exactly strephosymbolia means other than "a descriptive name for the whole group of children who show unusual difficulty in learning to read".&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, Jane. "Gillingham: Contemporary After 76 Years", ''Annals of Dyslexia'' '''49''' (1989): 3-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was subsequently changed in 1937 to specify that, as a condition, it creates difficulty in seeing the ends of written words in unfamiliar languages, especially those in which the letters look similar to each other such as "b" and "d", "m" and "n" and "p" and "q".

{{Infobox technetium}}
'''Technetium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Tc''' and [[atomic number]] 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all [[radioactive]]; none are [[stable nuclide|stable]], excluding the fully ionized state of &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Tc.&lt;ref name="Takahashi et al"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bound-state beta decay of highly ionized atoms|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13335547|last1=Takahashi|first1=K|last2=Boyd|first2=R. N.|last3=Mathews|first3=G. J.|last4=Yokoi|first4=K.|date=October 1987|accessdate=2016-11-20|issn=0556-2813|oclc=1639677|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1522–1528|journal=Physical Review C|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.36.1522|pmid=9954244|bibcode=1987PhRvC..36.1522T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only about 18000 tons can be found at any given time in the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous [[fission product]] in [[uranium ore]] and [[thorium]] ore, the most common source, or the product of [[neutron capture]] in [[molybdenum]] ores. This silvery gray, crystalline [[transition metal]] lies between [[rhenium]] and [[manganese]] in [[group 7 element|group 7]] of the [[periodic table]], and its chemical properties are intermediate between those of these two adjacent elements. The most common naturally occurring isotope is &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc.

Many of technetium's properties were predicted by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] before the element was discovered. Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|ekamanganese]]'' (''Em''). In 1937, technetium (specifically the [[technetium-97]] isotope) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced, hence its name (from the Greek {{lang|el|τεχνητός}}, meaning "synthetic or artificial", + {{nowrap|''[[wikt:-ium#Suffix|-ium]]'').}}

One short-lived [[gamma ray]]-emitting [[nuclear isomer]] of technetium—[[technetium-99m]]—is used in [[nuclear medicine]] for a wide variety of diagnostic tests, such as bone cancer diagnoses. The ground state of this [[nuclide]], technetium-99, is used as a gamma-ray-free source of [[beta particle]]s. Long-lived [[isotopes of technetium|technetium isotopes]] produced commercially are by-products of the [[nuclear fission|fission]] of [[uranium-235]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s and are extracted from [[nuclear fuel cycle|nuclear fuel rods]]. Because no isotope of technetium has a [[half-life]] longer than 4.2&amp;nbsp;million years ([[technetium-98]]), the 1952 detection of technetium in [[red giant]]s, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.

==History==

===Search for element 43===
From the 1860s through 1871, early forms of the periodic table proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev contained a gap between [[molybdenum]] (element&amp;nbsp;42) and [[ruthenium]] (element&amp;nbsp;44). In 1871, Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below [[manganese]] and have similar chemical properties. Mendeleev gave it the provisional name ''ekamanganese'' (from ''eka''-, the [[Sanskrit]] word for ''one)'' because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00837634|title = Technetium, the missing element|date = 1996|last = Jonge|journal = European Journal of Nuclear Medicine|volume = 23|pages = 336–44|pmid = 8599967|last2 = Pauwels|first2 = E. K.|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early misidentifications===
Many early researchers, both before and after the periodic table was published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements.

German chemists [[Walter Noddack]], [[Otto Berg (scientist)|Otto Berg]], and [[Ida Tacke]] reported the discovery of element&amp;nbsp;75 and element&amp;nbsp;43 in 1925, and named element&amp;nbsp;43 ''[[masurium]]'' (after [[Masuria]] in eastern [[Prussia]], now in [[Poland]], the region where Walter Noddack's family originated).&lt;ref name="multidict"/&gt; The group bombarded [[Ferrocolumbite|columbite]] with a beam of [[electron]]s and deduced element&amp;nbsp;43 was present by examining [[X-ray]] diffraction [[spectrogram]]s.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p423"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wavelength]] of the X-rays produced is related to the atomic number by a formula derived by [[Henry Moseley]] in 1913. The team claimed to detect a faint X-ray signal at a wavelength produced by element&amp;nbsp;43. Later experimenters could not replicate the discovery, and it was dismissed as an error for many years.&lt;ref name="armstrong"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armstrong |first=J.

Armstrong of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] ran "computer simulations" of the 1925 experiments and obtained results quite close to those reported by the Noddack team. "Using first-principles X-ray-emission spectral-generation algorithms developed at NIST, I simulated the X-ray spectra that would be expected for Van Assche's initial estimates of the Noddacks' residue compositions. The first results were surprisingly close to their published spectrum! Over the next couple of years, we refined our reconstruction of their analytical methods and performed more sophisticated simulations. The agreement between simulated and reported spectra improved further. Our calculation of the amount of element&amp;nbsp;43 required to produce their spectrum is quite similar to the direct measurements of natural technetium abundance in uranium ore published in 1999 by Dave Curtis and colleagues at Los Alamos. We can find no other plausible explanation for the Noddacks' data than that they did indeed detect fission "masurium."&lt;br /&gt; {{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J.

===Official discovery and later history===
The [[Discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of element&amp;nbsp;43 was finally confirmed in a 1937 experiment at the [[University of Palermo]] in Sicily by [[Carlo Perrier]] and [[Emilio Segrè]].&lt;ref name="Heiserman1992p164"&gt;{{harvnb| Heiserman|1992|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1936, Segrè visited the United States, first [[Columbia University]] in New York and then the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in California. He persuaded [[cyclotron]] inventor [[Ernest Lawrence]] to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become [[radioactive]]. Lawrence mailed him a [[molybdenum]] foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emilio |last=Segrè |date=1993 |title=A Mind Always in Motion: The Autobiography of Emilio Segrè |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0520076273 |pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segrè enlisted his colleague Perrier to attempt to prove, through comparative chemistry, that the molybdenum activity was indeed from an element with the atomic number 43. In 1937 they succeeded in isolating the [[isotope]]s [[technetium-95]]m and [[technetium-97]].&lt;ref name=segre/&gt;&lt;ref name=blocks&gt;{{cite book| title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley |first=J. |location = New York| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = 2001| isbn = 978-0-19-850340-8| pages = 422–425|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yhi5X7OwuGkC&amp;pg=PA423}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery "''panormium''", after the [[Latin]] name for [[Palermo]], ''Panormus''.

They isolated the [[metastable isotope]] [[technetium-99m]], which is now used in some ten million medical diagnostic procedures annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The transuranium people: The inside story|publisher =University of California, Berkeley &amp; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|date =2000|chapter =Chapter 1.2: Early Days at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory|page =15|chapter-url =http://www.worldscibooks.com/physics/p074.html|isbn =978-1-86094-087-3|access-date =2007-03-31|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070124220556/http://www.worldscibooks.com/physics/p074.html#|archive-date =2007-01-24|dead-url =yes|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, astronomer [[Paul W. Merrill]] in California detected the [[Emission spectrum|spectral signature]] of technetium (specifically [[wavelength]]s of 403.1&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]], 423.8&amp;nbsp;nm, 426.2&amp;nbsp;nm, and 429.7&amp;nbsp;nm) in light from [[Stellar classification#Class S|S-type]] [[red giant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merrill |first=P.

This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars.&lt;ref name=blocks/&gt; More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by [[neutron capture]] in the [[s-process]].&lt;ref name=s8&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that discovery, there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in [[uraninite|pitchblende]] from the [[Belgian Congo]] in extremely small quantities (about 0.2&amp;nbsp;ng/kg);&lt;ref name=s8/&gt; there it originates as a [[spontaneous fission]] product of [[uranium-238]]. The [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into [[ruthenium-99]].&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Technetium is a silvery-gray radioactive [[metal]] with an appearance similar to [[platinum]], commonly obtained as a gray powder.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;  The [[crystal structure]] of the pure metal is [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] [[close-packed]]. Atomic technetium has characteristic [[Emission spectrum|emission lines]] at these [[wavelength]]s of light: 363.3&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]], 403.1&amp;nbsp;nm, 426.2&amp;nbsp;nm, 429.7&amp;nbsp;nm, and 485.3&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The CRC Handbook| publisher =CRC press|chapter = Line Spectra of the Elements| date = 2004–2005|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=q2qJId5TKOkC&amp;pg=PT1672|pages=10–70 (1672) | first=David R. | last=Lide | isbn=978-0-8493-0595-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metal form is slightly [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], meaning its [[dipole|magnetic dipoles]] align with external [[magnetic field]]s, but will assume random orientations once the field is removed.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite book| title = The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements| editor = Hampel, C. A.| last = Rimshaw |first=S. J.| location = New York| publisher = Reinhold Book Corporation| date = 1968| pages = 689–693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure, metallic, single-crystal technetium becomes a [[type-II superconductor]] at temperatures below 7.46&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Irregular crystals and trace impurities raise this transition temperature to 11.2&amp;nbsp;K for 99.9% pure technetium powder.{{harv|Schwochau|2000|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schwochau, K. ''Technetium: Chemistry and Radiopharmaceutical Applications''; Wiley-VCH:Weinheim, Germany, 2000.

&lt;/ref&gt; Below this temperature, technetium has a very high [[London penetration depth|magnetic penetration depth]], greater than any other element except [[niobium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Technetium as a Material for AC Superconductivity Applications| last = Autler |first=S. H.| publisher = Proceedings of the 1968 Summer Study on Superconducting Devices and Accelerators|accessdate = 2009-05-05|date=1968| url = http://www.bnl.gov/magnets/Staff/Gupta/Summer1968/0049.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Technetium is located in the [[Group 7 element|seventh group]] of the periodic table, between [[rhenium]] and [[manganese]]. As predicted by the [[History of the periodic table|periodic law]], its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form [[covalent bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form [[cation]]s ([[ion]]s with a net positive charge). Technetium exhibits nine [[oxidation state]]s from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; Technetium dissolves in [[aqua regia]], [[nitric acid]], and concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], but it is not soluble in [[hydrochloric acid]] of any concentration.&lt;ref name= CRC/&gt;

Metallic technetium slowly [[tarnish]]es in moist air&lt;ref name="LANL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Technetium|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/43.shtml|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|date=2003-12-15|work=Periodic Table of the Elements|last=Husted|first=R.|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in powder form, burns in [[oxygen]].

Technetium can catalyse the destruction of [[hydrazine]] by [[nitric acid]], and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-5088(84)90023-7 | title=The technetium-catalysed oxidation of hydrazine by nitric acid | journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals | date=1984 | volume=97 | pages=191–203 | first=John | last=Garraway}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a problem in the separation of plutonium from uranium in [[Nuclear reprocessing|nuclear fuel processing]], where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was exacerbated by the mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-5088(85)90379-0 | title=Coextraction of pertechnetate and zirconium by tri-n-butyl phosphate | journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals | date=1985 | volume=106 | issue=1 | pages=183–192 | first=J. | last=Garraway}}&lt;/ref&gt; and required a process modification.

==Compounds==
===Pertechnetate and derivatives===
[[File:Pertechnetate1.svg|thumb|left|200 px|Pertechnetate is one of the most available forms of technetium.  It is structurally related to [[permanganate]].]]
The most prevalent form of technetium that is easily accessible is sodium pertechnetate, Na[TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;].  The majority of this material is produced by radioactive decay from [&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=127–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nuclmed/&gt;
:[&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  →   [&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  γ
[[Pertechnetate]] (tetroxidotechnetate) {{chem|TcO|4|-}} behaves analogously to perchlorate, both of which are [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]]. Unlike [[permanganate]] ({{chem|MnO|4|-}}), it is only a weak oxidizing agent.

Related to pertechnetate is [[Technetium(VII) oxide|heptoxide]].  This pale-yellow, volatile solid is produced by oxidation of Tc metal and related precursors:
:4 Tc + 7 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
It is a very rare example of a molecular metal oxide, other examples being [[OsO4|OsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[RuO4|RuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].  It adopts a [[Centrosymmetry|centrosymmetric]] structure with two types of Tc−O bonds with 167 and 184&amp;nbsp;pm bond lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Krebs|first = B.|title = Technetium(VII)-oxid: Ein Übergangsmetalloxid mit Molekülstruktur im festen Zustand (Technetium(VII) Oxide, a Transition Metal Oxide with a Molecular Structure in the Solid State)|journal = Angewandte Chemie|date = 1969|volume = 81|pages = 328–329|doi = 10.1002/ange.19690810905|issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technetium heptoxide hydrolyzes to [[pertechnetate]] and [[pertechnetic acid]], depending on the pH:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Herrell|first1 = A. Y.|last2 = Busey|first2 = R. H.|last3 = Gayer|first3 = K. H.|title = Technetium(VII) Oxide, in Inorganic Syntheses| date = 1977|volume = XVII| pages = 155–158|isbn= 978-0-07-044327-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  2 TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  2 HTcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

HTcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a strong acid. In concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], [TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; converts to the octahedral form TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the conjugate base of the hypothetical tri[[aquo complex]] [TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=7|author=Poineau F|author2=Weck PF|author3=German K|author4=Maruk A|author5=Kirakosyan G|author6= Lukens W|author7=Rego DB|author8=Sattelberger AP|author9=Czerwinski KR|title= Speciation of heptavalent technetium in sulfuric acid: structural and spectroscopic studies|journal= Dalton Transactions|date= 2010|volume= 39 |issue=37|pages=8616–8619|doi=10.1039/C0DT00695E |url=http://radchem.nevada.edu/docs/pub/tc%20in%20h2so4%20%28dalton%29%202010-08-23.pdf|pmid=20730190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other chalcogenide derivatives===
Technetium forms a dioxide,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metal dichalcogenide|disulfide]], di[[selenide]], and di[[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]].  An ill-defined Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; forms upon treating [[pertechnate]] with hydrogen sulfide. It thermally decomposes into disulfide and elemental sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly the dioxide can be produced by reduction of the Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.

Unlike the case for rhenium, a trioxide has not been isolated for technetium. However, TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been identified in the gas phase using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1524/ract.1993.60.23.121|title=High-Temperature Oxide and Hydroxide Vapor Species of Technetium|journal=Radiochimica Acta|volume=60|issue=2–3|year=1993|last1=Gibson|first1=John K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple hydride and halide complexes===
Technetium forms the simple complex {{chem|TcH|9|2-}}.  The potassium salt is [[isostructural]] with [[Potassium nonahydridorhenate|{{chem|ReH|9|2-}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following binary (containing only two elements) technetium halides are known: [[TcF6|TcF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], TcF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, [[TcCl4|TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], TcBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, TcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, α-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TcI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, α-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[oxidation state]]s range from Tc(VI) to Tc(II). Technetium halides exhibit different structure types, such as molecular octahedral complexes, extended chains, layered sheets, and metal clusters arranged in a three-dimensional network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3100&amp;context=thesesdissertations|title=Binary Technetium Halides|last=Johnstone|first=E.

TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained by chlorination of Tc metal or Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; Upon heating, TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives the corresponding Tc(III) and Tc(II) chlorides.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

[[File:Zirconium-tetrachloride-3D-balls-A.png|thumb|180 px|left|TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; forms chain-like structures, similar to the behavior of several other metal tetrachlorides.]]
The structure of TcCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is composed of infinite zigzag chains of edge-sharing TcCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra.  It is isomorphous to transition metal tetrachlorides of [[zirconium]], [[hafnium]], and [[platinum]].&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

Two polymorphs of technetium trichloride exist, α- and β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The α polymorph is also denoted as Tc&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;. It adopts a confacial [[Octahedral molecular geometry#Bioctahedral molecular geometry|bioctahedral structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja105730e|pmid=20977207|title=Synthesis and Structure of Technetium Trichloride|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=132|issue=45|pages=15864–5|year=2010|last1=Poineau|first1=Frederic|last2=Johnstone|first2=Erik V.|last3=Weck|first3=Philippe F.|last4=Kim|first4=Eunja|last5=Forster|first5=Paul M.|last6=Scott|first6=Brian L.|last7=Sattelberger|first7=Alfred P.|last8=Czerwinski|first8=Kenneth R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is prepared by treating the chloro-acetate Tc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with HCl. Like [[Trirhenium nonachloride|Re&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]], the structure of the α-polymorph consists of triangles with short M-M distances. β-TcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; features octahedral Tc centers, which are organized in pairs, as seen also for [[molybdenum trichloride]]. TcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not adopt the structure of either trichloride phase.  Instead it has the structure of [[molybdenum tribromide]], consisting of chains of confacial octahedra with alternating short and long Tc—Tc contacts.  TcI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the same structure as the high temperature phase of [[titanium(III) iodide|TiI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], featuring chains of confacial octahedra with equal Tc—Tc contacts.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

Several anionic technetium halides are known.  The binary tetrahalides can be converted to the hexahalides [TcX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (X = F, Cl, Br, I), which adopt [[octahedral molecular geometry]].&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;  More reduced halides form anionic clusters with Tc–Tc bonds.  The situation is similar for the related elements of Mo, W, Re.  These clusters have the nuclearity Tc&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Tc&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Tc&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, and Tc&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;. The more stable Tc&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Tc&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; clusters have prism shapes where vertical pairs of Tc atoms are connected by triple bonds and the planar atoms by single bonds. Every technetium atom makes six bonds, and the remaining valence electrons can be saturated by one axial and two [[bridging ligand]] halogen atoms such as [[chlorine]] or [[bromine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = K.

===Coordination and organometallic complexes===
[[File:Tc CNCH2CMe2(OMe) 6Cation.png|thumb|right|[[Technetium (99mTc) sestamibi]]is ("Cardiolite") widely used for imaging of the heart.]]
Technetium forms a variety of [[coordination complex]]es with organic ligands.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of technetium}}
Technetium, with [[atomic number]] (denoted ''Z'') 43, is the lowest-numbered element in the periodic table of which all isotopes are [[radioactive]]. The second-lightest exclusively radioactive element, [[promethium]], has an atomic number of 61.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; [[Atomic nucleus|Atomic nuclei]] with an odd number of [[proton]]s are less stable than those with even numbers, even when the total number of [[nucleon]]s (protons + [[neutron]]s) is even,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8HSGFThnbvkC&amp;pg=PA547|page=547|title=Principles of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis: with a new preface|author=Clayton, D. D.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1983|isbn=978-0-226-10953-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and odd numbered elements have fewer stable [[isotope]]s.

The most stable [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] are technetium-98 with a [[half-life]] of 4.2&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years ([[Annum|Ma]]), technetium-97 with 2.6&amp;nbsp;Ma, and technetium-99 with 211,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="NNDC"/&gt; Thirty other radioisotopes have been characterized with [[mass number]]s ranging from 85 to 118.&lt;ref name="NNDC"&gt;{{cite web

The primary [[decay mode]] for isotopes lighter than technetium-98 (&lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) is [[electron capture]], producing [[molybdenum]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;42).&lt;ref name="NNDC"/&gt; For technetium-98 and heavier isotopes, the primary mode is [[Beta decay|beta emission]] (the emission of an [[electron]] or [[positron]]), producing [[ruthenium]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;44), with the exception that technetium-100 can decay both by beta emission and electron capture.&lt;ref name="NNDC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics| publisher =CRC press| chapter = Table of the isotopes| date = 2004–2005 | editor = Lide, David R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technetium also has numerous [[nuclear isomer]]s, which are isotopes with one or more [[Excited state|excited]] nucleons. Technetium-97m (&lt;sup&gt;97m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc; 'm' stands for [[metastability]]) is the most stable, with a half-life of 91&amp;nbsp;days (0.0965&amp;nbsp;MeV).&lt;ref name="CRCisotopes"&gt;{{cite book

Technetium-99 (&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) is a major product of the fission of uranium-235 (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U), making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium. One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;disintegrations a second (that is, 0.62&amp;nbsp;G[[Becquerel|Bq]]/g).&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
Technetium occurs naturally in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] in minute concentrations of about 0.003 parts per trillion. This totals about 18000 tonnes at any given time, assuming the mass of the Earth's crust is &lt;span style="display:none;"&gt;6000000000000000000000&lt;/span&gt;6×10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms. Technetium is so rare because technetium-98's [[half-life]] is only 4.2&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years. More than a thousand of such periods have passed since the formation of the [[Earth]], so the probability for the survival of even one atom of [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] technetium is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous [[fission product]]s in [[uranium ore]]s. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1&amp;nbsp;nanogram (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g) of technetium.&lt;ref name=blocks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ac961159q|title = Analysis of Naturally Produced Technetium and Plutonium in Geologic Materials|date = 1997|last1 = Dixon|first1 = P.|journal = Analytical Chemistry|volume = 69|pages = 1692–9|last2 = Curtis|first2 = David B.|last3 = Musgrave|first3 = John|last4 = Roensch|first4 = Fred|last5 = Roach|first5 = Jeff|last6 = Rokop|first6 = Don|issue = 9|pmid = 21639292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00282-8|title =Nature's uncommon elements: plutonium and technetium|first4 =Jan|last4 =Cramer|first3 =Paul|last3 =Dixon|first2 =June|date=1999|last2 =Fabryka-Martin|last1=Curtis|first1=D.|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume =63|pages =275|bibcode=1999GeCoA..63..275C|issue =2|url =https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc704244/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[red giant]] stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| first=C.

===Fission waste product===
In contrast to the rare natural occurrence, bulk quantities of technetium-99 are produced each year from [[spent nuclear fuel|spent nuclear fuel rods]], which contain various fission products. The fission of a gram of [[uranium-235]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s yields 27&amp;nbsp;mg of technetium-99, giving technetium a [[fission product yield]] of 6.1%.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; Other [[fissile]] isotopes produce similar yields of technetium, such as 4.9% from [[uranium-233]] and 6.21% from [[plutonium-239]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=374–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An estimated 49,000&amp;nbsp;T[[Becquerel|Bq]] (78&amp;nbsp;[[tonne|metric tons]]) of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors between 1983 and 1994, by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium.&lt;ref name="yoshihara"&gt;{{cite book| first = K.|last = Yoshihara| chapter = Technetium in the Environment| title = Topics in Current Chemistry: Technetium and Rhenium| volume = 176|editor = K.

Technetium-99 is produced by the [[nuclear fission]] of both uranium-235 and plutonium-239. It is therefore present in [[radioactive waste]] and in the [[nuclear fallout]] of [[nuclear weapon|fission bomb]] explosions. Its decay, measured in [[becquerel]]s per amount of spent fuel, is the dominant contributor to nuclear waste radioactivity after about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years after the creation of the nuclear waste.&lt;ref name="yoshihara"/&gt; From 1945 to 1994, an estimated 160&amp;nbsp;T[[Becquerel|Bq]] (about 250&amp;nbsp;kg) of technetium-99 was released into the environment during atmospheric [[nuclear test]]s.&lt;ref name="yoshihara"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QLHr-UYWoo8C&amp;pg=PA69|page=69|title=Technetium in the environment|last1=Desmet |first1=G. |last2=Myttenaere |first2=C.|publisher=Springer|date=1986|isbn=978-0-85334-421-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of technetium-99 from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to 1986 is on the order of 1000&amp;nbsp;TBq (about 1600&amp;nbsp;kg), primarily by [[nuclear fuel reprocessing]]; most of this was discharged into the sea. Reprocessing methods have reduced emissions since then, but as of 2005 the primary release of technetium-99 into the environment is by the [[Sellafield]] plant, which released an estimated 550&amp;nbsp;TBq (about 900&amp;nbsp;kg) from 1995–1999 into the [[Irish Sea]].&lt;ref name=leon&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.radiochem.org/paper/JN63/jn6326.pdf|journal=Journal of Nuclear and Radiochemical Sciences|volume=6|issue=3|pages=253–259|date=2005|title=99Tc in the Environment: Sources, Distribution and Methods|last=Garcia-Leon |first=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to 90&amp;nbsp;TBq (about 140&amp;nbsp;kg) per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Technetium-99 Behaviour in the Terrestrial Environment&amp;nbsp;— Field Observations and Radiotracer Experiments|first = K.|last = Tagami|journal=Journal of Nuclear and Radiochemical Sciences|volume = 4|pages= A1–A8|date = 2003|doi=10.14494/jnrs2000.4.a1|url= https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnrs2000/4/1/4_1_A1/_pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discharge of technetium into the sea resulted in contamination of some seafood with minuscule quantities of this element.

===Fission product for commercial use===
The [[Metastability|metastable]] isotope technetium-99m is continuously produced as a [[fission product]] from the fission of uranium or [[plutonium]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s:

Because used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing, all molybdenum-99 and technetium-99m is decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the major [[actinide]]s in conventional [[nuclear reprocessing]]. The liquid left after plutonium–uranium extraction ([[PUREX]]) contains a high concentration of technetium as {{chem|TcO|4|-}} but almost all of this is technetium-99, not technetium-99m.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost two-thirds of the world's supply comes from two reactors; the [[National Research Universal Reactor]] at [[Chalk River Laboratories]]  in Ontario, Canada, and the [[Petten nuclear reactor|High Flux Reactor]] at [[Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group]] in Petten, Netherlands.

The two new Canadian [[Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice Experiment]] reactors planned and built to produce 200% of the demand of technetium-99m relieved all other producers from building their own reactors. With the cancellation of the already tested reactors in 2008, the future supply of technetium-99m became problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Gregory S. | last2 = Maddahi | first2 = Jamshid | title = The technetium shortage | journal = [[Journal of Nuclear Cardiology]] | volume = 17 | pages = 993–8 | date = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s12350-010-9281-8 | issue = 6 | pmid=20717761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste disposal===
The long half-life of technetium-99 and its potential to form [[anionic]] species creates a major concern for long-term [[High-level radioactive waste management|disposal of radioactive waste]]. Many of the processes designed to remove fission products in reprocessing plants aim at [[cationic]] species such as [[caesium]] (e.g., [[caesium-137]]) and [[strontium]] (e.g., [[strontium-90]]). Hence the pertechnetate escapes through those processes. Current disposal options favor [[geological repository|burial]] in continental, geologically stable rock. The primary danger with such practice is the likelihood that the waste will contact water, which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment. The anionic pertechnetate and [[iodide]] tend not to adsorb into the surfaces of minerals, and are likely to be washed away. By comparison [[plutonium]], [[uranium]], and [[caesium]]  tend to bind to soil particles. Technetium could be immobilized by some environments, such as microbial activity in lake bottom sediments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = Konstantin E. | last2 = Firsova | first2 = E.

An alternative disposal method, [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]], has been demonstrated at [[CERN]] for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with [[neutron]]s to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16&amp;nbsp;seconds) which decays by beta decay to [[ruthenium]]-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the [[minor actinide]]s such as [[americium]] and [[curium]] are present in the target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more [[fission product]]s which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374&amp;nbsp;days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000XT88.txt|title=Alternative disposal concepts for high-level and transuranic radioactive waste disposal|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|date=1979|author=Altomare, P|last2=Bernardi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual separation of technetium-99 from spent nuclear fuel is a long process. During [[nuclear reprocessing|fuel reprocessing]], it comes out as a component of the highly radioactive waste liquid. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long-lived isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes feasible.

[[Technetium-99m]] ("m" indicates that this is a [[Nuclear isomer#Metastable isomers|metastable]] nuclear isomer) is used in radioactive isotope [[nuclear medicine|medical tests]]. For example, Technetium-99m is a [[radioactive tracer]] that medical imaging equipment tracks in the human body.&lt;ref name=blocks/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-20150530/&gt; It is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|keV]] [[gamma ray]]s, and its half-life is 6.01&amp;nbsp;hours (meaning that about 94% of it decays to technetium-99 in 24&amp;nbsp;hours).&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; The chemistry of technetium allows it to be bound to a variety of biochemical compounds, each of which determines how it is metabolized and deposited in the body, and this single isotope can be used for a multitude of diagnostic tests. More than 50 common [[radiopharmaceuticals]] are based on technetium-99m for imaging and functional studies of the [[Human brain|brain]], heart muscle, [[thyroid]], [[Human lung|lungs]], [[liver]], [[gall bladder]], [[kidney]]s, [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], [[blood]], and [[tumor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer-lived isotope, technetium-95m with a half-life of 61&amp;nbsp;days, is used as a [[radioactive tracer]] to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=12–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial and chemical===
Technetium-99 decays almost entirely by beta decay, emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is used for equipment calibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and [[nanotechnology|nanoscale]] [[nuclear battery|nuclear batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 2006-11-30|title = University Research Program in Robotics REPORT|publisher = University of Florida|url = http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/895620-n4Nt3U/895620.PDF|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[rhenium]] and [[palladium]], technetium can serve as a [[catalyst]]. In processes such as the [[dehydrogenation]] of [[isopropyl alcohol]], it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When steel is immersed in water, adding a small concentration (55&amp;nbsp;[[parts per notation|ppm]]) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) to the water protects the [[steel]] from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to {{convert|250|C|K|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=corr&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, pertechnetate has been used as an anodic [[corrosion]] inhibitor for steel, although technetium's radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self-contained systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Ch. 14 Separation Techniques |date=July 2004 |title=EPA: 402-b-04-001b-14-final |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |chapter-url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/marlap/402-b-04-001b-14-final.pdf |chapter-format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308042639/http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/marlap/402-b-04-001b-14-final.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While (for example) {{chem|CrO|4|2-}} can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20&amp;nbsp;years and was still uncorroded.&lt;ref name=corr/&gt; The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer ([[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]). One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium [[oxide|dioxide]] which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. ([[Activated carbon]] can also be used for the same purpose.) The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.&lt;ref name=s91/&gt;

As noted, the radioactive nature of technetium (3&amp;nbsp;MBq/L at the concentrations required) makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations. Nevertheless, corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in [[boiling water reactor]]s.&lt;ref name=s91&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Technetium plays no natural biological role and is not normally found in the human body.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15&amp;nbsp;µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QLHr-UYWoo8C&amp;pg=PA392|pages=392–395|title=Technetium in the environment|author=Desmet, G.|author2=Myttenaere, C.|author3=Commission of the European Communities.

Office of Health and Environmental Research|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-85334-421-6|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) is a function of compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|pp=371–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All isotopes of technetium must be handled carefully. The most common isotope, technetium-99, is a weak beta emitter; such radiation is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware. &lt;!-- NEEDS CITE Soft [[X-ray]]s are emitted when the beta particles are stopped, but as long as the body is kept more than {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} away these should pose no problem. /NEEDS CITE --&gt; The primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust; such [[radioactive contamination]] in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk. For most work, careful handling in a [[fume hood]] is sufficient, and a [[glove box]] is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Page from The Indian Antiquary.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cover page of a 1931 edition of ''The Indian Antiquary'']]
'''''The Indian Antiquary, A journal of oriental research in archaeology, history, literature, language, philosophy, religion, folklore, &amp;c, &amp;c,''''' (subtitle varies) was a journal of original research relating to India, published between 1872 and 1933. It was founded by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India and was notable for the high quality of its epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts that in many cases remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian [[folklore]]. It was succeeded by ''The New Indian Antiquary'' (1938-47) and the ''Indian Antiquary'' (1964-71).

==History==
''The Indian Antiquary'' was founded in 1872 by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] as a journal of original research relating to India. It was designed to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India.&lt;ref name=Pros&gt;[http://indianhistorybooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/indian-antiquary-vol-i-1872.pdf Prospectus] in ''The Indian Antiquary'', Part 1, 5 January 1872, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Indian Antiquary" in ''[[The Antiquaries Journal]]'', Vol. 2, No. 2, April 1922, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal was a private venture,&lt;ref name=Temp&gt;[[Richard Carnac Temple|Temple, Richard Carnac]]. (1922) ''[https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofthei00temprich Fifty years of The Indian Antiquary]''. Mazgaon, Bombay: B. Miller, British India Press, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; although no contributor or editor was ever paid for their work and the editors often had to support the publication out of their own pockets.&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt; Burgess was the first editor and he continued in that role until the end of 1884 when failing eyesight forced him to hand over to John Faithfull Fleet and [[Richard Carnac Temple]].&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt;

The late nineteenth century was marked by a great increase in the number of local historical societies in India and a similar increase in the number of Indians who could speak and write English, to the extent that by the 1920s the entire journal could have been filled with work by Indian contributors.&lt;ref name="Temple, p. 7"/&gt; Volumes for 1925 to 1932 were published under the authority of the Council of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] (1933, not).&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; The first incarnation of the ''Antiquary'' ceased publication in 1933 with volume 62, number 783 (Dec. 1933),&lt;ref name=sun&gt;[http://suncat.ac.uk/serials/SC00623823801/all ''Indian antiquary''.] Suncat.

Retrieved 9 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''New Indian Antiquary''''' was published between 1938&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120202 ''New Indian Antiquary''.] South Asia Archive, 2014. Retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1947, and the '''''Indian Antiquary''''' (described as the "third series") between 1964 and 1971.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;''Indian Antiquary'', British Library catalogue search, 29 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Volumes 14 to 62 of the original ''Antiquary'' were described as the "second series".)&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Antiquary'', British Library catalogue search, 10 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The journal had an archaeological and historical focus, and in the late nineteenth century that naturally meant that [[epigraphy]] (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages.&lt;ref name=Sal&gt;{{cite book|author=Salomon, Richard (1998)|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA219|date=|location= New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Antiquary'' was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the ''[[Epigraphia Indica]]'', was published as a quarterly supplement to the ''Antiquary'' between 1892 and 1920.&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt;

The ''Antiquary'' was printed at [[Mazgaon]], Bombay, by the [[Bombay Education Society]] and later the British India Press, but illustrations were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6/&gt; A high standard of reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6&gt;Temple, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations in the ''Antiquary'' were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, [[Bhagvanlal Indraji]], [[Georg Bühler]], [[John Faithfull Fleet]], Eggeling and B. Lewis Rice to decipher important inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_aboutus_history.asp ''History'',] [[Archaeological Survey of India]], 2011. Retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and in many cases their translations remain the definitive versions to this day.&lt;ref name=Sal/&gt;

Over one thousand plates were included in ''The Indian Antiquary'' and the ''Epigraphia Indica'' over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6/&gt;

Another area where the ''Antiquary'' led was in recording folklore and folktales. Its publication of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] folktales was the first attempt to classify the events on which folk tales were based&lt;ref name="Temple, p. 7"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/fiftyyearsofthei00temprich#page/6/mode/2up Temple, p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the pioneering work on north Indian folklore of [[William Crooke]] and [[Ram Gharib Chaube|Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube]] was printed in its pages.&lt;ref name="CrookeChaube2002"&gt;"Introduction" by Sadhana Naithani in {{cite book|author1=William Crooke|author2=Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube|author3=|title=Folktales from Northern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcK2l0yE1OsC&amp;pg=PT38|date=2002|location=Santa Barbara|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-698-9|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The War for Late Night: When Leno Went Early and Television Went Crazy''''' is a 2010 [[non-fiction]] book written by ''[[The New York Times]]'' media reporter Bill Carter. It chronicles the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|2010 conflict]] surrounding the American late-night talk show ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' involving [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[Jay Leno]]. It is a sequel to Carter's 1994 book ''[[The Late Shift (book)|The Late Shift]]'', which detailed the struggle  for the hosting spot on ''The Tonight Show'' between [[David Letterman]] and [[Jay Leno]] in the early 1990s following the retirement of [[Johnny Carson]]. It was first published on November 4, 2010, by [[Viking Press]].

The book received a generally favorable reception from reviewers including ''[[Associated Press]]'', ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', ''[[New York Magazine]]'', ''[[Star Tribune]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[New York Post]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and [[ABC News]]. The ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' said, "''The War for Late Night''&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;offers an exhaustive, eye-opening, how-could-he-possibly-know-that look at the late-night feud that ultimately was a muddled victory for Leno: He won back ''The Tonight Show'', but his ratings have fallen below O'Brien's."&lt;ref name="christopherlawrence" /&gt;

==Background==
Author Bill Carter previously wrote ''[[The Late Shift (book)|The Late Shift]]'', a book about the 1992 conflict between Jay Leno and David Letterman to decide who would succeed [[Johnny Carson]] as host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101107/LIFE/11070318/-1/NEWSMAP|accessdate=2010-11-08|date=November 7, 2010|title=Conan O'Brien's big night|work=Cape Cod Times|publisher=www.capecodonline.com|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well received by critics from publications including ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'',&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Katz| first=Jon|title=The Late Shift|journal=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|volume=99|page=11|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]| date =February 20, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Campbell| first=Kim|title=The Late Shift|journal=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] (Eastern edition)|page=17| date = March 11, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I obviously have to reach out to all sides", he said. "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as I could to get sense of each show, and what each guy does. I don't just pick one and stick with that guy."&lt;ref name="gillianreagan" /&gt; Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy.&lt;ref name="juliemiller" /&gt; He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave him the benefit of familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressnightout.com/2010/11/bill-carter-the-war-for-late-night/|accessdate=2010-11-09|date=November 8, 2010|title=All's Fair in Love and TV: Bill Carter, 'The War for Late Night'|work=Express Night Out|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC executives tried to solve the problem so that both Leno and O'Brien would keep their jobs.&lt;ref name="nealjustin" /&gt; [[Jeff Gaspin]], the chairman of [[NBC Universal Television]], instructed both parties that he did not wish to make a difficult decision but that the most appropriate solution was to move Leno back to his previous timeslot and push O'Brien to 12:05.&lt;ref name="jackmirkinson"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jack|last=Mirkinson|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=October 28, 2010|title=Conan Vs.

Carter writes about how the "Team Coco" movement and fans impacted O'Brien following the controversy, "The outpouring of support made Conan feel as if he was starring in his own version of the movie ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', both because he was allowed to see a 'Tonight Show' where he never existed and because the support made him realize he really was 'the richest man in town.'"&lt;ref name="marikar" /&gt; O'Brien was hurt by the fact that Leno did not communicate directly with him during the fiasco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A40AU20101105|accessdate=2010-11-08|work=[[Reuters]]|publisher=www.reuters.com|date=November 4, 2010|title=Conan won't invite Jay on new show, except to sing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter also says that compared to the eventual payout to O'Brien of $45 million, NBC would have suffered a financial loss of $235 million if O'Brien had left the company in 2004 to host a talk show for another network.&lt;ref name="windolf" /&gt; O'Brien moved from NBC to host his own late night program on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[Good Morning America]]|title=Excerpt: 'The War for Late Night' By Bill Carter|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=November 8, 2010|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/gma-book-excerpt-war-late-night-bill-carter/story?id=12066165|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's work concludes with an interview from comic [[Jerry Seinfeld]], who favored Leno; Seinfeld argues that O'Brien should have remained at NBC.&lt;ref name="ricenov4"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Lynette|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 3, 2010|title=Book Review, The War for Late Night (2010), Bill Carter|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20439043,00.html|accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Writing for ''[[New York Post]]'', Larry Getlen wrote, "Veteran journalist Bill Carter details the vicious recent battle over ''The Tonight Show'', showing how Leno was hardly the devious schemer he was made out to be, and how O’Brien was not always the angelic innocent the media portrayed, as he and his team aggressively pursued the show at every opportunity."&lt;ref name="getlen"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Post]]|first=Larry|last=Getlen|title=The war for late night: In ‘Tonight Show’ battle, Leno wasn’t always the bad guy|date=October 16, 2010|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/books/the_war_for_late_night_Kd9hc34c5RgPMmdiXOWTRL|accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Bershad of ''[[Mediaite]]'' commented, "It’s as tense and exciting as expected."&lt;ref name="bershad" /&gt; Writing for ''[[TV Squad]]'', Joel Keller analyzed Carter's comparison of Leno's legal contract with O'Brien's, and wrote that the author "paints a picture of Leno and his producer, Debbie Vickers, as pragmatists and Conan as a cockeyed idealist".&lt;ref name="joelkeller" /&gt; Joe Flint of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented about changes in the media industry since Carter's prior book ''The Late Shift'', "The only difference is that the media world has changed a lot then, and while ''The Late Shift'' had a lot of inside dirt and drama that was news to everyone but the most hardcore industry insiders, this time around the soap opera played out on TV and in the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/10/the-morning-fix-meg-whitman-and-jerry-brown-pour-it-on-lions-gate-sues-carl-icahn-redbox-wants-to-get-its-kiosks-onto-the-web.html|accessdate=2010-10-30|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=The Morning Fix: Can't remember what happened 10 months ago in late night?|date=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrote, "There are lots of juicy bits, but the big takeaway: the guy with the best contract, wins",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Poniewozik|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]|title=Weekend Reading: How Jay Beat Conan (and NBC)|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-30|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2010/10/29/weekend-reading-how-jay-beat-conan-and-nbc/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called the book, "Bill Carter's Jaypocalypse dirt-disher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Poniewozik|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]|title=Letterman Defeats Leno!

On January 19, 2010, during O'Brien's last week of shows, guest [[Quentin Tarantino]] jokingly suggested that he direct a sequel to ''[[The Late Shift (film)|The Late Shift]]'', cast O'Brien as himself and make it a revenge movie in the style of his film ''[[Kill Bill]]'' with the title ''Late Shift 2: The Rolling Thunder of Revenge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/01/latenight-watch-the-revenge-of-conan-obrien.html | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | title=Show Tracker&amp;nbsp;– Late-night Watch: The Revenge of Conan O'Brien|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=2012-10-21|first=Mary |last=McNamara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]|date=January 19, 2010|title=Season 1, Episode 142|author=[[Conan O'Brien]]; [[Quentin Tarantino]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/01/20/quentin-tarantino-conan-obrien/|title=Quentin Tarantino to direct Conan O'Brien in 'Late Shift 2: The Rolling Thunder of Revenge'|first=Mandi |last=Bierly|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=2012-10-21|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]: PopWatch|publisher=Entertainment Weekly, Inc.; popwatch.ew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' reported in February 2010 that a sequel to ''The Late Shift'' film was in planning stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Salem  | first = Rob  | title = Why Tonight belongs to yesterday | work =[[The Toronto Star]]  | publisher = Toronto Star Newspapers Limited | page =E01  | date =February 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the final episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', O'Brien said he wished that actress [[Tilda Swinton]] could portray him in a film version about ''The Tonight Show'' conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title =Conan O'Brien's next move  | work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date = February 24, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swinton subsequently expressed interest in being cast as O'Brien in a sequel to ''The Late Shift''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =The Bullseye: Hits  | journal = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher =www.ew.com  | date =January 29, 2010|issue=1088  | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20340020,00.html  | accessdate = 2010-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Georgia Marine Institute''' ('''UGAMI''') is a nearshore [[ecological]] and [[geological]] research station located on [[Sapelo Island]] off the coast of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the [[United States]].  This island lies between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and a pristine salt marsh.  A ferry takes passengers from [[Meridian, Georgia|Meridian]] (between [[Darien, Georgia|Darien]] and [[Crescent, Georgia|Crescent]]) to Sapelo Island. The Island has fewer than 100 full-time residents. The Institute was created in 1953 and is currently a unit of the University of Georgia's Office of Research. The Institute is 280 miles southeast of the [[University of Georgia]]'s main campus in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]].  UGAMI is world-renowned for its research on coastal marine and estuarine ecosystems.

== Education ==
UGAMI offers life-changing experiences for undergraduate and graduate students. Approximately 600-700 university students train at UGAMI each year. The essence of the UGAMI student experience is characterized by: Immersion, Mentorship, and Engagement. Students experience complete immersion in field-based academic studies,close mentorship by faculty who are experts in their fields of study, and engagement in a supportive community of scholars.

UGAMI does not have any stand-alone degree programs. However, it provides many training and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. UGAMI offers undergraduate classes, provides research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students, and is a field trip destination for university classes from all over the country. Classes visiting UGAMI on field trips usually stay 2-5 days, but some stay longer.  UGA offers full-credit courses that take place entirely at the Marine Institute. As many of these classes take place during the summer, they attract students from many colleges and universities.  Undergraduates in UGAMI's residential courses live and work alongside the Institute's faculty and graduate student researchers, while taking courses in topics such as marine sciences, ecology, and coastal geography. In addition, graduate students from many different institutions conduct thesis research at UGAMI for periods ranging from a few days to a few years.

== Research ==
[[File:Research Aboard the RV Spartina.jpg|thumb|Students and faculty making physical and biological measurements aboard the University of Georgia Marine Institute's research vessel, Spartina.]]
The field of saltmarsh ecology, and many of the foundational concepts in ecosystem ecology, were created at UGAMI by scientists such as [[Eugene Odum]] and John Teal. Today, UGAMI is still at the forefront of coastal and estuarine research. The flagship research project at UGAMI is the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems-Long-Term Ecological Research Program (GCE LTER). The GCE LTER is part of the [[National Science Foundation's]] Long Term Ecological Research Network, which consists of 28 research sites around North America and Antarctica. The GCE LTER was established by the National Science Foundation in 2000 and it is the largest ecological research project on the Southeast Coast.  The Georgia coast will experience many changes in the coming decades because of sea level rise, climate change, and human modification. GCE LTER is studying the estuary ecosystem to learn how it responds to these perturbations, and to better predict future changes to the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER|url = https://gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu/|website = gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UGAMI is used for both long-term and short-term research projects, conducted by scientists from many institutions. The field research conducted at UGAMI results in the publication of approximately 50 peer-reviewed scientific papers each year.

Long-term researchers generally maintain semi-permanent housing, offices, and laboratories and have students and technicians stationed at the Marine Institute for months at a time. Short-term researchers generally stay in the Marine Institute's apartments and dormitory, and use the visitor labs. Although most of the visiting scientists come from the U.S., UGAMI also hosts international researchers.

The greatest assets that UGAMI offers visiting scientists are:
-Access – UGAMI offers access to protected barrier island habitats, including some of the most expansive and relatively undisturbed salt marshes along the U.S. eastern seaboard;
-Data – Researchers can build on long-term monitoring data, together with the results from numerous directed studies; and
-Community – UGAMI serves as a focal point that fosters connections among scholars from multiple institutions and fields of study.

'''Upland and lowland''' are conditional descriptions of a [[plain]] based on elevation above sea level.

In studies of the '''[[ecology]] of [[freshwater]] [[river]]s''', [[habitat]]s are classified as '''upland and lowland'''.

==Definitions==
&lt;!--PLEASE NOTE: the section heading "Definitions" is linked to from several other articles; please be cautious of changing it.--&gt;
Upland and lowland are portions of plain that are conditionally categorized by their elevation above the [[sea level]]. Lowlands are usually no higher than {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}}, while uplands are somewhere around {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}}. On rare occasions, certain lowlands such as [[Caspian Depression]] lie below [[sea level]].

Upland habitats are cold, clear and rocky whose rivers are fast-flowing in mountainous areas; lowland habitats are warm with slow-flowing rivers found in relatively flat lowland areas, with water that is frequently coloured by [[sediment]] and organic matter.

These classifications overlap with the geological definitions of "upland" and "lowland".  In [[geology]] an "upland" is generally considered to be land that is at a higher elevation than the [[alluvial plain]] or [[stream terrace]], which are considered to be "lowlands". The term "bottomland" refers to low-lying alluvial land near a river.

Many freshwater fish and invertebrate communities around the world show a pattern of specialisation into upland or lowland river habitats. Classifying rivers and streams as upland or lowland is important in freshwater ecology as the two types of river habitat are very different, and usually support very different populations of fish and invertebrate species.

==Upland==
In freshwater ecology, upland rivers and [[stream]]s are the fast-flowing rivers and streams that drain elevated or mountainous country, often onto broad [[alluvial plain]]s (where they become lowland rivers). However, altitude is not the sole determinant of whether a river is upland or lowland. Arguably the most important determinants are that of stream power and [[stream gradient]]. Rivers with a course that drops in altitude rapidly will have faster water flow and higher stream power or "force of water". This in turn produces the other characteristics of an upland river - an [[incised course]], a [[river bed]] dominated by [[bedrock]] and coarse sediments, a [[riffle]] and pool structure and cooler water temperatures. Rivers with a course that drops in altitude very slowly will have slower water flow and lower force. This in turn produces the other characteristics of a lowland river - a meandering course lacking rapids, a river bed dominated by fine sediments and higher water temperatures. Lowland rivers tend to carry more suspended [[sediment]] and organic matter as well, but some lowland rivers have periods of high water clarity in seasonal low-flow periods.

The generally clear, cool, fast-flowing waters and bedrock and coarse sediment beds of upland rivers encourage fish species with limited temperature tolerances, high oxygen needs, strong swimming ability and specialised reproductive strategies to prevent eggs or larvae being swept away.  These characteristics also encourage invertebrate species with limited temperature tolerances, high oxygen needs and ecologies revolving around coarse sediments and interstices or "gaps" between those coarse sediments,

==Lowland==
[[Image:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Amazon River]] near [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]], an example of a lowland river habitat.]]

The generally more turbid, warm, slow-flowing waters and fine sediment beds of lowland rivers encourage fish species with broad temperature tolerances and greater tolerances to low oxygen levels, and life history and breeding strategies adapted to these and other traits of lowland rivers.  These characteristics also encourage invertebrate species with broad temperature tolerances and greater tolerances to low oxygen levels and ecologies revolving around fine sediments or alternative habitats such as submerged woody debris ("snags") or submergent [[macrophyte]]s ("water weed").

They are typically defined by either their designated members' often superficial similarity to each other, or their ''lack'' of one or more distinct [[Synapomorphy|character states]] or by their ''not'' belonging to one or more other taxa. Wastebasket taxa are by definition either [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]], and are therefore not considered to be valid taxa under strict [[cladistic]] rules of taxonomy. The name of a wastebasket taxon may in some cases be retained as the designation of an [[evolutionary grade]], however.

==Examples==
* The familiar category of [[invertebrates]] is an "everything-else" category, comprising all animals without backbones.
* The [[snake]] family [[Colubridae]] as traditionally defined are not a natural group. 
* The obsolete kingdom [[Protista]] is composed of all [[eukaryote]]s that are not [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s or [[fungi]], leaving to the protists all single-celled eukaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whittaker RH |title=New concepts of kingdoms or organisms.

* [[Tricholomataceae]] is a fungal group, at one point composed of the white-, yellow-, or pink-spored genera in the [[Agaricales]] not already classified as belonging to the [[Amanitaceae]], [[Lepiotaceae]], [[Hygrophoraceae]], [[Pluteaceae]], or [[Entolomataceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Young AM.

* [[Carnosauria]] and [[Thecodontia]] are fossil groups, banded together back when the limited fossil record did not allow for a more detailed scheme.
* [[Condylarthra]] is an artificial clade into which ungulate mammals not clearly within [[Perissodactyla]] or [[Cetartiodactyla]] were traditionally shoved. Many of these groups, like [[Meridiungulata]] or ''[[Protungulatum]]'', may not represent [[Laurasiatheria|laurasithere]] mammals, while others like [[Phenacodontidae|phenacodontids]] have been clearly established as early odd-toed ungulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/2013/08/08/phenacodontidae-i-feel-like-i-know-you/ |website=Tetrapod Zoology |publisher=Scientific American |title=Phenacodontidae, I feel like I know you |first=Darren |last=Naish |date=8 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310022530/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/2013/08/08/phenacodontidae-i-feel-like-i-know-you/ |archivedate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0109232| pmid = 25295875| title = Anthracobunids from the Middle Eocene of India and Pakistan Are Stem Perissodactyls| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 10| pages = e109232| date = 8 October 2014| last1 = Cooper | first1 = L.

* The order [[Insectivora]] has traditionally been used as a dumping ground for placental insectivorous mammals (and similar forms, such as [[colugos]]), usually aligned with [[carnivorans]], [[ungulates]] and [[bats]]. While the core components ([[mole (animal)|moles]], [[shrews]], [[hedgehogs]] and close relations) do in fact form a consistent clade, [[Eulipotyphla]], that is part of [[Laurasiatheria]] with the aforementioned clades, other mammals historically placed in the order have been found to belong to other branches of the placental tree: [[tree shrews]] and [[colugos]] are [[euarchonta]]ns related to [[Primates]] and sometimes grouped in [[Sundatheria]], while [[tenrecs]], [[golden moles]] and [[elephant shrews]] are all [[Afrotheria|afrotheres]], probably forming the clade [[Afroinsectiphilia]]. Both of these clades have at times been accused of being wastebasket taxons themselves, grouping superficially similar animals in [[Euarchonta]] and [[Afrotheria]] respectively, but they have been more strongly supported by genetic studies.

==Wastebasket taxa in science==
[[Fossil]] groups that are poorly known due to fragmentary remains are sometimes grouped together on gross morphology or [[stratigraphy]], only later to be found to be wastebasket taxa, such as the crocodile-like [[Triassic]] group [[Rauisuchia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nesbitt|first=S. J.|date=7 November 2003|title=Arizonasaurus and its implications for archosaur divergence|url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/2vetg3w8xha9e992|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=270|issue=Suppl. 2|pages=S234–S237

One of the roles of taxonomists is to identify wastebasket taxa and reclassify the content into more natural units. Sometimes, during taxonomic revisions, the wastebasket taxa can be salvaged after doing thorough research on its members, and then imposing tighter restrictions on what continues to be included. Such techniques  "saved" Carnosauria and ''[[Megalosaurus]]''. Other times, the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] name contains too much unrelated "baggage" to be successfully salvaged. As such, it is usually dumped in favour of a new, more restrictive name (for example, [[Rhynchocephalia]] or Thecodontia), or abandoned altogether (for example, ''[[Simia]]'').

==Related concepts==
A related concept is that of '''[[form taxon]]''', "wastebasket" groupings that are united by gross morphology. This is often result of a common mode of life, often one that is [[generalist and specialist species|generalist]], leading to generally similar body shapes by [[convergent evolution]].

The term wastebasket taxon is sometimes employed in a derogatory fashion to refer to an [[evolutionary grade]] taxon.

'''Witchcraft''' or '''witchery''' broadly means the practice of and belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. ''Witchcraft'' is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision,&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=witchcraft+definition&amp;ots=aw4oz13kOS&amp;sig=2CWBjLB2TIsUt1aNz_nyUPxOf5E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=witchcraft%20definition&amp;f=false Witchcraft in the Middle Ages], Jeffrey Russell, p.4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cross-cultural]] assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious [[divination|divinatory]] or medicinal role,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is often present within societies and groups whose [[cultural framework]] includes a magical [[world view]].&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Magic Circle (Waterhouse painting)|The Magic Circle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886]]

The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both "primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001, p xiii: ''"Magic is central not only in 'primitive' societies but in 'high cultural' societies as well"''&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Scientifically, the existence of magical powers and witchcraft are generally believed to [[pseudoscience|lack credence]] and to be unsupported by high-quality [[scientific method|experimental testing]], although individual witchcraft practices [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|and effects]] may be open to [[scientific knowledge|scientific explanation]] or explained via [[mentalism]] and [[Psychological theories of magic|psychology]].

Historically, the [[Christian views on magic|predominant concept of witchcraft in the Western world]] derives from [[Old Testament]] [[biblical law|laws]] against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the [[Early Modern Period]]. It posits a [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] [[conflict between good and evil]], where witchcraft was generally [[evil]] and often associated with [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]] and [[Devil worship]]. This culminated in deaths, [[torture]] and [[scapegoating]] (casting blame for human misfortune),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Burton Russell |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft |title=Witchcraft – Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and many years of large scale [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch-trials]] and [[witch-hunting|witch hunts]], especially in [[Protestant]] Europe, before largely ceasing during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christian views in the modern day are diverse and cover the gamut of views from intense belief and opposition (especially from Christian [[fundamentalist]]s) to non-belief, and in some churches even approval. From the mid-20th century, witchcraft – sometimes called contemporary witchcraft to clearly distinguish it from older beliefs – became the name of a branch of [[modern paganism]].  It is most notably practiced in the [[Wiccan]] and modern witchcraft traditions, and no longer practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press. pp. 45–47, 84–5, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western mainstream Christian view is far from the only societal perspective about witchcraft. Many cultures worldwide continue to have widespread practices and cultural beliefs that are loosely translated into English as "witchcraft", although the English translation masks a very great diversity in their forms, magical beliefs, practices, and place in their societies. During the [[History of colonialism|Age of Colonialism]], many cultures across the globe were exposed to the modern Western world via [[colonialism]], usually accompanied and often preceded by intensive [[Christianity and colonialism|Christian missionary activity]] ''(see "[[Christianization#Colonial era (16th−19th centuries)|Christianization]]")''. Beliefs related to witchcraft and magic in these cultures were at times influenced by the prevailing Western concepts. Witch hunts, scapegoating, and killing or shunning of suspected witches still occurs in the modern era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pearlman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/papuanewguinea/9987294/Papua-New-Guinea-urged-to-halt-witchcraft-violence-after-latest-sorcery-case.html |title=Papua New Guinea urged to halt witchcraft violence after latest 'sorcery' case |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with killings both of victims [[Murder for body parts#Medicine murder|for their supposedly magical body parts]], and of suspected witchcraft practitioners.

Suspicion of modern medicine due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic [[healthcare]] consequences.

== Etymology and definitions ==
{{Further information|Witch (word)}}
The word ''witch'' is of uncertain origin. There are numerous etymologies that it could be derived from. One popular belief is that it is "related to the English words wit, wise, wisdom [Germanic root *weit-, *wait-, *wit-; Indo-European root *weid-, *woid-, *wid-]," so "craft of the wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12416396|title=Power in the Name: The Origin and Meaning of the Word &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot;|first=Michael|last=Dilts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is from the [[Old English]] wiccecræft, a compound of "wicce" ("witch") and "cræft" ("craft").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas|title=witchcraft (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=witchcraft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, witches differ from sorcerers in that they don't use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and one may be unaware of  being a witch, or may have been convinced of his/her nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176–9 |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-465-02131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |date=1937 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, as well as some who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |date=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464–5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-297-00220-8}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an [[ideology]] for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.&lt;ref name="Pocs"&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 9–10. The first three categories were proposed by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Alleged practices ===
[[File:A Witch.jpg|thumb|''A Witch'', 1902, by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
Historically the witchcraft label has been applied to practices people believe influence the mind, body, or property of others against their will—or practices that the person doing the labeling believes undermine social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} believe the malefic nature of witchcraft is a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against their will was clearly present in many cultures, as traditions in both folk magic and religious magic have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples appear in early texts, such as those from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. Malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

{{quote|It is argued here that the medical arts played a significant and sometimes pivotal role in the witchcraft controversies of seventeenth century New England. Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Gevitz, N. ""The Devil Hath Laughed at the Physicians": Witchcraft and Medical Practice in Seventeenth-Century New England." Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 55 no. 1, 2000, pp. 5–36. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/15172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people&amp;nbsp;– even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=alleged+practices+witchcraft#v=onepage&amp;q=alleged%20practices%20witchcraft&amp;f=false|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spell casting ====
{{See also|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most widely known characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], "spell" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantation]]s; by the performance of physical [[ritual]]s; by the employment of magical [[herb]]s as amulets or [[potion]]s; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see [[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736–1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necromancy (conjuring the dead) ====
Strictly speaking, "[[necromancy]]" is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]]&amp;nbsp;– although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical [[Witch of Endor]] performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==== Demonology ====
{{main article|Demonology}}
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], Protestants, and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. The key century was the fifteenth, which saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft, culminating in the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' but prepared by such fanatical popular preachers as Bernardino of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;For this dramatic rise in witchcraft consciousness during the fifteenth century and Bernardino's critical role in it, see Chapter 2 (pp. 52–108) Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-53854-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word [[Warlock]] came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' (Latin for "Hammer of The Witches") was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false |title=The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788|publisher= Britannica Educational Publishing |page=27 |accessdate=2013-06-29|isbn=9781615303434 |date=2011-01-15 |editor-last1= Campbell|editor-first1=Heather M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on the work,&lt;ref&gt;'In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.', Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), 'Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was later officially condemned by the Catholic Church in 1490.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term "witch" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. As Alan McFarlane noted, "There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=+interchangeable+terms+for+these+practitioners,+&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study|first=Alan|last=Macfarlane|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415196123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scot]] explained, "At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scot |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Scot |date=1584 |title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft |volume=Booke V |chapter=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as "witches" in the negative sense. Many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20witches%20black%20witches&amp;f=false Alan Macfarlane p. 127 who notes how "white witches" could later be accused as "black witches".]&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' ("diviner-healers") were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft".&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a horned male deity or a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===
[[Éva Pócs]] states that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or [[Occultism]]

She identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
* The "neighbourhood witch" or "social witch": a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The "magical" or "sorcerer" witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The "supernatural" or "night" witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Neighbourhood witches" are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of "sorcerer" witches and "supernatural" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence related to accusations====
Belief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such incidents are common in places such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tanzania]]. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance. Witchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf |title=A Global Issue that Demands Action |publisher=the Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1 |title=CONFLICT BETWEEN STATE LEGAL NORMS AND NORMS UNDERLYING POPULAR BELIEFS: WITCHCRAFT IN AFRICA AS A CASE STUDY |publisher=DUKE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE &amp; INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol 14:351 |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |title=WITCH HUNTS IN MODERN SOUTH AFRICA: AN UNDER-REPRESENTED FACET OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE |publisher=MRC-UNISA Crime, Violence and Injury Lead Programm |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425074549/http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/opinions/columns/AHRC-ETC-056-2011 |title=NEPAL: Witchcraft as a Superstition and a form of violence against women in Nepal — Asian Human Rights Commission |publisher=Humanrights.asia |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mensah Adinkrah |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/10/4/325.abstract |title=Witchcraft Accusations and Female Homicide Victimization in Contemporary Ghana |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=325–356 |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07|doi=10.1177/1077801204263419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft ===
{{Further information|Neoshamanism|Modern paganism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as "witchcraft" have grown dramatically since the early 20th century. Generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[ritual]] and [[spirituality]], they are understood to involve varying degrees of [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|magic]], [[shamanism]], [[folk medicine]], [[spiritual healing]], calling on [[elemental]]s and [[spirit]]s, veneration of ancient [[Pantheon (religion)|deities]] and [[archetype]]s, and attunement with the forces of nature.

The first [[Neopagan]] groups to publicly appear, during the 1950s and 60s, were [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]. They operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7591-0202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wicca ====
{{Main article|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pan-European witch-cult]] originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner's]] claim in 1954 in ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=978-1-86163-110-7|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=978-1-86163-164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large "Eclectic Wiccan" movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205–252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939–1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35–62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed "witches." They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=====Witchcraft, feminism, and media=====
Wiccan literature has been described as aiding the empowerment of young women through its lively portrayal of female protagonists. Part of the recent growth in Neo-Pagan religions has been attributed to the strong media presence of fictional works such as the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Harry Potter]] series with their depictions of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=tosenberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosenberger|first=Catherine|title=Neo-Paganism for teens|url=http://jeunessejournal.ca/index.php/yptc/article/view/81/63|journal=Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures|volume=2.2|year=2010|pages=172–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread accessibility to related material through internet media such as chat rooms and forums is also thought to be driving this development. Wiccan beliefs are currently often found to be compatible with liberal ideals such as the [[Green movement]], and particularly with [[feminism]] by providing young women with means for empowerment and for control of their own lives.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=Christine|title=Becoming a woman through Wicca: Witches and wiccans in contemporary teen fiction|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=39|issue=1|year=2008|pages= 43–52|doi=10.1007/s10583-007-9058-0|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4140/2/CLE_Jarvis_Wicca_article_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merskin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|title=Joining Forces: Teen Girl Witches and Internet Chat Groups|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/1/3/0/p171306_index.html |journal=Proceedings of the International Communication Association|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case particularly in North America due to the strong presence of feminist ideals.&lt;ref name=tosenberger/&gt; The 2002 study [[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]] suggests that Wiccan religion represents the second wave of feminism that has also been redefined as a religious movement.&lt;ref name=jarvis/&gt;

==== Stregheria ====
{{Main article|Stregheria}}
Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional witchcraft ====
{{Main article|Traditional witchcraft}}
Traditional witchcraft is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of witchcraft. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===
{{main article|Satanism|Satanism and Witchcraft}}
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi's]] Sabbatic goat (known as The Goat of Mendes or [[Baphomet]]) is one of Satanism's most common symbols.]]

[[Satanism]] is a broad term referring to diverse beliefs that share a symbolic association with, or admiration for, [[Satan]], who is seen as a liberating figure. While it is heir to the same historical period and pre-Enlightenment beliefs that gave rise to modern witchcraft, it is generally seen as completely separate from modern witchcraft and Wicca, and has little or no connection to them.

Modern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the "dark side of Christianity" rather than a branch of Wicca: – the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)&lt;ref name=JamesRLewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&amp;q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966).  After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31–34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=March 2006|title=Religious Satanism, 16th century Satanism, Satanic Dabbling, etc|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|author=B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the [[British Royal Navy]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Helen.

[[Luciferianism]], on the other hand, is a belief system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm|title=How Luciferians Differ From Satanists|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not revere the [[devil]] figure or most characteristics typically affixed to [[Satan]].

[[Madeline Montalban]] was an English witch who adhered to a specific form of luciferianism which revolved around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=26, 85–86}} Although initially seeming favourable to Gerald Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=69}} She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, [[Charles Cardell]], although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n tradition, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and his wife, [[Maxine Sanders]], who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=69–70}} In contemporary times luciferian witches exist within traditional witchcraft.{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}}

== Historical and religious perspectives ==
===Near East beliefs===
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile Valley]]. It played a conspicuous role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. The latter tradition included an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] anti-witchcraft ritual, the [[Maqlû]]. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes:

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006.

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main article|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]
The [[King James Version]] uses the words "witch", "witchcraft", and "witchcrafts" to translate the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} ''kāsháf'' ({{IPA-he|kɔˈʃaf}}) and {{hebrew|קֶסֶם}} (''qésem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate {{lang|grc|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeia'' in the [[Greek New Testament]]. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11–12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live") thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]] in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, usually translated as "witch" or "sorceress", is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeía'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, φαρμακεία, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that "witch" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} include "mutterer" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning "herb", and ''hapaleh'', meaning "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means "herbalist" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33–35 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:
{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word {{hebrew|אֹב}} ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6). The word in most New Testament translations is "sorcerer"/"sorcery" rather than "witch"/"witchcraft".

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.

However, some of the rabbis practiced "magic" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than "unclean" forces) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9–10) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.

==== Islam ====
Divination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460 “Magic”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

{{quote|Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn From the mischief of created things; From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads; From the mischief of those who practise secret arts; And from the mischief of the envious one as he practises envy. (Qur'an 113:1–5)}}

Also according to the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|publisher=Routledge|others=Leaman, Oliver, 1950-, Credo Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781780343686|location=Abingdon, Oxon [England]|pages=381|oclc=764567609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And they follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind sorcery and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut&amp;nbsp;... And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew. (Qur'an 2:102)
}}

Islam distinguishes between God-given gifts, which can heal sickness, and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Good supernatural powers are therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', whereas sorcery or black magic is achieved through help of [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]]. In the Qurʾānic narrative, the [[Solomon in Islam|Prophet Sulayman]] had the power to speak with animals and command jinn, and he thanks God for this نعمة (i.e. gift, privilege, favour, bounty), which is only given to him with God’s permission.{{Cite Quran|27|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir Ibn Kathir'' for surah 21, verse 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was accused of being a magician by his opponents.{{Cite Quran|10|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1374|title=Magic - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common belief that jinn can possess a human,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic masculinities|last=Ouzgane|first=Lahoucine|date=2006|publisher=[[Zed Books]]|isbn=9781848131514|location=London, UK|pages=89|oclc=654873315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-20357997|title=British Asians turn to exorcists|last=Nye|first=Catrin|date=2012-11-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus requiring [[Exorcism#Exorcism in Islam|exorcism]] (''ruqya'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dentist-stabbed-faith-healer-death-7789872|title='Possessed' dentist stabbed faith healer to death at black magic centre|last=fox|first=aine|date=2016-04-19|work=mirror|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the Prophet's ''[[sunnah]]'' to cast off the jinn or devils from the body of the possessed. The practice of seeking help from the jinn is prohibited and can lead to possession. The ''ruqya'' contains verses of the Qur'an as well as prayers specifically targeted against demons. The knowledge of which verses of the Qur'an to use in what way is what is considered "magic knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of the history of religion have linked several magical practises in Islam with pre-Islamic Turkish and East African customs.

In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[tagati]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as "witch", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as "witch doctor" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a "witch doctor" is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga''{{'}}s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

Complimentary remarks about witchcraft by a native Congolese initiate: "From witchcraft ... may be developed the remedy (''kimbuki'') that will do most to raise up our country."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.12).&lt;/ref&gt; "Witchcraft ... deserves respect ... it can embellish or redeem (''ketula evo vuukisa'')."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.14).&lt;/ref&gt; "The ancestors were equipped with the protective witchcraft of the clan (''kindoki kiandundila kanda''). ... They could also gather the power of animals into their hands ... whenever they needed. ... If we could make use of these kinds of witchcraft, our country would rapidly progress in knowledge of every kind."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, pp. 54b-55a (13.9.16).&lt;/ref&gt; "You witches (''zindoki'') too, bring your science into the light to be written down so that ... the benefits in it ... endow our race."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 55b (13.10.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cameroon ====

In eastern Cameroon, the term used for witchcraft among the [[Maka people|Maka]] is ''djambe''&lt;ref&gt;Geschiere, Peter; "''The Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa''" (1997) University of Virginia Press. {{ISBN|0-8139-1703-4}} (paperback). Translated by Geschiere, Peter &amp; Roitman, Janet from the originally published in French: "''Sorcellerie et politique en Afrique – La viande des autres''" (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to a force inside a person; its powers may make the proprietor more vulnerable. It encompasses the occult, the transformative, killing and healing.&lt;ref&gt;''idem'' (Geschiere, 1997, p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Every year, hundreds of people in the [[Central African Republic]] are convicted of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312100813/http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-balaka|Christian militias]] in the Central African Republic have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive women accused of being 'witches' in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Esslemont 2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Esslemont | first=Tom | title=Witch burning rebels stoke Central African Republic violence | newspaper=Reuters | date=26 November 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-witchcraft/witch-burning-rebels-stoke-central-african-republic-violence-idUSKBN0TF03920151126 | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====
{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Dowden in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 |title=Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcism]]s, sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html|title=Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists|website=Christianity Today|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis snatching]]) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bavier |first=Joe |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Penis theft panic hits city.. |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, the belief in magical warfare technologies (such as "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, even if it is suboptimal at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nunn |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Nunn |last2=Sierra |first2=Raul Sanchez de la |date=2017 |title=Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=582–87 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20171091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this is one reason why the belief in witchcraft persists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Ghana ====
In [[Ghana]], women are often accused of witchcraft and attacked by neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108050152/http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |title=My Mum is Not A Witch |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there exist six [[witch camp]]s in the country where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety.&lt;ref name="Camps"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19437130 | title=Ghana witch camps: Widows' lives in exile | publisher=BBC | accessdate=September 1, 2012| work=BBC News | date=September 2012 | last1=Whitaker | first1=Kati }}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch camps, which exist solely in Ghana, are thought to house a total of around 1000 women.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt;

Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has "stolen" a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja |first=Uchenna |title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on May 21, 2008 that in [[Kenya]], a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 |title=Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches" |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malawi ====
In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011. Hunting the vulnerable: Witchcraft and the law in Malawi; Consultancy Africa Intelligence (16 June):&lt;/ref&gt; Various secular and Christian organizations are combining their efforts to address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meer, Erwin 2011. The Problem of Witchcraft in Malawi, Evangelical Missions Quarterly (47:1, January): 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William Kamkwamba]], witches and wizards are afraid of money, which they consider a rival evil. Any contact with [[cash]] will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.&lt;ref&gt;Kamkwamba, William. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Harper Collins. 2009. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
In [[Nigeria]], several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business—which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593|title=Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria|website=humantrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017185346/http://humantrafficking.org/publications/593|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by "detecting" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of "exorcisms", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
Among the Mende (of [[Sierra Leone]]), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. "The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caribbean ====

Brua is an Afro-Caribbean religion and healing tradition that originates in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean. A healer in this culture is called a ''kurioso'' or ''kuradó'', a man or woman who performs ''trabou chikí'' (little works) and ''trabou grandi'' (large treatments) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns, in which sorcery is involved. Sorcery usually involves reference to the ''almasola'' or ''homber chiki'', a devil-like entity. ''Transcultural Psychiatry'' published a paper called "Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua" by Jan Dirk Blom, Igmar T. Poulina, Trevor L. van Gellecum and Hans W. Hoek of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016204|title=Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua|first1=Jan Dirk|last1=Blom|first2=Igmar|last2=T.

[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html |title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents |publisher=Masslive.com |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1645–1663, about eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft. Thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1645–1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93. These witch trials were the most famous in [[British North America]] and took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Prior to the witch trials, nearly 300 men and women had been suspected of partaking in witchcraft, and 19 of these people were hanged, and one was “pressed to death”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America: A Narrative History|year=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-393-91265-4|page=85|author=George Brown Tindall|edition=Brief Ninth Edition, Volume One|author2=David Emory Shi |editor=Jon Durbin. Retrieved 10/3/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. [[Giles Corey|One man]] who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]]. The best known trials were conducted by the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692 in Salem Town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education|title=Salem Witch Museum|website=www.salemwitchmuseum.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the "Witch of Pungo" was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

In Maryland, there is a legend of Moll Dyer, who escaped a fire set by fellow colonists only to die of exposure in December&amp;nbsp;1697. The historical record of Dyer is scant as all official records were burned in a courthouse fire, though the county courthouse has on display the rock where her frozen body was found. A letter from a colonist of the period describes her in most unfavourable terms. A local road is named after Dyer, where her homestead was said to have been. Many local families have their own version of the Moll Dyer affair, and her name is spoken with care in the rural southern counties.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Thompson, "Sister Witch: The Life of Moll Dyer" (2017 Solstice Publishing) {{ISBN|978-1973105756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of witchcraft and wizardry led to the prosecution of a man in Tennessee as recently as 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topix.com/forum/city/jamestown-tn/TPAPB6U4LVF0JDQC8/p2|title=Old Stories|work=Topix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1wvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67|title=History of Fentress County, Tennessee|last1=Hogue|first1=Albert Ross|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Touring the East Tennessee Backroads |first=Carolyn |last=Sakowski|page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLBrUbj02IcC&amp;pg=PA212|isbn=9780895874764 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Crucible]]'' by Arthur Miller is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the [[Salem witch trials]] that took place in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during 1692–93.

==== Diné / Navajo ====
In [[Navajo people|Diné culture]], witches are seen as the polar opposite of [[medicine man|ceremonial people]]. While spiritual leaders perform "[[Navajo song ceremonial complex|sings]]" for healing, protection and other beneficial purposes, all practices referred to as "witchcraft" are intended to hurt and curse. Witches are associated with harm to the community and transgression of societal standards, especially those relating to family and the dead.

The ''yee naaldlooshii'' is the type of witch known in English as a "[[skin-walker]]". They are believed to take the forms of animals in order to travel in secret and do harm to the innocent.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "with it, he goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of  ''{{lang|nv|’ánti’įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Corpse powder or corpse poison ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}}}, literally "witchery" or "harming") is a substance made from powdered corpses.  The powder is used by witches to curse their victims.&lt;ref name="PerroneStockel1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrone|first1=Bobette|last2=Stockel|first2=H. Henrietta|last3=Krueger|first3=Victoria|title=Medicine women, curanderas, and women doctors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApJayEh43ZcC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2512-1|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the ''{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}'' is a curse and disease, usually indicated by an immediate action to administration of the poison, like fainting, swelling of the tongue, or [[Trismus|lockjaw]]. Sometimes, however, the victims simply [[wasting|wastes away]], as from a normal disease.

Traditional Navajos usually hesitate to discuss things like witches and witchcraft with non-Navajos.&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;Keene, Dr. Adrienne, "[http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/03/magic-in-north-america-part-1-ugh.html Magic in North America Part 1: Ugh.]" at ''[[Native Appropriations]]'', 8 March 2016. Accessed 9 April 2016: "What happens when Rowling pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions ... but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I’m sorry if that seems "unfair," but that's how our cultures survive."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== North America (Mexico) ====
{{See also|Brujería}}
Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico, during the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a "conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged."&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Ruth. ''Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico.'' American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, Asunción. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an "affirmation of hegemony" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of mirrors: power, witchcraft, and caste in colonial Mexico.'' Durham, N.C.:Duke University Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, notoriety has been awarded to a place called [[Catemaco#The "witches" of Catemaco|Catemaco]], in the state of Veracruz, which has a history of witchcraft, and where the practice of witchcraft by contemporary ''brujos'' and ''brujas'' thrives.

In Mexico City, people who practice brujería, [[Santería]], voodoo, ocultism and magic may find items, herbs and supplies at the ''[[mercado de Sonora]]''.

==== South America ====
In [[Chile]] there is a tradition of the [[Kalku]] in [[Mapuche religion]]; and the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] in the folklore and [[Chilote mythology]].

The presence of the witch is a constant in the [[ethnographic]] [[history]] of [[colonial Brazil]], especially during the several denunciations and confessions given to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of [[Bahia]] (1591–1593), [[Pernambuco]] and [[Paraíba]] (1593–1595).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} João Ribeiro Júnior, ''O Que é Magia'', p.48-49, Ed.

Apart from other types of [[Violence against women]] in [[Nepal]], the malpractice of abusing women in the name of witchcraft is also really prominent.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Okabe - The cat witch.jpg|thumb|Okabe – The cat witch, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]

In Japanese folklore, the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of "The Grateful foxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes – Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services. The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires. It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master's enemies. The most feared power of the ''kitsune-mochi'' is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or "hereditary witches".&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''Tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

==== Philippines ====
Witchcraft in [[the Philippines]] is often classified as malevolent, with practitioners of black magic called ''[[Mangkukulam]]'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and ''[[Mambabarang]]'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]; there are also practitioners of benevolent, white magic, in addition to some who practise both. ''Mambabarang'' in particular are noted for their ability to command insects and other invertebrates to accomplish a task, such as delivering a curse to a target.

Magic and witchcraft in the Philippines varies considerably across the different [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]], and is commonly a modern manifestation of [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] spirituality interwoven with [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] religious elements such as the invocation of [[saints]] and the use of [[pseudo-Latin]] prayers (''oración'') in spells, and ''[[anting-anting]]'' (amulets).

Practitioners of traditional herbal-based medicine and divination called ''[[albularyo]]'' are not considered witches. They are perceived to be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. [[Feng shui]], an influence of [[Filipino Chinese]] culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.

[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;

"Witch".&lt;/ref&gt; European pagan belief in witchcraft was associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and dismissed as "diabolical fantasies" by medieval Christian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regino of Prüm]] (906), see Ginzburg (1990) part 2, ch. 1 (89ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch-hunt]]s first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest [[Germany]] were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684, 1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commonly believed that individuals with power and prestige were involved in acts of witchcraft and even cannibalism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thornton, John. "Cannibals, Witches, and Slave Traders in the Atlantic World." The William and Mary Quarterly 60, no. 2 (2003): 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Europe had a lot of power over individuals living in West Africa, Europeans in positions of power were often accused of taking part in these practices. Though it is not likely that these individuals were actually involved in these practices, they were most likely associated due to Europe’s involvement in things like the slave trade, which negatively affected the lives of many individuals in the Atlantic World throughout the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) "The Emergence of the Christian Witch" in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle witches]], commonly involves a [[deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe "[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover. They were also depicted as lustful and perverted, and it was thought that they copulated with the devil at the Sabbath.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] . Other rulers such as [[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.
[[File:Torturing and execution of witches in medieval miniature.jpg|thumb|Burning witches, with others held in Stocks, 14th century]]
The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BC–186BC).

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or wise man. The term "witch doctor" was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[Charmer (folklore)|charmer]]s.)

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in  Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996)  pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis." ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173296 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500." ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536–1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales." ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] Brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male [[homosociality]] among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community." ''CLIO'' (2008) 37#3 pp 322–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====21st century=====
In the [[United Kingdom]] children believed to be witches or seen as possessed by evil spirits can be subject to severe beatings, traumatic [[exorcism]], and/or other abuse.  There have even been child murders associated with witchcraft beliefs.

==== Italy ====
As in most European countries, women in Italy were more likely suspected of witchcraft than men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Witchcraft and the Inquisition in Venice, 1550–1650|last=Martin|first=Ruth|year=1989|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were considered dangerous due to their supposed sexual instability, such as when being aroused, and also due to the powers of their menstrual blood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cook Islands ====
In pre-Christian times, witchcraft was a common practice in the [[Cook Islands]]. The native name for a sorcerer was ''tangata purepure'' (a man who prays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA372|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=372|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers offered by the ''ta'unga'' (priests)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA471|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=471|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods worshiped on national or tribal ''[[marae]]'' (temples) were termed ''karakia'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=156|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on minor occasions to the lesser gods were named ''pure''. All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down from generation to generation with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a [[Gardenia taitensis|Gardenia]] was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a journalist who visited the Cook Islands in 1907, the uncrowned [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] was believed to have possessed the mystic power called ''[[mana]]'',  giving the possessor the power to slay at will. It also included other gifts, such as [[second sight]] to a certain extent, the power to bring [[luck|good or evil luck]], and the ability already mentioned to deal death at will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beatrice Grimshaw|author-link=Beatrice Grimshaw|date=1908|title=In the Strange South Seas|chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/instrangesouths00grimgoog#page/n112/mode/2up|chapter=A Mystic Power|publisher=London: Hutchinson &amp; Co.|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
Among the [[Russian language|Russian]] words for ''witch'', ведьма (ved'ma) literally means "one who knows", from Old Slavic вѣдъ "to know").&lt;ref&gt;See also Ryan, W.F. ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent term is колдунья (koldun'ya), ''sorcerer'' being колдун (koldun).

==== Spells ====
Pagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.
&lt;/ref&gt;  One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanicals should be gathered, "During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right."&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"/&gt;  Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The western concept of an "evil eye" or a "hex" was translated to Russia as a "spoiler".&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal view of witchcraft ====
The dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a "whisperer" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).&lt;ref&gt;
Christine D. Worobec, 1995. "Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages." Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual’s self is often deemed as "feminine" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192–194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witchcraft trials ====
[[File:"A true and just recorde of the information"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]

Witchcraft trials occurred frequently in seventeenth-century Russia, although the "great witch-hunt" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominately Western European phenomenon.  However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called "witch hysteria."  This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.  Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
Russell Zguta, "Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia," American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: " [so she must be a witch]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqRCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sentence for an individual found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the "ordeal of cold water" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"&gt;Zguta, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but was used as a method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy.  Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them "brought back," but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two methods of torture were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century.  Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present.  In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.&lt;ref&gt;
Zguta, 1187.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts—astrology, fortune telling, and divination—became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"&gt;Zguta, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547–1584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"/&gt;  Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565–1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles.  Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598–1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Time of Troubles, seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the ground, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.

== Witches in art ==
Witches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a "witch-craze" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Patricia. "THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART." Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the "protectress of childbirth and fertility" while Herodias symbolized "unbridled sensuality". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
One of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht Dürer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.&lt;ref&gt;Stumpel, Jeroen. “The Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in Dürer's ‘Four Witches.’” Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143–160., www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Dürer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as "[sucking] the blood of newborn infants"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as "practitioners of witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an "earthly alliance" had taken place between Satan's female minions who "conspired to destroy Christendom".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Hoak, Dale. "THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE." ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their "flight-inducing [powers]". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
