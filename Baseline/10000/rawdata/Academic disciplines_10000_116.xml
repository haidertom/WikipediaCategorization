      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5087">In [[second-language acquisition]], the '''Acculturation Model''' is a theory proposed by John Schumann to describe the acquisition process of a second language (L2) by members of ethnic minorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Rod |authorlink=Rod Ellis |title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KglibyrZ5sC&amp;pg=PA230 |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn= 0-19-437189-1 |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; that typically include immigrants, migrant workers, or the children of such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (1994), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition process takes place in natural contexts of majority language setting. The main suggestion of the theory is that the acquisition of a second language is directly linked to the acculturation process, and learners’ success is determined by the extent to which they can orient themselves to the target language culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= VanPatten |first=Bill |authorlink= |title=Key Terms in Second Language Acquisition |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KO-ZDi_lpYIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=ja&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2010 |publisher= Continuum|location= |isbn=9780826499158 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The acculturation model came into light with Schumann’s study of six non-English learners where one learner named Alberto, unlike the other five, had little progress in the acquisition process of [[English Language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631214823_chunk_g97806312148235_ss1-2 |title= Acculturation |author= |date= |work=Blackwell Reference Online |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Inc |doi=10.1111/b.9780631214823.1999.x |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The process of acculturation was defined by Brown as "the process of being adapted to a new culture" which involves a new orientation of thinking and feeling on the part of an L2 learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=H. Douglas |title=Principles of Language Learning and Teaching |url= |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall Regents]] |location=[[New Jersey]] |isbn= 0-13-191966-0 |pages=169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, as culture is an integral part of a human being, the process of acculturation takes a deeper turn when the issue of language is brought on the scene. Schumann based his Acculturation Model on two sets of factors: social and psychological. Schumann asserts that the degree to which the second-language learners acculturate themselves towards the culture of target-language (TL) group generally depends on social and psychological factors; and these two sorts of factors will determine respectively the level of ''social distance'' and ''psychological distance'' an L2 learner is having in course of his learning the target-language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schumann |first=John H |title=The Pidginization Process: A Model for Second Language Acquisition |url= |accessdate= |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House Publishers|location=Rowley |pages=367–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social distance, as Ellis notes, concerns the extent to which individual learners can identify themselves with members of TL group and, thereby, can achieve contact with them. Psychological distance is the extent to which individual learners are at ease with their target-language learning task.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (1994), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann identifies eight factors that influence social distance: social dominance, integration pattern, enclosure, cohesiveness, size factor, cultural congruence, attitude factor, and intended length of residence. He also identifies three factors that influence psychological distance: motivation, attitude, and culture shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3203534|title=The pidginization process : a model for second language acquisition|last=H.|first=Schumann, John|date=1978|publisher=Newbury House Publishers|isbn=0883770962|location=Rowley, Mass.|oclc=3203534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann later sought to extend the acculturation model by assessing contemporary cognitive models for second language acquisition, including McLaughlin’s cognitive theory, Hatch and Hawkins’ experiential approach, Bialystok and Ryan’s model of knowledge and control dimensions, Anderson’s active control of thought framework, and Gasser's connectionist lexical memory framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schumann|first=John|date=Winter 1990|title=Extending the Scope of the Acculturation/Pidginization Model to Include Cognition|url=https://www.jstor.org.proxy-bc.researchport.umd.edu/stable/3587114|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|pages=667–684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7044">'''Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory''' (also known as APO) is a not-for-profit [[open access]] [[Disciplinary repository|subject repository]] or [[digital library]], specialising in public policy and practice [[grey literature]] and journal articles, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, with some coverage of other countries. Formerly known as Australian Policy Online, the organisation underwent a name change to Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory (APO) in 2017.

== Background ==

APO was established in 2002 by the Swinburne Institute for Social Research, at [[Swinburne University]] in [[Melbourne]]. It was intended as a way to collate and disseminate academic research reports and other [[grey literature]] that was increasingly proliferating online. It has since established itself as a notable resource for people involved in policy research in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="broadband.unimelb"&gt;Bellamy, C., Gibbs, M., Williamson, A., Sean Cubit, S. (December 2011).  [http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/engage/pubs/wp/IBES-political-issue-analysis-system.pdf "Political Issue Analysis System: Policy deliberation in the age of information abundance"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204050628/http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/engage/pubs/wp/IBES-political-issue-analysis-system.pdf |date=2014-02-04 }}. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from [http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/ "Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918084602/http://www.broadband.unimelb.edu.au/ |date=2010-09-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It now sits as part of the Centre of Urban Transitions within Swinburne University of Technology.

APO is a not-for-profit organisation supported by partnerships with academic institutions and government agencies, grants donations and advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apo.org.au/funding-and-support "Funding and support"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313112458/http://apo.org.au/funding-and-support |date=2014-03-13 }}. Retrieved 13 March 2014 from [http://apo.org.au/ "Policy Online"].&lt;/ref&gt; Partners include the [[Australian National Data Service]], [[Australia and New Zealand School of Government|ANZSOG]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[Henry Halloran]] Trust at the [[University of Sydney]], and the [[University of South Australia]]. APO has also been an awarded a number of [[Australian Research Council]] grants.

== Purpose ==

APO was established to address the transformation of the means of production for publications brought about by the internet. Frustrations with the limitations of the [[academic publishing]] system – long delays, lack of access or audience – were causing producers of academic and other content to move online and increasingly produce [[grey literature]] (informally published written material, such as reports, that may be difficult to trace via conventional channels). The informal channels used to disseminate digital grey literature have meant that libraries and other services have only been able to collect it in an ad hoc manner. APO aims to make digital research content that is relevant to Australian policy debates more easily discoverable, accessible and able to be managed.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, M.,  Magnifico, C., Tyler, K. (August 2013). [https://www.scribd.com/doc/163740640/The-Effects-of-the-Internet-and-Open-Access-on-the-Usage-of-Grey-Literature-A-Review-of-the-Literature-Group-Project#download "The Effects of the Internet and Open Access on the Usage of Grey Literature: a review of the literature"]. Retrieved 18 November 2013 from  [https://www.scribd.com "Scribd"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

APO specialises in collecting public policy reports and articles from academic research centres, think tanks, government and non-government organisations. As well as research, the site includes a smaller collection of opinion and commentary pieces, video, audio and web resources focused on policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaaccess.org.au/research-policy/research/useful-research-and-policy-databases "Useful research and policy databases"]. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from [http://mediaaccess.org.au/ "Media Access Australia"].&lt;/ref&gt; Most content is produced by other organisations and collected and catalogued on the site, although some commentary is original to APO.

== Reception ==

In 2011, the then Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet described APO as providing “some of the most valuable and constructive contributions to Australia’s policy debate”.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, T. (28 July 2011).[http://www.dpmc.gov.au/media/speech_2011_07_28.cfm "The John Paterson Oration 2011"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019235357/http://www.dpmc.gov.au/media/speech_2011_07_28.cfm |date=2011-10-19 }}. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from  [http://www.dpmc.gov.au/ "The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet"].&lt;/ref&gt; However, APO has also been criticised on the grounds that it “could perhaps do more to engage with the formal political workings of government through providing access to formal government policy information.”&lt;ref name="broadband.unimelb" /&gt;

In 2012, the report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation by the Hon Raymond Antony Finkelstein QC stated that: "While the start-up costs for new print publications have been prohibitive and inhibited new enterprises emerging, the streamlining of the relationship between content producers and consumers has led to many new websites and web-based services. Among the most important such websites that have grown up in Australia over the last decade are Inside Story, Australian Policy Online, Online Opinion, The Drum, The Conversation, and New Matilda."&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, R. (March 2012).

In August 2014, APO won the "Information" category at the Australia &amp; New Zealand Internet Awards (ANZIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetawards.org.au/winners "Winners"].

[[Statistical shape analysis]] and [[Computational anatomy#Statistical shape theory in computational anatomy|statistical shape theory]] in [[computational anatomy]] (CA) is performed relative to templates, therefore it is a local theory of statistics on shape.[[Computational anatomy#Template Estimation from Populations|Template estimation]] in [[computational anatomy]] from populations of observations is a fundamental operation ubiquitous to the discipline. Several methods for template estimation based on [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] probability and statistics in the [[Computational anatomy#The random orbit model of computational anatomy|random orbit model of CA]] have emerged for submanifolds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Bayesian Generative Model for Surface Template Estimation|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2010/974957|journal = Journal of Biomedical Imaging|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1687-4188|pmc = 2946602|pmid = 20885934|pages = 16:1–16:14|volume = 2010|doi = 10.1155/2010/974957|first = Jun|last = Ma|first2 = Michael I.|last2 = Miller|first3 = Laurent|last3 = Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Atlas Generation for Subcortical and Ventricular Structures with its Applications in Shape Analysis|journal = IEEE Transactions on Image Processing|date = 2010-06-01|issn = 1057-7149|pmc = 2909363|pmid = 20129863|pages = 1539–1547|volume = 19|issue = 6|doi = 10.1109/TIP.2010.2042099|first = Anqi|last = Qiu|first2 = Timothy|last2 = Brown|first3 = Bruce|last3 = Fischl|first4 = Jun|last4 = Ma|first5 = Michael I.|last5 = Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dense image volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bayesian Template Estimation in Computational Anatomy|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1053-8119|pmc = 2602958|pmid = 18514544|pages = 252–261|volume = 42|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.056|first = Jun|last = Ma|first2 = Michael I.|last2 = Miller|first3 = Alain|last3 = Trouvé|first4 = Laurent|last4 = Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The deformable template model of shapes and forms via diffeomorphic group actions ==
{{Further|Group actions in computational anatomy}}[[Linear algebra]] is one of the central tools to modern engineering. Central to linear algebra is the notion of an orbit of vectors, with the matrices forming [[Matrix group|groups]] (matrices with inverses and identity) which act on the vectors.  In linear algebra the equations describing the orbit elements the vectors are linear in the vectors being acted upon by the matrices.  In [[computational anatomy]] the space of all shapes and forms is modeled as an orbit similar to the vectors in linear-algebra, however the groups do not act linear as the matrices do, and the shapes and forms are not additive. In computational anatomy addition is essentially replaced by the law of composition.

The central group acting CA defined on volumes in  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are the [[diffeomorphisms]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G} \doteq Diff&lt;/math&gt; which are mappings with 3-components &lt;math&gt;\phi(\cdot) = (\phi_1(\cdot),\phi_2 (\cdot),\phi_3 (\cdot))&lt;/math&gt;, law of composition of functions &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^\prime (\cdot)\doteq \phi (\phi^\prime(\cdot)) &lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^{-1}(\cdot) =\phi ( \phi^{-1}(\cdot))= id&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s and [[group actions|group]] are familiar to the Engineering community with the universal popularization and standardization of [[linear algebra]] as a basic model

A popular  [[group actions|group action]] is on scalar images, &lt;math&gt;I(x),x \in {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, with action on the right via the inverse.

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot I(x) = I \circ \phi^{-1} (x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3.
&lt;/math&gt;

For sub-[[manifold]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, parametrized by a chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m(u), u \in U &lt;/math&gt;, the diffeomorphic action the flow of the position

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot m(u) \doteq \phi\circ m(u), u \in U.
&lt;/math&gt;

Several [[group actions in computational anatomy]] have been defined.

== Geodesic positioning via the Riemannian exponential ==
For the study of deformable shape in CA, a more general diffeomorphism group has been the group of choice, which is the infinite dimensional analogue. The high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups used in computational anatomy are generated via smooth flows &lt;math&gt; \phi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields satisfying the ordinary differential equation: [[File:Lagrangian flow.png|thumb|Showing the Lagrangian flow of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; with associated vector fields &lt;math&gt;v_t, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; satisfying ordinary differential equation &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t = v_t(\phi_t), \phi_0=id&lt;/math&gt;.]]
: {{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dt} \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t , \ \phi_0 = id \ ; &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian flow}}}}
with &lt;math&gt; v \doteq (v_1,v_2,v_3) &lt;/math&gt; the vector fields on &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt; termed the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Eulerian]] velocity of the particles at position &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of the flow. The vector fields are functions in a function space, modelled as a smooth [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] space with the vector fields having 1-continuous derivative . For &lt;math&gt;v_t = \dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, with the inverse for the flow given by

: {{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dt} \phi_t^{-1} = -(D \phi_t^{-1}) v_t, \ \phi_0^{-1} = id \ , &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eulerianflow}}}}
and the &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; Jacobian matrix for flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;  given as &lt;math&gt; \ D\phi \doteq \left(\frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial x_j}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Flows were first introduced&lt;ref&gt;GE Christensen,RD Rabbitt,MI Miller, Deformable templates using large deformation kinematics, IEEE Trans Image Process. 1996;5(10):1435-47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GE Christensen, SC Joshi, MI Miller, Volumetric transformation of brain anatomy
IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,1997.&lt;/ref&gt; for large deformations in image matching; &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the instantaneous velocity of particle &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. with  the vector fields termed the Eulerian velocity of the particles at position  of the flow. The modelling approach used in CA enforces a continuous differentiability condition on the vector fields by modelling the space of vector fields &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; as a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]] (RKHS), with the norm defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;, Green's inverse &lt;math&gt;K = A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The norm  according to &lt;math&gt; \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X Av \cdot v dx , v \in V,
&lt;/math&gt; where for &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v) \doteq Av \in V^*
&lt;/math&gt; a generalized function or distribution, then &lt;math&gt; (\sigma\mid w)\doteq \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  \sum_i w_i(x) \sigma_i(dx)
&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a differential operator, finiteness of the norm-square &lt;math&gt;  \int_X Av \cdot v dx &lt; \infty

The variation in the anatomical configurations are modelled separately from the Medical imaging modalities [[Computed axial tomography|Computed Axial Tomography]] machine, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machine, [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] machine, and others. The [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes theory]] models the prior on the source of images &lt;math&gt; \pi_{\mathcal{I}} (\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;, and the conditional density on the observable imagery &lt;math&gt; p(\cdot |I) \  \text{on} \ I^D \in {\mathcal I}^{\mathcal D} &lt;/math&gt;, conditioned on &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;. For images with [[Computational anatomy#Groups and group actions|diffeomorphism group action]] &lt;math&gt;I \doteq \phi \cdot I_\mathrm{temp}, \phi \in Diff_V&lt;/math&gt;,  then the prior on the group &lt;math&gt;\pi_{Diff_V} (\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; induces the prior on images &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathcal{I}} (\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, written as densities the log-posterior takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\log p(\phi \cdot I\mid I^D) \simeq \log p(I^D \mid \phi \cdot I)+ \log \pi_{\operatorname{Diff}_V}(\phi) \ .

[[Maximum a posteriori estimation]] (MAP) estimation is central to modern [[statistical theory]]. Parameters of interest &lt;math&gt; \theta \in \Theta &lt;/math&gt; take many forms including (i) disease type such as [[neurodegenerative]] or [[neurodevelopmental]] diseases,  (ii) structure type such as cortical or subcorical structures in problems associated to segmentation of images, and (iii) template reconstruction from populations.  Given the observed image &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt;, MAP estimation maximizes the posterior:
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat \theta \doteq \arg \max_{\theta \in \Theta} \log p(\theta \mid I^D). &lt;/math&gt;

== MAP Estimation of volume templates from populations and the EM algorithm ==
Generating templates empirically from populations is a fundamental operation ubiquitous to the discipline.
Several methods based on Bayesian statistics have emerged for submanifolds and dense image volumes.
For the dense image volume case, given the observable &lt;math&gt; I^{D_1}, I^{D_2}, \dots &lt;/math&gt; the problem is to estimate the template in the orbit of dense images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.  Ma's procedure takes an initial hypertemplate &lt;math&gt; I_0 \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \phi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;, with the parameters to be estimated the log-coordinates &lt;math&gt;\theta \doteq v_0&lt;/math&gt; determining the geodesic mapping of the hyper-template &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0) \cdot I_0 = I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the [[Computational anatomy#The random orbit model of computational anatomy|Bayesian random orbit model of computational anatomy]] the observed MRI images &lt;math&gt;I^{D_i}&lt;/math&gt; are modelled as a conditionally Gaussian random field with mean field &lt;math&gt;\phi_i \cdot I&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; a random unknown transformation of the template.  The MAP estimation problem is to estimate the unknown template &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; given the observed MRI images.

Ma's procedure for dense imagery takes an initial hypertemplate &lt;math&gt; I_0 \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \phi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The observables are modelled as conditional random fields, &lt;math&gt; I^{D_i} &lt;/math&gt; a {{EquationNote|conditional-Gaussian}} random field with mean field &lt;math&gt; \phi_i \cdot I \doteq \phi_i \cdot \phi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The unknown variable to be estimated explicitly by MAP is the mapping of the hyper-template &lt;math&gt; \phi_0&lt;/math&gt;, with the other mappings considered as nuisance or hidden variables which are integrated out via the Bayes procedure.  This is accomplished using the [[expectation-maximization]] (EM) algorithm.

The orbit-model is exploited by associating the unknown to be estimated flows to their log-coordinates &lt;math&gt;v_i,i=1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; [[Computational anatomy#Riemannian exponential (geodesic positioning) and Riemannian logarithm (geodesic coordinates)|via the Riemannian geodesic log and exponential]] for [[computational anatomy]] the initial vector field in the tangent space at the identity so that &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_{i}) \doteq \phi_i &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_{0}) &lt;/math&gt; the mapping of the hyper-template.
The MAP estimation problem becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\max_{v_0} p(I^D, \theta = v_0) = \int p(I^D, \theta= v_0\mid v_1,v_2, \dots ) \pi(v_1,v_2, \dots ) \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

The EM algorithm takes as complete data the vector-field coordinates parameterizing the mapping, &lt;math&gt;v_i,i=1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; and compute iteratively the conditional-expectation
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
Q(\theta=v_0; \theta^\text{old}=v_0^\text{old}) &amp;
= - E ( \log p(I^D, \theta=v_0 \mid v_1,v_2,\dots)|I^D, \theta^\text{old}) \\
&amp; = - \| ( \bar I^\text{old} - I_0 \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \sqrt{\beta^\text{old}} \|^2 - \|v_0\|_V^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
* Compute new template maximizing Q-function, setting &lt;math&gt;\theta^\text{new}\doteq v_0^\text{new} = \arg \max_{\theta = v_0} Q(\theta ; \theta^\text{old}=v_0^\text{old}) = - \| ( \bar I^\text{old} - I_0 \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \sqrt{\beta^\text{old}}\|^2
- \| v_0\|_V^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Compute the mode-approximation for the expectation updating the expected-values for the mode values:

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Branches}}
'''Celestial mechanics''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] that deals with the [[motion (physics)|motion]]s of [[celestial object|objects in outer space]]. Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of [[physics]] ([[classical mechanics]]) to astronomical objects, such as [[star]]s and [[planet]]s, to produce [[ephemeris]] data.

As an astronomical field of study, celestial mechanics includes the sub-fields of [[orbital mechanics]], which deals with the launching and [[orbit]]s [[artificial satellite]]s, and [[lunar theory]], a specialty which deals with the complications of the [[orbit of the Moon]]. Modern celestial mechanics tends to divide between five broad fields of study:
* trajectories of artificial satellites ([[orbital mechanics|astrodynamics]])
* motions of major planets, minor planets, and natural satellites in the Solar system and other stellar systems and widely spaced multiple-star systems (planetary dynamics)
* the motion of component stars and their planetary systems in closely spaced multiple-star systems and globular clusters (astrodynamics and [[stellar dynamics]])
* flow of stars within and among the bodies of large galaxies, dwarf galaxies, and globular clusters ([[stellar dynamics]] and galactic dynamics)
* motions of galaxies and intergalactic dust and gas within galaxy clusters ([[computational astrophysics]])

All of the above fields overlap, but are sometimes treated as separate, especially the study of the motion of stars within [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[interacting galaxy|interactions between whole galaxies]], which both tend to rely heavily on [[fluid mechanics]] (whole stars being particles of the “fluid”).{{cn | date = August 2018}}

==History==
{{For|early theories of the causes of planetary motion|Dynamics of the celestial spheres}}

Modern analytic celestial mechanics started with [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] of 1687. The name "celestial mechanics" is more recent than that.  Newton wrote that the field should be called "rational mechanics." The term "dynamics" came in a little later with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and over a century after Newton, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] introduced the term "celestial mechanics."  Prior to Kepler there was little connection between exact, quantitative prediction of planetary positions, using [[Greek astronomy#Eudoxan astronomy|geometrical]] or [[Babylonian astronomy#Neo-Babylonian astronomy|arithmetical]] techniques, and contemporary discussions of the physical causes of the planets' motion.

===Johannes Kepler===
{{For|detailed treatments of how his laws of planetary motion can be used|Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian problem}}

[[Johannes Kepler]] (1571&amp;ndash;1630) was the first to closely integrate the predictive geometrical astronomy, which had been dominant from [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century  to [[Copernicus]], with physical concepts to produce a [[Astronomia nova|''New Astronomy, Based upon Causes, or Celestial Physics'']] in 1609.  His work led to the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|modern laws of planetary orbits]], which he developed using his physical principles and the [[planet]]ary observations made by [[Tycho Brahe]]. Kepler's model greatly improved the accuracy of predictions of planetary motion, years before [[Isaac Newton]] developed his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of gravitation]] in 1686.

===Isaac Newton===
[[Isaac Newton]] (25&amp;nbsp;December 1642&amp;ndash;31&amp;nbsp;March 1727) is credited with introducing the idea that the motion of objects in the heavens, such as [[planet]]s, the [[Sun]], and the [[Moon]], and the motion of objects on the ground, like [[cannon]] balls and falling apples, could be described by the same set of [[physical law]]s.  In this sense he unified ''celestial'' and ''terrestrial'' dynamics.  Using [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], proving Kepler's Laws for the case of a circular orbit is simple. Elliptical orbits involve more complex calculations, which Newton included in his [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]].

===Joseph-Louis Lagrange===
After Newton, [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange#Astronomy|Lagrange]] (25&amp;nbsp;January 1736&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;April 1813) attempted to solve the [[three-body problem]], analyzed the stability of planetary orbits, and discovered the existence of the [[Lagrangian points]].  Lagrange also reformulated the principles of [[classical mechanics]], emphasizing energy more than force and developing a [[Lagrangian mechanics|method]] to use a single polar coordinate equation to describe any orbit, even those that are parabolic and hyperbolic. This is useful for calculating the behaviour of planets and [[comet]]s and such.  More recently, it has also become useful to calculate [[spacecraft]] [[trajectory|trajectories]].

===Simon Newcomb===
[[Simon Newcomb]] (12&amp;nbsp;March 1835&amp;ndash;11&amp;nbsp;July 1909) was a Canadian-American astronomer who revised [[Peter Andreas Hansen]]'s table of lunar positions.  In 1877, assisted by [[George William Hill]], he recalculated all the major astronomical constants. After 1884, he conceived with A. M. W. Downing a plan to resolve much international confusion on the subject. By the time he attended a standardisation conference in [[Paris]], France in May 1886, the international consensus was that all ephemerides should be based on Newcomb's calculations. A further conference as late as 1950 confirmed Newcomb's constants as the international standard.

===Albert Einstein===
[[Albert Einstein]] (14&amp;nbsp;March 1879&amp;ndash;18&amp;nbsp;April 1955) explained the anomalous [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|precession of Mercury's perihelion]] in his 1916 paper ''The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity''.  This led astronomers to recognize that [[Newtonian mechanics]] did not provide the highest accuracy.  [[Binary pulsar]]s have been observed, the first in 1974, whose orbits not only require the use of [[General Relativity]] for their explanation, but whose evolution proves the existence of [[gravitational radiation]], a discovery that led to the 1993 Nobel Physics Prize.

==Examples of problems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Celestial motion, without additional forces such as [[thrust]] of a [[rocket]], is governed by gravitational acceleration of masses due to other masses. A simplification is the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]], where the problem assumes some number ''n'' of spherically symmetric masses. In that case, the integration of the accelerations can be well approximated by relatively simple summations.

:Examples:
:*4-body problem: spaceflight to Mars (for parts of the flight the influence of one or two bodies is very small, so that there we have a 2- or 3-body problem; see also [[Patched conic approximation|the patched conic approximation]])
:*3-body problem:
:**[[Quasi-satellite]]
:**Spaceflight to, and stay at a [[Lagrangian point]]

In the case that ''n''=2 ([[two-body problem]]), the situation is much simpler than for larger ''n''. Various explicit formulas apply, where in the more general case typically only numerical solutions are possible. It is a useful simplification that is often approximately valid.

:Examples:
:*A [[binary star]], e.g., [[Alpha Centauri]] (approx. the same mass)
:*A [[binary asteroid]], e.g., [[90 Antiope]] (approx. the same mass)

A further simplification is based on the "standard assumptions in astrodynamics", which include that one body, the [[orbiting body]], is much smaller than the other, the [[central body]]. This is also often approximately valid.

:Examples:
:*[[Solar system]] orbiting the center of the [[Milky Way]]
:*A planet orbiting the Sun
:*A moon orbiting a planet
:*A spacecraft orbiting Earth, a moon, or a planet (in the latter cases the approximation only applies after arrival at that orbit)

==Perturbation theory==
{{main|Perturbation theory}}
[[Perturbation theory]] comprises mathematical methods that are used to find an approximate solution to a problem which cannot be solved exactly. (It is closely related to methods used in [[numerical analysis]], which [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|are ancient]].) The earliest use of modern [[perturbation theory]] was to deal with the otherwise unsolveable mathematical problems of celestial mechanics: [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s solution for the orbit of the [[Moon]], which moves noticeably differently from a simple [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]] because of the competing gravitation of the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]].

[[Perturbation theory|Perturbation methods]] start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is carefully chosen to be exactly solvable. In celestial mechanics, this is usually a [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]], which is correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]]), or a circular orbit, which is only correct in special cases of two-body motion, but is often close enough for practical use.

The solved, but simplified problem is then ''"perturbed"'' to make its [[differential equation|time-rate-of-change equations for the object's position]] closer to the values from the real problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third, more distant body (the [[Sun]]). The slight changes that result from the terms in the equations – which themselves may have been simplified yet again – are used as corrections to the original solution. Because simplifications are made at every step, the corrections are never perfect, but even one cycle of corrections often provides a remarkably better approximate solution to the real problem.

There is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, for most problems the recycling and refining of prior solutions to obtain a new generation of better solutions could continue indefinitely, to any desired finite degree of accuracy.

The common difficulty with the method is that the corrections usually progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the [[Moon]]'s orbit ''"It causeth my head to ache."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Cropper |first1=William H. |title=Great Physicists: The life and times of leading physicists from Galileo to Hawking |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-517324-6 |date=2004 |page=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This general procedure – starting with a simplified problem and gradually adding corrections that make the starting point of the corrected problem closer to the real situation – is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering. It is the natural extension of the "guess, check, and fix" method [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|used anciently with numbers]].

'''China University of Political Science and Law''' ('''CUPL'''; [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 中国政法大学; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 中國政法大學; [[pinyin]]: ''Zhōngguó Zhèngfǎ Dàxué'' abbr. 法大, ''Fǎ Dà'') is a national public research university specialized in [[law]], [[The arts|arts]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[management]] and [[foreign language]]s established in 1952 in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

China University of Political Science and Law is a first tier institution within the national key university [[Project 211]] and the [[985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines Project|Project 985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines]] as part of the national endeavor to build world-class universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cupl.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.htm|title=学校简介-中国政法大学|website=www.cupl.edu.cn|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUPL is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]] with the highest status "A+" in legal studies.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html|title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered to be one of the best Chinese universities in legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zyxw.cn/article/cdetail/3736|title=2016教育部法学院排名名单|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zyxw.cn|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the most competitive and selective universities to enter in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaokao.com/e/20130618/51c0051a1d4fd.shtml|title=2013年中国大学高考招生50强|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gaokao.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CUPL has two campuses, one in [[Haidian District|Haidian]], [[Beijing]] which is the original campus of the university, and the other locates in [[Changping District|Changping]], [[Beijing]]. The university's Haidian campus now hosts [[postgraduate]] students only while [[undergraduate]]s study at a much larger campus in [[Changping District|Changping]], [[Beijing]]. In 2015, CUPL comprises 13 schools, with 15,833 students and 951 faculty members, of whom 290 are professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cupl.edu.cn/szdw.htm|title=师资队伍-中国政法大学|website=www.cupl.edu.cn|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUPL maintains a broad international exchange program, with approximately 1000 foreign students from many countries.

==History==
CUPL was initially established in 1952, with its official name '''Peking College of Political Science and Law''' and combined departments of law, political science, sociology and other subjects of [[Peking University]], [[Yenching University]], [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] and [[Tsinghua University]]. The prestigious scholar [[Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng]] (钱端升), who was educated at [[Harvard University]] and regarded as the founder of modern [[political science]] in China, was appointed as the first president. But after the outbreak of [[Cultural Revolution]] CUPL was greatly affected. CUPL had been stopped during Cultural Revolution. Ch'ien died of illness in 1990.

In 1983, under the policy of [[Central People's Government]] to develop the college quickly and make it the center of politics and law education in China, BCPSL was renamed as the China University of Political Science and Law. The Changping campus was a part of the State's [[Economic history of China|Seventh Five-Year-Plan]] in 1985.

Under the [[motto]] of "Cherish the Moral, Understand the Law, Know the World, Serve the Public"; CUPL made its contribution to the development of legal education and training in China. It was the first university to establish specialties such as Legal History, Civil and Commercial Law, Economic Law, Procedure Law and Comparative Law in the PRC. It also contributed to the education and promotion of [[Roman law]] in China. With over 100,000 graduates in the past 50 years who have become the elites of law enforcement and practitioners in China, CUPL has developed a niche for the enactment and enforcement of law in China. Furthermore, it became prominent in other public affairs in China, among which members of the faculty and student body played an active role in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] demanding [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]].

To face the challenge of globalization, CUPL developed joint programs with international partners. CUPL provided the first opportunity to study Chinese law in Beijing with an [[American Bar Association]]-approved program inaugurated in 1995 by the [[Duquesne University School of Law]]. In 2008, an exchange program was formed with [[Fordham University School of Law]].

CUPL also maintains relationship with the [[University of Exeter]] and the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]], [[Deakin University]] in [[Australia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|UIUC]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Davis]] in the [[United States]], the [[University of Montreal]] in [[Canada]], and [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]] in [[Singapore]].

==Postgraduate Programs==
CUPL also offers two LLM programs and a PhD program for international students in English. One of them is based in Changping and is with the China-EU University. This is an EU funded course, and its main focus is on educating Chinese students on EU law.

There is another LLM program at Haidian campus, in downtown Beijing, which is aimed at International students to learn about Chinese law. There is also a PhD programs in English at Haidian campus. These are flexible and taught entirely in English. They include the option to study Mandarin, and gain law work experience in Beijing and other cities in China.

These postgraduate programs are also open as a semester program to international students from any institution around the world who would like to study at CUPL for one semester.

==Chinese Language Programs==
There are Chinese language programs for international students. These are 8,000 RMB per semester, or 16,000 RMB per year. Students can also stay in accommodation on campus which is 1,000 RMB per year.

The '''Comparative Toxicogenomics Database''' ('''CTD''') is a public website and research tool launched in November 2004 that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules.
The database is maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at [[North Carolina State University]].

==Background==
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public website and research tool that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules, launched on November 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattingly CJ, Rosenstein MC, Colby GT, Forrest JN, Boyer JL |title=The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): A Resource for Comparative Toxicological Studies |journal=J Exp Zoolog.

==Goals and objectives==
One of the primary goals of CTD is to advance the understanding of the effects of environmental chemicals on human health on the genetic level, a field called [[toxicogenomics]].

The [[etiology]] of many chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental factors and genes that modulate important physiological processes. Chemicals are an important component of the environment. Conditions such as [[asthma]], cancer, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[immunodeficiency]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are known to be influenced by the environment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well understood. CTD may help resolve these mechanisms. The most up-to-date extensive list of peer-reviewed scientific articles about CTD is available at their publications page&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctdbase.org/about/publications/#ctdpubs CTD Publications page] ctdbase.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core data==
CTD is a unique resource where [[biocurator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bourne PE, McEntyre J |title=Biocurators: Contributors to the World of Science |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e142 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17411327 |pmc=1626157 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salimi N, Vita R |title=The Biocurator: Connecting and Enhancing Scientific Data |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e125 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17069454 |pmc=1626147 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; read the scientific literature and manually curate four types of core data:

* Chemical-gene interactions
* Chemical-disease associations
* Gene-disease associations
* Chemical-phenotype associations

==Data integration==
By integrating the above four data sets, CTD automatically constructs putative chemical-gene-phenotype-disease networks to illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-influenced diseases.

These inferred relationships are statistically scored and ranked and can be used by scientists and computational biologists to generate and verify testable hypotheses about toxicogenomic mechanisms and how they relate to human health.

Users can search CTD to explore scientific data for chemicals, genes, diseases, or interactions between any of these three concepts.  Currently,{{when|date=November 2015}} CTD integrates toxicogenomic data for vertebrates and invertebrates.

CTD integrates data from or hyperlinks to these databases:

'''Daniel Clasen''', in [[Latin]] '''Danielis Clasenius''' or '''Clasenus''' (1 May 1622, [[Lüneburg]] – 20 November 1678,&lt;ref&gt;J.F. von Schulte, ''Die Geschichte der Quellen und Literatur des canonischen Rechts'' (The Lawbook Exchange, 2000, 2008), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helmstedt]]), was a German [[political theorist]], [[religious scholar]], and [[classicist]].

His treatises, written in Latin, dealt with law, jurisprudence, religion, and politics. Clasen was one of the earliest theorists of [[political religion]], though preceded by [[Tommaso Campanella]] (1568–1639),&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Trousson, ''Le thème de Prométhée dans la littérature européenne'' (Librairie Droz, 1964, 3rd ed. 2001) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against [[Accommodation (religion)|accommodation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Mulson, "Cartesianism, Skepticism and Conversion to Judaism: The Case of Aaron d'Antan," in ''Secret Conversions to Judaism in Early Modern Europe'' (Brill, 2004), p. 138, note 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clasen was a major [[mythographer]] of the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Trousson, ''Le thème de Prométhée'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote [[commentary (philology)|commentaries]] on classical texts such as the so-called ''[[Cebes|Tablet of Cebes]]'' ''(Cebetis Tabula vitae humanae)'', for which he provided a Latin translation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Clasen, ''Cebetis Tabula vitae humanae recte instituendae de scriptionem continens cum commentariis'' (1652 edition), full text [https://books.google.com/books?id=crFAAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online], with parallel Greek text and Latin translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Clasen's works include:
* ''Commentarius in constitutiones criminales Caroli V. Imperatoris''
* ''De religione politica''
* ''De iure legitimationis exercitatio iuridica''
* ''Exercitatio iuridica de patria potestate''
* ''Politicae compendium succinctum cum notis''
* ''De iure aggratiandi''
* ''Theologia gentilis'' (vol. 7 of the series ''Thesaurus Graecarum antiquitatum'' edited by [[Jakob Gronovius]])
* ''De oraculis gentilium et in specie de vaticiniis Sibyllinis''

The term [[dyslexia]] comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words 'dys' meaning 'impaired', and 'lexis' meaning 'word' and is used to describe disorders of language concerning reading and [[spelling]].

Numerous models and hypotheses have been proposed in attempt to explain the broad range of symptoms experienced by deep dyslexics, but a definite consensus has yet to be reached. The proposed models and hypotheses have helped in treatment of some suffering patients, but only with certain specific symptoms. Additionally, the recovery seen is not experienced equally in all patients.

Deep dyslexia is considered to be a "[[central dyslexia]]" as compared to a "[[peripheral dyslexia]]". Peripheral dyslexics have difficulty matching the visual characteristics of letters that comprise a word to a stored memory of this word from prior encounters.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; Central dyslexics are unable to properly match the visual word to the word's meaning.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; They may also be incapable of speaking, or [[Phonation|phonating]], the sequence of written letters that they see into the word these letters represent.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; Deep dyslexia differs from other forms of central dyslexia ([[phonological dyslexia]] and [[surface dyslexia]]) in that deep dyslexics have many more symptoms and these symptoms are generally more severe.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Rapcsak"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rapcsak|first=Steven Z.|author2=Beeson, Pélagie M. |author3=Henry, Maya L. |author4=Leyden, Anne |author5=Kim, Esther |author6=Rising, Kindle |author7=Andersen, Sarah |author8= Cho, HyeSuk |title=Phonological dyslexia and dysgraphia: Cognitive mechanisms and neural substrates|journal=Cortex|year=2009|volume=45|issue=5|pages=575–591|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.04.006 |pmid=18625494 |pmc=2689874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Orden|first=G|title=What do double dissociations prove?|journal=Cognitive Science|year=2001|volume=25|issue=1|pages=111–172|doi=10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "continuum" hypothesis, deep dyslexia is a more severe form of phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Rapcsak" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lambon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambon Ralph|first=Matthew A.|author2=Graham, Naida L.|title=Acquired phonological and deep dyslexia|journal=Neurocase|year=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages=141–178|doi=10.1080/13554790008402767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Deep dyslexia is mainly characterized by the occurrence of [[Semantics|semantic]] reading errors or semantic [[paralexias]] (transposition of letters or words) when reading aloud (e.g. the written word "view" is read aloud as "scene", the word "bird" is read as "canary").&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plaut|first=David C.|author2=Shallice, Tim|title=Deep dyslexia: A case study of connectionist neuropsychology|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=1993|volume=10|issue=5|pages=377–500|doi=10.1080/02643299308253469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weekes|first=Brendan|author2=Coltheart, Max |author3=Gordon, Evian |title=Deep dyslexia and right hemisphere reading-a regional cerebral blood flow study|journal=Aphasiology|year=1997|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1139–1158|doi=10.1080/02687039708249437}}&lt;/ref&gt; These semantic errors are the major distinguishing feature of deep dyslexia in comparison to other central dyslexias.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; There are many other symptoms of deep dyslexia, including visual errors (e.g. the written word "thing" is read aloud as "think", the word "skate" is read as "scale") and derivational errors (e.g. the written word "alcohol" is read aloud as "alcoholic", the word "governor" is read as "government"), and poor reading of [[function word]]s.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt; Additionally, deep dyslexics have more difficulty reading [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] than [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and highly imaginable words, more difficulty reading [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, and [[verb]]s than [[noun]]s, a complete inability to read [[Pseudoword|non-words]], and often impairments on tasks of verbal [[working memory]].&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Plaut" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harley|first=Trevor|title=The psychology of language : from data to theory|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Hove|isbn=978-0-86377-867-4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=Bryan|title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=0-7167-9586-8|edition=6th|author2=Whishaw, Ian Q.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the symptoms of deep dyslexia listed above are different and independent impairments of reading, it is rare to find an individual who only displays some of the characteristics of it; indeed, most patients presenting with semantic paralexias, a hallmark symptom of the disorder, also demonstrate all of the other symptoms.&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheartmax"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coltheart|first=Edited by Max|title=*Deep dyslexia.|year=1980|publisher=Routhledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-0456-7|edition=[1st publ.].|author2=Patterson, Karalyn |author3=Marshall, John C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in deep dyslexia being considered a symptom-complex and has led to much research into why this variety of symptoms may co-occur in so many patients.&lt;ref name= "Weekes" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheartmax" /&gt;

===Imageability effect and ease of predication===

The difficulty of deep dyslexics in reading abstract words has been referred to as the "[[imageability]] effect".&lt;ref name= "Temple" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=GV|title=Deep dyslexia, imageability, and ease of predication.|journal=Brain and Language|year=1985|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–19|pmid=3971130|doi=10.1016/0093-934x(85)90094-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Riley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=EA|author2=Thompson, CK|title=Semantic Typicality Effects in Acquired Dyslexia: Evidence for Semantic Impairment in Deep Dyslexia.|journal=Aphasiology|year=2010|volume=24|issue=6–8|pages=802–813|pmid=20657815|doi=10.1080/02687030903422486|pmc=2907924}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this idea, the ease with which a [[mental image]] can be created for a word is strongly related to the ease of reading the word.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt; In an attempt to explain this relationship, researchers have developed a variable to link the mental imagery created by a word and the ease of reading it.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt; This variable, [[ease of predication]], is a rating of how easy it is to come up with simple factual statements or attributes of a word.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=Trevor A.|title=Connectionist approaches to language disorders|journal=Aphasiology|year=1993|volume=7|issue=3|pages=221–249|doi=10.1080/02687039308249508}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when presented with the word "dog", an individual may come up with statements, or [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]], such as "has four legs", "is an animal", or "barks and wags its tail". Words with higher ease of predication scores are more easily read aloud by deep dyslexics than words with lower ease of predicaton scores, yet there is no correlation between ease of predication and ease of reading seen in normal adult readers.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harley2" /&gt; Ease of predication may not explain specific symptoms of deep dyslexia, but rather indicates that deep dyslexics read using imagery, or a predicational route, rather than the more precise mechanisms used in normal reading.&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt;

==Mechanism==

There are many different, and often conflicting, hypotheses that attempt to explain the deficits associated with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Shallice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shallice|first=Tim|title=From neuropsychology to mental structure|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521308747|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories have resulted in several models designed to conceptualize the symptom-complex found in deep dyslexics. These models are not ordered chronologically, but rather follow a general increasing trend of presence in the field of knowledge regarding deep dyslexics. Some models may be stronger than others, but that is not necessarily reflected here. Models and hypothesis toward the end of the list are more heavily debated and thus typically have a greater wealth of knowledge surrounding their topic.&lt;ref name = "Colangelo" /&gt;

===Continuum model===

The "Glosser and Friedman (continuum) model" is based upon the concept that deep dyslexia and phonological dyslexia are opposite endpoints on a "continuum" of reading disability.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Rhonda B.|title=Recovery from Deep Alexia to Phonological Alexia: Points on a Continuum|journal=Brain and Language|year=1996|volume=52|issue=1|pages=114–128|doi=10.1006/brln.1996.0006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Deep dyslexia appears to be a more severe form of phonological dyslexia;&lt;ref name= "Rapcsak" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lambon" /&gt; however, symptoms in patients can change over time so that an initial diagnosis of deep dyslexia is later better described as strictly a phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; These observations suggest recovery is possible along the [[semantic pathway]].&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;

Friedman justifies the continuum hypothesis with two sets of evidence. The first involves five patients who started with deep dyslexia, but whose disorders shifted to phonological dyslexia during recovery.  Semantic paralexias were the first symptom to diminish, either partially or totally, in each case and then other symptoms were resolved to varying degrees after that. However, nonword reading was always the last symptom to go and complete recovery was never reached by any patient.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crisp|first=J.|last2=Ralph|first2=M.A.|date=|year=2006|others=|title=Unlocking the Nature of the Phonological-Deep Dyslexia Continuum: The Keys to Reading Aloud Are in Phonology and Semantics|url=|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=18|issue=3|pages=348–362|doi=10.1162/089892906775990543|pmid=16513001|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second set of evidence in support of the continuum was found in her review of eleven patients with deep or phonological dyslexia in whom she found a predictable succession of symptoms.  She placed great emphasis on the order in which reading symptoms emerged (poor nonword reading first, then visual errors, then noun &gt; functor, then noun &gt; verb, concrete &gt; abstract, and finally, semantic errors) and suggested that the continuum hypothesis was supported by this pattern of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Connectionist model===

[[File:Connectionist model of deep dyslexia.png|thumb|right|300px|Deep dyslexics have sufficient activation of a written word's features; but, this activation decays quickly, leading to errors in speech output.]]
The "connectionist model" suggests that the phonological and semantic features of a word are [[Spreading activation|activated]], but this activation decays at a rate too quick for cognitive processing- thus, errors in speech output are produced as a result of this fading activation.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt; This hypothesis explains the broad symptom-complex of deep dyslexics without resorting to a multiple loci damage approach as seen in other models.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt; It eliminates the need to attribute a specific locus of damage to each symptom of deep dylsexia, and instead states that all symptoms are due to decay of a large activation area.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Buchanan" /&gt;

=== Distributed attractor networks ===
Plaut and Shallice have hypothesized that units in the brain interact in such a way that semantic features form stable attractors in the space of all possible representations of words.  These unit interactions correspond to particular attractor patterns, and if the particular attractor pattern is activated, the network remains in that pattern.  However, they hypothesize that when the pattern is distorted, there is a pull on the pattern, and it gravitates toward the correct pattern, almost as if this semantic space is filled with basins, where if one point on the pattern falls to the edge of the basin, it will still gravitate toward the middle.  If you lesion this area, the neurons die and the basins change their shape.  When this happens, you may now have the same distorted starting pattern that will end up in a neighboring basin, which is a semantically related area, but not the correct one, and this would account for deep dyslexic patients to incorrectly identify "river" as "ocean".  Lesions that occur early in the network change the basins that send different semantic words to different areas of the network, whereas if they occur later, the words will be much closer semantically.  This may account for severity of the deficit in individual patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaut|first=D.C.|date=|year=1995|title=Double Dissociation Without Modularity: Evidence from Connectionist Neuropsychology|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=291–321|doi=10.1080/01688639508405124|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of inhibition hypothesis===

The "failure of inhibition hypothesis" states that the presentation of a target word activates [[semantic memory]] of that word, along with memory for other words that are semantically related.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; For example, the target word "dog" may activate "bark", "cat", "squirrel", "ball", "fetch". Deep dyslexic patients are unable to inhibit the other related words, so they are likely to substitute one of these words for the target word in speech production (explicit output).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This hypothesis contradicts the belief of other researchers that the deficits seen in deep dyslexics are due to [[Mental process|processing]] problems.

Researchers believe that "failure of inhibition" has no effect on [[Implicit learning|implicit]] processing, but instead is the cause of impairments in the explicit task of speech production.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; They believe that explicit characteristics of reading involve only the conscious production of speech (reading).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Information about written words is internalized without awareness (implicitly); the ability to access this information and process it into words that can be read or spoken is an explicit process.  Implicit knowledge involves [[phonological awareness]], understanding of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and a semantic understanding of written words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This implicit aspect of reading may be completely intact, and yet reading errors can still occur through defects in explicit output, or production.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Researchers have studied the dissociation of implicit and explicit processes to thus unravel the underlying deficiencies in deep dyslexia. Studies in support of "failure of inhibition" show intact implicit processing of deep dyslexics.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; For instance, studies have shown deep dyslexics that are equally fast in a [[lexical decision task]] with a rhyming pair of words (book-took) in comparison to a non-rhyming pair of words (bough-tough), indicating that the patients are able to use implicit phonological knowledge and [[phonics]] to process the words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; Additionally, they are faster in a lexical decision task with words that sound like they are spelled (couch, pouch) than they are with words that do not sound like they are spelled (touch), again showing that patients are using phonology.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; These data show that implicit processing is in fact occurring in deep dyslexic patients. Thus, some researchers believe that the impairments present in deep dyslexics are only in explicit phonological output (i.e., reading aloud).&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; They believe that the problems of deep dyslexics are due to production errors, and that deep dyslexics have normal phonological processing at the implicit level.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt; This is supported by the fact that deep dyslexia is often present in patients suffering from production errors resulting from [[Expressive aphasia]].&lt;ref name= "Lambon" /&gt;

Riley and Thompson expanded on this theory in 2010.  Previous studies had shown that typical in patients with deep dyslexia, typical members of a semantic category (like "robin" in the category of "birds") are processed faster than atypical members of the same category (like "ostrich"), known as the semantic typicality effect.  According to their research, this typicality effect may indicate an inability to efficiently select a correct lexical-semantic representation.  They suggest that selection inhibition becomes impaired beginning at the level of semantics rather than the later levels of production like the original failure of inhibition hypothesis suggests.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

===Dual route model===

[[File:Dual route model and deep dyslexia diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Deep dyslexia can affect both pathways in the dual-route hypothesis of reading.]]
{{main article|Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud}}
The "Morton and Patterson (dual route) model" is based upon the [[Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud|dual route hypothesis of reading]]. It proposes that the occurrence of semantic errors alongside an inability to read non-words aloud must be due to multiple loci of damage within this dual-route model.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; Because a deep dyslexic cannot read aloud non-words, a disruption in the [[Phonology|phonological]] process is assumed, forcing reading to proceed through the semantic route.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; However, deep dyslexics also produce semantic errors while reading, alluding to damage in this pathway as well.&lt;ref name= "Colangelo" /&gt; Other researchers refer to the phonological and semantic route as "modules".&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; They believe that patients have a partially functioning [[Lexicon|lexical]] module and a completely deficient nonlexical module.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; The lexical module is analogous to the semantic route in the dual route model and relies on lexical memory, or the memory for words, to name words.&lt;ref name= "Colangelokaren" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; In using the lexical module, an individual accesses a "mental dictionary" of words. The nonlexical module is comparable to the phonological route and uses knowledge of spelling and [[grapheme]]s to create [[phoneme]]s to name words and nonwords.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt; The absent nonlexical module in deep dyslexics explains why patients cannot name nonwords.&lt;ref name= "Orden" /&gt;

===Right and left hemisphere hypotheses===
[[File:HearReadBrain.png|thumb|Activation areas in the left hemisphere when hearing or reading a word. The "left-hemisphere hypothesis", supports the idea of a damaged left hemisphere-based reading system.]]

Normal reading is typically a function of a left [[Lateralization of brain function|hemisphere-based system]].&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt; The right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] plays a minimal role in reading.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt; One hypothesis, the "left hemisphere hypothesis", supports the idea of a damaged left hemisphere-based reading system associated with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|title=Deep Dyslexia Is Right-Hemisphere Reading|journal=Brain and Language|year=2000|volume=71|issue=2|pages=299–309|doi=10.1006/brln.1999.2183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salmelin|first=R|author2=Helenius, P |author3=Service, E |title=Neurophysiology of fluent and impaired reading: a magnetoencephalographic approach.|journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology|year=2000|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163–74|pmid=10831107|doi=10.1097/00004691-200003000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep dyslexics may be attempting to use this damaged left hemisphere, resulting in severe reading deficits.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warrington|first=Rosaleen A.

Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the "right hemisphere hypothesis" states that deep dyslexics attempt to read using a completely different reading system.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt; According to this hypothesis, they are using the right hemisphere for [[Orthography|orthographic]] and semantic processing, but given that this system does not usually play a role in reading, deep dyslexics have many reading disabilities.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt; Strong support for this hypothesis comes from studies of [[split-brain]] patients who use the right hemisphere for reading. These patients makes semantic errors similar to those seen with deep dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shallice|first=Tim|title=From neuropsychology to mental structure|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page= 112|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521308747|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have shown that the right hemisphere ''can'' contribute to reading when a patient's left hemisphere is damaged.&lt;ref name= "Coslett" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Shallice" /&gt; Brain imaging studies, performed both on deep dyslexics and in other patients with left hemisphere injury, have shown that the damaged left hemisphere is still playing a role in reading.&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt; However, the imaging has also shown that areas of the right hemisphere are also active during reading.&lt;ref name= "Coltheart" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salmelin" /&gt; Thus, it currently appears that there is greater support in favor of the right-hemisphere hypothesis.&lt;ref name = "Coltheart" /&gt;

==Treatment==
There have been many different studies done in an attempt to treat deep dyslexics, all which have been met with varying success. One method that has been frequently used is to teach patients to sound out words using grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence rules (for example, using single letter graphemes such as the letter 'B" to link with larger words such as "Baby", allowing for association of phonemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Rhonda B.|author2=Lott, Susan Nitzberg|title=Successful blending in a phonological reading treatment for deep alexia|journal=Aphasiology|year=2002|volume=16|issue=3|pages=355–372|doi=10.1080/02687040143000627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods are known as "non-lexically based reading treatments". Other studies have looked at attempting to repair the semantic-lexical route, known as "lexically based treatment".&lt;ref name= "Rilling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadie|first=Nicole|author2=Rilling, Eva|title=Evaluation of lexically and nonlexically based reading treatment in a deep dyslexic|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=2006|volume=23|issue=4|pages=643–672|doi=10.1080/02643290500538364}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the methodology, treatment studies with deep dyslexics are difficult because much of the information regarding this disability is still heavily debated.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Treatment options may be successful on repairing one route of reading but not another, and success for one patient may not translate to success in another.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Image:Amazon-river-delta-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|The [[Amazon river]] delta showing no clouds above river waters because water is not a diathermanous fluid.]]
'''Diathermancy''' (from "dia" ''through'' and "thermē" ''heat'') is the property of some fluids that allows rays of light through them without itself being heated. A diathermanous fluid is thus "[[Permeation|permeable]]" by heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?diathermanous]&lt;/ref&gt;). Diathermancy was first described by German physicist and chemist [[Heinrich Magnus]] in the 1800s (&lt;ref&gt;Magnus wrote initially four papers on Diathermancy [http://www.archive.org/stream/catalogueofscien04roya#page/184/mode/1up])&lt;/ref&gt;). Atmospheric air ''is'' diathermanous; therefore, air is not heated by sunshine, but by long wave heat reflected by soil, and especially, by water on the Earth's surface. Water, on the contrary, ''is not'' diathermanous, and it is heated directly by sunshine.
==Atmospheric heating from oceanic waters==
[[File:Nepac sst oper0-Temp-sup-Oc-Pacífico-16-sep-2013.png|thumb|left|350 px|Northeastern Pacific Ocean Surface Water Temperature]]
Atmospheric heat comes from long wave radiation from the soil and, mostly, from the water surface (oceans, lakes, rivers), since water is a not diathermanous body and covers three quarters of Earth's surface. Diathermancy cause [[Subsidence (atmosphere)|subsidence]] on damp or water surfaces. That is because these areas tend to absorb heat radiation directly from the Sun but very slowly and also emits this radiation to the atmosphere very slowly. Therefore, cold ocean currents have very clear skies, without clouds, because subsidence from cold and heavy air avoids or limits [[convection]] since they are opposite processes.

'''Energy policy''' is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of [[energy development]] including [[energy production]], [[Resource distribution|distribution]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].  The attributes of energy policy may include [[legislation]], international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[tax]]ation and other public policy techniques. Energy is a core component of modern economies. A functioning economy requires not only labor and capital but also energy, for manufacturing processes, transportation, communication, agriculture, and more. 

==Background==
Concerning the term of energy policy, the importance of implementation of an eco-energy-oriented policy at a global level to address the issues of global warming and climate changes should be accentuated.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac, Marinko Stojkov, Dražan Kozak. Designing a global energy policy model, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Energy, Vol 170, Issue 1, February, 2017, pp. 2-11. https://doi.org/10.1680/jener.16.00005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research is ongoing, the "human dimensions" of [[energy use]] are of increasing interest to business, utilities, and policymakers. Using the [[social sciences]] to gain insights into energy [[consumer behavior]] can empower policymakers to make better decisions about broad-based [[climate and energy]] options. This could facilitate more [[efficient energy use]], [[renewable energy commercialization]], and [[carbon emission]] reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Armstrong, Catherine Wolfram, Robert Gross, Nathan S. Lewis, and [[M.V. Ramana]] et al., "The Frontiers of Energy", ''Nature Energy'', Vol 1, 11 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to energy is also critical for basic social needs, such as lighting, heating, cooking, and health care. As a result, the price of energy has a direct effect on jobs, economic productivity and business competitiveness, and the cost of goods and services.

==National energy policy==

===Measures used to produce an energy policy===
A national energy policy comprises a set of measures involving that country's laws, treaties and agency directives. The energy policy of a sovereign nation may include one or more of the following measures:

* statement of national policy regarding [[energy planning]], energy generation, transmission and usage
* [[legislation]] on commercial energy activities (trading, transport, storage, etc.)
* legislation affecting [[Efficient energy use|energy use]], such as [[Minimum Efficiency Performance Standards|efficiency standards]], [[emission standard]]s
* instructions for state-owned energy sector assets and organizations
* active participation in, co-ordination of and incentives for mineral [[fuel]]s exploration (see [[geological survey]]) and other energy-related [[research and development policy command ]]
* [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]] related to energy products and services (taxes, exemptions, subsidies ...
* [[energy security]] and international policy measures such as:
** international energy sector treaties and alliances,
** general international trade agreements,
** special relations with energy-rich countries, including military presence and/or domination.

Frequently the dominant issue of energy policy is the risk of supply-demand mismatch (see: [[energy crisis]]). Current energy policies also address environmental issues (see: [[climate change]]), particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Rossi|first2=Piercarlo|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=December 2, 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=232–244|ssrn=1970698|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some governments state explicit energy policy, but, declared or not, each government practices some type of energy policy. Economic and energy modelling can be used by governmental or inter-governmental bodies as an advisory and analysis tool (see: [[economic model]], [[Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems|POLES]]).

===Factors within an energy policy===

There are a number of elements that are naturally contained in a national energy policy, regardless of which of the above measures was used to arrive at the resultant policy.  The chief elements intrinsic to an energy policy are:

* What is the extent of energy self-sufficiency for this nation
* Where future energy sources will derive
* How future energy will be consumed (e.g. among sectors)
* What fraction of the population will be acceptable to endure [[energy poverty]]
* What are the goals for future [[energy intensity]], ratio of energy consumed to [[GDP]]
* What is the reliability standard for distribution reliability
* What environmental externalities are acceptable and are forecast
* What form of "portable energy" is forecast (e.g. sources of fuel for motor vehicles)
* How will energy efficient hardware (e.g. hybrid vehicles, household appliances) be encouraged
* How can the national policy drive province, state and municipal functions
* What specific mechanisms (e.g. taxes, incentives, manufacturing standards) are in place to implement the total policy
* What future consequences there will be for national security and foreign policy&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Michael S. 2013. ''Energy Policy Analysis: A Conceptual Framework''. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State, province or municipal energy policy==

Even within a state it is proper to talk about energy policies in [[plural]]. Influential entities, such as [[municipality|municipal]] or regional governments and energy industries, will each exercise  policy. Policy measures available to these entities are lesser in [[sovereignty]], but may be equally important to national measures.  In fact, there are certain activities vital to energy policy which realistically cannot be administered at the national level, such as monitoring [[energy conservation]] practices in the process of building construction, which is normally controlled by state-regional and municipal [[building code]]s (although can appear [[wiktionary:basic|basic]] federal legislation).

==Americas==

===Brazil===

{{Main article|Energy policy of Brazil}}

[[Brazil]] is the 10th largest [[energy]] consumer in the world and the largest in [[South America]]. At the same time, it is an important [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] producer in the region and the world's second largest [[ethanol fuel]] producer. The governmental agencies responsible for energy policy are the [[Ministry of Mines and Energy (Brazil)|Ministry of Mines and Energy]] (MME), the [[National Council for Energy Policy]] (CNPE, in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-language]] acronym), the [[National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Brazil)|National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels]] (ANP) and the [[Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency|National Agency of Electricity]] (ANEEL).&lt;ref name=weo1&gt;[[International Energy Agency|IEA]].

===Canada===

{{Main article|Energy policy of Canada}}

=== United States  ===
Currently, the major issues in U.S. energy policy revolve around the rapidly growing production of domestic and other North American energy resources. The U.S. drive toward energy independence and less reliance on oil and coal is fraught with partisan conflict because these issues revolve around how best to balance both competing values, such as environmental protection and economic growth, and the demands of rival organized interests, such as those of the fossil fuel industry and of the newer renewable energy businesses. {{Main article|Energy policy of the United States}}

==Europe==

===European Union===
{{Main article|Energy policy of the European Union}}

Although the [[European Union]] has legislated, set targets, and negotiated internationally in the area of energy policy for many years, and evolved out of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], the concept of introducing a mandatory common European Union energy policy was only approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] on October 27, 2005 in [[London]]. Following this the first policy proposals, ''Energy for a Changing World'', were published by the [[European Commission]], on January 10, 2007. The most well known energy policy objectives in the EU are 20/20/20 objectives, binding for all EU Member States. The EU is planning to increase the share of renewable energy in its final energy use to 20%, reduce greenhouse gases by 20% and increase energy efficiency by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obrecht|first1=Matevz|last2=Denac|first2=Matjaz|title=A sustainable energy policy for Slovenia : considering the potential of renewables and investment costs|journal=Journal of renewable and sustainable energy|date=2013|volume=5|issue=3|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jrse/5/3/10.1063/1.4811283 | doi = 10.1063/1.4811283|pages=032301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[energy policy of the United Kingdom]] has achieved success in reducing [[energy intensity]] (but still really high), reducing energy poverty, and maintaining energy supply reliability to date.{{when|date=September 2016}}  The United Kingdom has an ambitious goal to reduce [[carbon dioxide emissions]] for future years, but it is unclear whether the programs in place are sufficient to achieve this objective (the way to be so efficient as France is still hard).  Regarding energy self sufficiency, the United Kingdom policy does not address this issue, other than to concede historic [[energy self sufficiency]] is currently ceasing to exist (due to the decline of the [[North Sea oil]] production).  With regard to transport, the United Kingdom historically has a good policy record encouraging [[public transport]] links with cities, despite encountering problems with high speed trains, which have the potential to reduce dramatically domestic and short-haul European flights. The policy does not, however, significantly encourage [[hybrid vehicle]] use or [[ethanol fuel]] use, options which represent viable short term means to moderate rising transport fuel consumption.  Regarding [[renewable energy]], the United Kingdom has goals for [[wind energy|wind]] and [[tidal energy]].  The White Paper on Energy, 2007, set the target that 20% of the UK's energy must come from renewable sources by 2020.

===The Soviet Union and Russia===
{{Main article|Energy policy of the Soviet Union|Energy policy of Russia}}
The [[Soviet Union]] was the largest energy provider in the world until the late 1980s. [[Russia]], one of the world's [[energy superpower]]s, is rich in natural energy resources, the world’s leading net energy exporter, and a major supplier to the [[European Union]]. The main document defining the [[energy policy of Russia]] is the Energy Strategy, which initially set out policy for the period up to 2020, later was reviewed, amended and prolonged up to 2030. While Russia has also signed and ratified the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Numerous scholars note that Russia uses its energy exports as a foreign policy instrument towards other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Baran, Z. (2007). EU Energy Security: Time to End Russian Leverage.The Washington Quarterly, 30(4), 131–144.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Robert Orttung and Indra Overland (2011) ‘A Limited Toolbox: Explaining the Constraints on Russia’s Foreign Energy Policy’, Journal of Eurasian Studies, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 74-85.

===China===
{{Main article|Energy policy of China}}

===India===
{{Main article|Energy policy of India}}

The energy policy of [[India]] is characterized by trades between four major drivers:
* Rapidly growing economy, with a need for dependable and reliable supply of electricity, gas, and petroleum products;
* Increasing household incomes, with a need for affordable and adequate supply of electricity, and clean cooking fuels;
* Limited domestic reserves of [[fossil fuel]]s, and the need to import a vast fraction of the gas, crude oil, and petroleum product requirements, and recently the need to import coal as well; and
* Indoor, urban and regional environmental impacts, necessitating the need for the adoption of cleaner fuels and cleaner technologies.

In recent years, these challenges have led to a major set of continuing reforms, restructuring and a focus on [[energy conservation]].

===Thailand===

{{Main article|Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)}}

The [[Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)|energy policy of Thailand]] is characterized by 1) increasing energy consumption efficiency, 2) increasing domestic energy production, 3) increasing the private sector's role in the energy sector, 4) increasing the role of market mechanisms in setting energy prices.  These policies have been consistent since the 1990s, despite various changes in governments.  The pace and form of industry liberalization and privatization has been highly controversial.

===Bangladesh===
{{Main article|Energy policy of Bangladesh}}
The first National Energy Policy (NEP) of Bangladesh was formulated in 1996 by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral resources to ensure proper exploration, production, distribution and rational use of energy resources to meet the growing energy demands of different zones, consuming sectors and consumers groups on a sustainable basis.[1] With rapid change of global as well as domestic situation, the policy was updated in 2004. The updated policy included additional objectives namely to ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing minimum damage to environment, to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of energy sector and to bring the entire country under electrification by the year 2020.[2]

==Oceania==

===Australia===
{{Main article|Energy policy of Australia}}

Australia's energy policy features a combination of [[coal]] power stations and [[hydro electricity]] plants. The Australian government has decided not to build [[nuclear power]] plants, although it is one of the world's largest producers of uranium.

'''European studies''' is a field of study offered by many academic [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] that focuses on current developments in [[European integration]].

Some programmes offer a social science or public administration curriculum focusing on developments in the European Union. These programmes usually include a combination of political science, EU public policy, [[European history]], [[European law]], [[economics]] and [[sociology]]. Other universities approach the subject in a broader manner, including topics like [[European culture]], [[European literature]] and [[European languages]]. While all programmes focus on the study of the European Union, they often cover national topics (in a comparative perspective) as well.

The subject combines [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Disciplines that are involved in European studies include:

[[File:Map-of-Oz.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the [[land of Oz]], the fictional realm that is the setting for [[L. Frank Baum]]'s "[[List of Oz books|Oz]]" series.]]
A '''fictional universe''' is a [[consistency|self-consistent]] [[setting (narrative)|setting]] with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world). Fictional universes may appear in [[novel]]s, [[comics]], [[film]]s, [[Television program|television shows]], [[video game]]s, and other creative works.

A fictional universe can be almost indistinguishable from the real world, except for the presence of the invented [[character (arts)|character]]s and events that characterize a work of fiction; at the other extreme, it can bear little or no resemblance to the real world, with invented fundamental principles of time and space.

The subject is most commonly addressed in reference to fictional universes that differ markedly from the real world, such as those that introduce entire fictional cities, countries, or even planets, or those that contradict commonly known facts about the world and its history, or those that feature fantasy or [[science fiction]] concepts such as [[Magic in fiction|magic]] or [[faster than light]] travel—and especially those in which the deliberate development of the setting is a substantial focus of the work.

==Definition==
What distinguishes a fictional universe from a simple setting is the level of detail and internal consistency. A fictional universe has an established continuity and internal logic that must be adhered to throughout the work and even across separate works. So, for instance, many books may be set in conflicting fictional versions of [[Victorian London]], but all the stories of [[Sherlock Holmes]] are set in ''the same'' Victorian London. However, the [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes|various film series based on Sherlock Holmes]]  follow their own separate continuities, thus not taking place in the same fictional universe.

The history and geography of a fictional universe are well defined, and maps and timelines are often included in works set within them. Even new [[fictional language|languages]] may be constructed. When subsequent works are written within the same universe, care is usually taken to ensure that established facts of the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] are not violated. Even if the fictional universe involves concepts such as elements of magic that don't exist in the real world, these must adhere to a set of rules established by the author.

A famous example of a detailed fictional universe is [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (more popularly known as [[Middle-earth]]), of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s books ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.  He created first its [[Languages of Arda|languages]] and then the world itself, which he states was "primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary 'history' for the Elvish tongues."&lt;ref&gt;Foreword to ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', by J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of a [[Fictional universe of Avatar|fictional universe]] is that of the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' film series, as [[James Cameron]] has invented an entire [[Pandoran biosphere|ecosystem]], with a team of scientists to test whether it was viable. Additionally, he commissioned a linguistics expert to invent the [[Na'vi language|''Na'vi'' language]].

Virtually every successful fictional [[TV series]] or [[comic book]] develops its own "universe" to keep track of the various episodes or issues. Writers for that series must follow the ''[[Bible (writing)|story bible]]'',&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000550.php How to Give Maris Hives, Alphabetized] (April 2008), a blog entry by scriptwriter [[Jane Espenson]]&lt;/ref&gt; which often becomes the series canon.

Frequently, when a series is perceived by its creators as too complicated or too self-inconsistent (because of, for example, too many writers), the producers or publishers may introduce [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) to make future editions easier to write and more consistent. This creates an alternate universe that future authors can write about. These stories about the universe or universes that existed before the retcon are usually not canonical, unless the franchise-holder gives permission. ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was an especially sweeping example.

Some writers choose to introduce elements or characters from one work into another, to present the idea that both works are set in the same universe. For example, the character of [[Ursula Buffay]] from American [[sitcom]] ''[[Mad About You]]'' was also a recurring guest star in ''[[Friends]]'', despite the two series having little else in common. Fellow NBC series ''[[Seinfeld]]'' also contained [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] references to ''Mad About You''. [[L. Frank Baum]] introduced the characters of [[Cap'n Bill]] and [[Trot (Oz)|Trot]] (from ''[[The Sea Fairies]]'') into the Oz series in ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'', and they made a number of appearances in later Oz books. In science fiction, [[A. Bertram Chandler]] introduced into his future Galactic civilization the character [[Dominic Flandry]] from [[Poul Anderson]]'s quite different Galactic future (he had Anderson's consent) – on the assumption that these were two [[alternate history]] timelines and that people could on some occasions cross from one to the other.

==Scope==
[[Sir Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' is one of the earliest examples of a cohesive fictional world with its own rules and functional concepts, but it comprises only one small island. Later fictional universes, like [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' stories or [[Lev Grossman]]'s [[Fillory]], are global in scope and some, like ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Honorverse]]'', ''[[BattleTech]]'', or the [[Lensman series]], are galactic or even intergalactic.

A fictional universe may even concern itself with more than one interconnected universe through fictional devices such as dreams, "[[time travel]]" or "parallel worlds". Such a series of interconnected universes is often called a [[parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. Such multiverses have been featured prominently in science fiction since at least the mid-20th century.

The classic ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]" introduced the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], in which the crew members of the [[Starship Enterprise|Starship ''Enterprise'']] were brutal rather than compassionate. The 2009 movie ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' created an "alternate reality" and freed the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[media franchise|franchise]] from [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] issues. In the mid-1980s, [[DC Comics]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' streamlined its fictional continuity by destroying most of its alternate universes.

==Format==
A fictional universe can be contained in a single work, as in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', or in [[serial (literature)|serial]]ized, [[book series|series]]-based, open-ended or [[Round-robin story|round robin]]-style fiction.

In most small-scale fictional universes, general properties and [[timeline]] events fit into a consistently organized [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. However, in the case of universes that are rewritten or revised by different [[writer]]s, [[editing|editors]], or [[Film producers|producer]]s, this continuity may be violated, by accident or by design.

The occasional publishing use of retroactive continuity ([[retcon]]) often occurs due to this kind of revision or oversight. Members of [[fandom]] often create a kind of [[fan-made]] canon ([[canon (fiction)#Nature of fictional canons|fanon]]) to patch up such errors; "fanon" that becomes generally accepted sometimes becomes actual canon. Other fan-made additions to a universe ([[fan fiction]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]], [[pastiche]], [[parody]]) are usually not considered canonical unless they get [[authorization|authorized]].

==Collaboration==
{{see also|Shared universe}}

Shared universes often come about when a fictional universe achieves great commercial success and attracts other media. For example, a successful movie may catch the attention of various book authors, who wish to write stories based on that movie. Under U.S. law, the copyright-holder retains control of all other [[derivative work]]s, including those written by other authors, but they might not feel comfortable in those other mediums or may feel that other individuals will do a better job; therefore, they may open up the copyright on a shared-universe basis. The degree to which the copyright-holder or [[franchise (media)|franchise]] retains control is often one of the points in the [[license agreement#Intellectual property|license agreement]].

For example, the comic book ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' was so popular that it spawned over 30 different radio, television, and movie series and a similar number of [[video game]]s, as well as theme park rides, books, and songs. In the other direction, both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' are responsible for hundreds of books and games of varying levels of canonicity.

Fictional universes are sometimes shared by multiple prose authors, with each author's works in that universe being granted approximately equal canonical status. For example, [[Larry Niven]]'s fictional universe [[Known Space]] has an approximately 135-year period in which Niven allows other authors to write stories about the [[Man-Kzin Wars]]. Other fictional universes, like the [[Ring of Fire series|''Ring of Fire'' series]], actively court canonical [[The Grantville Gazettes|stimulus from fans]], but gate and control the  changes through a formalized process and the final say of [[Eric Flint|the editor and universe creator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =''[[Grantville Gazette III]]'' | others = [[Thomas Kidd (illustrator)|Thomas Kidd]] (cover art) | ISBN = 978-1-4165-0941-7 |id={{ISBN|1-4165-0941-0}} | publisher = [[Baen Books]] | last = [[Eric Flint|Flint, Eric]] and various others | pages = 311–313|quote=The print published and e-published Grantville Gazettes all contain a post book [[afterword]] detailing where and how to submit a manuscript to the fictional canon oversight process for the [[1632 series]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other universes are created by one or several authors but are intended to be used non-canonically by others, such as the fictional settings for [[game]]s, particularly [[role-playing game]]s and video games. Settings for the role-playing game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' are called [[campaign setting]]s; other games have also incorporated this term on occasion. [[Virtual world]]s are fictional worlds in which [[online]] computer games, notably [[MMORPG]]s and [[MUD]]s, take place. A [[fictional crossover]] occurs when two or more [[fictional character]]s, series or universes cross over with one another, usually in the context of a character created by one author or owned by one [[company (law)|company]] meeting a character created or owned by another. In the case where two fictional universes covering entire ''actual'' universes cross over, physical travel from one universe to another may actually occur in the course of the story. Such crossovers are usually, but not always, considered non-canonical by their creators or by those in charge of the [[intellectual property|properties]] involved.

'''Forensic art''' is any [[art]] used in [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[legal process|legal proceedings]]. Forensic art is used to assist law enforcement with the visual aspects of a case, often using witness descriptions and video footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forensicfaces.weebly.com/what-is-forensic-art.html|title=What is Forensic Art? - Forensic Faces Institute|website=forensicfaces.weebly.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a highly specialised field that covers a wide range of artistic skills, such as [[Facial composite|composite drawing]], crime scene sketching, [[image modification]] and identification, courtroom drawings, demonstrative evidence, and postmortem and facial approximation aids. It is rare for a forensic artist to specialise in more than one of these skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiai.org/disciplines/art/history.php|title=History of the I.A.I. Forensic Art Discipline|website=www.theiai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a breakdown of different skills and what they involve:
* &lt;u&gt;'''Composite Drawing:'''&lt;/u&gt; the main objective is to help investigators generate leads based on physical descriptions. This is usually drawn by hand; an artist who is trained in interviewing victims and witnesses uses the information provided to draw what is described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2004/12/forensic-art-defined-and-explained|title=Forensic Art Defined and Explained|date=2004-12-01|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composite art produces a single, graphic image that is designed to be a likeness or similarity of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Image Modification:&lt;/u&gt;''' this is used to change and enhance a photograph in order to help an investigator and/or trial attorney. Examples of this include age progression/regression (see below),&lt;ref name="p1698608879"&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1698608879&lt;/ref&gt; and the clarifying of images, such as from CCTV footage, to identify an individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Image Identification:&lt;/u&gt;''' this is the recording a person's distinguishing features for future reference. Investigators can use this tool to identify suspects who attempts to change their appearance to evade capture, as well as in the study of cold cases in which individuals may have changed their appearance since the event.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Crime Scene Sketching:&lt;/u&gt;''' the drawing of a crime scene; in the sketch, an investigator includes measurements and dimensions to aid in displaying the layout of the scene. This helps support the information shown in photographs of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evidencemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=184|title=Evidence Technology Magazine – Documenting the Crime Scene|last=MAYO|first=KRISTI|website=www.evidencemagazine.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Demonstrative Evidence:&lt;/u&gt;''' any visible, physical evidence used in legal proceedings. These are used to demonstrate aspects of the case, reconstruct an event, and illustrate what happened. There are two categories of demonstrative evidence; court displays and investigative aids.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Postmortem Drawing:&lt;/u&gt;''' when an artist either looks at a deceased person's photograph or their remains to help identify who the person is and what they looked like prior to their death. This helps most in cases where the body is too damaged by an accident or decomposition.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Age Progression/Regression&lt;/u&gt;''': useful to determine what a person's appeearance before or after a period of time. This is most commonly used in missing persons cases or during cold cases when investigators need an idea of what an individual looked like years prior to or following the investigation.
* '''&lt;u&gt;Forensic Sculpture&lt;/u&gt;''': this is used to create three-dimensional models, usually using the skull of the victims. Other features are added such as fake eyes and wigs to add realism. This process can also inform the investigators of certain characteristics of the victim - such as age, race, and gender - through a detailed knowledge of the intricacies of skeletal structure and other corresponding features such as dental records. It is later photograph and used like postmortem and composite drawings. However, because forensic sculpture relies heavily on assumptions made by the artist, it is not considered a legally recognised technique for positive identification, and is thus used in an advisory capacity only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Helmer et al. Assessment of the Reliability of Facial Reconstruction|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Collaboration:'''&lt;/u&gt; forensic artists, anthropologists and other professions are used to help determine the age, sex, and race of an identified skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/jan2001/taister.htm|title=Book Review of Forensic Art and Illustration (by Taylor), by Taister (Forensic Science Communications, January 2001)|last=Taister|first=Karen T. Taylor, Taylor, Michael A. Taister,|work=FBI|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many forensic artists do the job as a collateral duty to their "regular" job in law enforcement, such as police officer, crime scene tech, etc. Such forensic artists perform their work while on a fixed salary and are not additionally compensated for artistic duties. There are few full-time forensic artist jobs available. Most full-time artists work in large cities, or in state or federal agencies. "Freelancing" in forensic art is a difficult career path, as ties to law enforcement are a necessary part of the job, and agencies have limited budgets to pay outside contractors.

The skill of '''facial approximation''' is closely associated and related to [[forensic anthropology]] in that an artist specializes in the reconstruction of the remains of a human body. Generally this discipline focuses on the human face for identification purposes. The forensic artist can create a facial approximation in a number of ways to include 2D ([[drawing]]s), 3D ([[sculpture]]s) and other methods using new computer technology. Forensic artists generally can add greater character and make their subjects come back to "life".

== Methods of Manual 3d construction ==
* Anthropometric was a method developed by [[Wilton M. Krogman]] in 1946 .&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=110682508&amp;site=ehost-livepose-methods.html|title=What is Anthropometric Measurement? - Tools, Purpose &amp; Methods – Video &amp; Lesson Transcript |website=study.com|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facial muscles are recorded by a highly trained professional. This job is particularly tedious, which is why most do not use this method.
* Computerized 3d forensic facial reconstruction- manual model clay techniques are used within this method. Computer systems vary, in that some computerized systems used 3D animation software to model the face onto the skull, while other systems use a virtual sculpture system with Haptic feedback&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com" /&gt;
* Haptic Feedback- The ability to feel the surface of the skull during analysis and also provide important skeletal details for facial reconstruction such as muscle attachment strength, position of eye, position of malar tubercle etc.&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com" /&gt;

== Face model creation ==
When creating a face model, the forensic artist looks at whether the person is masculine or feminine, as well as their skin tone, age, wrinkles, freckles, the shadow of the beard, and attractiveness. There are three segments that they examine: 
* Face shape: round, narrow, heart shape, high/low cheeks, high/low chin, double chin, the distance between lips and nose.
* Eyes: round, upwards/downwards, the distance of eyeballs, eye color, thin/thick eyebrows, high/low arch brow, distance between both eyebrows, distance between eyebrows and eyes.
* Hair: the 3D models have not been programmed to be used with hair, therefore, hair cannot be used the same way as facial attributes. A profile and frontal image of a person is used where 5 to 15 different key features of each hairstyle are selected. These different hairstyles features are from a database used by these professionals. The styles are put into the system where the algorithm automatically estimates the structure of the face. The system is also able to depict different shade of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=23414201&amp;site=ehost-live|title=EBSCOhost Login|website=search.ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Becoming a Forensic Artist ==
To qualify for a professional certification for forensic arts - such as the Forensic Art Certification, which is provided through the [https://www.theiai.org/certifications/artist/index.php International Association for Identification] - applicants can focus on one or more of the three available categories of professional designation: composite imaging, facial reconstruction, and image enhancement/age progression,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and must: 
* have at least 80 hours of IAI-approved forensic art training&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have at least 40 hours of related workshops, lectures, and short program training
* have at least 2 years of experience as forensic arts
* provide at least 30 forensic art examples that include age progressions, composites, and reconstructions
* have a portfolio that demonstrates their forensic art techniques (must include at least 10 forensic art images that were prepared for law enforcement investigation cases)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements, and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10737">The '''Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol''' is a tool that promotes and guides more sustainable [[hydropower]] projects. It is a methodology used to measure the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental, social, technical and economic topics.

Hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact. This is because the construction of a [[dam]], power plant and [[reservoir]] creates certain social and physical changes in the area it effects. The protocol provides a common language to allow governments, [[civil society]], financial institutions and the hydropower sector to talk about and evaluate [[sustainability]] issues.

Assessments are based on objective evidence and the results are presented in a standardised way, to show how new projects are being developed or how existing facilities are performing.

It has been designed to work on projects and facilities anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Home|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Protocol Basics|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application  ==

=== Purpose ===

The Protocol is used by different hydropower stakeholders for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - How it can help|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/How-can-it-help-.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular uses include: 
 
* Independent review of sustainability issues
* Guiding improvement of sustainability practice
* Comparison with international best practice
* Communication with stakeholders
* Facilitating access to finance
* Preparing clients to meet bank requirements
* Reducing investment risk

=== Users ===

[[Crédit Agricole]], [[Société Générale|Societe Generale]], [[Standard Chartered]], [[Citigroup|Citi]], and [[UBS]] now refer to the Protocol in their sector guidance.&lt;ref&gt;http://mediacommun.ca-cib.com/sitegenic/medias/DOC/13870/2012-12-politique-sectorielle-rse-energie-hydroelectricite-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/Document%20RSE/Finance%20responsable/Dams%20&amp;%20Hydropower%20Sector%20Policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sc.com/en/resources/global-en/pdf/sustainabilty/Dams_and_Hydropower_Position_Statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citigroup.com/citi/environment/data/1160840_Sector_Brief_HydroPower.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ubs.com/content/dam/ubs/global/about_ubs/corporate_responsibility/UBS-ESR-framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] has analysed the value of the Protocol for use by their clients, concluding that it is a useful tool for guiding the development of sustainable hydropower in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Protocol for World Bank clients|url = http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/06/20106007/hydropower-sustainability-assessment-protocol-use-world-bank-clients-lessons-learned-recommendations|website = documents.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] has reviewed social and environmental safeguards for large dam projects, concluding that the Protocol currently offers the best available ‘measuring stick’ for the [[World Commission on Dams]] provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A review of social and environmental safeguards for large dam projects|url = http://pubs.iied.org/17517IIED.html|website = pubs.iied.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===

A Protocol assessment takes place over a one-week period at the project site and provides a rapid sustainability check.

A Protocol assessment does not replace an [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental and social impact assessment]] (ESIA), which takes place over a much longer period of time as a mandatory regulatory requirement. A Protocol assessment will, amongst other things, check the scope and quality of the ESIA which has been done.

To ensure high quality, all commercial use of the Protocol is carried out by accredited assessors. These assessors have significant experience of the hydropower sector or relevant sustainability issues, and have passed a rigorous accreditation course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Accredited Assessors|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/Accredited-Assessors.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

=== Tools ===
The Protocol can be used at any stage of hydropower development, from the early planning stages through to operation.  Each project stage is assessed using a different tool: 
* The early stage tool, a screening tool for potential hydropower projects
* The preparation tool, which covers planning and design, management plans and commitments.
* The implementation tool, used through the construction phase.
* The operation tool, used on working projects.

=== Topics ===
The Protocol covers a range of topics that need to be understood to assess the overall sustainability of a hydropower project.

The name and range of topics changes slightly at different project stages.

==== Social aspects ====

*Communications and consultation
*Project benefits
*Project affected communities and livelihoods
*Resettlement 
*[[Indigenous peoples]]
*Labour and working conditions
*Public health
*Cultural heritage

==== Environmental aspects ====

*Environmental and social assessment and management  
*[[Biodiversity]] and invasive species 
*[[Erosion]] and [[sedimentation]]  
*Water quality  
*Waste, noise and air quality  
*[[Reservoir]] planning / preparation and filling / management  
*Downstream flow regimes

==== Business aspects ====

*[[Governance]]
*[[Procurement]]
*Integrated project management 
*Financial viability
*Economic viability

==== Technical aspects ====

*Demonstrated need and strategic fit
*Siting and design
*Hydrological resource
*Asset reliability and efficiency
*Infrastructure safety

The Protocol also includes ‘cross-cutting issues’ such as [[climate change]], [[gender]], and [[human rights]], which feature in multiple topics.

=== Criteria ===
For each sustainability topic, performance is assessed against a range of criteria at two levels: basic good practice and proven best practice.

A multi-stakeholder forum developed the Protocol between 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - History|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/Protocol-development.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following key group were represented: social and environmental NGOs, governments of developed and developing countries, financial institutions, development banks, and the hydropower industry.

The forum jointly reviewed, enhanced and built consensus on what a sustainable hydropower project should look like.

Policies taken into account included the [[World Commission on Dams]]’ Criteria and Guidelines, World Bank Safeguard Policies, IFC Performance Standards, and the [[Equator Principles]].

A draft of the Protocol was released in 2009, which was trialled in 16 countries across six continents and subjected to further consultation involving 1,933 individual stakeholders from 28 countries.

The final version was produced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Download Protocol Document|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/The-Protocol-Documents.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of the forum was important to ensure that the Protocol became globally applicable and universally accepted. Diversity also ensured that the multiple perspectives and stakeholder interests surrounding a hydropower project were incorporated into the document.

== Governance  ==
The Protocol is governed by a multi-stakeholder body, the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Council (HSA Council).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Governance.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Council is to ensure multi-stakeholder input and confidence in the Protocol's content and application.

All individuals and organisations engaged in hydropower are welcome and encouraged to join the Council. This approach to governance ensures that all stakeholder voices are heard in the shaping of the use of the Protocol and its future development.

The Council consists of a series of Chambers, each representing a different segment of hydropower stakeholders. Each chamber elects a chair and alternate chair for a two-year term. The chamber chairs come together regularly to form the decision-making Protocol Governance Committee. The current Governance Committee (elected May 2015) is shown in the table below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24148">'''In-Situ Capping (ISC) of Subaqueous Waste''' is a non-removal [[environmental remediation|remediation]] technique for contaminated [[sediment]] that involves leaving the waste in place and isolating it from the environment by placing a layer of soil and/or material over the contaminated waste as to prevent further spread of the [[contaminant]]. In-situ capping provides a viable way to remediate an area that is contaminated. It is an option when [[Environmental remediation#Pump and treat|pump and treat]] becomes too expensive and the area surrounding the site is a low energy system. The design of the cap and the characterization of the surrounding areas are of equal importance and drive the feasibility of the entire project. Numerous successful cases exist and more will exist in the future as the technology expands and grows more popular.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt; In-situ capping uses techniques developed in [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geotechnical engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and [[environmental geotechnical engineering]].

==Introduction==
[[Contaminant]]s located in sediments still pose a risk to the environment and human health. Some of the direct effects on aquatic life that can be associated with contaminated sediment include “the development of cancerous tumors in fish exposed to [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s in sediments."&lt;ref name="Palermo"&gt;Palermo, M., Maynord, S., Miller, J., and Reible, D. 1998. "Guidance for [[In-Situ]] Subaqueous Capping of Contaminated Sediments," EPA 905-B96-004, Great Lakes National Program Office, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; These high-risk sediments need to be remediated. There are usually only four options for remediation:

#Nonremoval technologies&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
## Containment in-place (In-Situ Capping)
## Treatment in-place
#Removal technologies&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
## Removal and containment
## Removal and treatment

The cap can be made up of many different things, including but not limited to sand, gravel, [[geotextile]]s, and multiple layers of these options.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;

There are many ways that a contaminant inside sediment can become introduced to the environment. These ways include but are not limited to advection, diffusion, [[Benthos|benthic organisms]] mixing and reworking of the upper layer of the contaminated sediment, and sediment re-suspension by different subaquatic forces.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; In-situ capping (ISC) can fix all of these adverse effects with three primary functions:

# Isolation of the contaminated sediment from the benthic environment; this prevents the contaminant from spreading up the food chain.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt; This isolation of the contaminant is the most important factor in reducing exposure risks.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
# Prevention of resuspension and transport of the contaminant, referred to as stabilization of the sediments.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
# Reduction of the flux of dissolved contaminants into the water column, also known as chemical isolation.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"&gt;Reible, D. 2003. “In Situ Remediation Through Capping: Status and Research Needs,” Department of Civil Engineering, University of Texas. Austin, Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth, although not necessary, function of an in-situ cap should be the "encouragement of habitat values." This should not be made a primary goal except in extreme circumstances. This can be achieved by altering the superficial characteristics of the cap to "encourage desirable species or discourage undesirable species."&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

The obvious advantage of using in-situ capping is that the waste will not be disturbed, and it prevents further contamination of the surrounding area from movement of the contaminant by removal. Sadly, the long-term effects of ISC have not been studied since it is an emerging technology.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

In-situ capping has been effective in numerous locations. For example, in several places in the interior of Japan “in-situ capping of nutrient-laden sediments with sand” has worked very well in preserving water quality by reducing “the release of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)” and oxygen depletion by bottom sediments.&lt;ref name="Zeman"&gt;Zeman, A. J., Sills, S., Graham, J. E., and Klein, K. A. 1992. Subaqueous Capping of Contaminated Sediments: Annotated Bibliography, NWRI Contribution No. 92-65, National Water Research Institute, Burlington, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site evaluation==

===Remedial objectives===
It is very important to evaluate the site and goals of a specific project to determine if ISC is the right technique to use. First, it is important to find out if ISC will satisfy all of the desired remedial objectives. To determine if ISC will satisfy the remedial objectives it is important to look at the three primary functions previously listed for ISC. For the first function it is important to realize that “the ability of an ISC to isolate aquatic organisms from the sediment contaminants is dependent upon” the deposition of new sediment contaminants being deposited on the cap. If contaminated sediment is deposited back on top of the cap then a cap was built to separate to contaminated layers. Thus, “ISC should only be considered if source control has been implemented."  Stabilization of the contaminated sediment could be a design function if the goal of remediation is to prevent negative environmental impacts due to “resuspension, transport and redeposition” of the contaminated sediments to other remote areas. Furthermore, if a remedial objective is desired, then the purpose of the ISC could be to isolate the contaminated soil from the surrounding environment, thus controlling the environment of the contaminated soil and causing possible degradation of the contaminate.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Criteria===
On site evaluation to see if ISC is a good remediation technique is based on several criteria: the surrounding physical environment, current and long-term hydrodynamic conditions, the geotechnical and geological conditions, hydrogeological conditions, on-site sediment characterization, and current and long-term waterway uses.&lt;ref name="Sharma" /&gt;

Many of the physical properties of the surrounding area where the cap would be placed are important. Some things to consider when constructing a cap would be “waterway dimensions, water depths, tidal patterns, ice formations, aquatic vegetation, bridge crossings and proximity of lands or marine structures”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; It is best if the area surrounding the ISC is flat for ease of installation.

===Hydrodynamic conditions===
The hydrodynamic conditions are of equal importance. It is best if in-situ capping projects are performed in low-energy waterways such as harbors, low flow streams, or estuaries.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;Sharma, H., Reddy, K. 2004. ''Geo-Environmental Engineering'', Site Remediation, Waste Containment, and Emerging Waste Management Technologies, pp 938–958.&lt;/ref&gt; High energy and high flow environments can affect the long-term stability of the cap and cause plausible erosion over time. Currents are also important. Currents vary along a water column and placement of the ISC can be negatively affected by changing currents. It is important to take into consideration the long-term impacts of episodic events such as tidal flow on bottom current velocities. Modeling must be done to determine if placement of the in-situ cap will alter existing hydrodynamic conditions.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Geotechnical and geological conditions===
A study of the geotechnical and geological conditions must be made before the placement of the in-situ cap because of potential settling underneath the cap. If settling is predicted to be significant, the cap design may have to be designed thicker than originally projected to allow the settling to not alter the integrity of the cap.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

Hydrogeological conditions are important to consider before placement. It is important to locate areas of discharge, which are areas where the groundwater flow path has an upward component.&lt;ref name="Freeze"&gt;Freeze, R.A. and Cherry, J.A. 1979; ''Groundwater''&lt;/ref&gt; This discharge can cause the in-situ cap to become displaced or cause containments to be transported to the surface water, thus causing decreased effectiveness of the in-situ cap.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Sediment characterization===
Typical sediment characterization is needed before construction and design of the ISC can be implemented. These tests on the sediments include: “visual classification, natural water content/solids concentrations, plasticity indices ([[Atterberg limits]]), [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) content, grain size distribution, [[specific gravity]], and Unified Soil Classification System (USCS)”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Waterway uses===
It is important to realize what the current waterway uses are and how they may be affected with the placement of an in-situ cap. Some waterway uses that may be affected by the construction of an in-situ cap include but are not limited to “navigation, flood control, recreation, water supply, storm water or effluent discharge, waterfront development, and utility crossing." Since the construction of an in-situ cap may limit some of these activities due to the importance that the caps integrity be maintained over an extended period of time, any use that may cause displacement of the cap should be limited. Furthermore, the construction of an in-situ cap will cause a drop in water depth thus limiting the size of ships that may cross the area. These limitations on the waterway may also have social and economic impacts that must be considered.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Regulatory standards===
It is important to know all of the regulatory standards in place for the desired location of the ISC. All ISC must comply with the requirements in the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA), although the ability of in-situ capping to meet those standards in the long term has not been successfully researched and studied enough due to lack of data.

==Cap design==
Cap design, which includes the composition and dimensions of the components, is probably the most important aspect of in-situ capping. The cap designs “must be compatible with available construction and placement techniques” along with meeting the three previously mentioned criteria above. The cap designs usually are over small areas with small volumes of contaminants. The cap is usually constructed with many layers of granular media, armor stone, and geotextiles. Presently, laboratory tests and models of the various processes involved (advection, diffusion, bioturbation, consolidation, erosion), limited field experience, and monitoring data drive cap design. Since data and field experience is limited a conservative approach is used when designing an in-situ cap. This approach uses the idea that the many different components are additive and no cap component provides a dual function, although a component may provide a dual function in actual practice.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===The six steps of cap design===
The six general steps for in-situ cap design, provided by Palermo et al. are listed below:&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

# Identify candidate capping materials and compatibility with contaminated sediment at the site.
# Assess the bioturbation potential of indigenous benthos and design a cap component to physically isolate sediment contaminants from the benthic environment.
# Evaluate potential erosion at the capping site due to currents, waves, propeller wash, and design a cap component to stabilize the contaminated sediments and other cap components.
# Evaluate the potential flux of sediment contaminants and design a cap component to reduce the flux of dissolved contaminants into the water column.
# Evaluate potential interactions and compatibility among cap components, including consolidation of compressible materials.
# Evaluate operational considerations and determine restrictions or additional protective measure needed to assure cap integrity.

===Selection of materials===
Identifying the materials should be assessed at the beginning of the project because they typically represent the largest cost to the project. Thus, if the materials needed cost too much the project may not be feasible at all.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;
Granular materials are used in most cases. These can include but are not limited to “quarry sand, naturally occurring sediments or soil materials”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Studies have shown that fine-grained materials and sandy materials can be effective in the construction of an in-situ cap.&lt;ref name=Brannon&gt;Brannon, J. M., Hoeppel, R. E., Sturgis, T. C., Smith, I., and Gunnison, D. 1985. “Effectiveness of Capping in Isolating Contaminated Dredged Material from Biota and the Overlying Water, “ Technical Report, D-85-10, US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, fine grain materials have been shown to act as better chemical barriers than sand caps.&lt;ref name="Suszkowski"&gt;Suszkowski, D. J. 1983. “Studies on Capping of Contaminated Dredged Material by the New York District Corps of Engineers.” In Proceedings of the 7th Annual US/Japan Experts Meeting, 134–145. US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station: Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a fine grain material is a better capping component than factory-washed sand.  It is important to have control the amount of organic material within the cap because the benthic organisms have shown interest in burrowing within any unconsolidated fine grained sediments containing organic matter.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Increased levels of organic matter in sands have shown an increase in the retardation of hydrophobic organic contaminants through the cap and encourage degradation of contaminant.&lt;ref name="Reible" /&gt; Thus a careful balance of organics is necessary.

===Geomembranes===
[[Geomembranes]] can serve numerous purposes in a cap design, including “provide a bioturbation barrier; stabilize the cap; reduce contaminant flux; prevent mixing of cap materials with underlying sediments; promote uniform consolidation, and; reduce erosion of capping materials”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Geomembranes have been used for stabilization in two projects along with granular media for the ISC constructed at [[Sheboygan River]] and in Eitrheim Bay, Norway.&lt;ref name="Instanes"&gt;Instanes. D. 1994. “Pollution Control of a Norwegian Fjord by Use of Geotextiles,” Fifth International Conference on Geotextiles, Geomembranes, and Related Products, Singapore, 5–9 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Although geomembranes seem to have great benefits, the problem of uplift and ballooning has arisen and not much research has gone into assessing what causes the lift of the geomembranes off of the surface.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;Cooke et al 1993.'' Restoration and Management of Lakes and Reservoirs'', Second Edition, Lewis Publishers, Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is needed to determine the overall effectiveness of [[geosynthetics]] for chemical isolation.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Cap armoring===
[[Armoring stone]], which is any stone that is used to "shield" the rest of the in-situ cap, can be used for resistance to erosion and should be considered in cap design.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt; The long-term ability of the cap to perform depends primarily on its ability to withstand external forces, mostly hydraulic forces.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt; There are three basic approaches that may be used to have long-term cap stability:

#The cap layer needs to be armored sufficiently to hold up under the various hydraulic forces.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#Cap at a deeper layer since hydraulic forces typically decrease with decreasing depth.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#Try to control the hydraulic forces to limit their effect on the cap layer with breakwaters, dams, navigational controls, etc.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

===Bioturbation===
[[Bioturbation]] is defined as the disturbance and mixing of sediments by benthic organisms. Many aquatic organisms live on or in the bottom sediments and can greatly increase the “migration of sediment contaminants through the direct movement of sediment particles, increasing the surface area of sediments exposed to the water column, and as a food for [[epibenthic]] or [[pelagic]] organism grazing on the benthos." The depth of bioturbation in marine environments is greater than that in fresh water environments. To prevent and reduce the impact of bioturbation on the cap, the cap should be designed with a sacrificial layer, typically only a few centimeters thick (5–10&amp;nbsp;cm). This layer will be assumed to be completely mixed with the environment and should prevent benthic organism from descending further into the in-situ cap. The thickness of the sacrificial layer should be based on a study of the local organisms and their behavior in the surrounding sediment near the area of the cap construction, since some benthic organisms have been known to burrow at depths of 1m or more. The presence of armor stone has been known to limit the colonization by deep burrowing benthic creatures. Another method of preventing benthic organisms from destroying the integrity of the cap design is to pick a granular media that the local benthic organism find unattractive and are not known to readily colonize on that surface, thus limiting the chance a benthic organism will grown on the cap.

The consolidation of the in-situ cap must be considered, provided that the selected material for the cap “is fine-grained granular material." The consolidation of the underlying material should be taken into account due to “advection of pore water upward into the cap during consolidation."&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Erosional effects===
Erosion should be carefully considered. To determine the level of protection against erosion it is important to look at “the potential severity of the environmental impacts associated with cap erosion and potential dispersion of the sediment contaminants in an extreme event” (such as a 100-year event). An under-designed in-situ cap could be compromised by erosion resulting in the release of contaminants. An over-designed cap would result in extremely high costs.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

==Construction==
Since the construction of the cap will directly affect the ability of the in-situ cap to perform it is important to plan carefully. It is important to note that "many contaminated sediment sites exhibit exceedingly soft sediments that can be easily disturbed, may be dislocated or destabilized by uneven placement, and may have insufficient load bearing capacity to support some cap materials." &lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

There are two basic was to construct an in-situ cap:
#Land-based placement: this involves using equipment near the shore or working in narrow channels. The cap in constructed with standard construction equipment such as "backhoes, clamshells, dumped from trucks, and/or spread with bulldozers." The major limitation of this method is the reach of the equipment.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
#Pipeline or barge placement: this involves placing the in-situ cap with a barge or a pipeline. Using different types of equipment to place the cap components on the ocean bed or lake bed. This is typically the desired method when working in deep areas or offshore.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

==Monitoring==

===Five steps for a monitoring program===
Fredette et al. outlines five steps for the development of a physical/biological monitoring program for ISC projects:&lt;ref name="Fredette"&gt;Fredette, T.J., Nelson, D.A., Clausner, J.E., and Anders, F.J. 1990. “Guidelines for Physical and Biological Monitoring of Aquatic Dredged Material Disposal Sites,” Technical Report D-90-12, US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Designating site-specific monitoring objectives
# Identifying elements of the monitoring plan
# Predicting responses and developing testable hypotheses
# Designating sampling design and methods
# Designating management options

Thus it is important a monitoring program be put into place at the onset of construction. A short-term monitoring program should be used to monitor the in-situ cap during construction and immediately following construction. This monitoring program should include frequent testing so real-time data is provided to allow quick adjustments to the overall cap design. A long-term monitoring program should be established to provide data about the overall effectiveness of the cap design and to make sure the cap is meeting all of its required regulations and that the cap is not excessively eroded. This long-term monitoring need only be assessed on a yearly to bi-yearly basis unless a problem is discovered; then more frequent testing will be required.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

During monitoring, it is important to schedule routine maintenance. This may include placement of material equal to the predicted amount of material removed due to erosion.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

==Case studies==
Although ISC is a relatively new remediation procedure several groups have used it with great success.

===General Motors Superfund Site===
In [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]], at the [[General Motors]] [[Superfund site]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-contaminated soils were dredged repeatedly but some areas still had high levels of contaminant (&gt;10ppm). These areas were capped, an approximate area of {{convert|75000|sqft|m2}}, with a three-layer ISC composed of 6&amp;nbsp;inches of sand, 6&amp;nbsp;inches of gravel and 6&amp;nbsp;inches of armor stone.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Manistique River, Michigan===
In [[Manistique River]], [[Michigan]], PCB-contaminated sediments were capped with a 40mm thick plastic liner over an area of {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}} with varying depths of up to 15&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Sheboygan River, Wisconsin===
In Sheboygan River, Wisconsin, PCB-contaminated sediments were capped with a sand layer and armor stone layer. This was done in shallow regions were direct placement was possible.&lt;ref name="Eleder"&gt;Eleder, B. 1992. Sheboygan River Capping/armoring Demonstration Project, Presented at a Workshop on Capping Contaminated Sediments, May 27–28, 1992, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marathon Battery Remediation Project===
In [[Cold Spring, New York]], in the [[Hudson River]], sediment was contaminated with cadmium and nickel from a battery manufacturing facility. A Geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and a 12-inch covering of sandy loam was planted on top of the contaminated area.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

===Galaxy/Spectron Superfund Site===
In  [[Elkton, Maryland]], contaminated sediment was discovered with excess amounts of [[Volatile organic compound|volatile organic]] components and [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]]s, resulting is severe discharge. The cap system constructed over the contaminated waste involved a geotextile working mat, a GCL, a scrim-reinforced polypropylene liner, a geotextile cushion, and a gabion mat.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

==Future research==
There are four major areas of research that currently need to be assessed:

#"Research into the fate and transport behavior of specific contaminants that do not behave in the simple manner assumed in current cap evaluation approaches (e.g. mercury)" &lt;ref name ="Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into the fate processes associated with physical, chemical and biological gradients within a cap" &lt;ref name = "Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into the influence of transport processes facilitated by [[nonaqueous phase liquid]] ([[NAPL]]) or gas migration"&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into cap amendments that may encourage sequestration or degradation fate processes" &lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

The '''''Inscriptiones Graecae''''' ('''IG'''), [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Greek inscriptions'', is an academic project originally begun by the [[Prussian Academy of Science]], and today continued by its successor organisation, the ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften''. Its aim is to collect and publish all known [[ancient]] [[inscriptions]] from the mainland and islands of [[Greece]].

The project was designed as a continuation of the ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' (''Corpus of Greek Inscriptions'', abbreviated CIG) published by [[August Böckh]] between 1825 and 1860, and as a parallel to the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' (''Corpus of Latin Inscriptions'') founded by [[Theodor Mommsen]] in 1847. From 1860 to 1902, it was directed by [[Adolf Kirchhoff]]. From 1902 to 1931, [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] was in control of the project; he reorganised and re-energised the IG, turning it into one of the most important series for the publication of source material in [[Classical studies]].

After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the project suffered from a lack of financial and motivational support. It came to a temporary halt in 1972, but was revived by the newly reformed Berlin-Brandenburg Academy in 1994.

So far, 49 [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s have been published, some of them in several editions. The preparation of individual volumes is partially entrusted to external scholars, in which case the Berlin Academy retains the final [[editing]]. The Academy also maintains a collection of [[squeeze (copying method)|"squeezes"]] (paper copies) of Greek inscriptions. The project is currently directed by [[Peter Funke]]. Editors of previous volumes include [[Wilhelm Dittenberger]], [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], [[Johannes Kirchner]] and [[Günther Klaffenbach]].

All editorial texts are published in [[Latin language|Latin]], a fact that is occasionally criticised in view of the decreasing use of that language and the extra effort required from editors. The inscriptions were published without translation, but [[German language|German]] translations for all volumes since 2012 are available on the IG website.

'''Liberal conservatism''' is a [[list of political ideologies|political ideology]] combining [[conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on ethical and social issues, or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} It is a political position which also supports [[civil liberties]] along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions and is usually regarded as a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] ideology. In [[western Europe]], especially [[northern Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and has also adopted some [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] positions.

==Overview, definitions and usage==
As both "conservatism" and "liberalism" have had different meanings over time and across countries, the term "liberal conservatism" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[conservatism]], which rejects the principle of equality as something in discordance with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and the United States), the term "liberal conservatism" came to be understood simply as "conservatism" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical liberal values to call themselves "[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112&lt;/ref&gt; However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a "hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the term "liberal conservatism" is not used. American "[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]" happens to be quite different from the [[Liberalism in Europe|European brand]] and occupies the [[center-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] and [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those conservatives who have embraced [[national conservatism|national conservative]] views, more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stances and/or outright [[populism]], let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. Several regional characteristics can be observed:

* In much of [[central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries as well as Britain and [[Belgium]], a divide persists between liberals on the centre and conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) further to their right.
* On the other hand, in countries strongly influenced by French political culture, such as Spain, Italy or Greece, economic liberalism was originally adopted in the 1830s by social conservatives; as a result, the 'niche' of liberalism is split between two distinct traditions:  'liberalism' itself is considered a centre-right, conservative philosophy, distinct from the centre-left political tradition of social-democratic and humanist liberalism known as Radicalism.

Often liberalism therefore involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. Compared to other [[centre-right politics|centre-right politic]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;al traditions, such as those proposed by Christian democrats, liberal conservatism is less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] economically, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy. In the modern European discourse, "liberal conservatism" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and environmentalism. In this sense, "liberal conservatism" has been espoused for instance by [[nordic countries|Nordic]] conservative parties (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have seen right-wing populist parties emerge to their right and do not comprise Christian democrats who form separate parties and the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[David Cameron]], who in an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010 said that he had always described himself as a "liberal conservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first speech to a Conservative Party's conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of "grand schemes to remake the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm "Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference"], BBC, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]
Historically, in the 18th and 19th centuries "[[conservatism]]" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous "[[liberalism]]" – now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] – advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].

According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is "economics is prior to politics".&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, Sandoff, "Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism." ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435–464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of current liberal conservatism as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] and the ideological outlook of centre-right parties. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] – without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term "liberal" is used to describe those with free market economic views. This is the case, for example, in [[continental Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;dq=EU+left-wing+liberal+parties&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Europe, a Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics - Hans Slomp - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Michael |title='Liberal?

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
===Lexicostatistics===
The proposed measures used for linguisitic distance reflect varying understandings of the term itself. One approach is based on [[mutual intelligibility]], i.e. the ability of speakers of one language to understand the other language. With this, the higher the linguistic distance, the lower is the level of mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"&gt;{{Citation | title=Receptive multilingualism: linguistic analyses, language policies, and didactic concepts |author1=Jan D. ten Thije |author2=Ludger Zeevaert | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2007 | isbn=978-90-272-1926-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gIEN068J3gC | quote=''... Assuming that intelligibility is inversely related to linguistic distance ... the content words the percentage of cognates (related directly or via a synonym) ... lexical relatedness ... grammatical relatedness ...''|date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[cognate|cognate words]] play an important role in mutual intelligibility between languages, these figure prominently in such analyses. The higher the percentage of cognate (as opposed to non-cognate) words in the two languages with respect to one another, the lower is their linguistic distance. Also, the greater the degree of grammatical relatedness (i.e. the cognates mean roughly similar things) and lexical relatedness (i.e. the cognates are easily discernible as related words), the lower is the linguistic distance.&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt; As an example of this, the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''pānch'' is grammatically identical and [[lexical similarity|lexically similar]] (but non-identical) to its cognate [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''panj'' as well as to the lexically dissimilar but still grammatically identical [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pent-''&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Greek and Latin roots in English#P]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[English language|English]] ''five''. As another example, the English ''dish'' and [[German language|German]] ''tisch'' 'table' are lexically (phonologically) similar but grammatically (semantically) dissimilar. Cognates in related languages can even be identical in form, but semantically distinct, such as ''caldo'' and ''largo'', which mean respectively  'hot' and 'wide' in Italian but 'broth, soup' and 'long' in Spanish. Using a statistical approach (called [[lexicostatistics]]) by comparing each language's mass of words, distances can be calculated between them. In technical terms, what is calculated is the [[Levenshtein distance]].&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt; Based on this, one study compared both [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] to see which was closer to Dutch. It determined that the Dutch and Afrikaans (mutual distance of 20.9%) were considerably closer than Dutch and West Frisian (mutual distance of 34.2%).&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt;

However, lexicostatistical methods, which are based on retentions from a common proto-language – and not innovations – are problematic due to a number of reasons, so some linguists argue they cannot be relied upon during the tracing of a phylogenetic tree (for example, highest retention rates can sometimes be found in the opposite, peripheral ends of a language family).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems"&gt;http://www.elisanet.fi/alkupera/Problems_of_phylogenetics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual innovativeness or conservativeness of a language can distort linguistic distance and the assumed separation date, examples being [[Romani language]] and [[East Baltic languages]] respectively.&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt; On the one hand, continued [[Language contact|adjacency]] of closely related languages after their separation can make some loanwords 'invisible' (indistinguishable from cognates, see [[etymological nativization]]), therefore,  from lexicostatistical point of view these languages appear less distant then they actually are (examples being [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Saami languages]]).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt; On the other hand, strong foreign influence of languages spreading far from their homeland can make them share less inherited words than they should do (examples being [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Samoyedic languages]] in the East Uralic branch).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt;

===Other internal aspects===
Besides cognates, other aspects that are often measured are similarities of [[syntax]] and written forms.&lt;ref name="chiswick2004hsk"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chiswick | first1 = B. R. | last2 = Miller | first2 = P. W. | doi = 10.1080/14790710508668395 | title = Linguistic Distance: A Quantitative Measure of the Distance Between English and Other Languages | journal = Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development | volume = 26 | pages = 1–11 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = | hdl = 10419/20510 }} ''... vocabulary, grammar, written form, syntax and myriad other statistics ... this scalar measure of "linguisitic distance" is demonstrated through an analysis of the determinants of English language proficiency among immigrants ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome the aforementioned problems of the lexicostatistical methods, [[Donald Ringe]], [[Tandy Warnow]] and [[Luay Nakhleh]] developed a complex phylogenetical method relying on phonological and morphological innovations in 2000s.&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt;

===Language learning===
A 2004 paper by economists Barry Chiswick and Paul Miller attempted to put forth a metric for linguistic distances that was based on empirical observations of how rapidly speakers of a given language gained proficiency in another one when immersed in a society that overwhelmingly communicated in the latter language. In this study, the speed of English language acquisition was studied for immigrants of various linguistic backgrounds in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].{{Vague|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref name="chiswick2004hsk"/&gt;

'''''The Lives of Flemish, German, and Dutch painters''''' refers to a compilation of artist biographies by [[Jean-Baptiste Descamps]] published in the mid 18th-century that were accompanied by illustrations by [[Charles Eisen]]. The list of illustrations follows and is in page order by volume. Most of the biographies were translated into French from earlier work by [[Karel van Mander]] and [[Arnold Houbraken]]. The illustrated portraits were mostly based on engravings by [[Jan Meyssens]] for [[Het Gulden Cabinet]] and by Arnold and [[Jacobus Houbraken]] for their ''[[Schouburgh]]'', while the work examples engraved in the margins of the portraits were mostly based on engravings by [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]].

'''Manipulation check''' is a term in [[experimental research]] in the [[social science]]s which refers to certain kinds of secondary evaluations of an experiment.

== Overview ==
Manipulation checks are measured variables that show what the manipulated variables concurrently affect besides the dependent variable of interest.

In experiments, an experimenter manipulates some aspect of a process or task and [[Random assignment|randomly assigns]] subjects to different levels of the manipulation ("experimental conditions"). The experimenter then observes whether variation in the manipulated variables cause differences in the [[dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]. Manipulation checks are targeted at variables beside the dependent variable of interest.

Manipulations are not intended to verify that the manipulated factor caused variation in the dependent variable.  This is verified by random assignment, manipulation before measurement of the dependent variable, and [[statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]] of effect of the manipulated variable on the dependent variable.  Thus, a failed manipulation check does not refute the hypothesis that the manipulation caused variation in the dependent variable.

In contrast, a successful manipulation check can help an experimenter rule out reasons that a manipulation may have failed to influence a dependent variable.  When a manipulation creates significant differences between experimental conditions in both (1) the dependent variable and (2) the measured manipulation check variable, the interpretation is that (1) the manipulation "causes" variation in the dependent variable (the "effect") and (2) the manipulation also explains variation in some other, more theoretically obvious measured variable that it is expected to concurrently influence, which assists in ''interpreting'' the "cause" (i.e., it only help interpret the "cause"; it is not necessary to ''affirm'' that the "cause" ''causes'' an effect).{{Clarify|date=August 2016}}

'''The March of the Living''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|מצעד החיים}} ''Mits'ad HaKhayim'') is an annual educational program which brings students from around the world to [[Poland]], where they explore the remnants of the [[Holocaust]].  On Holocaust Memorial Day (''[[Yom HaShoah]]''), thousands of participants march silently from [[Auschwitz]] to [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]], the largest [[Nazi concentration camp]] complex built during [[World War II]].

The program was established in 1988 and takes place annually for two weeks around April and May, immediately following [[Passover]].&lt;ref name="motl"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.motl.org|website=motl.org|title= March of the Living International}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marchers have come from over 50 countries, as diverse as [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[China]], [[Estonia]], [[Panama]], [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Hungary]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="marchoftheliving"&gt;{{cite web| website=motl.org| url=http://www.marchoftheliving.org |title=March of the Living Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli founders of the March of the Living were [[Avraham Hirschson]] and Dr. Shmuel Rosenman. They were assisted in the early years by Jewish communal leaders and philanthropists from the United States (Alvin Schiff, Gene Greenzweig and Joseph Wilf, the first North American Chair of the March of the Living), and Canada (Walter Hess, Shlomo Shimon, Rabbi Irwin Witty,  and [[Eli Rubenstein]]).

== Commemoration of World War II death marches ==
The climax of the program is the March, which is designed to contrast with the [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]] which occurred towards the end of [[World War II]].  When [[Nazi Germany]] withdrew its soldiers from [[forced-labour camps]], inmates – most already starving and stricken by oppressive work – were forced to march hundreds of miles further west, while those who lagged behind or fell were shot or left to freeze to death in the winter climate. The March of the Living, in contrast to the death marches, serves to illustrate the continued existence of the Jewish people despite [[Nazi]] attempts at their obliteration.

After spending a week in Poland visiting other sites of Nazi Germany's persecution, such as Majdanek, Treblinka, and the Warsaw Ghetto, and former sites of Jewish life and culture, various Synagogues, many of the participants in the March also travel on to Israel where they observe [[Yom Hazikaron]] (Israel's Remembrance Day) and celebrate [[Yom Haatzmaut]] (Israel's Independence Day).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://passport.bbyo.org/destination/FJA/ |title=BBYO Passport: March of the Living |website=Passport.bbyo.org |language=en |access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational value ==
The March of the Living is mainly aimed at Jewish [[high school]] students and its goals are both universal (fighting indifference, racism and injustice) and particular (opposing anti-semitism, and strengthening their sense of Jewish identity).&lt;ref name="universalandparticulargoals"&gt;[http://marchoftheliving.org/goals-of-the-march-of-the-living 12 Goals of the March of the Living]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key element of the program is the participation of Holocaust survivors who share the memory of their war-time experiences with the students, while they are still well enough to participate in this challenging two week trip of the young.

Though the vast majority of participants in the March of the Living are Jewish high school students from different countries including Israel, there are many non-Jewish groups in attendance, along with adult groups such as the Polish Friends of Israel, Japan's Bridges for Peace and others.

== Exhibit ==
In mid January 2014 a new exhibit on the March of the Living opened at the [[United Nations]], which housed the exhibit until the end of March 2014.&lt;ref name="Youtube Playlist"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDjofQRyRwpf_-JX2hmktzbaoMnaVUwM8 March of the Living Exhibit Opening at the United Nations videos.]&lt;/ref&gt; Titled "When you Listen to a Witness, You Become a Witness", the exhibit includes photographs, documents and writings devoted to the 25-year history of the March of the Living. The exhibit tells the stories of the aging survivors and their young students who, hand in hand, embark on a life-changing journey and return profoundly transformed.  It also contains archival photos of deportation and mass murder from the Holocaust period.&lt;ref name="UN2014/01/15"&gt;[http://marchoftheliving.org/2014/01/15/un-exhibit-to-honor-march-of-the-living-when-you-listen-to-a-witness-you-become-a-witness/  UN Exhibit to Honor March of the Living “When You Listen to a Witness, You Become a Witness”] March of the Living Canada 2011-2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

An interactive component of the exhibition allows visitors to fill out their own pledge of tolerance and compassion which may be taken on the March of the Living and planted alongside thousands of other plaques of tolerance and compassion on the very grounds of Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/video/news/audioplayer.html?clipid=2432907763 March of the Living. CBC Radio: Metro Morning audio recording.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the exhibit is taken from the words of Judy Weissenberg Cohen in a speech given to students on the 1997 March of the Living describing the last time she saw her mother during the selection of Hungarian Jewry in Auschwitz-Birkenau in the spring of 1944.&lt;ref name="CJN Article"&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/?q=node/121095 UN to host March of the Living exhibit] The Canadian Jewish News, January 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPost Article"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/New-exhibit-at-UN-dedicated-to-preserving-Holocaust-memory-339776 New exhibit at UN dedicated to preserving Holocaust memory] Jewish World - Jerusalem Post 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesofIsraelArticle"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/holocaust-exhibit-at-un-stresses-memory-and-hope/  Holocaust exhibit at UN stresses memory and hope] The Times of Israel 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2014, a group of students from New York's [[Pine Bush High School]]&lt;ref name="NYTimes article on regional anti-semitism"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/nyregion/us-cites-evidence-of-anti-semitism-in-school-district.html|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|title = U.S. Cites Evidence of Anti-Semitism in School District|first = Benjamin|last = Weiserjan|date = January 25, 2014|accessdate = April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; part of a district where there have been press reports alleging widespread anti-Semitism &amp;ndash; visited the UN Exhibit.

In November 2015, the Exhibit was mounted at the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March of The Living Exhibit is open to the visitors of Auschwitz Museum|url=http://motl.org/march-of-the-living-exhibit-is-open-to-the-visitors-of-auschwitz-museum/|website=March of the Living International|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Exhibit became the basis of a book published in the fall of 2015, titled, [[Witness: Passing the Torch of Holocaust Memory to New Generations]]. The book has a unique interactive feature where the survivors, World War II liberators, and [[Righteous Among the Nations]] featured in the book, include an invisible link embedded on their image. When their image is accessed with a smart phone or other device, the reader is taken to an excerpt of their video testimony on [[USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education]] (created by [[Steven Spielberg]]) or [[March of the Living Digital Archive Project]] websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Testimony Clips in New Book from the March of the Living|url=https://sfi.usc.edu/news/2015/12/10558-watch-testimony-clips-new-book-march-living|publisher=[[USC Shoah Foundation]]|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations in several other languages are already in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lungen|first1=Paul|title=Book Passes the Torch of Holocaust Memory|url=http://www.cjnews.com/culture/books-and-authors/book-passes-the-torch-of-holocaust-memory|accessdate=23 December 2015|publisher=The Canadian Jewish News|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supplementary programs ==
In recent years the March of the Living (MOTL) has attempted to broaden its focus from only concentrating on the Holocaust, and include other program content in the Poland portion of the trip.  These elements include: celebrating Jewish life before the war, establishing dialogue with Polish students, meeting with [[Polish Righteous among the Nations]], and connecting with the contemporary Polish Jewish community.

The [[March of Remembrance and Hope]] (MRH) is a program designed for university/college students of all religions and backgrounds. This program, founded in 2001, takes place in May, and in recent years, has included a 2-day trip to Germany, before the 5 day Poland portion of the trip. The purpose of the March of Remembrance and Hope is to teach students of various religious and ethnic backgrounds about the dangers of intolerance through the study of the Holocaust and other World War II genocides, and to promote better relations among people of diverse cultures. Holocaust survivors also participate in the March of Remembrance and Hope program. Since its inception, students of a wide variety of religions and ethnicities have taken part.

== Cultural impact ==
In 2009 two different documentaries featured March of the Living participants or students on similar experiences during their time on the trip. The documentary ''[[Defamation (film)|Defamation]]'', by filmmaker [[Yoav Shamir]], includes a group of Israeli students during their time at Poland sites, including the stop at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Israeli Documentary Challenges Jewish Responses to Anti-Semitism {{!}} Film|url = http://www.jewishjournal.com/film/article/israeli_documentary_challenges_jewish_responses_to_anti-semitism_20091117/|website = Jewish Journal|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Director Jessica Sanders made a documentary titled [[imdbtitle:1186809|March of the Living]], which focuses entirely on the program and participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jessica Sanders - Documentary|url = http://jessicasandersfilm.com/documentary.html|website = jessicasandersfilm.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151201001601/http://www.jessicasandersfilm.com/documentary.html|archivedate = 2015-12-01|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 2015 saw the release of ''[[Blind Love (2015 film)|Blind Love]]'', a documentary film about blind Israelis traveling to Poland with the help of their guide dogs on the March of the Living to learn about the Holocaust. The film, Blind Love: A Holocaust Journey Through Poland with Man's Best Friend, premiered during Holocaust Education Week in Toronto, with the co-sponsorship of the [[Toronto Jewish Film Festival]]. It was also broadcast on the CBC's Canadian [[speciality channel]] [[documentary (TV channel)|Documentary]] in late 2015 and then again in 2017 on Holocaust Remembrance Day, as well as in Israel on its main station [[Channel 10 (Israel)]] on the same day.

'''Margaret Elizabeth Egan''' (March 14, 1905 – January 26, 1959) was an American librarian and communication scholar who is best known for “Foundations of a Theory in Bibliography,” published in ''Library Quarterly'' in 1952 and co-authored with [[Jesse Shera|Jesse Hauk Shera]]. This article marked the first appearance of the term "[[social epistemology]]" in connection with library science.

==Biography==
Margaret Egan was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], in 1905. She obtained a B.A. at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1939 and completed graduate work at both [[Yale University]] (1940–41) and the [[University of Chicago]] (1941–43). She worked at the [[Cincinnati Public Library]] from 1933 to 1940; in 1943 Egan joined the Industrial Relations Center of the [[University of Chicago]] as librarian and began teaching in the [[Graduate Library School]] (GLS). She was appointed as an assistant professor in the GLS in 1946 and was an associate editor of ''Library Quarterly'' from 1952 to 1955. She left Chicago in 1955 and joined [[Jesse Shera]] at the [[School of Library Science]] at [[Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where she first served as a research associate at the newly formed Center for Documentation and Communication Research. In 1956 she was appointed as an associate professor.

Egan died of a heart attack in 1959 at the age of 53.

==Social Epistemology==
[[Social epistemology]], “the production, distribution, and utilization of intellectual products” (Egan and Shera 1952), correlates the production and consumption of information to that of material goods. Shera later wrote that social [[epistemology]] “is the study of knowledge in society,” distinct from previous investigations of individual knowledge.

Furner (2004) lists the following contributions made in “Foundations of a Theory of Bibliography”:
* Establishing “informed social action” as the goal of library service.
* Establishing the extent to which librarianship contributes to attaining this goal as “the primary criterion by which [bibliographic services] may be evaluated.”
* Providing “a theoretical framework … for the study of [[information-seeking]] behavior, knowledge organization, and bibliometrics,” which is then treated as “a theoretical foundation for library and information science.”
* Using the term “[[social epistemology]]” in this context for the first time.

==Errors of Attribution==
Although Egan was the first author on “Foundations of a Theory of Bibliography,” her untimely death (and Shera’s prolific publishing that followed) have led to frequent omissions of her name when citing the work. In 1978, Shera wrote that "both the term and the concept [of social epistemology] were hers, but because I have given it wide currency, despite frequent disclaimers, it has generally been attributed to me.”&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Shera, "Egan, Margaret Elizabeth (1905–1959)", in B. S. Wynar, ed., ''Dictionary of American Library Biography'' (Littleton, Colorado: Libraries Unlimited, 1978), p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica''' is a [[music museum]] and [[music library]] in the Palazzo Aldini Sanguinetti, in the historic center of [[Bologna, Italy]].

==Museum==

===Background===
The Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 to hold the city's collection of musical objects. It was renamed Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica in 2004 when the museum's current site, the Palazzo Sanguinetti, opened to the public. The palace was reopened after a long and careful restoration that brought the rich, interior [[frescoe]]s back to their original splendour. These frescoes were first completed between the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and provide one of the finest examples of Napoleonic and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] decoration.

The purpose of the museum was to make the public aware of the rich musical heritage owned by the Comune di Bologna. Until recently, much of this heritage remained confined in warehouses – primarily due to lack of adequate space – and was only brought out occasionally for temporary display.

Palazzo Sanguinetti offered the possibility to enhance the cultural value of such precious musical heritage and to provide an environment worthy of the priceless items displayed. The palace also guarantees ideal conditions for managing and conserving these items.

The institute is now divided into two sites. An ample selection of volumes, paintings, and musical instruments are displayed in the museum halls in Strada Maggiore 34 (Palazzo Sanguinetti), while the majority of bibliographic material is accessible in Piazza Rossini 2 (the ex-Convent of San Giacomo) in rooms attached to the G.B. Martini Conservatory of Music.

In the early 16th century, the original core of the Palazzo Sanguinetti belonged to the Loiani family. The building was sold in 1569 to the Bolognese brothers, Ercole and Giulio Riario, who were originally from Savona and were related to the della Roveres. Having acquired neighboring land and buildings, Senator Ercole Riario had the home reconstructed and enlarged. The individual homes were united into one structure, and construction on the impressive staircase, which still characterizes the building today, was likely begun. The second major reconstruction was commissioned by Count Antonio Aldini, to whom the Marquis Raffaello Riario Sforza had granted a long-term lease in 1796. Count Aldini tasked the architect Giovanni Battista Martinetti (1774–1830) with modernizing the building. A neighboring house was attached to the tower belonging to the Oseletti family, and the huge 16th-century hall was divide into two rooms, which correspond to the modern museum's two most spacious rooms – the vestibule, or the Room of Virtues, and the Ballroom.

Following the fall of [[Napoleon]] and the economic ruin of Aldini, the palace was sold to the Cuban nobleman don Diego Pegnalverd, a former member of the Napoleonic government. Upon his death in 1832, the palazzo passed to the famous tenor, [[Domenico Donzelli]]. It is noted that [[Gioachino Rossini]] stayed there while his own nearby home was under reconstruction. In 1870 the Sanguinetti family purchased the building. They were responsible for the most recent decorations in the intended library and the “Egyptian Room.” During recent renovations of the palazzo, marvelous frescoes were discovered in these two areas.

In 1986 the last heiress, Eleonora Sanguinetti, donated the larger part of the building to the Comune di Bologna in memory – as she wrote in her will – of “my unforgettable father, Dr. Guido Sanguinetti. I wanted to donate the building in Strada Maggiore 34 in his name and memory, and for the love that he always had for his city and his home, so that it could become a music museum and library.”

===The frescos and decorations===
The Palazzo Sanguinetti decorations displays works by major 18th- and 19th-century [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] painters, such as [[Pelagio Palagi]] (1777–1860), [[Serafino Barozzi]], and [[Antonio Basoli]] (1774–1848), under the direction of [[Vincenzo Martinelli]] (1737–1807). On the ground floor, the landscape fresco (a magnificent trompe-l'oeil perspective) is attributed to [[Luigi Busatti]], while the [[quadratura]] is the work of [[Francesco Santini]] (1763–1840). Santini, with the probable collaboration of [[Serafino Barozzi]] (1735–1810), also decorated the walls of the grand staircase. On the first floor, the Woodland Room (Room 1), used as and called the Banquet Room, was designed by Martinelli: he illustrates landscapes rich with greenery and classical architecture in the distance. These classical elements surround the onlooker in the illusion of a step that supports hermes and statues of Bacchus and Ceres, works by a young Palagi.&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions by Paola Foschi writes in the museum guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aeneas Room (Room 2), also by Palagi, depicts stories of the [[Aeneid]] on a black, ''Etruscan'' background. The Zodiac and Aurora Room (Room 3) depicts the Zodiac signs by Domenico Corsini (1774–1814) and a figure of Aurora, attributed to Palagi. The last small room of the east wing (Room 4) is decorated by artists from the Barozzi workshop.  They are also credited with the two rooms (Rooms 6 and 7) that conclude the west wing, which are decorated in ''oriental'' style with curtains and pavilions, exotic plants, and feminine figures with small umbrellas. Room 5 is the Ballroom. At the end of the museum tour are two salons in the apartment designed by Aldini; they were the first two rooms to be decorated. The original room (Room 8), is decorated by Antonio Basoli in a ''neo-gothic'' style, with figures, statues, and bass reliefs by [[Pietro Fancelli]] (1764–1850).

====Father Giovanni Battista Martini====
[[File:Padre Martini 1.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Padre Gianbattista Martini. Author: Angelo Crescimbeni, 1770.]]

The original core of the museum's musical collections is credited to the Conventual Franciscan [[friar]], [[Giovanni Battista Martini]] (Bologna, April 24, 1706 – August 3, 1784), important 18th-century music scholar and collector, a theorist and composer, and a teacher of counterpoint. [[Johann Christian Bach]] and [[Mozart|Wolfgang Amadé Mozart]] were among his students.

At only 19 years old, Martini was appointed chapel-master of the Church of [[Basilica of San Francesco, Bologna|San Francesco]] in Bologna. His fame as an excellent teacher and connoisseur of music began to grow when he “won” a dispute with the scholar, Redi, regarding the interpretation of a mysterious ''canone dell'Animuccia'' that existed in the choir gallery of the Santa Casa di Loreto, where Redi himself was chapel-master. After this triumph, not content with being only a scholar, he continued his music studies and was an admired composer of [[sonatas]] for the harpsichord, canons, and about 500 unpublished musical pieces.

The numerous letters conserved in the library (around 80 volumes with more than 6,500 letters), document the broad network of musicians, aristocrats, singers, and [[cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]] who had contacts with Martini. Even the [[Emperor of Austria]] visited Padre Martini while in Bologna. Martini collected not only manuscripts and musical works of various kinds, but also portraits of musicians displayed on the walls of his library in the Monastery of San Francesco.

===Exhibition path===
[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Wolfgang Amadé Mozart, composer Author:unknown, 1777.]]
The museum path opens among the lush decorations of '''the Boschereccia Room''' with some symbolic works which serve as an introduction to the museum and prepare the visitor for their trip through the musical universe.

'''Rooms 2''' and 3 are dedicated to the spiritual father of the new museum, pictured in an oval by Angelo Crescimbeni: Giambattista Martini, whose priceless moral heritage, both intellectual and material, is celebrated here and made known to the greater public.
&lt;br /&gt;
In '''Room 3''', the relationships between [[Padre Martini]] and the stand-out personalities of the music world of the time, such as the young [[Mozart]] or [[Johann Christian Bach]], who is represented in the famous portrait by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], are displayed. In the same room, one can also admire the famous Sportelli di libreria musicale by [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]].&lt;br /&gt;
'''Room 4''' (“The Idea of Music”) follows, which is dedicated to the musical scholars from the 15th century to the 17th century, with important examples of musical treatises, and portraits of their respective authors. This room also contains some musical instruments of great importance, like the unique omnitonum harpsichord  by [[Vito Trasuntino]] ([[Venice]] 1606).

Some of the more relevant pieces are on display in the following '''Room 5''' (Arts Room), which is dedicated to the “Books for music and instruments of the 16th and 17th centuries.” In this room, rare texts from ranging the 15th century to the famous Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A, the first printed musical book by [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], can be admired. They are kept inside very modern, circular cases in the center of the room, which match the rich decoration of the floors.

Then there are the instruments: lutes; the harmony of flutes by Manfredo Settala of 1650, which represents a real unicum;
the pochette, various little violins used as instruments by dance instructors, the ghironde, the serpentoni, the extraordinary series of horns and cornets from the 16th and 17th centuries, and finally, a unique performance instrument: the tiorba, which is in the shape of a khitára.

Italian opera is the focus of the following room.
The 18th century are first in '''Room 6''', dedicated to the famous singer [[Carlo Broschi]], known as [[Farinelli]].

His beautiful portrait, painted by [[Corrado Giaquinto]], dominates the room, together with the portraits of the castrati from various periods and of composers from the time, such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]] and [[Domenico Cimarosa]].

'''Room 7''' places the visitor in the 19th century with [[Gioachino Rossini]], whose name is forever tied to [[Bologna]]. Portraits, busts, and libretti from the first recitals of [[Isabella Colbran]], a singer and Rossini's first wife, can be found here. Also of interest is the original score of [[The Barber of Seville]] and some rather curious personal effects, like a dressing gown and a wig. Finally, one can behold Rossini's grand piano, which was constructed in 1844 by [[Camille Pleyel]].

The path proceeds through the centuries, the musical uses, and styles in '''Room 8''', which is dedicated to “Books for music and instruments in the 18th and 19th centuries.” There are viole d'amore and flutes along with the original scores composed by [[Torelli]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Ferdinando Bertoni|Bertoni]], etc. There are also clarinets and the beautiful Buccin, created in [[Lyon]] by Jean Baptiste Tabard (1812–1845).

Concluding the exhibit, '''Room 9''' pays a proper tribute to two important people in the Italian and Bolognese musical culture, [[Giuseppe Martucci]] and [[Ottorino Respighi]].  This room displays the composer's portraits, photographs, and a selection of works from the Respighi property, which were donated to the library in 1961 by his widow, Elsa, for the 25th anniversary of his death. In the same room lies the portrait of the musician Arrigo Serato, painted by the famous artist [[Felice Casorati]].

===Collections===
The first floor of the Palazzo is home to the nine rooms of the exhibition, which illustrates about six centuries of the history of European music. There are over one hundred paintings of famous people from the music world, which are a part of the picture gallery started by Padre Giovanni Battista Martini, more than eighty antique musical instruments, and a large selection of valuable historical documents, such as treatises, volumes, opera libretti, letters, manuscripts, original musical scores, etc.

==Library==
[[File:Due sportelli di libreria con scaffali di libri di musica.jpg|thumb|right|Libreria. Autore:G.M.Crespi, c. 1720 – 1730. Collocazione: Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica]]
The collection inherited from Padre Martini constitutes one of the most prestigious collections of music repertory printed between the 16th and 18th centuries because of its incunabulums, valuable manuscripts, opera libretti, and for the unique collection of autographs and letters, which are the result of the correspondence Martini painstakingly kept with eminent people, scholars, and musicians of the time.
Saved from the [[Napoleonic]] confiscations  due to the intervention of [[Stanislao Mattei]], Martini's disciple and successor, the valuable bibliographic patrimony was donated to the Liceo musicale di [[Bologna]] in 1816. The Liceo had been founded in 1804 at the ex-convent of the Agostinians in the church of San Giacomo Maggiore. The library grew considerably throughout the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, thanks to the amount of materials produced from the didactic activity of the Liceo (famous students of the Liceo included Rossini, Donizetti, and Respighi and directors Mancinelli, Martucci, and Busoni).
The library also grew because of the valuable items and rare volumes that were acquired by [[Gaetano Gaspari]], who was appointed as librarian in 1855.
Gaspari directed the library for many years with a unique zeal and knowledge. After many years of hard work and constant effort, he was able to excellently organize and card-catalogue all the library material (also from this period came the posthumous publication, the "Library Catalogue of the Liceo Musicale di Bologna", which bears his name and is now also available online).
In 1942, when the Liceo musicale was transformed into a state institution – Regio Conservatorio di Musica – the [[Comune di Bologna]] chose to maintain ownership of Padre Martini's bibliographic patrimony and the attached picture gallery.
The Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 in order to conserve and make the most of the bibliographic patrimony and portrait gallery.

===Picture gallery===
[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|right|Supposed portrait of [[Antonio Vivaldi]]. Author and date unknown.]]
There is not much information about the development of the picture gallery, which seems to have had no rivals in [[Bologna]] during the 18th century. From the valuable letters of correspondence that [[Padre Martini]] kept with different well-known people of the time (for example, musicians that were his students in [[Bologna]], members of the [[Philharmonic Academy of Bologna|Accademia Filarmonica]], music theorists, composers, nobles, illustrious intellectuals, chapel masters, and custodians of Franciscan convents), it is evident that there was a complex network of informers and intermediaries that were responsible for finding the portraits he desired.
Many of the portraits were commissioned to the artists directly by [[Padre Martini]]. The painters drew the features of the musicians from engravings of the time. In reality, he wasn't interested in the artistic worth of the paintings as much as their plausible resemblance to the model. He was also more interested in whether they were in harmony with his century's interest in the physiognomic reading of faces with the intention of giving iconographic testimony of the people bonded by one common denominator – music. It was also important that the paintings had a direct relationship with his Library.
It's worth noting that there are many paintings by famous artists present in the collection, including the portrait of [[Farinelli]] by [[Corrado Giaquinto]], the portrait of [[Johann Christian Bach]] by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], and one of [[Charles Burney]] by [[Joshua Reynolds]].
It also seems that the prestige of Padre Martini, who was considered the most knowledgeable [[Europe]]an expert on the art of music, was so great that it was important for a musician of that time to have their portrait in his gallery. This served as a recognition of the musician's merit.
The picture gallery remained in the convent of [[San Francesco]] even after Martini's death, surviving the [[Napoleonic]] confiscations thanks to Martini's successor, Padre Stanislao Mattei. Only in 1801 was it transferred to the ex-convent of the Agostinians at the Chiesa di San Giacomo Maggiore. Today, the collection consists of 319 paintings, the majority of which are oil on canvas with some pastels and drawings.

===The collection of musical instruments===
The musical instruments displayed in the rooms of the museum originate from the collections of two important Bolognese institutions: the Museo Civico Medievale and the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. The core of this collection from the Museo Civico Medievale comes from the Liceo musicale, which was founded in 1804. As Federico Parisini (the Liceo librarian from 1881 to 1891) explained, following the Napoleonic suppressions, “the instruments, many famous musical works, chorus books, rare instruments, and other items related to music were sold publicly.”
The central administration of the Dipartimento del Reno had asked the government of the Repubblica Cisalpina to purchase and conserve the objects that risked being dispersed. The recovered instruments were then entrusted to the Liceo and, in 1881, were finally added to the Museo Civico Medievale, where they have remained until today.
Among the most valuable instruments now displayed in the rooms of the museum is the Trasuntino harpsichord of 1606 (displayed in Room 4). It was constructed for Camillo Gonzaga, the Count of Novellara, and afterwards was passed to Giuseppe Baini (1775–1844), the celebrated author of the first biography of [[Palestrina]]. In his will, Baini bequeathed the harpsichord to the Liceo Musicale. Other valuable instruments on display are the Trasuntino monochord, which was built to tune the cymbal, and the 5-reed flute, which is able to mimic several flutes playing in harmony. There is also the polyphonic flute (displayed in Room 5), which bears the mark of Manfredo Settala (1600–1680), a Milanese rector, who was a great collector and famous personality in the cultural panorama of the 17th century.
The origin of the collection of musical instruments in the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale is more uncertain. The collection includes some particularly important models, such as eight pianos, five of which are grand pianos and three of which are rectangular. These pianos date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Among these are the priceless Erard from 1811 (that possibly belonged to Paolina Borghese), which was restored for the inauguration of the museum and is now exhibited in Room 8. Also included are [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] piano of 1844 (exhibited in Room 7), and the so-called “spinette of Padre Martini”, a rectangular Glonner from 1780 (displayed in Room 3). Other important instruments on display are the Heckelphon of 1900 (Room 8), various English horns, some cornets, and two oboes.

The '''National Humanities Medal''' is an American award that annually recognizes several individuals, groups, or institutions for work that has "deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened our citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities."&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/awards.html |title=Awards and Honors |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |accessdate=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- is it always, or always nowadays, or not always conferred ceremonially by the US President? --&gt;

The annual '''[[Charles Frankel]] Prize in the Humanities''' was established in 1988 and succeeded by the National Humanities Medal in 1997. The initial design for the National Humanities Medal was created by a 1995 Frankel Prize winner, [[David Macaulay]], and was used for all recipients through 2012.&lt;ref name=awards /&gt; During 2013, The National Endowment for the Humanities ran a public competition for a new medal design, judged by metalsmith [[Chunghi Choo]], coin engraver [[Don Everhart]] of the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]] and sculptor [[George Anthonisen]]. In June 2013, the agency announced that a design by Paul C. Balan of Illinois had been selected as the winner. The final medal will be unveiled in Washington D.C. in November 2013. The new design was used for the first time for the 2013 National Humanities Medals, which were presented in mid-2014.&lt;ref name=NewNHM2013&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul C.

Medals are conferred once annually, usually by the U.S. President, to as many as twelve living candidates and existing organizations nominated early in the calendar year. The President selects the winners in consultation with the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref name=nominations&gt;{{cite  web |url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/medalsnominate.html |title=National Humanities Medals Nominations |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEH asks that nominators consult the list of previous winners and consider the [[National Medal of Arts]] to recognize contributions in "the creative or performing arts".&lt;ref name=nominations /&gt;

[[Image:National Oceanography Centre Southampton UK seen from waterfront.jpg|thumb|National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK]]
The '''National Oceanography Centre Southampton''' (NOCS) is a centre for research, teaching, and technology development in Ocean and Earth science. NOCS was created in 1995 jointly between the [[University of Southampton]] and the UK [[Natural Environment Research Council]] and is located within the port of [[Southampton]] at a purpose-built dockside campus with modern facilities. In 2010 the University and NERC components demerged, and the NERC-managed component became the [[National Oceanography Centre]] (NOC – with the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in Liverpool). The two components of NOCS continue close collaboration through the jointly run Graduate School, shared research facilities and laboratories, complementary research groups, and many joint research grants and publications. The University component “Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton” (OES) is part of the Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, (FNES). It was ranked 30th in the world for Earth and Marine Sciences by the [[QS World University Rankings]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="University of Southampton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/news/2014/2/southampton_positioned_30_in_the_world_rankings_for_ocean_and_earth_science.page|title=Southampton positioned 30 in the world rankings for Earth and Marine Sciences|author=University of Southampton|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:AYool NOCS 2004-05-01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|National Oceanography Centre, Southampton at sunset]]

The centre can trace its origins back to the years immediately after [[Second World War]], when the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) was founded.&lt;ref name=NIO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/history-national-institute-oceanography|title=History of the National Institute of Oceanography|accessdate=1 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919061745/http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/history-national-institute-oceanography|archivedate=19 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan to create National Oceanography Centre Southampton as a centre of excellence in marine and earth science was formulated in the late 1980s to early 1990s by the Natural Environment Research Council in coordination with the University of Southampton. According to that plan a research and teaching complex was erected on the new Waterfront Campus dock-side location within the [[Port of Southampton]] to become the new home for the former National Institute of Oceanographic Science (from Wormley, Surrey), the Research Vessel Service (from Barry, Wales) and the former University of Southampton departments of Geology and Oceanography. NOCS was officially opened in 1996 as the Southampton Oceanography Centre by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] (he also renamed it the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, in 2005).

The Centre's inaugural director from 1994-99 was [[John Shepherd (scientist)|John Shepherd]], a former Deputy Director of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] and an [[Earth system science|Earth system scientist]].&lt;ref name="director"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/influential-scientists/professor-john-shep | title=Professor John Shepherd FRS | publisher=NOCS | accessdate=5 September 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208084855/http://noc.ac.uk/about-us/history/national-oceanography-centre-southampton/influential-scientists/professor-john-shep | archivedate=8 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOCS's on-site resources include the National Marine Facilities, UK National Oceanographic Library, the Discovery Collections, a branch of the British Oceanographic Data Centre and the British Ocean Sediment Core Repository. The National Oceanographic Library holds the UK's most extensive collection of oceanographic literature and one of the largest marine science libraries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/undergraduate/study/facilities.page&lt;/ref&gt;

OES is ranked 30th in the world for Earth and Marine Sciences by the [[QS World University Rankings]], rising from 47th in 2012 and 38th in 2013.&lt;ref name="University of Southampton"/&gt;

==Facilities==
NOCS consists of the University of Southampton’s OES academic unit, together with five NERC research divisions and the NERC's National Marine Facilities Sea Systems. In addition, NOCS houses teaching facilities for nearly 1000 students (undergraduate, Master and PhD).

===Research vessels===
[[File:RRS Discovery-1.jpg|thumb|RRS ''Discovery'' inbound to Southampton]]
NOCS is the base for the purpose-built research vessels [[RRS Discovery (1962)|RRS ''Discovery'']] and [[RRS James Cook|RRS ''James Cook'']] (and formerly [[RRS Charles Darwin|RRS ''Charles Darwin'']]). In 2014 the RRS ''Discovery'' has been replaced and the new ''Discovery'' will remain based at NOCS. For fieldwork and research by university staff and students OES further operates three vessels, including the {{convert|19.75|m}} catamaran RV ''Callista'' and the {{convert|12|m}} RV ''Bill Conway''.

&lt;!--Basic introduction; who he is--&gt;
'''Avram Noam Chomsky''' (born December 7, 1928) is an American [[linguist]], [[philosopher]], [[cognitive scientist]], [[historian]], [[Activism|political activist]], and [[Social criticism|social critic]]. Sometimes described as "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in [[analytic philosophy]] and one of the founders of the field of [[cognitive science]]. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and laureate professor at the [[University of Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MITLinguistics/posts/1547120331974705|title=MIT Linguistics|via=Facebook|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/worldrenowned-linguist-noam-chomsky-joins-ua-faculty|title=World-Renowned Linguist Noam Chomsky Joins UA Faculty|work=UANews|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as [[linguistics]], war, politics, and [[mass media]]. Ideologically, he aligns with [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].

&lt;!--Early life up until 1966--&gt;
Born to middle-class [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] immigrants in [[Philadelphia]], Chomsky developed an early interest in [[anarchism]] from alternative bookstores in New York City. He began studying at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] at age 16, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955, he was appointed to [[Harvard University]]'s [[Society of Fellows]]. While at Harvard, he developed the theory of [[transformational grammar]]; for this, he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. Chomsky began teaching at MIT in 1957 and emerged as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', which remodelled the scientific study of language. From 1958 to 1959, he was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. Chomsky is credited as the creator or co-creator of the [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]] theory, the [[generative grammar]] theory, the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], and the [[minimalist program]]. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of [[behaviorism]], being particularly critical of the work of [[B. F. Skinner]].

&lt;!--Later life post-1967--&gt;
Chomsky [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|vocally opposed U.S. involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], believing the war to be an act of [[American imperialism]]. In 1967, Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]". Associated with the [[New Left]], he was arrested multiple times for his activism and was placed on [[Nixon's Enemies List|Nixon's "Enemies List"]]. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the [[Linguistics Wars]]. In collaboration with [[Edward S. Herman]], Chomsky later co-wrote [[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|an analysis]], which articulated the [[propaganda model]] of media criticism, and worked to expose the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. Additionally, his defense of [[freedom of speech]]—including free speech for [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]]—generated significant controversy in the [[Faurisson affair]] of the early 1980s. Following his retirement from active teaching, Chomsky has continued his vocal political activism by opposing the [[War on Terror]] and supporting the [[Occupy Movement]].

&lt;!--Brief assessment of Chomsky's reception and legacy:--&gt;
One of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a [[paradigm shift]]er who helped spark a [[cognitive revolution|major revolution]] in the [[human sciences]], contributing to the development of a new [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivistic]] framework for the study of [[language]] and the [[mind]]. In addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading [[Criticism of American foreign policy|critic]] of [[U.S. foreign policy]], [[neoliberalism]] and contemporary [[state capitalism]], the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and mainstream [[news media]]. His ideas have proved highly significant within the [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] movements. Some of his critics have accused him of [[anti-Americanism]].

== Early life ==

===Childhood: 1928–45===
Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the [[East Oak Lane, Philadelphia|East Oak Lane]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=9|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=3}} His father was [[William Chomsky|William "Zev" Chomsky]], an Ashkenazi Jew originally from [[Ukraine]] who had fled to the United States in 1913. Having studied at [[Johns Hopkins University]], William went on to become school principal of the [[Congregation Mikveh Israel]] religious school, and in 1924 was appointed to the faculty at [[Gratz College]] in Philadelphia. Chomsky's mother was the Belarusian-born Elsie Simonofsky (1904–1972), a teacher and activist whom William had met while working at Mikveh Israel.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=9–10|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=What motivated his [political] interests? A powerful curiosity, exposure to divergent opinions, and an unorthodox education have all been given as answers to this question. He was clearly struck by the obvious contradictions between his own readings and mainstream press reports. The measurement of the distance between the realities presented by these two sources, and the evaluation of why such a gap exists, remained a passion for Chomsky.|source=Biographer [[Robert F. Barsky]], 1997{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=30–31}}}}
{{external media| float = left|width = 270px| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?88099-1/noam-chomsky-life-dissent Presentation by Robert F. Barsky on ''Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent'', July 19, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}
Noam was the Chomsky family's first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=11–13|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} The brothers were close, although David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=11–13}} Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of [[Zionism]]; the family was particularly influenced by the [[Left Zionism|Left Zionist]] writings of [[Ahad Ha'am]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=11–13|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} As a Jew, Chomsky faced [[anti-semitism]] as a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities living in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=15}}

Chomsky described his parents as "normal [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]" who had a [[centre-left politics|center-left]] position on the political spectrum; however, he was exposed to [[far-left politics]] through other members of the family, a number of whom were [[socialism|socialists]] involved in the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=14|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=11, 14–15}} He was substantially influenced by his uncle who owned a newspaper stand in New York City, where Jewish leftists came to debate the issues of the day.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=23|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=12, 14–15, 67|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=4}} Whenever visiting his uncle, Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores in the city, voraciously reading political literature.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=23}} He later described his discovery of [[anarchism]] as "a lucky accident",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=17–19}} because it allowed him to become critical of other far-left ideologies, namely [[Stalinism]] and other forms of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=17–19|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=16, 18}}

Chomsky's primary education was at [[Oak Lane Day School|Oak Lane Country Day School]], an independent [[Deweyism|Deweyite]] institution that focused on allowing its pupils to pursue their own interests in a non-competitive atmosphere.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=12|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} It was here, at the age of 10, that he wrote his first article, on the spread of [[fascism]], following the [[Catalonia Offensive|fall of Barcelona]] to [[Francisco Franco]]'s fascist army in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=13|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} At the age of 12, Chomsky moved on to secondary education at [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], where he joined various clubs and societies and excelled academically, but was troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching used there.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=21–22|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=14|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=4}} During the same time period, Chomsky attended the Hebrew High School at [[Gratz College]]. From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17}}

In 1945, Chomsky, aged 16, embarked on a general program of study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning [[Arabic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=47|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=47}} However, he was frustrated with his experiences at the university, and considered dropping out and moving to a [[kibbutz]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=17}} His intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist [[Zellig Harris]], whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=48–51|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19, 31}} Chomsky's [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] honors thesis was titled "Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew", and involved his applying Harris's methods to the language.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=32}} Chomsky revised this thesis for his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], which he received at Penn in 1951; it would subsequently be published as a book.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=33}} He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of his teacher [[Nelson Goodman]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=33}}

From 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was named to the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]], where he undertook research on what would become his doctoral dissertation.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=79|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=20}} Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} a significant factor in his decision to move to Harvard was that the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, [[J. L. Austin]] of the [[University of Oxford]], would strongly influence Chomsky.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=33–34}} In 1952, Chomsky published his first [[academic article]], "Systems of Syntactic Analysis", which appeared not in a journal of linguistics, but in ''[[The Journal of Symbolic Logic]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} Being highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures given at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=81}} Although he had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, in 1955 he submitted a thesis to them setting out his ideas on [[transformational grammar]]; he was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] on the basis of it, and it would be privately distributed among specialists on [[microfilm]] before being published in 1975 as part of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=83–85|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=36|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3pp=4–5}} Possession of this Ph.D. nullified his requirement to enter [[national service]] in the armed forces, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=36}} [[George Armitage Miller]], a Professor at Harvard, read the Ph.D. and was impressed; together he and Chomsky published a number of technical papers in [[mathematical linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=38}}

{{double image|left|Rudolf Rocker.jpg|155|George Orwell press photo.jpg|152|The work of anarcho-syndicalist [[Rudolf Rocker]] (left) and democratic socialist [[George Orwell]] (right) significantly influenced the young Chomsky.}}

In 1947, Chomsky entered into a romantic relationship with [[Carol Chomsky|Carol Doris Schatz]], whom he had known since they were toddlers, and they married in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=13, 48, 51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19}} After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to an apartment in the [[Allston]] area of [[Boston]], remaining there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=20}} In 1953 the couple took up a Harvard travel grant in order to visit Europe, traveling from the [[United Kingdom]] through [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] and into [[Italy]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=20–21}} On that same trip they also spent six weeks in [[Israel]] at [[Hashomer Hatzair]]'s [[HaZore'a]] Kibbutz. Although enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab racism]] that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=20–21}}

On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of Yiddish anarchist journal ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'', becoming enamored with the ideas of contributor [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose work introduced him to the link between anarchism and [[classical liberalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=24|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=13}} Other political thinkers whose work Chomsky read included the anarchist [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], democratic socialists [[George Orwell]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], and works by Marxists [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Karl Korsch]], and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=24–25}} His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which were documented in Orwell's ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=26}} He avidly read leftist journal ''[[politics (magazine 1944-1949)|politics]]'', remarking that it "answered to and developed" his interest in anarchism,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=34–35}} as well as the periodical ''[[International Council Correspondence|Living Marxism]]'', published by [[council communism|council communist]] [[Paul Mattick]]. Although rejecting its Marxist basis, Chomsky was heavily influenced by council communism, voraciously reading articles in ''Living Marxism'' written by [[Antonie Pannekoek]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=36–40}} He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the [[Leninist League (US)|Leninist League]], an anti-Stalinist Marxist–Leninist group, sharing their views that the [[Second World War]] was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's "[[state capitalism|state capitalists]]" to crush Europe's proletariat.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=43–44}}

===Early career: 1955–66===

Chomsky had befriended two linguists at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Morris Halle]] and [[Roman Jakobson]], the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position at MIT in 1955. There Chomsky spent half his time on a [[mechanical translation]] project, and the other half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=86–87|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3pp=38–40}} Chomsky had been recruited to MIT by Jerome Wiesner, an influential scientist who, at this time, was also involved in getting the US's nuclear missile program established &lt;ref&gt;Chris Knight (2018). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''. Yale University Press., pp. x-xii, 16, 30, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Having brought such missile research to MIT, Wiesner then became a nuclear strategy adviser to both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, before returning to MIT to oversee research programmes at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Knight 2018, pp. xi-xii; Snead, D. L. 1999. ''The Gaither Committee, Eisenhower, and the Cold War''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its military involvement, Chomsky has described MIT as "a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work."{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=87}} In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by [[Columbia University]] as a visiting professor.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=91}} That same year, Chomsky's first child, a daughter named Aviva, was born,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=22}} and he published his first book on linguistics, ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', a work that radically opposed the dominant [[Zellig Harris|Harris]]–[[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] trend in the field.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=88–91|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=40|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=5}} The response to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused "significant upheaval" in the discipline.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=88–91}} Linguist [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] later asserted that it "revolutionized the scientific study of language".{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=1}} From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=84}}

In 1959 he published a review of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' in the journal ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=6|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=96–99|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=41|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=5}} Opining that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics, his review helped him to become an "established intellectual",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=119}} and he proceeded to found MIT's Graduate Program in linguistics with Halle. In 1961 he was awarded [[academic tenure]], being made a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=101–102, 119|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=23}} He went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth [[International Congress of Linguists]], held in 1962 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which established him as the ''de facto'' spokesperson of American linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=102}} He continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]'' (1966), ''Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar'' (1966), and ''[[Cartesian linguistics|Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought]]'' (1966).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=103}} Along with Halle, he also edited the ''Studies in Language'' series of books for [[Harper and Row]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=104}} and extended the theory of generative grammar to [[phonology]] in ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://libraries.mit.edu/chomsky/slideshow/#active=1&amp;slide=b4 |title=Slideshow {{!}} unBox the Chomsky Archive |publisher= MIT  |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to receive academic recognition and honors for his work, in 1966 visiting a variety of Californian institutions, first as the [[Linguistics Society of America]] Professor at the [[University of California]], and then as the Beckman Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} His Beckman lectures would be assembled and published as ''Language and Mind'' in 1968.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=122}} In this period, military scientists were also interested in Chomsky's linguistics. As former Air Force Colonel, Anthony Debons, said: "much of the research conducted at MIT by Chomsky and his colleagues [has] direct application to the efforts undertaken by military scientists to develop … languages for computer operations in military command and control systems."&lt;ref&gt;A. Debons, 'Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact', in F. Alt and M. Rubinoff, ''Advances in Computers'', Vol.11, 1971. New York/London 1971, p354; A. Newell in G. Bugliarello (ed.), ''Bioengineering: An Engineering View'', San Francisco 1968, p271.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, between 1963 and 1965, Chomsky was a consultant for a military sponsored project "to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control." One of Chomsky's students who also worked on this project, [[Barbara Partee]], says that this research was justified to the military on the basis that "in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program."&lt;ref&gt;C. Knight, [http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html 'When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky’s Linguistics for their Weapons Systems'], ''3 Quarks Daily'', 12 March 2018 (citing Arnold Zwicky, [https://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/grammars-of-number-theory.pdf ‘Grammars of Number Theory: Some Examples’], Working Paper W-6671, MITRE Corp., 1963, Foreword, last page).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these scientists eventually found Chomsky's theories unworkable for their computer systems. Other subsequent difficulties with the theories led to various debates between Chomsky and his critics that came to be known as the "[[Linguistics Wars]]", although they revolved largely around debating philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=60–61}}

===Anti-Vietnam War activism and rise to prominence: 1967–75===
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=[I]t does not require very far-reaching, specialized knowledge to perceive that the United States was invading South Vietnam. And, in fact, to take apart the system of illusions and deception which functions to prevent understanding of contemporary reality [is] not a task that requires extraordinary skill or understanding. It requires the kind of normal skepticism and willingness to apply one's analytical skills that almost all people have and that they can exercise.|source=Chomsky on the Vietnam War{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=114}}}}

Chomsky first involved himself in active political protest against U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=78}} However, it was not until 1967 that he publicly entered the debate on United States foreign policy.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=120}} In February he published a widely read essay in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]", in which he criticized the country's involvement in the conflict; the essay was based on an earlier talk that he had given to Harvard's Foundation for Jewish Campus Life.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=122|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=83}} He expanded on his argument to produce his first political book, ''[[American Power and the New Mandarins]],'' which was published in 1969 and soon established him at the forefront of American dissent.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvii|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=122–123|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=83}} His other political books of the time included ''At War with Asia'' (1971), ''The Backroom Boys'' (1973), ''For Reasons of State'' (1973), and ''Peace in the Middle East?'' (1975), published by [[Pantheon Books]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xvi–xvii|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=163|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=87}} Coming to be associated with the American [[New Left]] movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=123}} he nevertheless thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Erich Fromm]], and preferred the company of activists to intellectuals.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=134–135}} Although ''The New York Review of Books'' did publish contributions from Chomsky and other leftists from 1967 to 1973, when an editorial change put a stop to it,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=162–163|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=87}} he was virtually ignored by the rest of the mainstream press throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=162–163}}

Along with his writings, Chomsky also became actively involved in left-wing activism. Refusing to pay half his taxes, he publicly supported students who refused [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]], and was arrested for being part of an anti-war teach-in outside [[the Pentagon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=127–129}} During this time, Chomsky, along with [[Mitchell Goodman]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[William Sloane Coffin]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], also founded the anti-war collective [[RESIST (non-profit)|RESIST]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=127–129|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3pp=80–81}} Although he questioned the objectives of the [[1968 student protests]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=121–122, 131}} Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups; furthermore, he and his colleague Louis Kampf began running undergraduate courses on politics at MIT, independently of the conservative-dominated [[political science]] department.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=121|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=78}}

During this period, MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam and, as Chomsky says, "a good deal of [nuclear] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus".&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael (2006). ''Remembering Tomorrow: From the politics of opposition to what we are for'', Seven Stories Press, pp. 97–99; C. P. Otero (1988). ''Noam Chomsky: Language and politics'', Black Rose, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; As Chomsky elaborates, "[MIT was] about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was right in the middle of it. I was in a military lab&amp;nbsp;... the Research Laboratory for Electronics."&lt;ref&gt;White, G. D. (2000). ''Campus Inc.: Corporate power in the ivory tower''. Prometheus Books, pp. 445–446.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, student activists were actively campaigning "to stop the war research" at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Shalom, [http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue23/shalom23.htm "Review of Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent, by Robert F. Barsky"], ''New Politics'', NS6(3), Issue 23. Retrieved October 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but he also thought it best to keep such research on campus and he proposed that it should be restricted to what he called "systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character".&lt;ref&gt;Barsky 1997, pp. 121–122, 140-141; Albert 2006, p. 98; Knight 2016, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; MIT had six of its anti-war student activists sentenced to prison terms. Chomsky says MIT's students suffered things that "should not have happened." However, Chomsky has also claimed that MIT has "quite a good record on civil liberties".&lt;ref&gt;Albert 2006, pp. 107–108; Knight 2016, pp. 36–38, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Chomsky visited the Vietnamese city of [[Hanoi]] to give a lecture at the [[Hanoi University of Science and Technology]]; on this trip he also toured Laos to visit the refugee camps created by the war, and in 1973 he was among those leading a committee to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the [[War Resisters League]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=153|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=24–25, 84–85}}

[[File:Nixon 30-0316a.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|President [[Richard Nixon]] placed Chomsky on his "Enemies List".]]

As a result of his anti-war activism, Chomsky was ultimately arrested on multiple occasions, and U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] included him on the [[Master list of Nixon's political opponents|master version]] of his [[Nixon's Enemies List|"Enemies List"]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=124|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=80}} He was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience, and his wife began studying for her own Ph.D. in linguistics in order to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or loss of employment.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=123–124|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=22}} However, MIT – despite being under some pressure to do so – refused to fire him due to his influential standing in the field of linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=143}} His work in this area continued to gain international recognition; in 1967 he received honorary doctorates from both the [[University of London]] and the [[University of Chicago]][[Doctor of Humane Letters|.]]{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xv–xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} In 1970, [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] and [[Swarthmore College]] also awarded him honorary D.H.L.'s, as did [[Bard College]] in 1971, [[Delhi University]] in 1972, and the [[University of Massachusetts]] in 1973.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xv–xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=143}}

In 1971 Chomsky gave the Bertrand Russell Memorial Lectures at the [[University of Cambridge]], which were published as ''Problems of Knowledge and Freedom'' later that year. He also delivered the [[Whidden Lectures]] at [[McMaster University]], the [[Huizinga Lecture]] at [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, the Woodbridge Lectures at [[Columbia University]], and the Kant Lectures at [[Stanford University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=156}} In 1971 he partook in a [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] on Dutch television, entitled ''Human Nature: Justice versus Power''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192–195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=52|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=222}} Although largely agreeing with Foucault's ideas, he was critical of [[post-modernism]] and French philosophy generally, believing that post-modern leftist philosophers used obfuscating language which did little to aid the cause of the working-classes{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192–195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=53}} and lambasting France as having "a highly parochial and remarkably illiterate culture".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=192–195}} Chomsky also continued to publish prolifically in linguistics, publishing ''Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar'' (1972),{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=143}} an enlarged edition of ''Language and Mind'' (1972),{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=51}} and ''Reflections on Language'' (1975).{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=51}} In 1974 he became a corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=156}}

[[File:Noam Chomsky (1977).jpg|thumb|left|Noam Chomsky (1977)]]
Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=175}} His public talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized actions of the Israeli government and military,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=167, 170}} and his political views came under attack from right-wing and centrist figures, the most prominent of whom was [[Alan Dershowitz]]. Chomsky considered Dershowitz "a complete liar" and accused him of actively misrepresenting his position on issues.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=170–171}}  During the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with [[Edward S. Herman]], who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=157}} Together they authored ''[[Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact &amp; Propaganda]]'', a book which criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and highlighted how mainstream media neglected to cover stories about these activities; the publisher [[Warner Modular]] initially accepted it, and it was published in 1973. However, Warner Modular's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies to be destroyed.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=160–162|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=86}}

While mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from [[Michael Albert]]'s [[South End Press]], an activist-oriented publishing company.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=85}}
In 1979, Chomsky and Herman revised ''Counter-Revolutionary Violence'' and published it with South End Press as the two-volume ''[[The Political Economy of Human Rights]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=187|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=86}} In this they compared U.S. media reactions to the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|Cambodian genocide]] and the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. They argued that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on that in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=187}}&lt;ref&gt;This Chomsky-Herman thesis has been challenged by Sophal Ear, who "argues that concurrent [media] coverage of human rights violations in right-wing regimes in [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chile]] and [[South Korea]] exceeded the coverage given to Cambodia" during the genocide: See {{cite web |last=Sharp |first=Bruce |url=http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm |title=Averaging Wrong Answers: Noam Chomsky and the Cambodia Controversy |website=Mekong.net |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a particular interest in the situation in East Timor, Chomsky testified on the subject in front of the [[United Nations]]' [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] in both 1978 and 1979, and attended a conference on the occupation held in [[Lisbon]] in 1979.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=103}} The following year, the Marxist academic, [[Steven Lukes]] authored an article for the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' accusing Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader [[Pol Pot]].&lt;ref&gt;https://libcom.org/files/lukes_chomsky_debate_1980_1981-2_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Laura J. Summers and Robin Woodsworth Carlsen replied to the article, arguing that Lukes completely misunderstood Chomsky and Herman's work. The controversy damaged his reputation,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=187–189}} and Chomsky maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies about him in order to defame him.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=190}}

Although Chomsky had long publicly criticized [[Nazism]] and [[totalitarianism]] more generally, his commitment to [[freedom of speech]] led him to defend the right of French historian [[Robert Faurisson]] to advocate a position widely characterized as [[Holocaust denial]]. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for the historian's freedom of speech was published as the preface to Faurisson's 1980 book ''Mémoire en défense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=179–180|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=61}} Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=185|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=61}} and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=184}} Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist [[Werner Cohn]] later published an analysis of the affair titled ''Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers''.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=78}} The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=185}} and Chomsky did not visit France, where the translation of his political writings was delayed until the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Birnbaum |first=Jean |title=Chomsky à Paris: chronique d'un malentendu |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2010/06/03/chomsky-a-paris-chronique-d-un-malentendu_1367002_3260.html |work=Le Monde des Livres |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for almost thirty years following the debacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aeschimann |first=Eric |title=Chomsky s'est exposé, il est donc une cible désignée |url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/0101638536-chomsky-s-est-expose-il-est-donc-une-cible-designee |work=Liberátion |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaganite era and work on the media: 1980–89===

The election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] to the U.S. Presidency in 1980 marked a period of increased military intervention in [[Central America]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=90–91}} In 1985, during [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Nicaragua's Contra War]] – in which the U.S. supported the [[Contras|Contra militia]] against the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] government – Chomsky travelled to [[Managua]] to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=91, 92}} Many of these lectures would be published in 1987 as ''On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=91}} In 1983 he published ''[[The Fateful Triangle]]'', an examination of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] and the place of the U.S. within it, arguing that the U.S. had continually used the conflict for its own ends.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=99|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=13}} In 1988, Chomsky then visited the [[Palestinian territories]] to witness the impact of Israeli military occupation.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=98}}

In 1988, Chomsky and Herman published ''[[Manufacturing Consent|Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', in which they outlined their [[propaganda model]] for understanding the mainstream media; there they argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news provided was censored through four filters which had a great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=160, 202|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=127–134}} The book was adapted into a 1992 film, ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', which was directed by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Peter Wintonick]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=136}} In 1989, Chomsky published ''[[Necessary Illusions|Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies]],'' in which he critiqued what he sees as the pseudo-democratic nature of Western capitalist states.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=138–139}}

By the 1980s, a number of Chomsky's students had become leading linguistic specialists in their own right, expanding, revising, and expanding on Chomsky's ideas of generative grammar.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=53}} By the end of the 1980s, Chomsky had established himself as a globally recognized figure.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=59}}

===Increased political activism: 1990–present===

In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=214}} Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the [[East Timorese Relief Association]] and the [[National Council for East Timorese Resistance]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=104}} The lectures that he gave on the subject would be published as ''Powers and Prospects'' in 1996.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=104}} As a result of the international publicity generated by Chomsky, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist [[John Pilger]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=107}} After East Timor's independence from Indonesia was achieved in 1999, the Australian-led [[International Force for East Timor]] arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing that it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the [[Timor Gap Treaty]]. {{Sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=109–110}} Chomsky's book ''Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order'' was a [[Boston Globe]] and Voice Literary Supplement bestseller in 1999.

[[File:Noam Chomsky WSF - 2003.jpg|thumb|left|Chomsky at the [[World Social Forum]] ([[Porto Alegre]]) in 2003]]

Chomsky retired from full-time teaching,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}} although as an [[Emeritus]] he nevertheless continued to conduct research and seminars at MIT.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}}

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed, with these interviews being collated and published by [[Seven Stories Press]] in October.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=110–111}}
Chomsky argued that the ensuing [[War on Terror]] was not a new development, but rather a continuation of the same U.S. foreign policy and its concomitant rhetoric that had been pursued since at least the Reagan era of the 1980s.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=143}} In 2003 he published ''[[Hegemony or Survival]]'', in which he articulated what he called the United States' "imperial grand strategy" and critiqued the [[Iraq War]] and other aspects of the 'War on Terror.'{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=114–118}}

Chomsky toured the world with increasing regularity during this period, giving talks on various subjects.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=120}} In 2001 he gave the [[D.T. Lakdawala]] Memorial Lecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/2001/11/04/stories/0204000j.htm U.S., Britain ignored 'culture of terrorism': Chomsky], ''[[The Hindu]]'' November 4, 2001. Retrieved 21 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Delhi]], India, and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the [[Latin American Association of Social Scientists]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=120}} In 2002 Chomsky visited Turkey in order to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a [[co-defendant]] and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the prosecution on the first day.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=25}} During that trip, Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favour of the Kurds' [[human rights]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=25}} A supporter of the [[World Social Forum]], he attended their conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=112–113, 120}}

His wife, Carol, died in December 2008.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}}

[[File:Noam Chomsky Toronto 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Chomsky speaking in support of the [[Occupy movement]] in 2011]]

Chomsky was drawn to the energy and activism of the [[Occupy movement]], delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence, first [[Occupy (Chomsky book)|''Occupy'']] a pamphlet, in 2012, then, in 2013, ''Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity''. Both were published by [[Zuccotti Park Press]]. His analysis included a critique that attributed Occupy's growth as a response to a perceived abandonment of the interests of the white working class by the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jul/06/noam-chomsky-occupy-movement-spark-video |title=Noam Chomsky: 'The Occupy movement just lit a spark' – video |last=Younge |first=Gary |date=July 6, 2012 |last2=Hogue |first2=Kat Keene |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |last3=theguardian.com|access-date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Chomsky joined the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]] advisory council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noam Chomsky Joins NAPF Advisory Council |url=https://www.wagingpeace.org/noam-chomsky-joins-napf-advisory-council/ |website=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |accessdate=27 July 2018 |date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a senior fellow there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Joe |title=Tickets on sale for Tucson talk on nuclear war with Noam Chomsky, Daniel Ellsberg |url=https://tucson.com/news/local/tickets-on-sale-for-tucson-talk-on-nuclear-war-with/article_66bf8396-1b21-5af5-9843-79bcbf551fd0.html |website=Arizona Daily Star |accessdate=27 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Chomsky announced his support for [[Vermont]] U.S. senator [[Bernie Sanders]] in the upcoming [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate |title=Inside the mind of Bernie Sanders: unbowed, unchanged, and unafraid of a good fight |work=The Guardian |date=June 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117082624/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |dead-url=no |first=Paul |last=Lewis |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Chomsky was publicly rebuked by President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] of Turkey after he signed an [[open letter]] condemning the Turkish leader for his [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)#2015 PKK rebellion|anti-Kurdish repression]] and for holding double standards on terrorism.&lt;ref name="erdogan"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chomsky hits back at Erdoğan, accusing him of double standards on terrorism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/14/chomsky-hits-back-erdogan-double-standards-terrorism-bomb-istanbul |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 14, 2016|access-date =January 14, 2016 |issn= |language= |first=Matthew |last=Weaver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky accused Erdoğan of [[hypocrisy]] and added that the Turkish president supports [[al-Qaeda]]'s Syrian affiliate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-crisis-turkey-and-saudi-arabia-shock-western-countries-by-supporting-antiassad-jihadists-10242747.html |title=Turkey and Saudi Arabia alarm the West by backing Islamist extremists the Americans had bombed in Syria |author=Sengupta, Kim |newspaper=The Independent |date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name="erdogan" /&gt; Chomsky also criticized the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and U.S. involvement in [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], highlighting that Saudi has "one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/5/17/chomsky_saudi_arabia_is_the_center |title=Chomsky: Saudi Arabia is the "Center of Radical Islamic Extremism" Now Spreading Among Sunni Muslims |date=May 17, 2016 |newspaper=[[Democracy Now!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the documentary ''[[Requiem for the American Dream]]'' was released, summarizing his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a "75-minute teach-in".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/movies/review-noam-chomsky-focuses-on-financial-inequality.html |title=Review: Noam Chomsky Focuses on Financial Inequality in 'Requiem for the American Dream' |last=Gold |first=Daniel M. |date=January 28, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Requiem for the American Dream'' was published as a book in 2017, and is a furthering of the ideas put forward in the 2016 documentary ([[Seven Stories Press]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sevenstories.com/books/3993-requiem-for-the-american-dream |title=Books &amp;#124; Seven Stories Press |publisher=Sevenstories.com |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Chomsky called [[Donald Trump]] an "ignorant, thin-skinned megalomaniac" and a "greater evil" than Hillary Clinton. Asked about claims that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election through hacking, Chomsky said: "It's possible, but it's a kind of strange complaint in the United States. The U.S. has been [[Foreign electoral intervention|interfering]] with, and undermining, elections all over the world for decades and is proud of it."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://pr.aljazeera.com/post/153594128485/noam-chomsky-speaks-with-upfront-slams-media Noam Chomsky speaks with ‘Upfront’ – slams media coverage, criticises third party voters]". Al Jazeera. November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, at age 88 and retired since 2002, Chomsky left [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to join the linguistics department of [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson as part-time faculty,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/28/chomsky-joins-university-arizona-faculty/JYdA9TjGk6OeBwa7Q8fPjJ/story.html Noam Chomsky leaves MIT to join University of Arizona faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weidenfeld |first1=Lisa |title=Noam Chomsky Is Leaving MIT |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/08/29/noam-chomsky-mit-arizona/ |website=Boston Magazine |accessdate=27 July 2018 |date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; officially starting a few weeks later, and teaching in spring 2018.&lt;ref name="Univ.

In July 2018, Chomsky said in an interview with ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' that "it's hard to think of a more brutal and sadistic policy" about the [[Trump administration family separation policy]].&lt;ref name="url Brutal and Sadistic: Noam Chomsky on Family Separation &amp; the U.S. Roots of Today's Refugee Crisis | Democracy Now!"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/27/brutal_and_sadistic_noam_chomsky_on |title="Brutal and Sadistic": Noam Chomsky on Family Separation &amp; the U.S. Roots of Today's Refugee Crisis &amp;#124; Democracy Now! |format= |website= |accessdate=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview Chomsky also said that [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]'s victory of the 2018 New York primary election "was a quite spectacular and significant event".&lt;ref name="url Noam Chomsky on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Spectacular Victory &amp; Growing Split in Democratic Party | Democracy Now!"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/27/noam_chomsky_on_alexandria_ocasio_cortezs |title=Noam Chomsky on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's "Spectacular" Victory &amp; Growing Split in Democratic Party &amp;#124; Democracy Now! |format= |website= |accessdate=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the field of linguistics, McGilvray credits Chomsky with inaugurating the "[[cognitive revolution]]".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=5}} McGilvray also credits him with establishing the field as a formal, [[natural science]],{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=9}} moving it away from the procedural form of [[structural linguistics]] that was dominant during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=9–10}} As such, some have called him "the father of modern linguistics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Changed Noam Chomsky Simplifies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/arts/a-changed-noam-chomsky-simplifies.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1998|access-date =February 22, 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Margalit |last=Fox |quote=Mr. Chomsky&amp;nbsp;... is the father of modern linguistics and remains the field's most influential practitioner.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Noam Chomsky |publisher=MIT150 {{!}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology 150th anniversary |url=https://mit150.mit.edu/infinite-history/noam-chomsky |accessdate=2015-10-24 |quote=Noam Chomsky is an Institute Professor and professor of linguistics emeritus at MIT, widely known as the father of modern linguistics, a philosopher, prolific author, and globally influential political activist. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116154045/https://mit150.mit.edu/infinite-history/noam-chomsky |archivedate=November 16, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQnsSuvP9dAC |title=Sweet Reason: A Field Guide to Modern Logic |last=Tymoczko |first=Tom |last2=Henle |first2=Jim |date=2004-04-08 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year= |isbn=978-0-387-98930-3 |location= |page=101 |language=en |quote=As the founder of modern linguistics, Noam Chomsky, observed, each of the following sequences of words is nonsense&amp;nbsp;... |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/education/edlife/on-being-noam-chomsky.html |title=Noam Chomsky and the Bicycle Theory |last=Tanenhaus |first=Sam |date=October 31, 2016 |work= |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |quote=At 87, Noam Chomsky, the founder of modern linguistics, remains a vital presence in American intellectual life.|access-date=October 31, 2016 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis to Chomsky's linguistic theory is rooted in [[biolinguistics]], holding that the principles underlying the structure of language are biologically determined in the human mind and hence genetically transmitted.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=4|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=2–3}} He therefore argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=7}} In adopting this position, Chomsky rejects the [[radical behaviorism|radical behaviorist]] psychology of B.&amp;nbsp;F. Skinner which views the mind as a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate") and thus treats language as learned behavior.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=6}} Accordingly, he argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and is unlike modes of communication used by any other animal species.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=6|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name="McGill"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Tool Module: Chomsky's Universal Grammar |url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html |publisher=thebrain.mcgill.ca |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's [[Psychological nativism|nativist]], internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of "[[rationalism]]", and is contrasted with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language, which is consistent with the philosophical school of "[[empiricism]]".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=11}}&lt;ref name="MTCW"/&gt;

===Universal grammar===
{{Main|Universal grammar}}

Since the 1960s, Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting that there is an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (see: "[[poverty of the stimulus]]" argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones which have never before been uttered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/noam-chomskys-theory-universal-grammar-right-its-hardwired-our-brains-364236 |title=Noam Chomsky's Theory Of Universal Grammar Is Right; It's Hardwired Into Our Brains |date=2015-12-07 |work=Medical Daily|access-date=2017-08-04 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of [[inductive reasoning]], if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the [[language acquisition device]] (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute "universal grammar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chomsky, Noam |url=https://chomsky.info/architecture01/ |title=The 'Chomskyan Era' (excerpted from The Architecture of Language) |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thornbury |first1=Scott |title=An A–Z of ELT (Methodology) |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Education |location=Oxford |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/mit-claims-to-have-found-a-language-universal-that-ties-all-languages-together/ |title=MIT claims to have found a "language universal" that ties all languages together |newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformational generative grammar===
{{Main|Transformational generative grammar}}

Beginning with his ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' (1957), a distillation of his ''Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (1955), Chomsky challenges [[structural linguistics]] and introduces [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Transformacijsko-generativni pristup jeziku u ''Sintaktičkim strukturama'' i ''Aspektima teorije sintakse'' Noama Chomskog |trans-title=Transformational-generative approach to language in ''Syntactic structures'' and ''Aspects of the theory of syntax'' of Noam Chomsky |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=SOL: Lingvistički časopis |volume=6 |issue=12–13 |pages=103–112 |year=1991 |issn=0352-8715 |id={{ZDB|1080348-8}} |archivedate=September 2, 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANNlKB4s?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |accessdate=May 15, 2015}} [http://opak.crolib.hr/cgi-bin/unicat.cgi?form=D1941130086 (CROLIB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures. [[Surface structure]] 'faces out' and is represented by spoken utterances, while [[deep structure]] 'faces inward' and expresses the underlying relations between words and conceptual meaning. Transformational grammar is a [[generative grammar]] (which dictates that the syntax, or word order, of surface structures adheres to certain principles and parameters) that consists of a limited series of rules, expressed in mathematical notation, which transform deep structures into well-formed surface structures. The transformational grammar thus relates meaning and sound.&lt;ref name="MTCW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Noam Chomsky |url=https://chomsky.info/2004____/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015800/https://chomsky.info/2004____/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |via=chomsky.info |accessdate=December 18, 2017 |first=Zoltán Gendler |last=Szabó |publisher=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers, 1860–1960|editor-first = Ernest|editor-last = LePore |year=2004 |location=Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chomsky hierarchy===
{{Main|Chomsky hierarchy}}

The Chomsky hierarchy, sometimes referred to as the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy, is a containment hierarchy of classes of [[formal grammars]]. The hierarchy imposes a logical structure across different language classes and provides a basis for understanding the relationship between grammars (devices that enumerate the valid sentences within languages). In order of increasing expressive power it includes [[regular grammar|regular (or Type-3) grammars]], [[context-free grammar|context-free (or Type-2) grammars]], [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive (or Type-1) grammars]], and [[formal grammar|recursively enumerable (or Type-0) grammars]]. Each class is a strict subset of the class above it, i.e., each successive class can generate a broader set of [[formal languages]] (infinite sets of strings composed from finite sets of symbols, or alphabets) than the one below.&lt;ref name=":522"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.wmich.edu/~bhardin/cs4850/ChomskyPresentation.pdf |title=The Chomsky Hierarchy |publisher=cs.wmich.edu |accessdate=February 29, 2016 |author=Robert Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being important in linguistics, the Chomsky hierarchy is also relevant in [[theoretical computer science]], especially in [[programming language theory]],&lt;ref name=":222"&gt;{{cite book |title=Selected Papers on Computer Languages |date=2002 |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information |isbn=978-1-57586-381-8 |chapter=Preface |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[compiler]] construction, and [[automata theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Computability, complexity, and languages: fundamentals of theoretical computer science |last2=Weyuker |first2=Elaine J. |last3=Sigal |first3=Ron |publisher=Academic Press, Harcourt, Brace |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-12-206382-4 |edition=2nd |location=Boston |page=327| author-link2 = Elaine Weyuker |last1=Davis |first1=Martin| author-link1 = Martin Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist program===
{{Main|Minimalist program}}
Since the 1990s, much of Chomsky's research has focused on what he calls the Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain external conditions that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or '[[Logical form (linguistics)|logical forms]]'.&lt;ref name="McGill"/&gt; When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's prior research has focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to ''create'' these rules.&lt;ref name="McGill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Changed Noam Chomsky Simplifies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/arts/a-changed-noam-chomsky-simplifies.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1998|access-date =February 22, 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Margalit |last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed through elite [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]], who use corporate media, advertising, and [[think tanks]] to promote their own [[propaganda]]. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth that they obscure.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=8|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=158}} He believes that "[[common sense]]" is all that is required to break through the web of falsehood and see the truth, if it (common sense) is employed using both [[critical thinking]] skills and an awareness of the role that self-interest and self-deception plays both on oneself and on others.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=74|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=12–13}} He believes that it is the moral responsibility of intellectuals to tell the truth about the world, but claims that few do so because they fear losing prestige and funding.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

Although he had joined protest marches and organized activist groups, he identifies his primarily political outlet as being that of education, offering free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=71}} His political writings have covered a wide range of topics, although there are a number of core themes throughout much of his work.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=158}} He is a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] international union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/biography |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |title=IWW Biography |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317022105/http://www.iww.org/history/biography |archivedate=March 17, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sits on the interim consultative committee of the [[International Organization for a Participatory Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iopsociety.org/interim-committee International Organization for a Participatory Society—Interim Committee] Retrieved March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States foreign policy ===
[[File:Dussel and Chomsky.jpg|thumb|Chomsky and [[Enrique Dussel]], who left Argentina in reaction to the U.S.-backed [[Dirty War]] in the 1970s and 1980s]]
Chomsky has been a prominent critic of U.S. [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Milne, Seumas, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/07/noam-chomsky-us-foreign-policy "'US foreign policy is straight out of the mafia'"], ''The Guardian'', November 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His published work has focused heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}} such as the U.S.-backed [[state terror]] campaign against left-wing dissidents across Latin America known as [[Operation Condor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/200412__/ On Colombia: Noam Chomsky, introduction to Doug Stokes ''America’s Other War: Terrorizing Colombia'', Zed, December 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky believes that the basic principle of the [[foreign policy of the United States]] is the establishment of "open societies" that are economically and politically controlled by the U.S. and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=92}} He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}}
He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British imperialism have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading [[Christianity]]; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} Prominent examples that he regularly cites are the actions of the [[British Empire]] in India and Africa, and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}}

Chomsky explains his decision to focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14, 160}} His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway the population of the U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=18}}

He has been critical of U.S. involvement in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel–Palestine conflict]], arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} Chomsky has long endorsed the left binationalist program, seeking to create a democratic state in the [[Levant]] that is home to both Jews and Arabs.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=170|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=76–77|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=159}} However, acknowledging the [[realpolitik]] of the situation, Chomsky has also considered a [[two-state solution]] on the condition that both nation-states exist on equal terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=97|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=159}} As a result of [[Political positions of Noam Chomsky#Chomsky and the Middle East|his criticisms of Israel]], Chomsky was barred from entering Israel in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/16/israel-noam-chomsky-palestinian-west-bank |title=Noam Chomsky barred by Israelis from lecturing in Palestinian West Bank |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |date=May 16, 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/middleeast/18chomsky.html |title=Israel Roiled After Chomsky Barred From West Bank |last=Bronner |first=Ethan |date=May 17, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2010/05/201051904343834346.html |title=Israel: Chomsky ban 'big mistake' |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/5/17/denied_entry_israel_blocks_noam_chomsky |title=Denied Entry: Israel Blocks Noam Chomsky from Entering West Bank to Deliver Speech |publisher=Democracy Now!|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/noam-chomsky-denied-entry_0_n_578285.html |title=Noam Chomsky Denied Entry To Israel |date=January 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114172540/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/noam-chomsky-denied-entry_0_n_578285.html|archive-date=January 14, 2016|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capitalism and socialism===
[[File:Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor and Emeritus Professor of Linguistics, MIT (14112575810).jpg|thumb|Chomsky speaking at [[Chatham House]], London, May 2014]]
In his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of [[capitalism]] and the [[selfishness|selfish]] pursuit of material advancement.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=15}} At the same time, he developed a disdain for the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] attempts to establish a socialist society, as represented by the Marxist–Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=168|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Rather than accepting the common view among American economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy on the one hand and total private ownership on the other, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy on the one hand and total autocratic control (whether state or private) on the other.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=164–165}} He argues that Western capitalist nations are not really democratic,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=169}} because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=170}} He has stated his opposition to [[Ruling class|ruling elites]], among them institutions like the [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[GATT]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=211}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Socialism will be achieved only insofar as all social institutions—in particular, the central industrial, commercial, and financial institutions of a modern society—are placed under democratic control in a federal industrial republic of the sort that Russell and others envisioned, with actively functioning workers' councils and other self-governing units in which each citizen, in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s words, will be "a direct participator in the government of affairs."|source=Noam Chomsky{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=210}} }}

Chomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods financial control]] agreements.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He characterizes the U.S. as a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]], viewing both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as manifestations of a single "Business Party" controlled by corporate and financial interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14–15}} Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}

Noting that this economic system is firmly entrenched and difficult to overthrow, he believes that change is possible through the organized co-operation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to re-organize the economy in a more equitable way.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}} Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of the upheaval.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}

Chomsky deems libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas to be the inheritors of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=189}} arguing that his ideological position revolves around "nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=95}}
He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future in which there is direct worker control of the [[means of production]], with society governed by [[workers' council]]s, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=199}} In this, he believes that there will be no need for [[political parties]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=200}} By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction, a sense of fulfillment, and purpose to their work.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=197, 202}} He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=201–202}}

=== News media and propaganda ===
{{Main|Propaganda model}}
Chomsky's political writings have largely been focused on the two concepts of [[ideology]] and [[power (social and political)|power]], or the media and state policy.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=20}} One of Chomsky's best-known works, ''Manufacturing Consent'', dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, from government-guided "free market" forces, is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system that was present in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=37–38}} As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=179}} Although acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=178}} He states that, although the mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=189}} As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=177}} He also points to examples of important news stories that have been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: For instance, it ignored the murder of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Fred Hampton]] with possible [[FBI]] involvement, the massacres perpetrated in [[Nicaragua]] by the U.S.-funded [[Contras]], and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=179–182}}
To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=184}}

Chomsky considers most [[conspiracy theories]] to be fruitless, distracting substitutes to thinking about  [[policy|policy formation]] in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=70}} He does not dismiss [[conspiracy theories]] outright, but he does consider them unproductive to challenging [[power (social and political)|power]] in a substantial way.
In response to the labeling of his own thoughts as "conspiracy theory", Chomsky has replied that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether [[General Motors]] would be accused of conspiracy if they deliberately selected what they would use or discard to sell their product.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=42}}

Chomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=158|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=19}} calling himself "scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=121}} An intensely private person,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=7}} he is uninterested in appearances and the fame that his work has brought him.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=116}} McGilvray suggested that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but that he was impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=230}} He also has little interest in modern art and music.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=206–207}} He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the U.S., he subscribes to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=121}} He acknowledges that his income and the financial security that it accords him means that he lives a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=9}} He characterizes himself as a "[[Workforce|worker]]", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}}

Despite having been raised Jewish, Chomsky is currently [[Irreligious|non-religious]], although he has expressed approval of forms of religion such as [[liberation theology]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=69}} He is known for his "dry, laconic wit",{{attribution needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} and for the use of [[irony]] in his writings,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=162}} and has attracted controversy for labeling established political and academic figures with terms such as "corrupt", "fascist", and "fraudulent".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} Chomsky's colleague [[Steven Pinker]] has said that he "portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions that he generates from his critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/20/society.politics |title=The Guardian Profile: Noam Chomsky |last=Jaggi |first=Maya |authorlink=Maya Jaggi |date=January 20, 2001 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky avoids attending [[academic conferences]], including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=169}}

==Reception and influence==

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=[Chomsky's] voice is heard in academia beyond linguistics and philosophy: from computer science to neuroscience, from anthropology to education, mathematics and literary criticism. If we include Chomsky's political activism then the boundaries become quite blurred, and it comes as no surprise that Chomsky is increasingly seen as enemy number one by those who inhabit that wide sphere of reactionary discourse and action.|source=Sperlich, 2006{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=60}}}}
Chomsky's legacy is as both a "leader in the field" of linguistics and "a figure of enlightenment and inspiration" for [[political dissent]]ers.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=191}} Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in him being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being "on the outer margin of acceptability."{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=24}}

===In academia===

Linguist John Lyons remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become "the most dynamic and influential" school of thought in the field.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=2}} By the 1970s, his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=42}} while a poll conducted by [[Minnesota State University Moorhead|Minnesota State University]] found ''Syntactic Structures'' to be the single most important work in the field of [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Cognitive Science Millennium Project |url=http://web.mnstate.edu/schwartz/cogsci100.htm |publisher=web.mnstate.edu |accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his work in [[automata theory]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and the Chomsky hierarchy has become well known in [[computer science]], and he is much cited within the field of [[computational linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Michael Sipser |author=Sipser, Michael |year=1997 |title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation |publisher=PWS Publishing |isbn=978-0-534-94728-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Knuth: Selected Papers on Computer Languages |url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cl.html |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's work contributed substantially to the decline of [[behaviorist psychology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/ |title=Behaviorism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, some arguments in [[evolutionary psychology]] are derived from his research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lecture 6: Evolutionary Psychology, Problem Solving, and 'Machiavellian' Intelligence |publisher=Massey University |website=School of Psychology |year=1996 |url=http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |accessdate=September 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117055247/http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in [[animal language acquisition]] at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregory |last=Radick |title=The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Nobel Prize laureate in Medicine and Physiology, [[Niels Kaj Jerne]], used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system, equating "components of a generative grammar&amp;nbsp;... with various features of protein structures". The title of Jerne's Stockholm Nobel Lecture was "The Generative Grammar of the Immune System".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/jerne-lecture.pdf |title=The Generative Grammar of the Immune System |publisher=Nobel Prize |accessdate=19 August 2013 |author=Niels K.

An MIT press release found that Chomsky was cited within the [[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]] more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chomsky is Citation Champ |publisher=[[MIT]] News Office |date=April 15, 1992 |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1992/citation-0415.html |accessdate=September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their respect for his intellectual contribution, a number of linguists and philosophers have been very critical of Chomsky's approach to language. These critics include Christina Behme, Cedric Boeckx, [[Margaret Boden]], Rudolph Botha, [[Vyvyan Evans]], [[Nicholas Evans (linguist)|Nicholas Evans]], [[Daniel Everett]], [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Adele Goldberg]], Anna Kinsella, [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]], [[Stephen Levinson]], Bruce Nevin, [[Geoffrey K.

Chomsky's approach to academic freedom has led him to give support to MIT academics whose actions he deplores. In 1969, when Chomsky heard that [[Walt Rostow]], a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened "to protest publicly" if Rostow was "denied a position at MIT". Then, in 1989, when Pentagon adviser [[John Deutch]] wanted to be the President of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, ''The New York Times'' quoted Chomsky as saying, "He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met.... If somebody's got to be running the C.I.A., I'm glad it's him."&lt;ref&gt;Barsky 1997, pp. 140–141; Noam Chomsky (1996). ''Class Warfare: Interviews with David Barsamian''.

Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes the linguist and activist as "one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people",{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=7}} while journalist [[John Pilger]] described him as a "genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom.

However, Sperlich notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}} University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their syllabuses for undergraduate reading.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=153–154}} Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no expertise in these areas; to this he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many [[social science|social scientists]] claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them, regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so or not.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics "do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

'''Participatory 3D modelling''' ('''P3DM''') is a community-based [[cartography|mapping]] method which integrates local spatial knowledge with data on elevation of the land and depth of the sea to produce stand-alone, scaled and [[geo-referenced]] [[relief model]]s. Essentially based on local spatial knowledge, land use and cover, and other features are depicted by informants on the model by the use of pushpins (points), yarns (lines) and paints (polygons). On completion, a scaled and geo-referenced grid is applied to facilitate data extraction or importation. Data depicted on the model are extracted, digitised and plotted. On completion of the exercise the model remains with the community.&lt;ref&gt;Rambaldi G. and Callosa-Tarr J. 2002.

'''Proxemic communication''' deals with the ways that what is [[communication|communicated]] in face-to-face [[conversation]]s may go beyond the overt information being imparted. The communication may be influenced by degree of proximity and by [[nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] signals including touch, and varies between different cultures. Research in this field has been carried out on [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural differences]], and on interaction in [[counseling]] and [[clinical medicine|clinical]] settings.

==The field of proxemics==
[[Proxemics]] is one of several subcategories of the study of [[nonverbal communication]].&lt;ref name="nina moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Nina|title=Nonverbal Communication:Studies and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxemics can be defined as "the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture".&lt;ref name="Hidden Dimension"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hall| first = Edward T.| title = The Hidden Dimension| year = 1966| publisher = Anchor Books| isbn = 0-385-08476-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined in 1963 by the cultural anthropologist [[Edward T. Hall]].&lt;ref name="Hall2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Edward T.|title=A System for the Notation of Proxemic Behavior|journal=American Anthropologist|date=October 1963|volume=65|issue=5|pages=1003–1026|doi=10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work on proxemics, Hall separated his theory into two overarching categories: [[personal space]] and [[territory (animal)|territory]]. ''Personal space'' describes the immediate space surrounding a person, while ''territory'' refers to the area which a person may "lay claim to" and defend against others.&lt;ref name="nina moore" /&gt;

==Dimensions of nonverbal communication==
According to Xu Lin’s article on Cultural Dimensions and Conversational Strategies, "Cultural factors have a great impact on conversational techniques",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=L.|title=Cultural Dimensions and Conversational Strategies --Conversational Strategies Adopted in Different Cultures and the Way to Bridge the Gap.|year=2007|publisher=US-China Foreign Language|pages=71–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are two basic elements consisted in all [[conversations]]: ''informational'' and ''communicative''. The informational function deals with passing information to another individual; this is known as the information focused element. Whereas, the communicative function deals with the social principle or aim in the conversation, also known as the element that deals with social relationships and drawing closer to people. Xu Lin studies the different classifications of nonverbal communication brought forth by Edward T. Hall (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=E.|title=The Silent Language|year=1959|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different dimensions brought forth by Xu Lin and Prabhu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prabhu|first=T.T.|title=Proxemics: Some Challenges and Strategies in Nonverbal Communication.|year=2010}}Prabhu&lt;/ref&gt; include: Intimate, Personal, Social and Public Distances.

==Common methods==
One of the primary methods used among Kim, D., Pan, Y., &amp; Park, H. (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=D.|title=High- versus low-context culture: A comparison of Chinese, Korean, and American cultures|newspaper=Psychology &amp; Marketing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkin, R. S. (2006), Albas, C. (1991) and Graves, J. R., &amp; Robinson, J. D. included [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type measures of sampling. Participants would be given surveys, videotaped and observed while receiving responding to oral questions posed by formally dressed interviewers. Each study consisted of a controlled group and an experimental group and would measure each individual in a specific manner in order to bring forth accurate results. Each method included a sampling base of volunteers with cheap compensation such as a two dollar reward or extra credit in the class taking part in the experiment.

DiBiase{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} describes touch as differentiating depending on various aspects. All people touch and are touched by others, but there are vast differences in the amount of touching that people do. For example, touching appears to vary by gender, culture, and even age. Although these particular differences in touching behavior are not well understood, historically investigators have thought of touch as expressing control and dominance.

Not only does touch vary by culture, but also age and gender. They continue to explain how some researchers have suggested that some cultures, such as Middle Eastern, Latin America and Southern Europe, could be considered high-contact cultures (interact at closer distances and touch more frequently) much more in social conversations than people from non-contact cultures such as the USA and Northern Europe.

Research by Graves (1976),&lt;ref name="Graves1976"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graves|first=J.D.|title=Proxemic behavior as a function of inconsistent verbal and nonverbal messages|newspaper=Journal of Counseling Psychology|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robinson (1976),&lt;ref name="Graves1976" /&gt; suggests that an individual's nonverbal behavior is capable of communicating information about the particular individual's feelings and attitudes, regardless of the culture. However, from his research he concluded that the prominent role was in fact played by nonverbal communication in determining the total meaning of the message, and that the message being conveyed could very well differ depending on the context. Among his findings was that within the client-counselor relationship, the consistency or inconsistency between the counselor's verbal and [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] has been found to be an important determinant of the client's impressions of the counselor as well as of the client's proxemics behavior.

Albas (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albas|first=C.|title=Proxemic Behavior: A Study of Extrusion|newspaper=Journal of Social Psychology|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the comfortable proxemic distances assumed by Canadian female students. The cultural group and sex was held constant; however, the comfortable distances seemed to vary from situation to situation. Preston (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Preston|first=P.|title=Proxemics in Clinical and Administrative Settings|newspaper=Journal of Healthcare Management|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the proxemics in clinical and administrative settings. He came to the conclusion that the proximity of people to one another when they interact and the configuration of work areas send a message that affects people in different ways. One of his main suggestions was to use observation skills in understanding how and why others interact within or outside their own space. He claims that people choose to rely on their imagination to better receive unspoken messages sent by others through their spatial interactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">The '''Sábato triangle''' ({{lang-es|Triángulo de Sabato}}) is a model concerned with linkages between science, industry and government, which has informed discussions of science policy throughout Latin America. It was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by the Argentine physicist and metallurgist [[Jorge Sábato|Jorge Alberto Sábato]], of the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA, the Argentine government agency overseeing development of nuclear power in the country).

==Brief description==
The idea of the triangle was proposed by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and developed by Sábato as a model of [[policy]]-making in science and technology.&lt;ref name="Adler1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emanuel Adler|title=The Power of Ideology: The Quest for Technological Autonomy in Argentina and Brazil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSih4JkUBesC&amp;pg=PA302|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|302-303}}  The model is based on the concept that in order for a scientific-technological system to exist in practice it is necessary for three sectors to be strongly linked together over the long term: the [[State (polity)|State]] (which formulates and implements policy); the scientific and technological infrastructure (which provides technology); and the productive sector (which uses technology). These ''interrelationships'' are portrayed in the form of a [[triangle]].&lt;ref name="Adler1987" /&gt;{{rp|58-59}}&lt;ref name="GöranssonBrundenius2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bo Göransson|author2=Claes Brundenius|author3=Carlos Aguirre-Bastos|title=Innovation Systems for Development: Making Research and Innovation in Developing Countries Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54AwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|year=2016|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78347-383-0|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, each "[[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]" needs to have strong ''internal relations'', that is to say, relations between the different institutions contained within itself.  For example, within the State there needs to be coherence between "implicit" policy and "explicit" policy, between different [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] and autonomous organizations, and so on. The other factor considered is the ''external relations'' between the "vertices" and outside entities.

The triangle has been used to shed light on technological [[Dependency theory|dependency]]. The model predicts that the stronger the external relations, the weaker or non-existent will be the interrelationships and the internal relations, and this will delay the country in reducing its dependency.&lt;ref name="Bastos2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Ines Bastos|title=The Politics of Technology in Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgWFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-79937-4|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The Sábato Triangle won acceptance in several countries of Latin America, having an effect upon science and technology policy there and disseminating the belief that the State had an important role in promoting [[technology transfer]].&lt;ref name="Adler1987" /&gt;{{rp|58}}{{rp|302-303}} However, a separation of the three components of the "triangle" has still been observed in more recent times.&lt;ref name="GibsonHeitor2005"&gt;Isabel Bortagaray and Scott Tiffin, "Innovation clusters in Latin America", in {{cite book|author1=David V. Gibson|author2=Manuel V. Heitor|author3=Alejandro Ibarra Yunez (eds.)|title=Learning and Knowledge for the Network Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPlZgenaAZEC&amp;pg=PA273|year=2005|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-356-2|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18198">A '''sacred natural site''' is a natural feature or a large area of land or water having special [[Spirituality|spiritual]] significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Oviedo, G. and Jeanrenaud, S. (2007) 'Protecting sacred natural sites of indigenous and traditional peoples', in Mallarach, J.M. and Papayannis, T. (eds) (2007) Protected Areas and Spirituality, IUCN and Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, [[Sacred grove|groves]], [[Tree worship|trees]], rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. The interest in sacred natural sites, from the perspective of [[nature conservation]], lies in the component of [[biological diversity]] that they harbor.

== Overview ==
Sacred natural sites are natural features in or areas of land or water having special spiritual significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt; This working definition is broad and can be used as a basis for more specific articulations. Whilst “sacred natural sites” is the main term used, for reasons of variety and readability, other terms are used interchangeably, including [[sacred site]], [[sacred place]] and sacred area.

The interest in sacred natural sites from the perspective of [[nature conservation]] lies in the components of [[biological diversity]] that they harbour, such as the species of animals and plants, the [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, as well as the ecological dynamics and functions that support life within and outside the places. Linked to such biological diversity is the array of distinct [[human culture]]s that care for them and hold them sacred.&lt;ref name=v&gt;Verschuuren, B., Wild, R., McNeely, J., Oviedo G. (eds.), 2010. Sacred Natural Sites, Conserving Culture and Nature. EarthScan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, groves, rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. They can vary in size from the very small: an individual tree, small spring, or a single rock formation, to whole landscapes and mountain ranges.  They consist of [[geological formation]]s, distinct [[landform]]s, specific [[ecosystem]]s and [[natural habitat]]s.  They are predominantly [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] but are also found in inshore [[Ocean|marine]] areas, [[island]]s and [[archipelago]]s.  They may also be the location of [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s, [[mosque]]s and [[Church (building)|church]]es, and they can incorporate other features such as [[pilgrimage]] trails.  In some sites nature is itself sacred, while in others sanctity is conferred by connections with spiritual heroes, religious structures or sacred histories.

== Sacred natural sites and religion==
Sacred natural sites are just one of many domains where religions or belief systems interact with nature. Most if not all religions have [[mythology]], [[cosmology]], [[theology]] or [[ethics]] related to earth, nature and land. Contemporarily, such connections are increasingly being revived or rearticulated through ethical positions expressed for example in statements that many of the mainstream faiths have produced, setting out their relationship to the natural world and their responsibility towards the planet.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Sacred sites associated with living cultures always have institutions and rules associated with them. These institutions are usually religious or spiritual in nature and may be distinct from other parts of society, while in some communities of indigenous and traditional peoples, sacred site institutions are closely integrated within society with little distinction between the sacred and secular, the religious and civil.

The vast majority of sacred natural sites were arguably founded by indigenous or [[folk religion]]s and [[spirituality|spiritualities]], but many were subsequently adopted or co-opted by mainstream religions. There is consequently a considerable 'layering' and mixing of religious and other spiritual or belief systems. Within the larger mainstream religions there are many if not more autonomous or semi-autonomous sub-groups. While fifty per cent of the world's population profess to belong to either [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] and many others are [[Hindu]]s or [[Buddhist]]s, 80 per cent of all people ascribe to a mainstream religion, a large part of which continue to adhere to at least some traditional or [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. and Palmer, M. (1997)'The Atlas of Religion', University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites are thus connected to a wide range of socio-cultural systems and institutions, some more complex than others, and to different dynamics of change and cultural interaction.

==Sacred natural sites, indigenous peoples and mainstream faiths==
Establishing a duality between '[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]', in the sense of being native or belonging to a place, and 'mainstream', while pragmatic for discussion, does present some problems. Several mainstream faiths can be considered indigenous in much of their range e.g. [[Daoism]], [[Shinto]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], while [[Zoroastrianism]] now has very few followers and is essentially no longer 'mainstream'. More problematic is that this duality renders invisible the many merged or [[syncretic]] faiths and folk variants of mainstream religions where elements of the preceding indigenous beliefs are still practiced. These folk religions can have much stronger nature ethics than the more symbolic orthodox form.

Within human history, religion has been used (or abused) as a tool of domination. These issues, although much reduced, have not gone away and some faiths still seek converts from other faiths. The destruction of [[sacred site]]s has been part of that domination and still continues today. Conversely, most faiths over long periods of time have peaceably co-existed and shared sacred sites. Mutual respect and accommodation have often been reached. Further compassion and peace-building lie at the heart of many religious traditions and belief systems.

==The distribution of sacred natural sites==
Sacred natural sites are, with the exception of [[Antarctica]], found on every continent and probably in every country. Some of them are surely among the oldest venerated places of earth and at the same time new sacred natural sites are still being established, in some cases by migrants to new countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt; Paleo-anthropological evidence indicates that earlier humans such as [[Neanderthal]]s practised the cult of ancestors in burial sites over 60,000 years ago, which is arguably one of the origins of sacred sites. [[Ancestor worship]] and veneration of [[burial ground]]s seem to be a common trait of every culture of modern humans, as well as the adoration of natural features of great significance such as high mountains or large rivers. Australian sacred sites may go back at least 50,000 years; [[rock art]] considered of a sacred nature date to 20,000 years ago, and some of the [[Neolithic]] [[henge]]s date from 5,000 years ago.

At a landscape level, [[anthropologist]]s have long recognized the sacred status that cultures have given to nature not only in specific sacred sites,{{cn|date=February 2017}} but also in larger areas of cultural significance and entire landscapes. Interest on the importance of sacred sites for living cultures has seen an upsurge since the mid 1990s, which has contributed to the exploration of new paradigms and multidisciplinary views to the advantage of both the understanding and conservation of sacred sites.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, F. (1999) ‘Sacred Ecology, Traditional ecological knowledge and resource management’, Taylor &amp; Francis, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, D.L., Hubert, J., Reeves, B. and Schanche, A. (1994) ‘Sacred Sites, Sacred Places’, Routledge, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posey, D. (ed.) (1999) ‘Cultural and Spiritual Values of Biodiversity’, a comprehensive contribution to the UNEP Global Biodiversity Assessment. Intermediate Technology Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because of their diversity, origins, and different and varying degrees of sacrality of their elements, it is not really possible to have full knowledge about the number of sacred sites existing in the world today. Exhaustively documenting sacred natural sites would have to be done by bottom-up identification at the community level, which is not really practicable. However, estimates have been made for some countries, notably India, where at least 13,720 [[sacred grove]]s have been reported and experts estimate that the total number for the country may be in the range of 100,000 to 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, K C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S. (2001) ‘Cultural and Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India’, INSA: New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; India may be exceptional because of its size, cultural diversity and widespread practices about sacred groves, but it would not be unrealistic to estimate that sacred natural sites must exist in the hundreds of thousands.

==Importance for the conservation of nature and culture==
Many sacred natural sites have been well protected over long time periods and have seen low levels of utilization.  Many are demonstrably high in [[biodiversity]] and represent a strong biodiversity conservation opportunity.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Sacred natural sites also represent ancient and profound [[cultural]] values. The roles of sacred sites’ custodians from indigenous, local community and mainstream religions are expressions of dedicated efforts that cultures that have specifically, if not always consciously, cared for nature in various ways.

While sacred natural sites are connected to the [[human spirit]] and intangible heritage they also have strong material components. In addition to being places where animals and plant species survive,  they provide resources such as water and medicines and other [[ecosystem service]]s, they are the location of events and ceremonies, and traditionally are sites of education. They link to livelihoods in many ways and the concepts of cultural services and human wellbeing are associated with them.{{cn|date=February 2017}} They support [[pilgrimage]]s and [[tourism]], both of which have large associated service sectors and generate significant economic activity.

==A brief history in conservation==
Following a seminal workshop organized by [[UNESCO]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Lee C, Schaaf T. (2003) ‘The Importance of Sacred Natural Sites for Biodiversity Conservation’, Proceedings of the International Workshop held in Kunming and Xishuangbanna Biosphere Reserve, People’s Republic of China, 17–20 February 2003. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaaf T., and Lee, C. (2006) ‘Conserving Cultural and Biological Diversity: The Role of Sacred Natural Sites and Cultural Landscapes’ Proceedings of UNESCO-IUCN International Conference, Tokyo, Japan. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; international conservation organisations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[IUCN]], working with indigenous groups and networks such as the [[Rigoberta Menchu Tum Foundation]], started to explore ways to integrate sacred natural sites in their conservation work. A number of international events and processes followed, and case studies and scientific and practitioner articles started to appear in books and journals. In 2003 IUCN’s Specialist Group on the Cultural and Spiritual Values of Protected Areas (CSVPA) and UNESCO started work on guidelines for the management of sacred natural sites.&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt;  This Group has advanced a significant amount of work on sacred natural sites, including through specific projects such as the [[Delos Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallarach, J M. and Papayannis, T. (eds.) (2007) ‘Protected Areas and Spirituality’, IUCN and Publicacions de l’Abadia de Montserrat. Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Papayannis, T. and Mallarach, J M. (eds) (2009) ‘The Sacred Dimension of Protected Areas’, Proceedings of the Second Workshop of the Delos Initiative – Ouranoupolis 2007. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN and Athens, Greece: Med-INA.&lt;/ref&gt; Among international conservation NGO’s, The [[Nature Conservancy]] has developed a planning tool for the conservation of sacred sites and cultural heritage in protected areas and tested it across countries in [[Central America]] such as [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Secaira, E. and &amp; Molina M E, (2005) ‘Planning for the Conservation of Sacred Sites in the Context of Protected Areas’, an adaptation of a Methodology and lessons from its application in the Highlands of Western Guatemala. The nature conservancy, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; WWF studied sacred sites in one hundred protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt;

==International importance of sacred natural sites==
The urgent need for the protection of sacred natural sites has also been recognized by the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]]. The CBD in 2004 developed the Akwe Kon voluntary guidelines for the conduct of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding proposed developments that may affect sacred sites and on lands and waters traditionally occupied or used by indigenous and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2004, Akwé: Kon Voluntary Guidelines for the Conduct of Cultural, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment regarding Developments Proposed to Take Place on, or which are Likely to Impact on, Sacred Sites and on Lands and Waters Traditionally Occupied or Used by Indigenous and Local Communities’, CBD Guidelines Series, Montreal, 25p.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the political level, as described before, the adoption of the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] &lt;ref name=UNDRIP/&gt; is an important benchmark.  Article 12 in particular provides significant political leverage for developing appropriate policies for the protection and recognition of sacred natural sites at the national level. It states:  “Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.”.&lt;ref name=UNDRIP&gt;UNDRIP (2007) ‘Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations’, General Assembly, 61st session, agenda item 68, Report of the Human Rights Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred natural sites and the ethics of research and inventory==
It is particularly important to raise the concept of free prior, [[informed consent]] (FPIC), which has emerged as a standard for engaging with [[indigenous people]] and local communities. This is particularly important with regard to sacred natural sites.  For many custodians of sacred natural sites [[secrecy]] is of the utmost importance and needs serious consideration and respect.&lt;ref name=Wild/&gt;  At the same time it needs to be recognised that research and inventory can be powerful tools for the communication and conservation of sacred natural sites.

==Sacred natural sites and global change==
Verschuuren et al. (2010) identified significant global changes, many of which affect sacred natural sites and their custodian communities.  These include:&lt;ref name=v/&gt;
*global human [[population increase]],
*modernity and erosion of traditional [[culture]],
*[[biodiversity loss]], [[Habitat destruction|habitat]] and species declines, [[species extinction]] and [[ecosystem]] damage,
*[[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]],  [[forestry]], [[Fishery|fisheries]] or other types of [[Land use|land]] and sea use,
*[[Mining|extractive]] and energy industries,
*growth of cities, [[urbanization]] and transport networks,
*increased conflict over [[natural resource]]s,
*weakened livelihood systems and [[poverty]],
*[[Social change|social]] and political changes and conflicts in the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] realm,
*[[globalization]] of the dominant economic model based on continual growth, detached from ecological realities,
*decline in [[spirituality|spiritual]] values,
*[[climate change]].

Many of the drivers of these global changes are mutually reinforcing and affect cultural and [[biological diversity]] and the many services that sacred natural sites provide to human well-being. 

Generating a greater recognition of the sacred dimensions of nature focused on sacred natural sites is expected to be an important means of building public support for the policies that conserve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the diversity of human adaptations to a changing environment.

'''Soil regeneration''' as a particular form of [[ecological regeneration]] within the field of [[restoration ecology]] is the act or idea of replenishing the Earth's [[soil]] with beneficial nutrients (including carbon) using natural methods. The focus—building [[soil health]]—has many benefits, both proven and theorized, including the soil [[carbon sequestration|sequestration of carbon]] in response to a growing threat of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Healthyag - Soil|url = http://www.healthyag.com/soilreg.html|website = www.healthyag.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change and the carbon cycle ==
There has been much evidence to show a significant connection between the [[carbon cycle]] and [[climate change]]. Most [[greenhouse gas]]es are primarily composed of carbon and they produce an effect where warmer air that is heated by the sun is kept from leaving the atmosphere by forming a barrier in the troposphere. According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], greenhouse gasses produced by human activity have been noted as the most significant cause of global climate change since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor=Edenhofer, O. |editor2=R. Pichs-Madruga |editor3=Y. Sokona |editor4=E. Farahani |editor5=S. Kadner |editor6=K. Seyboth |editor7=A. Adler |editor8=I. Baum |editor9=S. Brunner |editor10=P. Eickemeier |editor11=B. Kriemann |editor12=J. Savolainen |editor13=S.

Minx|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA|isbn=9781107654815|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=jrUNCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781107654815&amp;hl=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without human interaction, carbon is removed from and reintroduced to soil through a variety of ecosystem processes known as the [[carbon cycle]]. Humans have been significantly influencing the global carbon cycle since the [[Industrial Revolution]] through various means, such as transportation and agriculture. Through these actions, most of this carbon has moved in one direction, from the [[lithosphere]] and [[biosphere]]s to the [[atmosphere]]. By means of oil, gas and irresponsible farming, much of the natural carbon in the earth's [[pedosphere]] has been released into the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gasses.

== Regenerative agriculture ==
Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as [[monoculture]], failing to [[Crop rotation|rotate crops]] sufficiently, and intensive livestock [[grazing]].&lt;ref&gt;Sundermeier, A., Reeder, R., &amp; Lal, R. (2005). Soil Carbon Sequestration Fundamentals. Columbus, OH.&lt;/ref&gt; Soil that is low in carbon will not support [[Plant|plant life]] and is susceptible to [[desertification]]. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. [[Agroecology]] is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes "[[permaculture]]", originally being a combination of the words "permanent" and "agriculture", which is a [[systems thinking]] approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing [[ecosystem]]s to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem. Permaculture focuses on using the land and a strong knowledge of plants, animals and natural cycles to create ecosystems that yield plentiful produce and help keep themselves healthy and productive. This can be done through intentional landscaping that would utilize as much rainfall as possible or placing nitrogen fixing plants near another crop that might need them. Agroecology also includes the ideas of [[Holistic management (agriculture)|holistic management]]. This approach stems from the work of [[Allan Savory]] who claims that planned grazing can improve soil health and reverse the effects of desertification.

[[Monoculture]] is a style of agriculture where only one type of crop is [[harvest]]ed in a field season after season. This depletes nutrients from the soil because each type of plant has a specific set of nutrients that it need to grow or can replace back into the soil. With a lack of plant diversity, only certain nutrients will be absorbed, leaving none of those in the soil, and only certain others will be returned into the land, leaving large gaps in the richness required to maintain a healthy level of production. [[Permaculture]] and [[Holistic management (agriculture)|holistic management]] are two different methods that focus on increasing [[biomass]] and returning nutrient richness and diversity to the soil. The more biomass that is present in an ongoing cycle, the more carbon that can be sequestered into the soil and that can be converted into oxygen by plant matter. To accomplish these goals, permaculture encourages the idea of planting more than one crop on a piece of land at a time. Any combination of plants that are chosen to grow together in a permaculture garden or farm would help the other plants be more healthy and grow as well. In permaculture design, each individual aspect of a farm would help other aspects attain the necessary nutrients and conditions to be as plentiful as possible. This helps to regenerate soil health because the diversity of the crops and even livestock used would help maintain a balance of all necessary nutrients, including carbon. Holistic management focuses mainly onn increasing biomass through the carefully planned grazing of livestock. The idea behind holistic management is that grazing livestock can actually help improve the growing conditions for more biomass through means such as naturally fertilizing the land and tilling with hooves.

The term '''stained glass''' can refer to coloured [[glass]] as a material or to works created from it. Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and [[sculpture]]. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term "stained glass" to include domestic [[leadlight]] and [[objets d'art]] created from [[came glasswork]] exemplified in the famous lamps of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].

As a material ''stained glass'' is glass that has been coloured by adding [[Salt (chemistry)|metallic salts]] during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into ''stained glass windows'' in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. [[Paint]]ed details and yellow [[stain]] are often used to enhance the design. The term ''stained glass'' is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.

Stained glass, as an [[art]] and a [[craft]], requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. In [[Western Europe]] they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as "illuminated wall decorations".

The design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the [[Bible]], history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church – episodes from the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]]; within a parliament building – shields of the constituencies; within a college hall – figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home – flora, fauna, or landscape.

Stained glass is still popular today, but often referred to as art glass.  It is prevalent in luxury homes, commercial buildings, and places of worship.  Artists and companies are contracted to create beautiful art glass ranging from domes, windows, backsplashes, etc.

==Glass production==
{{Main|Architectural glass}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

During the late [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as [[potash]], [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], and [[lead]] can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as [[Lime (material)|lime]], are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state. Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to [[flashed glass]].

===Cylinder glass or Muff===
Using a blow-pipe, a "gather" (glob) of molten glass is taken from the pot heating in the furnace. The gather is formed to the correct shape and a bubble of air blown into it. Using metal tools, molds of wood that have been soaking in water, and gravity, the gather is manipulated to form a long, cylindrical shape. As it cools, it is reheated so that the manipulation can continue. During the process, the bottom of the cylinder is removed. Once brought to the desired size it is left to cool. One side of the cylinder is opened. It is put into another oven to quickly heat and flatten it, and then placed in an [[Annealing (glass)|annealer]] to cool at a controlled rate, making the material more stable. "Hand-blown" cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in ancient stained-glass windows. Stained glass windows were normally in churches and chapeles as well as many more well respected buildings.

===Crown glass===
This hand-blown glass is created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a [[potter's wheel]]. The [[centrifugal force]] causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The center of each piece of glass, known as the "bull's-eye", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet. It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the "pontil" rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out. This lumpy, refractive quality means the bulls-eyes are less transparent, but they have still been used for windows, both domestic and ecclesiastical. Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.

===Rolled glass===
[[Architectural glass#Rolled plate (figured) glass|Rolled glass]] (sometimes called "table glass") is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or [[graphite]] table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or by machine. Glass can be "double rolled", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8" or 3mm). The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called [[cathedral glass]], but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.

===Flashed glass===
Architectural glass must be at least {{sfrac|1|8}} of an inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads. However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop. This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of {{sfrac|1|8}} inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black. The method employed is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming "[[flashed glass]]".

A lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily on a variety of flashed colours for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, [[hydrofluoric acid]] was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.

===Modern production of traditional glass===
There are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, the United States, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular [[Tiffany glass]] and [[Dalle de verre]].

==Colours==

===Transparent glass===

Ordinary [[soda-lime glass]] appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or can be seen with the aid of scientific instruments. A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained glass windows. Additives that reduce the green tint include [[manganese dioxide]] which produces [[sodium permanganate]], and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in [[New England]]. [[Selenium]] has been used for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="Illustrated Glass Dictionary"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100205233650/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html Illustrated Glass Dictionary] www.glassonline.com.

===Green glass===

While very pale green is the typical colour of transparent glass, deeper greens can be achieved by the addition of [[Iron(II) oxide]] which results in a bluish-green glass. Together with [[chromium]] it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make [[wine bottle]]s.
The addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speclab.com/elements/chromium.htm Chemical Fact Sheet – Chromium] www.speclab.com. Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Together with tin oxide{{clarify |date=April 2017 |reason=There are multiple Tin Oxides}} and arsenic it yields [[emerald (color)|emerald green]] glass.

===Blue glass===

*In medieval times, blue glass was made by adding cobalt, which at a concentration of 0.025% to 0.1% in soda-lime glass achieves the brilliant blue characteristic of [[Chartres Cathedral]].
*The addition of [[sulphur]] to boron-rich [[borosilicate glass]]es imparts a blue colour.
* The addition of [[copper oxide]] at 2–3% produces a [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]] colour.
* The addition of [[nickel]], at different concentrations, produces blue, violet, or black glass.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5abGjJ54mSoC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=The+addition+of+nickel,+at+different+concentrations,+produces+blue,+violet,+or+black+glass.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn2tvlqpzYAhVCz2MKHfuZCp8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20addition%20of%20nickel,%20at%20different%20concentrations,%20produces%20blue,%20violet,%20or%20black%20glass.&amp;f=false|title=The Illustrated Bead Bible: Terms, Tips &amp; Techniques|last=Geary|first=Theresa Flores|date=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=|isbn=9781402723537|location=|pages=108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red glass===

* Metallic [[gold]], in very low concentrations (around 0.001%), produces a rich ruby-coloured glass ("ruby gold"); in even lower concentrations it produces a less intense red, often marketed as "[[cranberry glass]]". The colour is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of lead glass with tin added.
* Pure metallic [[copper]] produces a very dark red, opaque glass. Glass created in this manner is generally "flashed" (laminated glass). It was used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploited for the decorative effects that could be achieved by sanding and engraving.
*[[Selenium]] is an important agent to make pink and red glass. When used together with cadmium sulphide, it yields a brilliant red colour known as "Selenium Ruby".&lt;ref name="Illustrated Glass Dictionary"/&gt;

===Yellow glass===

* [[Silver]] compounds (notably [[silver nitrate]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFQ4AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Silver+compounds+(notably+silver+nitrate)+are+used+as+stain+applied+to+the+surface+of+glass+and+fired+on&amp;dq=Silver+compounds+(notably+silver+nitrate)+are+used+as+stain+applied+to+the+surface+of+glass+and+fired+on&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFxZSXudnUAhVX-GMKHdtwDeMQ6AEIJDAA|title=Ceramic Industry|last=Steinhoff|first=Frederick Louis|date=1973|publisher=Industrial Publications, Incorporated|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used as stain applied to the surface of glass and fired on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2fQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Silver+compounds+(notably+silver+nitrate)+are+used+as+stain+applied+to+the+surface+of+glass+and+fired+on&amp;dq=Silver+compounds+(notably+silver+nitrate)+are+used+as+stain+applied+to+the+surface+of+glass+and+fired+on&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFxZSXudnUAhVX-GMKHdtwDeMQ6AEIKTAB|title=Chambers's encyclopaedia|date=1967|publisher=Pergamon Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can produce a range of colours from [[Orange (colour)|orange]]-red to yellow. The way the glass is heated and cooled can significantly affect the colours produced by these compounds. The chemistry involved is complex and not well understood.
* The addition of sulphur, together with [[carbon]] and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulphides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. With [[calcium]] it yields a deep yellow colour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070305020112/http://1st.glassman.com/articles/glasscolouring.html Substances Used in the Making of Coloured Glass] 1st.glassman.com (David M Issitt). Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adding [[titanium]] produces [[yellow]]ish-[[brown]] glass. Titanium is rarely used on its own and is more often employed to intensify and brighten other additives.
* [[Cadmium]] together with sulphur results in deep yellow colour, often used in glazes. However, cadmium is toxic.
* [[Uranium]] (0.1% to 2%) can be added to give glass a fluorescent yellow or green colour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110418061335/http://www.glassassociation.org.uk/Journal/uranium.htm Uranium Glass] www.glassassociation.org.uk (Barrie Skelcher). Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uranium glass]] is typically not [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] enough to be dangerous, but if ground into a powder, such as by polishing with sandpaper, and inhaled, it can be [[carcinogenic]]. When used with lead glass with a very high proportion of lead, it produces a deep red colour.

===Purple glass===

* The addition of [[manganese]] gives an [[Amethyst (color)|amethyst]] colour. Manganese is one of the oldest glass additives, and purple manganese glass has been used since early Egyptian history.
* [[Nickel]], depending on the concentration, produces blue, or [[violet (colour)|violet]], or even [[black]] glass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Lead crystal]] with added nickel acquires a purplish colour.

===White glass===

* [[Tin dioxide]] with [[antimony trioxide|antimony]] and [[arsenic trioxide|arsenic]] oxides produce an opaque [[white]] glass, first used in [[Venice]] to produce an imitation [[porcelain]]. White glass was used extensively by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] to create a range of [[Tiffany glass|opalescent, mottled and streaky glasses]].

==Creating stained glass windows==

===Design===
The first stage in the production of a window is to make, or acquire from the architect or owners of the building, an accurate template of the window opening that the glass is to fit.

The subject matter of the window is determined to suit the location, a particular theme, or the wishes of the patron. A small design called a ''Vidimus'' (from Latin "we have seen") is prepared which can be shown to the patron. A scaled model [[maquette]] may also be provided. The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique.

A traditional narrative window has panels which relate a story. A figurative window could have rows of saints or dignitaries. Scriptural texts or mottoes are sometimes included and perhaps the names of the patrons or the person to whose memory the window is dedicated. In a window of a traditional type, it is usually left to the discretion of the designer to fill the surrounding areas with borders, floral motifs and canopies.

A full-sized cartoon is drawn for every "light" (opening) of the window. A small church window might typically have two lights, with some simple [[tracery]] lights above. A large window might have four or five lights. The east or west window of a large [[cathedral]] might have seven lights in three tiers, with elaborate tracery. In medieval times the cartoon was drawn directly on the surface of a whitewashed table, which was then used as a pattern for cutting, painting and assembling the window. The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece. The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect.

===Selecting and painting the glass===

Each piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the template. An exact fit is ensured by "grozing" the edges with a tool which can nibble off small pieces.Details of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine. The art of painting details became increasingly elaborate and reached its height in the early 20th century.

From 1300 onwards, artists started using "silver stain" which was made with [[silver nitrate]]. It gave a yellow effect ranging from pale lemon to deep orange. It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent. This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass. By about 1450, a stain known as "Cousin's rose" was used to enhance flesh tones.

In the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles. They were a form of enamel. Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details. By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections. Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles. The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled.

A method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead [[came]]. This allows for the use of techniques such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]] to produce an effect visible from both sides but not exposing the decorated surface to the atmosphere or mechanical damage.

===Assembly and mounting===

Once the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames. All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. In modern windows, copper foil is now sometimes used instead of lead. For further technical details, see [[Came glasswork]].

Traditionally, when a window was inserted into the window space, iron rods were put across it at various points to support its weight. The window was tied to these rods with copper wire. Some very large early Gothic windows are divided into sections by heavy metal frames called ''ferramenta''. This method of support was also favoured for large, usually painted, windows of the Baroque period.

==History==

===Origins===
Stained glass has been produced since ancient times. Both the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] excelled at the manufacture of small colored glass objects. [[Phoenicia]] was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Antioch]]. The [[British Museum]] holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the [[Lycurgus Cup]], which is a murky mustard color but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the [[Portland vase]] which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.

In early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced alabaster set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect.

Evidence of stained glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century. The earliest known reference dates from 675 AD when [[Benedict Biscop]] imported workmen from France to glaze the windows of the monastery of St Peter which he was building at [[Monkwearmouth]]. Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at [[Jarrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Discovering stained glass – John Harries, Carola Hicks, Edition: 3 – 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at [[Raqqa]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.

===In Southwest Asia===
The creation of stained glass in [[Southwest Asia]] began in ancient times. One of the region's earliest surviving formulations for the production of colored glass comes from the [[Assyria|Assyrian]] city of [[Nineveh]], dating to the seventh century BC. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'', attributed to the 8th century [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|alchemist]] [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], discusses the production of colored glass in ancient Babylon and Egypt. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'' also describes how to create colored glass and artificial gemstones made from high-quality stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%209.htm The Manufacture of Coloured Glass] and [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%2093.html Assessment of ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna''], ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of stained glass manufacture has continued, with mosques, palaces, and public spaces being decorated with stained glass throughout the Islamic world. The stained glass of Islam is generally non-pictorial and of purely geometric design, but may contain both floral motifs and text.

===Medieval glass in Europe===
{{see also|Poor Man's Bible|Medieval stained glass}}

Stained glass, as an art form, reached its height in the [[Middle Ages]] when it became a major pictorial form used to illustrate the narratives of the Bible to a largely illiterate populace.

In the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and Early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period, from about 950 to 1240, the untraceried windows demanded large expanses of glass which of necessity were supported by robust iron frames, such as may be seen at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. As [[Gothic architecture]] developed into a more ornate form, windows grew larger, affording greater illumination to the interiors, but were divided into sections by vertical shafts and tracery of stone. This elaboration of form reached its height of complexity in the Flamboyant style in Europe, and windows grew still larger with the development of the [[Perpendicular style]] in England.

Integrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring. The circular form, or [[rose window]], developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to wheel windows, as exemplified by the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris and the "Bishop's Eye" at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].

While stained glass was widely manufactured, [[Chartres]] was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Stained Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance, Reformation and Classical windows===
Probably the earliest scheme of stained glass windows that was created during the [[Renaissance]] was that for Florence Cathedral, devised by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]].&lt;ref name=Lee1/&gt; The scheme includes three ocular windows for the dome and three for the facade which were designed from 1405 to 1445 by several of the most renowned artists of this period: [[Ghiberti]], [[Donatello]], [[Uccello]] and [[Andrea del Castagno]]. Each major ocular window contains a single picture drawn from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] or the [[Life of the Virgin|Life of the Virgin Mary]], surrounded by a wide floral border, with two smaller facade windows by Ghiberti showing the martyred deacons, [[St Stephen]] and [[St Lawrence]]. One of the cupola windows has since been lost, and that by Donatello has lost nearly all of its painted details.&lt;ref name=Lee1&gt;Lee, Seddon and Stephens, pp. 118–121&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of [[Protestantism]]. In France, much glass of this period was produced at the [[Limoges]] factory, and in Italy at [[Murano]], where stained glass and faceted [[lead crystal]] are often coupled together in the same window. The French Revolution brought about the neglect or destruction of many windows in France.

At the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the injunctions of [[Thomas Cromwell]] against "abused images" (the object of veneration) resulted in the loss of thousands of windows. Few remain undamaged; of these the windows in the private chapel at [[Hengrave Hall]] in Suffolk are among the finest. With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century. See [[Stained glass – British glass, 1811–1918]] for more details.

In the Netherlands a rare scheme of glass has remained intact at [[Sint Janskerk|Grote Sint-Jan]] Church, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. The windows, some of which are 18 metres (59&amp;nbsp;feet) high, date from 1555 to the early 1600s; the earliest is the work of [[Dirck Crabeth]] and his brother [[Wouter Crabeth|Wouter]]. Many of the original cartoons still exist.&lt;ref name=Vidimus1&gt;Vidimus, ''[http://vidimus.org/issues/issue-20/news/#sale-of-dirck-pieterz-crabeth-stained-glass-design Dirck Peterz.

===Revival in Britain===
{{main|British and Irish stained glass (1811–1918)}}
The Catholic revival in England, gaining force in the early 19th century with its renewed interest in the medieval church, brought a revival of church building in the Gothic style, claimed by [[John Ruskin]] to be "the true Catholic style". The architectural movement was led by [[Augustus Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]]. Many new churches were planted in large towns and many old churches were restored. This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained glass window making.

Among the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were [[William Warrington]] and [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman]] of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America. Other manufacturers included [[William Wailes]], [[Ward and Hughes]], [[Clayton and Bell]], [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]] and [[Charles Eamer Kempe]]. A Scottish designer, [[Daniel Cottier]], opened firms in Australia and the US.

===Revival in France===
{{see|List of French stained glass manufacturers}}
In France there was a greater continuity of stained glass production than in England. In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists. In 1824 the [[Sèvres]] porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand.
In France many churches and cathedrals suffered despoliation during the [[French Revolution]]. During the 19th century a great number of churches were restored by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. Many of France's finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself. The pioneers were Henri Gèrente and André Lusson.&lt;ref name= GC&gt;Gordon Campbell, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-518948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass.

===Revival===
During the mid- to late 19th century, many of Germany's ancient buildings were restored, and some, such as [[Cologne Cathedral]], were completed in the medieval style. There was a great demand for stained glass. The designs for many windows were based directly on the work of famous engravers such as [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Original designs often imitate this style. Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead. The Royal Bavarian Glass Painting Studio was founded by Ludwig I in 1827.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;  A major firm was [[Mayer of Munich]], which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as [http://www.mayer-of-munich.com/ ''Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc.'']. German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia. Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

In the [[Austrian Empire]] and later [[Austria-Hungary]], one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841. His son would continue the tradition as [[Carl Geyling's Erben]], which still exists today. Carl Geyling's Erben completed numerous stained glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an Imperial and [[Royal Warrant of Appointment]] from emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].

===Innovations in Britain and Europe===
Among the most innovative English designers were the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[William Morris]] (1834–1898) and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1833–1898), whose work heralds the influential Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Peter Cormack, Arts &amp; Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts &amp; Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.

[[Art Nouveau]].
Art Nouveau or [[Belle Epoch]] stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs. In France it is seen in the work of [[Francis Chigot]] of Limoges. In Britain it appears in the refined and formal [[leadlight]] designs of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].

===Innovations in the United States===
{{Main|Tiffany glass}}

[[J&amp;R Lamb Studios]], established in 1857 in New York City, was the first major decorative arts studio in the United States and for many years a major producer of ecclesiastical stained glass.

Notable American practitioners include [[John La Farge]] (1835–1910), who invented [[opalescent glass]] and for which he received a U.S. patent on 24 February 1880, and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] (1848–1933), who received several patents for variations of the same opalescent process in November of the same year and is believed to have invented the copper foil method as an alternative to lead, and used it extensively in windows, lamps and other decorations. However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s. Charles J. Connick (1875-1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts &amp; Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall. Connick created hundreds of windows throughout the USA, including major glazing schemes at Princeton University Chapel (1927-9) and at Pittsburgh's Heinz Memorial Chapel (1937-8).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other American artist-makers who espoused a medieval-inspired idiom included Nicola D'Ascenzo of Philadelphia, Wilbur Burnham and Reynolds, Francis &amp; Rohnstock of Boston and Henry Wynd Young and J. Gordon Guthrie of New York.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
Many 19th-century firms failed early in the 20th century as the Gothic movement was superseded by newer styles. At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the [[The Glass House (Fulham)|Glass House]] in London set up by [[Mary Lowndes]] and [[Alfred Drury (stained glass artist)|Alfred J. Drury]] and [[An Túr Gloine]] in Dublin, which was run by [[Sarah Purser]] and included artists such as [[Harry Clarke]].

A revival occurred in the middle of the century because of a desire to restore thousands of church windows throughout Europe destroyed as a result of World War II bombing. German artists led the way. Much work of the period is mundane and often was not made by its designers, but industrially produced.

Other artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials. The use of slab glass, a technique known as [[Dalle de verre|Dalle de Verre]], where the glass is set in [[concrete]] or epoxy resin, was a 20th-century innovation credited to [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] and brought to the UK by [[Pierre Fourmaintraux]]. One of the most prolific glass artists using this technique was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Dominican Friar]] [[Dom Charles Norris]] OSB of [[Buckfast Abbey]].

[[Gemmail]], a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead [[came]]s to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20030402061812/http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2003 |title=Le grand dictionnaire Qu&amp;#233bec government's online dictionary entry for '&amp;#39;gemmail'&amp;#39; (in French) |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=8 April 2003 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228139/gemmail Gemmail], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gemmail|Definition of Gemmail]]
Many famous works by late 19th- and early 20th-century painters, notably [[Picasso]], have been reproduced in gemmail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809295,00.html], Gemmail ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; A major exponent of this technique is the German artist [[Walter Womacka]].

Among the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an [[Abstract art]] form were [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painter [[Marc Chagall]] produced designs for many stained glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details. Important 20th-century stained glass artists include [[John Hayward (stained glass maker)|John Hayward]], [[Douglas Strachan]], [[Ervin Bossanyi]], [[Louis Davis]], [[Wilhelmina Geddes]], [[Karl Parsons]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Patrick Reyntiens]], [[Johannes Shreiter]], [[Judith Schaechter]], [[Paul Woodroffe]], [[Jean René Bazaine]] at [[Saint-Séverin (Paris)|Saint Séverin]], [[Sergio de Castro (artist)|Sergio de Castro]] at Couvrechef- La Folie ([[Caen]]), [[Hamburg-Dulsberg]] and [[Romont]] (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of [[Gabriel Loire]] at [[Chartres]]. The west windows of England's [[Manchester Cathedral]], by [[Tony Hollaway]], are some of the most notable examples of symbolic work.

In Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of [[Johan Thorn Prikker]] and [[Josef Albers]], and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. Trends included the abandonment of figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads.&lt;ref name="Harrod-p452"&gt;Harrod, Tanya, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press (4 Feb 1999), {{ISBN|978-0300077803}}, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Ludwig Schaffrath]] demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass.  In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as [[Brian Clarke (artist)|Brian Clarke]] were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.&lt;ref name="Harrod-p452" /&gt;

In the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of Stained Glass. It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass. Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers.

After the First World War, stained glass window memorials were a popular choice among wealthier families, examples can be found in churches across the UK.

In the United States, there is a 100-year-old trade organization, The Stained Glass Association of America, whose purpose is to function as a publicly recognized organization to assure survival of the craft by offering guidelines, instruction and training to craftspersons. The SGAA also sees its role as defending and protecting its craft against regulations that might restrict its freedom as an architectural art form. The current president is Kathy Bernard. Today there are academic establishments that teach the traditional skills. One of these is Florida State University's Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}} high stained-glass windows, designed by Robert Bischoff, the program’s director, and Jo Ann, his wife and installed to overlook [[Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium]].

==Buildings incorporating stained glass windows==
===Churches===
Stained glass windows were commonly used in churches for decorative and informative purposes. Many windows are donated to churches by members of the congregation as memorials of loved ones. For more information on the use of stained glass to depict religious subjects, see [[Poor Man's Bible]].

===Synagogues===
In addition to Christian churches, stained glass windows have been incorporated into Jewish temple architecture for centuries.  Jewish communities in the United States saw this emergence in mid-19th century, with such notable examples as the sanctuary depiction of the Ten Commandments in New York's Congregation Anshi Chesed.  From the mid-20th century to the present, stained glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture.  Styles and themes for synagogue stained glass artwork are as diverse as their church counterparts.  As with churches, synagogue stained glass windows are often dedicated by member families in exchange for major financial contributions to the institution.

===Houses===
Stained glass windows in houses were particularly popular in the [[Victorian era]] and many domestic examples survive. In their simplest form they typically depict birds and flowers in small panels, often surrounded with machine-made ''[[cathedral glass]]'' which, despite what the name suggests, is pale-coloured and textured. Some large homes have splendid examples of secular pictorial glass. Many small houses of the 19th and early 20th centuries have [[leadlight]] windows.

===Public and commercial buildings===
Stained glass has often been used as a decorative element in public buildings, initially in places of learning, government or justice but increasingly in other public and commercial places such as banks, retailers and railway stations. [[Public house]]s in some countries make extensive use of stained glass and leaded lights to create a comfortable atmosphere and retain privacy.

A '''style guide''' (or '''manual of style''') is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field.  (It is often called a '''style sheet''', though that term has other meanings.)

A style guide establishes and enforces [[wikt:style#Noun|style]] to improve [[communication]]. To do that, it ensures [[wikt:consistency#Noun|consistency]] within a document and across multiple documents and enforces [[best practice]] in [[usage]] and in [[Composition (language)|language composition]], [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], [[orthography]] and [[typography]]. For [[Academic publishing|academic]] and [[Technical communication|technical]] documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in [[ethics]] (such as [[authorship]], [[research ethics]], and [[:wikt:disclosure|disclosure]]), [[pedagogy]] (such as [[expository writing|exposition]] and clarity), and compliance ([[Technical standard|technical]] and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]]).

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[Academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and specific industries. '''House style''' refers to the internal style manual of a particular publisher or organization.

==Varieties==
Style guides vary widely in scope and size.

===Sizes===
This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade [[style sheet (web development)|in web development]] and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|in desktop publishing]] (e.g., how inline styles in [[HTML]] cascade over [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles).

A short style guide is often called a ''style sheet''. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a ''style manual'' or ''manual of style'' (''MOS'' or ''MoS'').  In many cases, a project such as one [[book]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[monograph]] series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a [[publishing]] company, whose content is usually called ''house style''. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an ''industry-wide or profession-wide style manual'' that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: 
* [[AP Stylebook|AP style]] for journalism and most forms of corporate communications
* [[United States Government Printing Office#GPO's Style Manual|USGPO style]] or [[Australian Government Publishing Service|AGPS style]] for government publications 
* [[Hart's Rules|Oxford style]] and [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]] for academic publishing and readership 
* [[APA style]] and [[ASA style]] for the social sciences 
* [[CSE style]] for various physical sciences 
* [[ACS style]] for chemistry 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] for medicine 
* [[Bluebook]] style for law

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [[orthography|orthographic]] norms of the language in use (for example, [[English orthography]] for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as [[comparison of American and British English|the different varieties of American English and British English]].

=== Topics ===
Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [[graphic design]], including [[typography]]. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text.

Style guides that cover [[usage]] may suggest ways of describing people that avoid [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover [[nomenclature]], which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and [[ontology|ontologically]] sound (e.g., [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[chemical nomenclature]], and [[gene nomenclature]]).

==Updating==
Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and [[usage]]. The frequency of updating and the [[revision control]] are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in [[reference work]] format, new [[edition (book)|editions]] typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the [[AP Stylebook]] is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

==Examples==
{{further|List of style guides}}

===International===
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. One example is [[ISO 215]] ''Documentation &amp;mdash; Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086 |title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation - Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] publishes an ''Interinstitutional style guide''—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 languages]] across the European Union. This manual is "obligatory" for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-360400.htm|title= Interinstitutional Style Guide|author= Publications Office of the European Union|date= 24 July 2008|work= Europa|publisher= European Union12 May 2010|ref= Eur08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] of the [[European Commission]] publishes its own ''English Style Guide'', intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, but aiming to serve a wider readership as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title= English Style Guide|author= Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|publisher= European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most public-facing corporate communication and journalism writing is written with styles following ''[[The Associated Press Stylebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;June Casagrande, ''Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite'' (New York: Penguin, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers and authors of journals requiring reference sections generally choose the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], while scholarly writing often follows the ''[[The MLA Style Manual|MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/style "What Is MLA Style?"], ''[[Modern Language Association|mla.org]]'', [[Modern Language Association]], 2011, Web, 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the most popular grammar guides used in third-person writing is ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. The Associated Press Stylebook is written to be used together with The Elements of Style to provide a very complete grammar and English style reference with no conflicts.

Despite the near uniform use of the Bluebook, nearly every state has appellate court rules that specify citation methods and writing styles specific to that state  - and the Supreme Court of the United States has its own citation method.  However, in most cases these are derived from the Bluebook.

There are also several other citation manuals available to legal writers in wide usage in the United States.  Virtually all large law firms maintain their own citation manual and several major publishers of legal texts (West, Lexis-Nexis, Hein, ''et al.'') maintain their own systems.

== Sustainable communities ==
Scotland's first dedicated programme for sustainable communities was delivered by Forward Scotland between 1997-1999 as part of a UK wide initiative led by Encams. Partnerships with a number of local authorities were developed and dedicated officers recruited to work with communities. This programme piloted the Community Eco-cal a forerunner of ecological footprinting. This programme was evaluated by Professor Michael Carley, Heriot-Watt University and the lessons learned informed a successor programme, 2000-2002, where community groups themselves were the focus. This produced the very first handbook for sustainable communities and a series of highly successful community projects. During this time the first community grants programme for sustainable communities was launched funded by the New Opportunities Fund (now the Big Lottery Fund). This programme funded some pioneering projects in areas such as community renewables, local food, community waste management and the first ecological footprinting projects in Scotland.

[[Community Energy Scotland]] is a charity that provides free advice, grant funding and finance for [[renewable energy]] projects developed by community groups in Scotland. The main aim of the company is to enable all communities to generate and use renewable energy for their long term and collective benefit.&lt;ref name=HICEC&gt;HICEC. (2006) ''Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company Annual Review''. Inverness. [http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-Annual_review.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the local [[development trust]] on the island of [[Tiree]] commissioned a 950&amp;nbsp;kW community-owned wind turbine project, the fourth such large-scale project in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tireerenewableenergy.co.uk/ "Tiree renewable energy"]. tireerenewableenergy.co.uk.

In August 2010 the historian [[James Hunter (historian)|James Hunter]] stated that the transfer of ownership into community control had brought about "a spectacular reversal of [[Gigha|Gigha's]] slide towards complete population collapse" and suggested that the UK Government should  learn lessons from this and other community buy-outs in places such as [[Assynt]], [[Eigg]], and [[Knoydart]] to inform their [[Big Society]] plans.&lt;ref&gt;"Ross, David (20 August 2010) "Cameron should visit Gigha to see the Big Society in action, says historian". Glasgow: ''The Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; These successes notwithstanding, civil servants have been criticised for impeding community buy-outs of land via the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]]. For example, the proposed community purchase of the former [[RAF Machrihanish]] base was thwarted due to technical problems with the application despite 97.4% local support in a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, David (1 September 2010).

==Public sector==

===Government policy===
The first serious policy was written in 1998 in anticipation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, by the Secretary of State's Advisory Group for Sustainable Development. This was followed by strategy that focussed on Waste, Energy and Travel in 2002 and Choosing our Future in 2005, which was written in association with the UK shared framework for sustainable development. In 2007 the Scottish National Party took office in a minority government pursuing 5 strategic objectives that encompass sustainable development but do not specifically reference it. Instead the government has adopted sustainable economic growth as its principal target.

In June 2007 [[John Swinney]], the new Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth in the [[Scottish Government]], announced plans for a Climate Change Bill that would include an intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Kevin (22 June 2007). [http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/news/display.var.1490712.0.0.php "Scotland could be ‘world leader’ in fighting climate change".] Glasgow. ''The Herald''.

In August 2007 the Scottish Government announced the creation of a [[Saltire Prize]] for innovation in industry, which will reward excellence in developing new renewable energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi-energy.org.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-%20%20%2006gnew02i%20%20%20.RefLocID-06g008001.Lang-EN.htm "Green energy excellence to be rewarded": John Swinney announces Saltire Prize] Hi-Energy (15 August 2007) Press release.

The passage of the [[Climate change in Scotland#Mitigation|Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009]] has a created and informed a wide variety of initiatives. The Climate Change Delivery Plan sets out what needs to be done to achieve emissions reductions to meet the statutory targets that are included in the Act. The Climate Change Adaptation Framework, published in December 2009  aims to build resilience and capacity for change. Other public sector initiatives  include:
* The Renewable Energy Framework, the Renewables Action Plan, and the Renewable Heat Action Plan
* The [[Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009]]
* Scotland's Climate Change Declaration
* The Rural Land Use Study
* The Scottish Climate Change Impact Partnership

===Scottish Sustainable Development Forum===
The Scottish Sustainable Development Forum (SSDF) is a group the focussed on promoting debate and action on sustainable development issues in Scotland. Forum membership is open to any individual who wishes to make Scotland more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssdforum.org.uk/ "About Us"] Scottish Sustainable Development Forum. Retrieved 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies===
In January 2010 it emerged that [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]], the government body responsible for protecting the environment had failed to reach its carbon emissions targets. Its aim is to cut CO2 emissions from business activities by 25% by 2012 compared with 2006 but a report showed that they had risen by 10% in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;Fyall, Jenny (29 January 2010) '' 'Green police' fail to hit own targets".''The Scotsman''.

==Energy production and distribution==
{{Main|Renewable energy in Scotland}}
[[File:Windmills and Ailsa Craig aka Paddy's Milestone rotated.jpg|thumb|right|Wind, wave and tide make up more than 80% of Scotland's renewable energy potential.]]
The natural resource base for [[renewable energy|renewables]] is extraordinary by [[Renewable energy in the European Union|European]], and even global standards. In addition to an existing installed capacity{{Ref label|A|a|none}} of 1.3 [[watt|Gigawatts]] (GW) of [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 GW of [[wind power|wind]] and 7.5 GW of [[tidal power]], 25% of the estimated total capacity for the [[European Union]] and up to 14 GW of [[wave power]] potential, 10% of EU capacity.&lt;ref name=Pow&gt;RSPB Scotland, WWF Scotland and FOE Scotland (February 2006) ''The Power of Scotland: Cutting Carbon with Scotland's Renewable Energy''. RSPB et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SER/&gt; The renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 GW or more, considerably greater than the existing capacity from all Scottish fuel sources of 10.3 GW.&lt;ref name=Pow/&gt;&lt;ref name=SRF4&gt;Scottish Renewables (January 2006) ''Market and Planning Report''. Issue No 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this potential remains untapped, but continuing improvements in engineering are enabling more of the [[renewable resource]]s to be utilised. Fears regarding "[[peak oil]]" and [[climate change]] have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various [[biofuel]]s. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on [[subsidy|subsidies]], it is probable that there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.&lt;ref name=Monbiot&gt;Monbiot, George (2006) ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning''. London. Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to planned increases in both large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] are being researched.&lt;ref name=BPPH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterheadhydrogenpower.com/|title=Peterhead hydrogen project|publisher=[[BP]]|accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is significant support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns about the effect of the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also an emerging political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.&lt;ref&gt;HICEC.

===Wind power===
{{Main|Wind power in Scotland}}
Wind power in Scotland is an area of considerable activity, with 1550 MW of installed capacity as at October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/south_of_scotland/7695508.stm Turbines achieve energy landmark]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] is the fastest growing of the renewable energy technologies in Scotland and the world's largest [[wind turbine]] generator (5 MW) is currently undergoing testing in the North Sea, 15 miles off the east coast. There are numerous large wind farms as well as a number, both planned and operating, which are in community ownership. The siting of turbines is sometimes an issue, but surveys have shown high levels of community acceptance for wind power in Scotland. There is further potential for expansion, especially offshore, given the high average wind speeds.

In May 2008 Scottish and Southern Energy confirmed it was proceeding with the Greater Gabbard wind farm, located off the south coast of England. However, they sold their stake in this project, expected to become the largest wind farm in the world, to [[npower (UK)|Npower]] some six months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52579 "Greater Gabbard Wind Project Gets Go-ahead "] (27 May 2008) Renewable Energy World.com.

===Lower carbon power stations===
In May 2007 Scottish Power announced that Alstom Power and Doosan Babcock had been commissioned to design plans for "clean coal" technology at [[Longannet]] and [[Cockenzie power station|Cockenzie]] power stations. This would have become the largest project of its kind in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Alistair (18 May 2007). [http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=771022007 " 'Dinosaur' power stations in line for £1bn green revamp"]. Edinburgh. ''The Scotsman''. Retrieved on 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was cancelled in 2011 after the Westminster Government withdrew funding.&lt;ref&gt;Currie, Brian (19 Oct 2011) "Scots £1bn climate change plant is axed". Glasgow. ''The Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish Power]] have also announced that they wished to reduce carbon emissions by using biomass products such as willow or cereals at Longannet and Cockenzie. This could save up to 300,000 tonnes (330,000&amp;nbsp;tons) of carbon emissions per annum. However, the challenge of replacing large-scale power production with renewables was highlighted by the fact that to replace 5% of the fuel from these plants, fully 12% of Scotland's agricultural land would be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6905893.stm "Crop energy power plan unveiled".] BBC online (July 19, 2007). Retrieved on 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon sequestration===
The [[British Geological Survey]] estimate that potentially 755 billion tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be stored in [[carbon dioxide sink]]s in the [[North Sea]] (Scotland's annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output is circa 50 million tonnes). The process also aids the recovery of oil and gas as it increases pressure in the oil field. The [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] estimate that as much as 2 billion additional barrels of oil could be recovered as a result of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection.&lt;ref name=SER&gt;''A Scottish Energy Review''. (November 2005) Scottish National Party Framework Paper. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this process could reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from conventional power plants by as much as 80–90%, if combined with increased oil recovery the net savings in carbon emissions may be much less as the total volume of oil and gas used from that field would increase.&lt;ref name=Monbiot /&gt;

===Electricity distribution===
However, controversy has arisen about [[Ofgem]]'s proposed plans to increase transmission charges for distant electrical generation. This was widely seen as placing renewable energy production in Scotland at a considerable disadvantage. Jason Ormiston, the chief executive of [[Scottish Renewables]] was quoted as saying "At a time when the UK government's chief scientific adviser has said that climate change is the greatest threat to humanity, here we have the industry regulator penalising renewable electricity generators for generating where the resource is greatest."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Ian (27 July 2007).

Retrieved on 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was highlighted the following month when leaked Department of Trade and Industry documents indicated that, despite Scottish successes, under current policies Britain would miss the EU's 2020 target of 20% energy from renewables by a considerable margin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/13/renewableenergy.energy "Revealed: cover-up plan on energy target".] London. ''Guardian Unlimited'' (13 August 2007). Retrieved on 13 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month a report by [[Xero Energy Limited]] into these 'use of system' transmission charges across Europe indicated that the UK system creates costs that are up to thirty times higher in Scotland than elsewhere in Europe and that charges for the [[List of islands of Scotland|islands]] are "almost certainly higher than any other European country". [[Rob Gibson]] an [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] for the Highlands and Islands described the charges as "a tax on geography", and Elaine Hanton of [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise|HIE]] claimed the report raised "serious concerns".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, John (14 September 2007) "Green energy in Highlands being hampered by 'tax on geography' ".

===Hydrogen economy===
An innovative approach was proposed by [[BP]] in partnership with [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] for the creation of a hydrogen-based power station at [[Peterhead]]. The project would have taken natural gas extracted from the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]], [[cracking (chemistry)|crack]] the gas to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and burn the hydrogen as the fuel source to create electricity in a 475 MW power station. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would then have been returned to the Miller field reservoir more than {{convert|4|km|mi|0}} under the seabed in a process called carbon sequestration (see above). The scheme was expected to be in production by 2009 at a projected cost of $600&amp;nbsp;million, although it fell through as it failed to gain sufficient support from the UK government to enable this to occur. Had it been completed, the plant would have been the first industrial-scale, hydrogen power station in the world.&lt;ref name=BPPH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are ongoing attempts to keep the project alive—see for example Perry, David (25 May 2007) "Last-ditch fight on to save green gas project". Aberdeen. ''Press and Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 a joint venture was announced by the PURE Energy Centre and the Hjaltland Housing Association to create two “unplugged” hydrogen houses on a remote site in Eshaness, [[Northmavine]], in [[Shetland]]. The installation will involve two combined heat and power systems, wind turbines and a hydrogen fuel cell to heat the houses at times when the wind is not blowing. There is also the possibility of a hydrogen refuelling station 
at the site for hydrogen-powered cars. A spokesman for PURE said “Forty per cent of the world-wide population lives with no access to 
electricity and heat. The CHP scheme will provide these populations with such access. There will be no impact on the environment whatsoever. This is totally clean energy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-News-Oct07.pdf "‘Unplugged Houses’ at Northmavine"] (pdf) (October 2007) ''Community Energy News No 6''. Dingwall. HICEC.

Advanced Plasma Power. Retrieved 23 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[Baron Wallace of Tankerness]] sided with liquidators [[KPMG]] who are arguing UK insolvency law has precedence over  Scottish environmental regulations. Wallace's position, taken "on behalf of the UK Government" is that the liquidators have the power to abandon environmental clean-up costs after the company with the responsibility for them has gone bust. KPMG estimates the liquidation of Scottish Coal will leave up to £30m that would be paid to creditor [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds Bank]] rather go towards the restoration of disused mines in [[Ayrshire]] and [[Lanarkshire]]. Opponents of KPMG include the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]], [[South Lanarkshire Council]] and [[East Ayrshire Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Vass, Stephen (11 August 2013) "Scots rules attacked by UK Government in clean-up battle over open-cast mines".

'''''The Age of Plastic''''' is the debut studio album by the British [[New wave music|new wave]] duo [[The Buggles]], composed of [[Trevor Horn]] and [[Geoff Downes]]. The name of the record was conceived from the group's intention of being a "plastic group". The album has lyrical themes of nostalgia and anxiety about the possible effects of modern technology. The titular song, "[[Living in the Plastic Age]]", views the experiences of watching media coverage of the [[Vietnam War]], while "Kid Dynamo" follows a child overexposed to media and its resulting effects on him. Described by writers as the first [[synthpop|technopop]] landmark,&lt;ref name ="Ianpeel"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Buggles Rehearsal"/&gt; the record is an electropop new wave album that includes musical elements and influences of [[disco]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[progressive rock]] and 1960s [[pop music]]. In a 1979 interview, Downes defined the album as "science fiction music. It's like modern psychedelic music. It's very futuristic." 

Horn used pre-dated technology for the album to have sounds unlike what was typical in records that were released at the time. The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977 and 1979, with contributions on several tracks from [[Bruce Woolley]]. The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, while the vocals were recorded and mixed at [[Sarm East Studios]]. Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979.

''The Age of Plastic'' was released by [[Island Records]] in Australia, January 1980, and later in February in the UK. The album's release followed the success of the group's 1979 first single, "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]", which reached number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Most of the songs for the album were written during promotion of the song. Three subsequent singles, "The Plastic Age", "[[Clean, Clean]]" and "[[Elstree (song)|Elstree]]", all released in 1980, followed "Video", and also charted in the UK, reaching number 16, 38 and 55 respectively. In Europe, ''The Age of Plastic'' reached the Top 20 in Italy and the Top 40 in France, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In other continents, the album reached the top 40 most played in Japan and was number 83 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' albums chart. It has been met with positive critical response, with some critics comparing it to other albums of its genre. There have been two reissues of the album, in 2000 and in 2010. A September 2010 performance of the album by the Buggles, a gig live at the "Ladbroke Grove's Supperclub" in [[Notting Hill, London]], marked the first time the group performed it in its entirety.

In 2016, ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine called ''The Age of Plastic'' the 45th best new wave album of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Josh (8 September 2016).

==Background and production==

[[Geoff Downes]] formed [[The Buggles]] in 1977 in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], South West London with [[Trevor Horn]] and [[Bruce Woolley]].&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; The trio had done rough demos of early compositions such as "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]", "[[Clean, Clean]]", and "[[On TV (song)|On TV]]", a track later included on their second album ''[[Adventures in Modern Recording]]''.&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; Talking about the formation of the Buggles, Downes said about the demos: 
{{quote|“We’d sort out the songs at my place and do all the arrangements together. Later we’d kick the artist out of the studio and spent most of the studio time just doing different things of our own, using every moment to our best advantage. It was a big experience for both of us and after a couple of years of doing that, we had quite a few songs together... It was at that stage that we decided to become artists. We felt that it was about time that somebody started making good, well-produced pop records again. We wanted to give people something more than they already had.”&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt;}}

The Buggles were signed to [[Island Records]], who gave Horn and Downes recording and publishing contracts, and started recording their upcoming first studio album in the first half of 1979.&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ztt.com/artists/the-buggles/|title=The Buggles|publisher=ZTT.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Woolley was originally intended to be the band's lead vocalist,&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt; he left the group during the sessions to form his own band, The Camera Club, who also did versions of "Clean, Clean" and "Video" that appeared on their album ''English Garden''.&lt;ref name = "Zang Tuum Tumb Bio"/&gt; When "Video Killed the Radio Star" was a huge commercial success, they had realized the problem that they had not finished an album's worth of material yet, so they wrote more during the promotion of the single, while in airport lounges, dressing rooms, rehearsal rooms and studios.&lt;ref name = "Trevor Horn bio"&gt;Whitehouse, K.M.

''The Age of Plastic'' had a budget of £60,000.&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt; Hugh Padgham recorded the backing tracks at Virgin's Town House in West London,&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt;&lt;ref name =Guidetoproduction&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Mark|title=Good vibrations: a history of record production|year=1998|publisher=Sanctuary|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to Sarm East's very small size and Horn wanting to record real drums.&lt;ref name =Guidetoproduction/&gt; The Buggles went to London’s Wardour Street to gain the attention of two females to appear on the album.&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt; The mixing and Horn's vocal recording were later done at [[Sarm East Studios]],&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deller, Fred|title=Life With the Buggles|work=[[Smash Hits]]|volume=32|date=21 February 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt; and mixing was finished before Christmas 1979 for a new year's release of the album.&lt;ref name = "Japanese liner notes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The Age of Plastic |others=The Buggles |year=2011 |chapter= |url= |accessdate= |first=Geoff |last=Downes |authorlink= |first2= |last2= |authorlink2= |page= |pages= |type= |publisher= |id=UICY-25077 |location=Japan |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarm East mixer [[Gary Langan]] used a 40-input Trident TSM console to record and mix the album, which was housed inside the same control room as two Studer A80 24-track machines and outboard gear that included an EMT 140 echo plate, Eventide digital delay, Eventide phaser, Marshall Time Modulator, Kepex noise gates, Urei and Orban EQs, and Urei 1176, Dbx 160, and UA LA2 and LA3 compressors.&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt;

The vocals of the album were recorded at Sarm East to a click track using a [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine, and other various machines and boxes synced up the tracks.&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt; As Langan recalls: "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push what we had to the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, as I said, it would influence the next process."&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"/&gt; Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: "We'd make it as clean as we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase."&lt;ref name = "Sound on Sound"&gt;{{cite web|author=Buskin, Richard|date=December 2011|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec11/articles/classic-tracks-1211.htm|title=The Buggles 'Video Killed The Radio Star'|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music development and arrangement==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = "My stuff just sounded weird. I couldn’t make records like Elton John and I hated punk - I thought they were all shit musicians, although I grew to understand it in retrospect. I envied those guys who played with Elton John. They seemed so unassailable. What am I going to ever do that’s going to get close to that? I don’t have a great feel or a great blues voice. Then I heard [[Kraftwerk]]’s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and I thought, that’s it! A mechanised rhythm section, a band where you’re never old-fashioned, where you don’t have to emote. It sounded so new and exciting, so full of potential."

Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records released in the late 1970s, as well as finding it boring, Horn "figured that if I couldn't get records to sound like [[Elton John]], which I couldn't because I couldn't figure out how they did it, then whatever I could do, I'd better exaggerate it." He had also wanted to "perverse things with sound, except that in 1978 and 1979, none of the equipment which would later allow me to do that was available. So I had to pre-date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds."&lt;ref name =Guidetoproduction/&gt; ''[[Audio (magazine)|Audio]]'' noted the album's sound to be reminiscent of duo [[Godley &amp; Creme]]'s debut album ''[[Consequences (Godley &amp; Creme album)|Consequences]]''.&lt;ref name = "Audio"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9UnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=buggles+clean+age+plastic&amp;dq=buggles+clean+age+plastic |title=Audio, Volume 64, Issues 2–6 |publisher=Radio Magazine |page=103|year=1980|date= |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Age of Plastic'' starts with the title track "The Plastic Age," which, according to Downes, is about a person's view of plastic experiences from watching and reading news reports on the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name = "Sydney Morning Herald"/&gt; "Video Killed the Radio Star," the second track, refers to a period of technological change in the 1960s, the desire to remember the past and the disappointment that children of the current generation would not appreciate the past.&lt;ref name = "TimothyWarnerp44"&gt;{{cite book|last= Warner |first= Timothy |title= Pop music: technology and creativity : Trevor Horn and the digital revolution|year= 2003 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn= 978-0-7546-3132-3 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fast-paced third song, "Kid Dynamo," is about the effects of media on a futuristic kid of the 1980s.&lt;ref name = "Sydney Morning Herald"/&gt; "I Love You (Miss Robot)" is the album's fourth track, that Downes said it talks about "being on the road and making love to someone you don't really like, while all the time you're wanting to phone someone who's a long way off."&lt;ref name = "Smash Hits LifewithBuggles"/&gt; Wave Maker Magazine viewed the song as "a darkly soothing, bass guitar-driven ballad which brings us back into cyberpunk country."&lt;ref name = "Wave Maker Mag"/&gt;

In a retrospective review, Jeri Montesano from [[AllMusic]] gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and described it as "a fun record that doesn't need to be taken too seriously". He further said that "it would be difficult to find a record from this era that sounds half as good. Pop rarely reaches these heights."&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt; While reviewing the Buggles' second album, the same author stated that both albums "still sound fresh" compared to 1990s pop music.&lt;ref name = "AllmusicAventures"&gt;Montesano, Jeri.

Volume 31. 7 February 1980. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the 1999 re-release of the album, Vincent L. of ''Krinein Magazine'' praised the entire record because it contains "catchy tracks and joyful melodies".&lt;ref name = "Krinein Magazine"/&gt; [[Napster]]'s Nicholas Baker liked the album's composition and concluded "this LP is not so much a guilty pleasure as an essential point in electropop history."&lt;ref name="Napster"&gt;{{cite web|author=Baker, Nicholas|url=http://www.napster.co.uk/artist/the-buggles/album/the-age-of-plastic-spectrum/track/i-love-you-miss-robot|title=The Age of Plastic: The Buggles|publisher=[[Napster]]|accessdate=28 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224134709/http://www.napster.co.uk/artist/the-buggles/album/the-age-of-plastic-spectrum/track/i-love-you-miss-robot|archivedate=24 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Metro Pulse]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Anthony Nownes found the tunes "punchy, memorable" and "accessible", concluding his review with "If all rock records sounded like this—shiny and slick and highly processed—the world would be terrible.

On the mixed to negative side, Joseph Stannard, in his review for ''Adventures in Modern Recording'', opined ''The Age of Plastic'' "sounds like unfinished business, a series of good ideas in need of elaboration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stannard|first=Joseph|date=6 April 2010|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04035-the-buggles-adventures-in-modern-recording-album-reissue-review|title=The Buggles: Adventures In Modern Recording|work=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Marsh]] and John Swenson, writing for ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'', opined that "aside from the wonderful 'Video Killed the Radio Star' — perhaps the most successful recent example of a single where the production was catchier than the material", the album was "high-tech dreck".&lt;ref name = "Rolling Stone review"&gt;{{cite book | title=The new Rolling stone record guide | publisher=Random House/Rolling Stone Press | author=Dave Marsh, John Swenson| year=1983 | isbn=0394721071|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betty Page from ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' commented that the group "stretches uncomfortably out into the long playing medium like a skein of well-chewed bubblegum."&lt;ref name = "Sounds review"&gt;{{cite web|author=Page, Betty|date=9 February 1980|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/buggles-the-age-of-plastic-island-|title=Buggles: The Age Of Plastic (Island) **|work=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the 1999 reissue of the album, Richard Wallace of ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the record "shows how [The Buggles] pioneered the synth-led nonsense which fused much of the decade's pop, but had little creative imagination.

[[File:TheStoryOfArt.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Story of Art''''', by [[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]], is a survey of the [[art history|history of art]] from ancient times to the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]] (2006), ''The Story of Art'', London: [[Phaidon Press]], 978-0-7148-324-70&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1950 by [[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]], the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the [[visual arts]]. It was originally intended for younger readers. Over seven million copies have been sold, making it the best selling art book of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/17/story-of-art-eh-gombrich Picture perfect.] William Skidelsky, ''[[The Observer]]'', 17 May 2009. theguardian.com Retrieved 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in its 16th edition and has been translated into approximately 30 languages.

==Summary==
The book is divided into an introduction, 27 chapters each dealing with a defined time period of art history within one or several cultural/geographic contexts, and a concluding chapter summarizing the latest developments in visual arts. The first chapter starts examining [[prehistoric art]] and native cultures. The next four chapters are dedicated to the greater ancient cultures, especially Greece and Rome. Starting with chapter 8, Gombrich then begins to focus on Central European art, returning to a more global view in chapter 24 that deals with art of the late 18th and early 19th century in England, France and America. A striking property of ''The Story of Art'' is the amount of illustrations it contains, with more than 50% of the book's pages devoted to color photographs of paintings, drawings, architecture and sculptures. In the preface, Gombrich explains that it has been his intention not to mention any work of art that he could not also include as an illustration.

The first two sentences of the book have become famous: ″There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=E.

Theories of technology attempt to explain the factors that shape technological innovation as well as the impact of technology on society and culture. Most contemporary theories of technology reject two previous views: the [[Linear model of innovation|linear model of technological innovation]] and [[technological determinism]]. To challenge the linear model, today's theories of technology point to the historical evidence that technological innovation often gives rise to new scientific fields, and emphasizes the important role that social networks and cultural values play in shaping technological artifacts. To challenge technological determinism, today's theories of technology emphasize the scope of technical choice, which is greater than most laypeople realize; as science and technology scholars like to say, "It could have been different." For this reason, theorists who take these positions typically argue for greater public involvement in technological decision-making.

== Social theories ==
'Social' theories focus on how humans and technology affect each other. Some theories focus on how decisions are made with humans and technology: humans and technology are equal in the decision, humans drive technology, and vice versa. The interactions used in a majority of the theories on this page look at individual human's interactions with technology, but there is a sub-group for a group of people interacting with technology. The theories described are purposefully vague and ambiguous, since the circumstances for the theories change as human culture and technology innovations change.

=== Descriptive approaches ===

* [[Social construction of technology]] (SCOT) – argues that technology does not determine human action, but that human action shapes technology. Key concepts include:
** '''interpretive flexibility''': "Technological artifacts are culturally constructed and interpreted ... By this we mean not only that there is flexibility in how people think of or interpret artifacts but also that there is flexibility in how artifacts are designed." 
** '''Relevant social group''': shares a particular set of meanings about an artifact
** ''''''Closure''' and stabilization''': when the relevant social group has reached a consensus 
** '''Wider context:''' "the sociocultural and political situation of a social group shapes its norms and values, which in turn influence the meaning given to an artifact" 
: Key authors include MacKenzie and Wajcman (1985).

* [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) –  posits a heterogeneous network of humans and non-humans as equal interrelated actors. It strives for impartiality in the description of human and nonhuman actors and the reintegration of the natural and social worlds. For example, Latour (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1992). Where are the missing masses? The sociology of a few mundane artifacts. In Bijker, W. and Law, J., editors, Shaping Technology/Building Society. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA&lt;/ref&gt; argues that instead of worrying whether we are anthropomorphizing technology, we should embrace it as inherently anthropomorphic: technology is made by humans, substitutes for the actions of humans, and shapes human action. What is important is the chain and gradients of actors' actions and competences, and the degree to which we choose to have figurative representations. Key concepts include the '''inscription''' of beliefs, practices, relations into technology, which is then said to '''embody''' them. Key authors include [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. (1997). On Actor Network Theory: a few clarifications&lt;/ref&gt; and Callon (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Callon, M. (1999). Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of Saint Brieuc Bay. In Biagioli, M., editor, The Science Studies Reader, pages 67–83. Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[Structuration theory]] – defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems. The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action. Consequently, in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact, but instead examines how people, as they interact with a technology in their ongoing practices,enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology. Key authors include DeSanctis and Poole (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Desanctis, G. and Poole, M. S. (1994). Capturing the complexity in advanced technology use: adaptive structuration theory. Organization Science, 5(2):121-147&lt;/ref&gt;, and Orlikowski (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Systems theory]] – considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity, stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social, economic, political and cultural factors surrounding it. Key concepts include [[reverse salient]]s when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others, differentiation, [[operational closure]], and [[autopoietic autonomy]]. Key authors include [[Thomas P. Hughes]] (1992) and [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]] (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (2000). The reality of the mass media. Stanford, Stanford, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Activity theory]] - considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality—it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or activity system.

=== Critical approaches ===

[[Critical theory]] goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are, to examine why they have come to be that way, and how they might otherwise be. Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the [[status quo]] and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice. According to Geuss's&lt;ref&gt;Geuss, R. (1981) The Idea of a Critical Theory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; definition, "a critical theory, then, is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation' (1964). Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices in fact they manifest political or moral values. Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common-sense understandings in order to  reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use. 
 
Perhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of [[Andrew Feenberg]] including 'Transforming Technology' (2002).

* Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values (alongside technical standards such as speed, efficiency, and reliability) as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media. How do values such as privacy, autonomy, democracy, and social justice become integral to conception, design, and development, not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include [[Helen Nissenbaum]] (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Nissenbaum, H. (2001). How computer systems embody values. Computer, 34(3):120-118.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Group Theories ===
There are also a number of technology related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) are concerned with questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) are concerned with the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).

* [[Social presence theory]] (Short, et al., 1976&lt;ref&gt;Short, J. A., Williams, E., and Christie, B. (1976). The social psychology of telecommunications. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology. Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing (the research was sponsored by the British Post Office, now British Telecom). It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the ''social presence'' it allows communicators to have. Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself: the degree of acoustic, visual, and physical contact that it allows. The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of "presence": greater intimacy, immediacy, warmth and inter-personal rapport. As a consequence of social presence, social influence is expected to increase. In the case of communication technology, the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction (e-mail, instant messaging) are less social, and therefore less conducive to social influence.
* [[Media richness theory]] (Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Daft, R. L. and Lengel, R. H. (1986). Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design. Management Science, 32(5):554-571&lt;/ref&gt; shares some characteristics with social presence theory. It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's ''richness''. The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication. Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time (with "rich" media carrying more information), they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well. The more restricted the medium's capacity, the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage. It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication.
* [[Media naturalness theory]] (Kock, 2001; 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2001). The ape that used email: Understanding e-communication behavior through evolution theory. Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 5(3), 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2004). The psychobiological model: Towards a new theory of computer-mediated communication based on Darwinian evolution. Organization Science, 15(3), 327-348.&lt;/ref&gt; builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory. Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face, evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication. Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction. Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication, as many electronic communication media do, thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication. This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks (e.g., business process redesign, new product development, online learning), because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks.
* Media synchronicity theory (MST, Dennis &amp; Valacich, 1999) redirects richness theory towards the ''synchronicity'' of the communication.
* The [[social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE)]] (Postmes, Spears and Lea 1999&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., and Lea, M. (1999). Social identity, group norms, and deindividuation: Lessons from computer-mediated communication for social influence in the group. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, B. D., editor, Social Identity: Context, Commitment, Content. Blackwell., Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;; Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Reicher, S., Spears, R., &amp; Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. In W. Stroebe &amp; M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp. 161–198). Chichester: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;;Spears &amp; Lea, 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 21, 427-459.&lt;/ref&gt;) was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished (or "deindividuated"). It provided an alternative explanation for these "[[deindividuation]] effects" based on theories of social identity (e.g., Turner et al., 1987&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory. Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;). The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology. Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make "salient" particular aspects of personal or social identity. For example, certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them (i.e., that convey aspects of their personal identity) and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity. The strategic effects are due to the possibilities, afforded by communication technology, to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity, and disguise others. SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining, and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two.
* Time, interaction, and performance (TIP; McGrath, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, J.E. (1991). Time, interaction, and performance (tip): A theory of groups. small group research. 22(2):147-174.&lt;/ref&gt; theory describes work groups as time-based, multi-modal, and multi-functional social systems. Groups interact in one of the modes of inception, problem solving, conflict resolution, and execution. The three functions of a group are production (towards a goal), support (affective) and well-being (norms and roles).

=== Other Stances ===
Additionally, many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories. For example, [[Steve Woolgar]] (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, S. (1991). The turn to technology in social studies of science. Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 16(1):20-50.&lt;/ref&gt; considers ''technology as text'' in order to critique the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion: the instrumental response (interpretive flexibility), the interpretivist response (environmental/organizational influences), the reflexive response (a double hermeneutic). Pfaffenberger (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Pfaffenberger, B. (1992). Technological dramas. Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 17(3):282-312.&lt;/ref&gt; treats ''technology as drama'' to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power. A technological drama is a discourse of technological "statements" and "counterstatements" within the processes of technological regularization, adjustment, and reconstitution.

An important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by [[Bernard Stiegler]]&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler, B. (1998). Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including [[Gilbert Simondon]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]].
In the Schumpeterian and Neo-Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of [[economic growth]] ([[Carlota Perez]])&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Carlota (2009).Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms. Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20. (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Analytic theories ==

Finally, there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent, but are used by authors in describing existing literature, in contrast to their own or as a review of the field.

For example, Markus and Robey (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Markus, M. and Robey, D. (1988). Information technology and organizational change: causal structure in theory and research. Management Science, 34:583-598.&lt;/ref&gt; propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency (technological, organizational, imperative, emergent), its structure (variance, process), and the level (micro, macro) of analysis.

Orlikowski (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope (is technology more than hardware?) and role (is it an external objective force, the interpreted human action, or an impact moderated by humans?) and identifies three models:
# '''Technological imperative:''' focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency
# '''Strategic choice:''' focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users
# '''Technology as a trigger of structural change:''' views technology as a social object

[[Gerardine DeSanctis|DeSanctis]] and Poole (1994) similarly write of three views of technology's effects: 
# '''Decision-making:''' the view of engineers associated with positivist, rational, systems rationalization, and deterministic approaches
# '''Institutional school:''' technology is an opportunity for change, focuses on social evolution, social construction of meaning, interaction and historical processes, interpretive flexibility, and an interplay between technology and power
# '''An integrated perspective (social technology):''' soft-line determinism, with joint social and technological optimization, structural symbolic interaction theory

Bimber (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Bimber, B. (1998). Three faces of technological determinism. In Smith, M. and Marx, L., editors, Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism, pages 79–100. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the:
# '''Normative:''' an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it (e.g., the industrialization of society)
# '''Nomological:''' a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature (e.g., steam mill had to follow the hand mill). 
# '''''[[Unintended consequence]]s:''''' a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent (e.g., a car is faster than a horse, but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16903">'''Urban metabolism''' is a [[scientific modelling|model]] to facilitate the description and analysis of the [[material flow|flows of the materials]] and [[energy transfer|energy]] within [[cities]], such as undertaken in a [[material flow analysis]] of a city. It provides researchers with a metaphorical framework to study the interactions of natural and human systems in specific regions.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"&gt;Pincetl, S., Bunje, P., &amp; Holmes, T. (2012). An expanded urban metabolism method: Toward a systems approach for assessing urban energy processes and causes. Landscape and Urban Planning, 193-202.&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, researchers have tweaked and altered the parameters of the urban metabolism model. C. Kennedy and fellow researchers have produced a clear definition in the 2007 paper ''The Changing Metabolism of Cities'' claiming that urban metabolism is "the sum total of the technical and socio-economic process that occur in cities, resulting in growth, production of energy and elimination of waste."&lt;ref name= "kennedy1"&gt;Kennedy, C., Cuddihy, J., &amp; Engel-Yan, J. (2007). The changing metabolism of cities. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 11(2), 43-59.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing concern of [[climate change]] and [[atmospheric degradation]], the use of the urban metabolism model has become a key element in determining and maintaining levels of [[sustainability]]  and health in cities around the world. Urban metabolism provides a unified or [[holistic]] viewpoint to encompass all of the activities of a city in a single model.

==History==

With deep roots in [[sociology]], [[Karl Marx]] and fellow researcher [[Friedrich Engels]] may have been the first to raise concerns around issues which we would now call urban metabolism.  Marx and Engels concentrated on the social organization of the harvesting of the Earth's materials by “ analysing the dynamic internal relationships between humans and nature.”&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; Marx used the metaphor of metabolism to refer to the actual metabolic interactions that take place through humans’ exertion of physical labour to cultivate the Earth for sustenance and shelter (M. Fischer-Kowalski, 1998). In short, Marx and Engels found that when humans exerted such physical labour they ultimately altered the biophysical processes as well. This acknowledgement of altering the biophysical landscape is the first stepping stone for the creation of urban metabolism within [[social geography]]. They also used metabolism to describe the material and energy exchange between nature and society in as a critique of industrialization (1883)which created an interdependent set of societal needs brought into play through the concrete organization of human labour. Marx advocated that urban metabolism becomes a power in itself (like capitalism), and will control society unless society is able to control it.

Later, in reaction against industrialization and coal use, [[Patrick Geddes|Sir Patrick Geddes]], a Scottish biologist, undertook an ecological critique of urbanization in 1885, making him the first scientist to attempt an [[empirical]] description of societal metabolism on a macroeconomic scale.&lt;ref name= "mcdonald"&gt;McDonald, G. W., &amp; Patterson, M. G. (2007). Bridging the divide in urban sustainability: From human exemptionalism to the new ecological paradigm.Urban Ecosyst, 10, 169-192&lt;/ref&gt; Through his experimental study of [[urbanization]] he established a physical budget for urban energy and material throughput by way of an input output table.&lt;ref name= "fischer"&gt;Fischer-Kowalski, M. (1998). Society’s metabolism the intellectual history of materials flow analysis, part I, I 860- I 970. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 2(1), 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

:“Geddes’ table consisted of the sources of energy and materials transformed into products in three stages: (1) extraction of fuels and raw materials; (2) the manufacture and transport; and (3) exchange. The table also included intermediary products used for manufacture or transport of the final products; calculation of energy losses between each of the three stages; and the resultant final product; which was often surprisingly small, in material terms, compared with its overall material inputs.”&lt;ref name= "mcdonald"/&gt;

It wasn't until 1965 when [[Abel Wolman]] fully developed and used the term urban metabolism in his work, “The Metabolism of Cities” which he developed in response to deteriorating air and water qualities in American cities.&lt;ref name= "kennedy1"/&gt; In this study Wolman developed a model which allowed him to determine the inflow and outflow rates of a hypothetical American City with a population of 1 million people. &lt;ref =name “deck”&gt;Decker, E., Elliot, S., Smith, F., Blake, D., &amp; Rowland, F. S. (2000). Energy and material flow through the urban ecosystem. Energy Environment, 25, 685-740.&lt;/ref&gt; The model allows the monitoring and documentation of natural resources used (mainly water) and the consequential creation and out-put of waste.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"&gt;Kennedy, C., Pincetl, S., &amp; Bunje, P. (2011). The study of urban metabolism and its applications to urban planning and design. Environmental Pollution,159, 1965-1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolman’s study highlighted the fact that there are physical limitations to the natural resources we use on a day-to-day basis and with frequent use, the compilation of waste can and will create problems. It also helped focus researchers and professionals of their time to focus their attention on the system wide impacts of consumption of goods and sequential production of waste within the urban environment.&lt;ref name= "d"&gt;Wachsmuth, D. (2012). Three ecologies: Urban metabolism and the society-nature opposition. The Sociological Quarterly, (53), 506-523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working off of Wolman’s pioneering work in the 60’s, environmentalist [[Herbert Girardet]] (1996) began to see and document his findings in the connection between urban metabolism and sustainable cities.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Girardet laid the foundation for the [[industrial ecology]] approach to urban metabolism in which it is seen as the “conversion of nature into society.”&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt; Aside from being a great advocate and populariser for urban metabolism, Girardet significantly coined and drew the difference between a ‘circular’ and ‘linear’ metabolism.&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt;  In a circular cycle, there is nearly no waste and almost everything is re-used. Girardet characterizes this as a natural world process.  On the other hand, a ‘linear’ metabolism which is characterized as an urban world process has a clear resource in-put and waste out-put. Girardet emphasizes that the accelerated use of linear metabolisms in urban environments is creating an impending global crisis as cities grow.

More recently the metabolism frame of reference has been used in the reporting of environmental information in Australia where researchers such as Newman have begun to link urban metabolic measures to and it has been suggested that it can be used to define the sustainability of a city within the ecosystems capacity that can support it.&lt;ref name= "newman"&gt;Newman, P. (1999). Sustainability and cities: Extending the metabolism model. Landscape and Urban Planning, (44), 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt;  This research has stayed mainly at a descriptive level and did not reach into the political or social forces of urban form and stages of flow.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; From this research there has been a strong theme in present literature on urban sustainability is that of the need to view the urban system as a whole if we are to best understand and solve the complex problems.&lt;ref name= "deck"&gt;Decker, E., Elliot, S., Smith, F., Blake, D., &amp; Rowland, F. S. (2000). Energy and material flow through the urban ecosystem. Energy Environment, 25, 685-740.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two main schools of approach==

===The energy method===
[[File:Energy Systems Symbols H.gif|thumbnail]]
{{Main article|Emergy}}

Developed in 1970’s [[Howard T. Odum]], a [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]], wanted to emphasize the dependence on the source of almost all energy on the planet: the sun.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Odum believed that previous research and development on urban metabolism was missing and did not account for qualitative differences of [[mass]] or [[energy transfer|energy flows]]. Odum’s study took this into count and he coined the term "energy" to track and account for the metabolic flows by measuring the [[solar energy]] used directly or indirectly to make a product or deliver a service. This method also emphasizes the use of a standard unit of measurement to calculate energy, nutrient and waste movement in the biophysical system; the unit chosen was "solar energy joules". At first glance, the notion to use standard units seems like a beneficial idea for calculating and comparing figures; in reality the ability to convert all urban processes into solar energy joules has proven to be a difficult feat, and difficult to understand.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt;

=== Material flow analysis ===

Currently, the Urban Metabolism (UM) approach, as deducted from international literature, has been applied several times to assess and describe urban flows and impacts related to them, using different tools such as Material Flow Analysis (MFA) (Ioppolo et al., 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo, Giuseppe; Reinout Heijungs, Stefano Cucurachi, Roberta Salomone, and René Kleijn, 2014. Urban Metabolism: Many Open Questions for Future Answers. Pp 23-32 in ''Pathways to Environmental Sustainability'', eds. Roberta Salomone and Giuseppe Saija. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The MFA, researched by Baccinni and Brunner in the 1990s, "measures the materials flowing into a system, the stocks and flows within it, and the resulting outputs from the system to other systems in the form of pollution, waste, or exports."&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; Much like Wolmans case model for a hypothetical American City, this method  is based on the concept that the mass of the resources used will equal the mass "plus" stock changes out.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; The MFA technique has become the mainstream school of urban metabolism because it uses more practical units that the public, workers, government officials and researchers can understand.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt;

== Applications ==
There are four main uses of urban metabolism that are used today by urban planners and designers; sustainability reporting, urban [[greenhouse gas accounting]], mathematical modelling for policy analysis and urban design.

===Sustainability indicators===
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumbnail]]

With the issue of sustainability at the core of many environmental issues today, one of the main uses of Urban Metabolism in the modern era is to track and record levels of sustainability in cities and regions around the world. Urban metabolism collects important and very useful information about [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[material cycling]], [[waste management]] and [[urban infrastructure|infrastructure]] in urban environments. The urban metabolism model records and analyzes environmental conditions and trends which are easily understood for policy makers and consequently comparable over time&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; making it easier to find unhealthy patterns and develop a plan of action to better the level of sustainability.

===Greenhouse gas accounting===
[[File:Greenhouse Effect.svg|thumbnail]]

Staying in line with the notion of sustainability, urban metabolism is also a helpful tool for tracking [[greenhouse gas]] emissions on a city or regional level. As mentioned above, with the proliferation of linear metabolisms such as cars, the production of greenhouse gases has increased exponentially since the birth and mass production of the automobile causing a problem for our atmosphere.&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt; Urban metabolism has been proven to be a necessary tool for measuring levels of greenhouse gas because it is an out-put or waste product that is produced through human consumption. The model provides quantifiable parameters which allow officials to mark unhealthy levels of GHG emissions and again, develop a plan of action to lower them.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt;

===Mathematical models===

Aside from the two accounting applications above, urban metabolism has begun to develop mathematical models to quantify and predict levels of particles and nutrients within the urban metabolism model. Such models have mostly been created and used by MFA scholars and are helpful in determining present and future sub-processes and material stocks and flows within the urban environment &lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; With the ability to predict future levels, these mathematical models allow progress to be made and possible pollution prevention programs to be instated rather than end-of-the-pipe solutions which have been favoured in the past.&lt;ref name= "ep"&gt;Cleaner production versus end-of-pipe. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.centric.at/services/cleaner-production/cleaner-production-versus-end-of-pipe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design tools===

Through utilization of the 3 applications above, scholars and professionals are able to use urban metabolism as a design tool to create greener and more sustainable infrastructure from the beginning. By tracing flows of energy, materials and waste through urban systems as a whole, changes and alterations can be made to close the loops to create circular metabolisms where resources are recycled and almost no waste is produced.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Such initiatives are being made around the world with technology and inventions which make building green that much easier and accessible.

:Uses of the model are however not restricted to strictly functional analysis, as the model has been adapted to examine the relational aspects of urban relationships between infrastructure and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Gandy, M. (2004). ''Rethinking urban metabolism: Water, space and the modern city. City'', http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/people/academics/matthew-gandy/files/pdf2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[novel]], [[theatrical]] [[Play (theatre)|script]], [[screenplay]], [[sketch story|sketch stories]], and [[poetry]], a '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}}) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca/2010/02/top-10-interwoven-vignettes.html|title=100 Movies, 100 Theaters: Top 10 Interwoven Vignettes|website=100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vignette|title=vignette Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blog]] or [[web series]] can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/vignette-in-literature.html | title=Vignette in Literature | publisher=[[Blogspot]] |work=[writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/ Writing in Wonderland] | date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series ''[[High Maintenance (TV series)|High Maintenance]]'', which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance|title=High Maintenance|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/11/12/high-maintenance-vimeo/23089/|title=Five must-reads celebrating the return of series ‘High Maintenance’|last=Baca|first=Ricardo|last2=Staff|first2=The Cannabist|website=The Cannabist|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363288754/despite-the-dope-high-maintenance-is-about-more-than-potheads|title=Despite The Dope, 'High Maintenance' Is About More Than Potheads|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/11/11/vimeo-original-programming-high-maintenance/#4008c623f269|title=Vimeo Takes A Bet On 'High Maintenance' As Its First Original Series|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as ''[[The House On Mango Street]]'', by [[Sandra Cisneros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/House-Mango-Street-Sandra-Cisneros/dp/0679734775|title=The House on Mango Street|last=Cisneros|first=Sandra|date=1991-04-03|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679734772|edition=Reissue|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The word ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' means "little vine" in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vignette|title=Definition of VIGNETTE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
