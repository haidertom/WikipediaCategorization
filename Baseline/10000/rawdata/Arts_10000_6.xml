'''''A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts''''', also known as '''''Lorenzo Tornabuoni Presented by Grammar to Prudentia and the other Liberal Arts''''' or '''''Lorenzo Tornabuoni Being Introduced to the Liberal Arts''''' ({{lang-it|Giovane Introdotto tra le Arti Liberali}}), is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] painter [[Sandro Botticelli]], circa 1483-1486. The painting and its companion piece, [[Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman (Botticelli)|''Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman'']], originally decorated Villa Lemmi, a country villa near [[Florence]] owned by [[Giovanni Tornabuoni]], uncle of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] and head of the Roman branch of the [[Medici]] Bank. They were probably commissioned for the 1486 wedding of Giovanni's son Lorenzo to Giovanna of the [[Albizzi]] family, and are therefore thought to depict the two.&lt;ref name=deimlink&gt;{{cite book|title=Sandro Botticelli 1444/5 - 1510|last=Deimling|first=Barbara|publisher=Taschen|location=Cologne, Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjHEhT5wRiwC|year=2007|isbn=978-3-8228-5992-6|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts'' depicts a young man, perhaps Lorenzo Tornabuoni, led by a personification of [[Grammar]] into a circle of allegorical figures representing the [[Seven Liberal Arts]]. Presided over by [[Prudence|Prudentia]], the circle also includes [[Rhetoric]], [[Logic]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Astronomy]] and [[Music]], each recognizable by means of various attributes. In antiquity, the liberal arts denoted the education worthy of a free person and the painting therefore testifies to the young man's broad education. The figure of Arithmetic is seen holding its hand out in greeting to the young man. Tornabuoni, a scion to a banking family, would have probably had an education focused on numbers.&lt;ref name=deimlink/&gt;

Both paintings were discovered at Villa Lemmi in 1873 under a coat of whitewash and removed from their original location. They are currently housed in the [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/activite/detail_parcours.jsp?CURRENT_LLV_PARCOURS%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226925&amp;CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226882&amp;CURRENT_LLV_CHEMINEMENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226882&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302024407&amp;bmLocale=en |title=Thematic Trails : Italian Renaissance Painting - The Allegory of the Liberal Arts |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |publisher=Louvre }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''[[Agony in the Garden]]''''' is an early painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Giovanni Bellini]], who painted it around 1459–65. It is in the [[National Gallery, London]].

It portrays Christ kneeling on the [[Mount of Olives]] in prayer, with his disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[St. John the Evangelist|John]] sleeping near to him. A Judas in the background leads the Roman soldiers to capture Christ.

The picture is closely related to the similar work by Bellini's brother-in-law, [[Andrea Mantegna]], also in the National Gallery. It is likely that both derived from a drawing by Bellini's father, [[Jacopo Bellini|Jacopo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng726 National Gallery website]&lt;/ref&gt; In Bellini's version, the treatment of dawn light has a more important role in giving the scene a quasi-unearthly atmosphere.

Until the mid-19th century Early Renaissance paintings were regarded as curiosities by most collectors. This one had probably belonged to [[Joseph Smith (1682–1770)|Consul Smith]] in [[Venice]] (d. 1770), was bought by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]] at the [[Joshua Reynolds]] sale in 1795 for £5, then sold in 1823 with [[Fonthill Abbey]] and repurchased by Beckford at the Fonthill Sale the next year (as a [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]) for £52.10s.  It was bought by the [[National Gallery]] for £630 in 1863, still a low price for the day.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, I, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

'''András Szántó''' (b. Jan. 1, 1964, Budapest)  is a writer, researcher, and consultant in the fields of art, media, cultural policy, arts sponsorship, and philanthropy, based in New York.

==Life and work==

After a childhood and early youth spent in Budapest and London, Szántó attended the Budapest University of Economics (now [[Corvinus University]]), and, in 1988, moved to New York for graduate studies in sociology. At [[Columbia University]], as a [http://pfl-css.columbia.edu/programs/lazarsfeld-fellowship-program.html Lazarsfeld Fellow], his research interests turned to the social and commercial ramifications of the visual arts. He completed his Ph.D. dissertation in 1996 on New York art galleries and the transformation of the art world in the 1980s, working closely with [[Arthur Danto]], the Columbia philosopher and art critic.

While in graduate school, Szántó worked as a research analyst at the Media Studies Center at Columbia. In the years 1997-2005, he was deputy directory and director of the [http://www.najp.org/%20 National Arts Journalism Program] at [http://www.journalism.columbia.edu Columbia ‘s Graduate School of Journalism], in association with the [http://arts.columbia.edu School of the Arts]. In 2005-10 he directed, also at Columbia, the NEA Arts Journalism Institute in Classical Music and Opera. Other appointments have included: research affiliate of the Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies at [[Princeton University]], visiting critic at the [[American Academy in Rome]], and senior visiting fellow at the [http://www.artsusa.org/information_services/research/cultural_policy_listserv/default.asp%20in%20Washington,%20DC Center for Arts and Culture in Washington, DC]. He is the Moderator of the [http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/news/2013/global-museum-leaders-colloquium Global Museum Leaders Colloquium] at the [http://www.metmuseum.org/ Metropolitan Museum of Art] In New York.

At Columbia, Szántó organized a [http://www.najp.org/events/conferences series of conferences] on a wide range of arts topics. Since 2008, he has moderated discussions of global museum leaders at [[Art Basel]] and [[Art Basel Miami Beach]], the [http://www.artdubai.ae/globalartforum Global Art Forum in Dubai], and other events. He was the curator of the September 2012 [http://artindustryforum.com International Art Industry Forum in Vienna], Austria. Szántó has taught courses on sociology at Columbia and [[Barnard College]], and on art business and marketing at the [http://www.sothebysinstitute.com/programmes/PNewyork.aspx Sotheby’s Institute of Art], New York. His principal professional focus is consulting and strategic advisory work with museums, foundations, cultural organizations, and corporations.

==Writing, Journalism, and Commentary==

Much of Szántó’s writing examines arts and cultural institutions, in particular the dynamics of the contemporary art world and art market.

The '''Antequera Dolmens Site''' is a cultural heritage ensemble comprising 3 cultural monuments &lt;ref&gt;''Decree 25/2009 of 27 January, which is enroll into the General Catalogue of Andalusian Historical Heritage as an Heritage of Cultural Interest, with the typology of Archaeological Zone, the archaeological area of the dolmens of Antequera (province of Málaga).'' [http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2009/33/32 BOJA 18.02.09]&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Dolmen of Menga]], [[Dolmen de Viera|Dolmen of Viera]] and [[Tholos de El Romeral|Tholos of El Romeral]]) and 2 natural mountain features (the [[Peña de los Enamorados]] and [[El Torcal de Antequera|El Torcal]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2014/8/14 Decree 222/2013, of November 5, declare  the Special Areas of Conservation Torcal de Antequera (ES0000032), Los Reales de Sierra Bermeja (ES6170004), Sierra Crestellina (ES6170005) and Desfiladero de los Gaitanes (ES6170003), expands the territorial scope of the Natural Park Torcal de Antequera and approves the Plan of Management of Natural Resources of the Natural Tourist Sites Torcal de Antequera, Los Reales de Sierra Bermeja, Sierra Crestellina and Desfiladero de los Gaitanes.]''&lt;/ref&gt;) in and near the city of [[Antequera]] in [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]. The cultural institution responsible for its protection is the [[Archeological Ensemble Dolmens of Antequera|CADA]] ({{ill|Conjunto Arqueológico Dólmenes de Antequera|es}}, Archeological Ensemble Dolmens of Antequera). It was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2016.

==Outstanding Universal Value==
For something to be declared World Heritage Site, it must demonstrate exceptional universal value; that is, an extraordinary importance transcending national borders and of interest to present and future generations of all humanity.

[[UNESCO]] requires justification of at least one of the six criteria set for the cultural heritage by the ''Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'' (1972) to demonstrate the exceptional universal value of the site. The proposal of the Antequera Dolmens Site is based on one of them (i); the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] in its final report incorporates other two (iii, iv).

* Criterion (i): "represent a masterpiece of the human creative genius"

The [[Neolithic]] Dolmen of Menga represents one of the most important masterpiece of [[Megalith|megalithic]] architecture (Atlantic tradition) based on [[Post and lintel|post-and-lintel]] construction with an earthen covering, notable for its enormous dimensions that push the size possible in a corridor sepulcher by incorporating the unprecedented solution of intermediate pillars; likewise, the later, [[Chalcolithic]] [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] (beehive tomb) of El Romeral complements the two dolmens with its corridor and false dome of [[Dry stone|drystone masonry]] (Mediterranean tradition).

* Criterion (iii): "provide a unique testimony, or at least exceptional, on a cultural tradition or a living or dead civilization"

Both the Dolmen of Menga and the Tholos of El Romeral have anomalous orientations. The [[Archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomer]] Michael Hoskin, who studied the site, noted that, whereas the axes of almost all [[dolmen]]s around the Mediterranean are oriented to a celestial feature, such as sunrise at dawn on the [[equinox]]es (as occurs in the [[Dolmen de Viera|Dolmen of Viera]]), the [[Dolmen of Menga]] points to the striking nearby peak called the [[Peña de los Enamorados]]. This rises abruptly from the plain and contains the contemporaneous [[rock shelter of Matacabras]], in which cave paintings are found.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2011/150/23 Decree 245/2011 of 12 July, which is enroll into the General Catalogue of the Andalusian Historical Heritage as Bien de Interés Cultural, with the typology of archaeological site, the Archaeological site of Peña de los Enamorados, in the municipality of Antequera (Andalusia). BOJA nº150 de 02/08/2011]''&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Tholos of El Romeral is oriented to the mountains of [[El Torcal de Antequera|El Torcal]], containing the [[Cave del Toro|Cave of the Bull]] (terrestrial orientation), as well as to the noon sun on the winter [[solstice]] (celestial orientation). El Torcal is noted for the extensive, otherworldly [[karst]] landscape at its summit. In addition, the Tholos of El Romeral lies along an axis from the Dolmen of Menga to the Peña de los Enamorados. Thus, the Dolmens of Antequera construct a unique megalithic landscape by their relationship with the surrounding natural elements.

* Criterion (iv): "be an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates one or several significant periods of human history"

The three megalithic monuments reflect a stage of human history in which the first ceremonial monuments in [[Western Europe]] were built, according to the two major building traditions of [[megalithic art]] ([[lintel]] and [[Beehive tomb|beehive]]). This is an unusual proposal on the List of World Heritage Sites as it is not being put forward as a mixed heritage site, in which its cultural value would be added to its natural value, but as an integration and close dialogue between the megalithic architecture and the [[landscape]]. A phenomenon of "landscape monumentalization" has occurred here by which the natural landmarks acquire the value of monuments while the manmade constructs present the appearance of a natural landscape.

Finally, the authenticity of the megaliths is well established, with the [[Dolmen of Menga]] dating to the [[Neolithic]] and the Tholos of El Romeral to the [[Chalcolithic]], and the structures retain high integrity, being in good condition and well maintained.

'''The Arts Council of Princeton''' was established in 1967, by Bill Selden, in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. Selden was also the first President of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://princetoninfo.com/index.php/component/us1more/?Itemid=6&amp;key=11-23-16laird New Director Named at Arts Council] Retrieved on 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2016/11/princeton_group_hosts_day_of_the_dead_celebration.html Princeton arts council hosts Day of the Dead celebration] Retrieved on 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1982, Anne Reeves, then President of Arts Council of Princeton, entered into an agreement with the [[Borough (New Jersey)|Borough of New Jersey]] for the occupation of 102 Witherspoon Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Richard D.|title=Legendary Locals of Princeton|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|date=2014|page=110|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QvNYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110}} Retrieved on 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1997, the Arts Council of Princeton purchased its facility at 102 Witherspoon Street from the [[Borough of Princeton]]. [[Michael Graves]], an American [[architect]] and native to Princeton, designed the renovated building and agreed to donate his design to the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://towntopics.com/jun1505/story1.html Arts Council Breaks New Ground By Matthew Hersh] Retrieved on 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sculpture.org/calendar/event/the-arts-council-of-princeton-announces-annual-fall-open-house/ The Arts Council of Princeton Announces Annual Fall Open House] Retrieved on 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
Anne Reeves announced her retirement in 2005 and assumed the role as ''Founding Director''. She served as Executive Director since the founding of the Council. The Board of Trustees hired current Executive Director, Jeff Nathanson, in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centraljersey.com/news/princeton-margaret-johnson-s-where-artwork-now-there-in-the/article_869b658a-a466-11e6-aaae-4ba0771bbb3c.html PRINCETON: Margaret Johnson's 'Where' artwork now there in the municipal building] Retrieved on 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the board announced it had appointed Taneshia Nash Laird to succeed Nathanson who announced his intent to retire in June 2016.

'''Beanie Babies''' are a line of [[Stuffed toy|stuffed animal]] plush toys created by [[Ty Warner]], who founded [[Ty Inc.]]. The toys are stuffed with plastic pellets ("beans") rather than conventional soft stuffing ([[polyvinylchloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene|PE]]), giving Beanie Babies a flexible feel. In an interview Warner said, "The whole idea was it looked real because it moved."&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;  

During the later half of the 1990s, the toy emerged as a major [[fad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chupka|first1=Kevin|title=Beanie Babies: Whatever happened to Millennials' favorite toy?|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beanie-babies--whatever-happened-to-millennials--favorite-toy-213059948.html|website=Yahoo!

==History==
Nine original Beanie Babies were launched in 1993: Legs the Frog, Squealer the Pig, Spot the Dog, Flash the Orca, Splash the Whale, Chocolate the Moose, Patti the Platypus, Brownie the Bear (later renamed "Cubbie"), and Pinchers the Lobster (with some tag errors with "Punchers").  They were not in factory production until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Those Beanies are still hot, and there's no sign of the frenze slowing down | first = Amy | last = Carr | date = August 14, 1997 | publisher = [[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] | quote = Punchers the red lobster.

In 1996, Ty Inc. released a new product called [[Teenie Beanies]], a miniature offshoot of the original Beanie Babies line. They were sold alongside [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]]s to celebrate that product's 17th anniversary.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;

Ty, Inc. stopped producing the product in December 1999, but consumer demand led them to reconsider.&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Bryan|title=Behind the Beanie Babies: The Secret Life of Ty Warner|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/May-2014/Ty-Warner/|accessdate=April 26, 2014|newspaper=Chicago Magazine|date=May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425221214/http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/May-2014/Ty-Warner/|archivedate=April 25, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production restarted in 2000 with a Beanie Baby named "The Beginning."

In early 2008, Ty released a new version of Beanie Babies called [[Beanie Babies 2.0]]. The purchase of a Beanie Baby 2.0 provided its owner with a code to access an online Beanie Babies interactive website.  The website has since been shut down.

By 2017, Beanie Baby incarnations of characters from ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]'' were available.&lt;ref&gt;https://store.ty.com/newtys/tyshop_items_preview.cfm?ITEM_NO=MLTPONY&amp;kitflag=Y&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Beanie Babies are deliberately under stuffed. This led to a criticism that the toys looked "cheap";&lt;ref name="threelessons"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Symington|first1=Steve|title=3 Business Lessons From Ty Warner, the Beanie Babies Billionaire|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/06/07/3-business-lessons-from-ty-warner-the-beanie-babie.aspx|website=Motleyfool|accessdate=2 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313130101/http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/06/07/3-business-lessons-from-ty-warner-the-beanie-babie.aspx|archivedate=13 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this set them apart from most stuffed animals on the market which could not be posed easily.&lt;ref name="threelessons"/&gt; Ty Warner has said that this understuffing method made the toys look "real".&lt;ref name="threelessons"/&gt;

Another important design element is the tag. Since the beginning, Beanie Babies have included two tags for identification: a heart-shaped "swing tag" at the top, and a fabric "tush tag" at the bottom. Both tags have been redesigned completely over time. Between 1994 and 1996, the swing tags had "To" and "From" blanks in them for use as gifts. Starting in early 1996, the tags include four-line poems related to the Beanie Baby, and a date of birth for the toy.  The poem and birthday concept was created by [[Lina Trivedi]] who is credited as authoring the poems on the first 136 Beanie Babies that were introduced to the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolkoff|first=Melanie|date=December 2000|title=The Girl With The Midas Touch, What Lina Trivedi Touches Turns to Gold – Just Ask Ty Warner|journal=[[Mary Beth's Bean Bag World]]|publisher=H&amp;S Media Incorporated|volume=4|issue=3|pages=56–59|issn=1520-7005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van West|first=Patricia E.|date=September 1999|title=Lina Trivedi – The First Beanie Poet &amp; Webmaster|journal=Becky and Becky's Beanie Mania|publisher=Beanie Mania LLC|volume=2|issue=1|pages=42–43|issn=1099-4874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TyWarnerBillionaire" /&gt;

It was not uncommon for Beanie Babies to be accidentally shipped out with incorrect or misspelled tags, which sometimes increased the toy's value. On occasion, the poems, birth dates and even the names have been changed on certain Beanie Babies.&lt;ref name="tag"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Claudia|author2=Sara Nelson|date=September 1998|title=Tag Training 101|journal=[[Mary Beth's Bean Bag World]]|publisher=H&amp;S Media Incorporated|volume=1|issue=7|pages=20–28|issn=1097-0444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectibility==
Beanie Babies began to emerge as popular [[Collecting|collectibles]] in late 1995, and became a [[fad|hot toy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aboutbeanies.com/news/1996/article.cgi?article=1996_05_31_Beanie_Babies_Take_Their_Place_In_Must_Have_Spotlight.txt |title=Ty Beanie Baby Beanies News |publisher=Aboutbeanies.com |accessdate=2012-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524065942/http://www.aboutbeanies.com/news/1996/article.cgi?article=1996_05_31_Beanie_Babies_Take_Their_Place_In_Must_Have_Spotlight.txt |archivedate=2012-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's strategy of deliberate scarcity, producing each new design in limited quantity, restricting individual store shipments to limited numbers of each design and regularly retiring designs, created a huge secondary market for the toys and increased their popularity and value as a collectible.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;

Ty systematically [[Retirement (Beanie Babies)|retired]] various designs, and many people assumed that all "retired" designs would rise in value the way that early retirees had. The craze lasted through 1999 and slowly declined after the Ty company announced that they would no longer be making Beanie Babies and made a bear called "The End".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutbeanies.com/news/1999/article.cgi?article=1999_09_01_Beanie_Babies_is_the_Party_Over.txt |title=Ty Beanie Baby Beanies News |publisher=Aboutbeanies.com |accessdate=2012-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311205359/http://aboutbeanies.com/news/1999/article.cgi?article=1999_09_01_Beanie_Babies_is_the_Party_Over.txt |archivedate=2012-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after the original announcement that the company would stop production, Ty asked the public to vote on whether the product should continue; fans and collectors voted "overwhelmingly" to keep the toys on the market.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;

At its height of popularity people would [[Flipping|flip]] Beanies at as much as ten-fold on [[eBay]].&lt;ref name="Fiscal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berr|first1=Johnathin|title=How the Great Beanie Baby Bubble Went Bust|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/02/How-Great-Beanie-Baby-Bubble-Went-Bust|website=The Fiscal Times|accessdate=4 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209103939/http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/02/How-Great-Beanie-Baby-Bubble-Went-Bust|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, at the height, Beanies made up 10% of eBay's sales.&lt;ref name="Lessonsfortune"&gt;{{cite web|last1=VanderMey|first1=Anne|title=Lessons from the great Beanie Babies crash|url=http://fortune.com/2015/03/11/beanie-babies-failure-lessons/|website=Fortune|accessdate=4 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213003204/http://fortune.com/2015/03/11/beanie-babies-failure-lessons/|archivedate=13 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some collectors insured their purchases for a price in the thousands.&lt;ref name="Fiscal"/&gt;

Following are key factors that contributed to the collectible nature of Beanie Babies:
* Unique Creative Elements - each product contained a unique birthday and poem that was printed on the tag of every Beanie Baby
* Supply/Demand - Scarce availability fell short of the product demand
* Availability - Beanie Babies were initially only sold in individually-owned small gift and specialty shops
* New Releases / Retirements - Several times a year, Beanie Babies would retire and the production of those characters would cease to make room for new designs&lt;ref name="TyWarnerBillionaire" /&gt;

Warner was keenly aware that the Beanie Babies bubble could burst and eventually started requiring retailers who sold Beanies to also stock other product lines by his company if they wished to continue selling Beanies. None of these lines did as well as Beanie Babies, although they kept the company alive after the fad ended and eventually some became successful in their own right.&lt;ref name="Fiscal"/&gt;

==Internet==
[[Ty, Inc.]] was the first business to produce a [[business to consumer]] [[Website]] designed to engage their market.  This is a major contributing factor to the early and rapidly growing popularity of Beanie Babies.  By the time the first iteration of the Ty Web site was published in late 1995, only 1.4% of Americans were using the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/27/part-1-how-the-internet-has-woven-itself-into-american-life/ |title=How the Internet Has Woven Itself Into American Life |author=Pew Research Center |date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with the launch of the Ty Website, all Beanie Baby hangtags had the Ty Website [[URL]] and a [[Call to action (marketing)|call to action]] printed underneath the poems and birthdays that commanded audiences to visit the company Web site with text that read: ''Visit our web page!!!'' As a result, hordes of consumers were visiting the Ty Web site by the thousands to gain information about Beanie Babies which was completely unprecedented at that time. Ty is the first business to leverage their Web site to connect and engage with consumers of their products. This effort evolved into the world's first [[Internet sensation]].&lt;ref name="TyWarnerBillionaire" /&gt;

==Notable Beanie Babies==
===Garcia the bear===
'''Garcia''' the bear was released in January 1996 and retired in May 1997. He is a [[tie-dye]]d bear that seems to be a tribute to musician [[Jerry Garcia]] of [[The Grateful Dead]] who died in 1995, designed by Nicholas Scarbrough. A group of differently colored dancing bears, originally artwork from the back of an album cover, was one of the band's many iconic images. The bear was supposedly "born" the date that Jerry died (August 9, 1995). The fast retirement for this Beanie Baby was due to an alleged lawsuit that the Garcia family filed against the Ty company, claiming that the name "Garcia" was used without permission from the family. In cooperation with the lawsuit, Garcia was retired and a similar bear named '''Peace''' was released.  Peace has a peace sign, while Garcia does not.

The bright colors on Garcia the bear made him one of the most popular Beanie Baby styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.peacebears.com/|title=peacebears.com|website=magazine.peacebears.com|accessdate=31 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831220812/http://magazine.peacebears.com/|archivedate=31 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Princess the bear===
[[Diana, Princess of Wales]] died on August 31, 1997. Warner announced the Beanie Baby Princess on October 29, 1997 in honor of Princess Diana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/05/magazine/sunday-july-5-1998-crime-a-world-gone-beanie-mad.html?scp=2&amp;sq=beanie%20bears&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1998: CRIME; A World Gone Beanie Mad! | date=1998-07-05 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119040640/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/05/magazine/sunday-july-5-1998-crime-a-world-gone-beanie-mad.html?scp=2&amp;sq=beanie%20bears&amp;st=cse | archivedate=November 19, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner said that all proceeds would be donated to the Diana, [[Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]]. The Princess Diana Beanie Baby was sent to vendors to distribute in the second week of December 1997. Some vendors had to wait until February 1998. Only 12 Beanie Baby Princesses were released to each vendor initially, but this changed due to strong demand. The 1st shipments are easily identified as "PVC Princess Bears" due to the tush tag stating "P.V.C. Pellets". The second shipment was during the switch to "P.E. Pellets" on the Tush in 1998 and are very common. Bears were made in both China and Indonesia

===Decade the bear===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Decadethebear.JPG|thumb|''Decade'' the bear]] --&gt;

''Decade'' the bear was made in honor of Beanie Babies' tenth anniversary. Decade bears were made in white, royal blue, red, purple, orange, hot pink, green, gold, brown, and light blue. Most ''Decade'' bears have silver sparkles on their bodies.  It was made in 2003.

===Tabasco the bull===
Originally named after the [[Tabasco sauce]], the name was changed to "Snort" to avoid trademark infringement. Tabasco has all red "feet" while Snort has all white. The poem stayed the same.

=== Peanut the Royal Blue Elephant===
Peanut the Royal Blue Elephant is one of the most notable of the Beanies. It first started production in 1995 as a royal blue color.  Then, Ty noticed that the fabric coloring was wrong, and that it needed to be the light blue color, so they started the light blue version and stopped the royal blue.  They made the light blue until his retirement in 1999. They only made about 500 of the royal blue variation and these beanies can go for $1500 with an original tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zacbissonnette/a-blue-elephant-named-peanut#.lnaZlMNzv|title=How A Blue Elephant Named Peanut Sparked The Beanie Baby Craze|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123202819/https://www.buzzfeed.com/zacbissonnette/a-blue-elephant-named-peanut#.lnaZlMNzv|archivedate=23 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterfeit Beanie Babies began to surface in 1997.

==Media==
During the wake of Beanie Babies' success, Beanie Baby-centric publications were issued. One of the largest was ''[[Mary Beth's Bean Bag World]]'', a monthly magazine dedicated to Beanie Babies and competing plush toys. This magazine ran from 1997 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58151402.html|title=Want The 'Scoop' On The Beanie Industry For The Millennium? |date=1999-12-10|work=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bridge to Terabithia''''' is a 2007 American [[fantasy]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Gábor Csupó]] and adapted for film by [[David L. Paterson]] and Jeff Stockwell. The film, starring [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Robert Patrick]], [[Bailee Madison]], and [[Zooey Deschanel]], and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], is based on [[Katherine Paterson]]'s [[Bridge to Terabithia (novel)|1977 novel of the same name]]. ''Bridge to Terabithia'' tells the story of bullied kids Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke, 12-year-old neighbors who create a fantasy world called Terabithia and spend their free time together in an abandoned tree house.

The original novel was based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed in part because of his ability as a playwright. Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in [[Auckland]], New Zealand within 60 days. Film editing took 10 weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months. This was [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman's]] last film as cinematographer before his retirement.

''Bridge to Terabithia'' was released to positive reviews; critics called it a faithful adaptation of the children's novel, and found dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhanced the imaginative film. ''Bridge to Terabithia'' was nominated for seven awards and won five at the [[Young Artist Award]]s.

==Plot==
&lt;!--- PLOTS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400–700 WORDS PER [[WP:FILMPLOT]] ---&gt;

Jesse "Jess" Aarons ([[Josh Hutcherson]]) is a 12-year-old aspiring artist living with his financially struggling family in Lark Creek. He rides the bus to school with his little sister May Belle ([[Bailee Madison]]), where he avoids the school bully Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton). In class, Jess is teased by classmates Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless), and meets new student Leslie Burke ([[AnnaSophia Robb]]). At recess, Jess enters a running event, for which he had been training at home. Leslie also enters and manages to beat all the boys, much to Jess' irritation. On the way home, Jess and Leslie learn that they are next-door neighbors.

Later in the evening Jess becomes frustrated when he finds that May Belle has drawn in his notebook, but his strict yet caring father ([[Robert Patrick]]) sides with her. He later watches them gardening together, disappointed that his father does not spend time with him. Moreover, his mother cherishes her daughter more than him. The next day at school, Leslie compliments Jess' drawing ability, and they soon become friends. After school, they venture into the woods and swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house on the other side, and invent a new world, which they call Terabithia. The fantasy world, which is a reflection on their lives, comes to life through their eyes as they explore the surroundings. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house getting to know each other.

Leslie gives Jess an art kit on his birthday, much to his delight. Jess becomes angry with his father's attitude to him, and refuses the existence of Terabithia the next day at school. Afterwards, Jess apologizes to Leslie by giving her a puppy, whom she names Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll resembling Janice, and a squirrel-like creature resembling Hoager, whom they name the 'Sqoager'. At school, Leslie becomes frustrated by Janice's fee for using the toilet. Jess and Leslie play a prank on Janice, and she becomes the laughing stock of everyone on the bus. Once Leslie's parents finish their book, she and Jess help paint their house. Jess is impressed by her parents' happiness, and smiles as he watches their family. At school, Leslie discovers from an upset Janice that her bullying is due to her abusive father, and the two become friends, with Janice later befriending Jess as well. Jess and Leslie take P.T. to Terabithia, where they fight off several creatures resembling students at their school, this time with the troll as their ally. When it starts raining, they decide to go home, and Jess looks on smiling as Leslie runs away.

The next morning, Ms. Edmunds ([[Zooey Deschanel]]), Jess' music teacher whom Jess has a crush on, calls to invite him on a one-on-one field trip to an art museum. Jess tries to ask his mother's permission; however, she is half-asleep and he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess doesn't ask Leslie to accompany him, and merely looks at her house as they drive by. When he returns home, Jess finds that his parents were worried sick since they didn't know where he was. His father reveals to Jess that Leslie had died that morning by drowning in the rain-swollen creek after the rope she used to try to cross it broke. Jess, much to his horror, first denies it, then runs out of his house to check on Leslie, but he discovers the emergency vehicles surrounding her house, and has no choice but to accept Leslie's death.

The following day, Jess and his parents visit the Burke family home to pay their respects. Leslie's father, Bill Burke ([[Latham Gaines]]), tells Jess that she loved him, and thanks him for being a very good friend to her, since she had trouble making friends at her old school. Jess feels overwhelming guilt for Leslie's death, even lashing out at both Scott and May Belle, and imagining that a dark spirit from Terabithia is chasing after him, but his father eventually consoles him to keep their friendship alive for her sake.

Jess decides to re-imagine Terabithia and builds a bridge across the river to welcome a new ruler. He invites May Belle to Terabithia; she is delighted because she was previously denied any opportunity to enter. They bring back Terabithia in even greater splendor, with Jess as king and May Belle as princess.

==Production==

===Overview===
Production for the film began on  February 20, 2006,&lt;ref name="vfx"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=Tara DiLullo|title=''Bridge to Terabithia'': From Imagination to 3D Enchantment|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=February 16, 2007|url=http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=3179|accessdate=April 29, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223134621/http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=3179|archivedate=December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a budget of $20–25 million.&lt;ref name="moviejungle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="numbers"/&gt; Principal photography for the film was shot in [[Auckland]], New Zealand within sixty days.&lt;ref name="moviejungle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walden"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridge to Terabithia&amp;nbsp;— About the Film |publisher=[[Walden Media]] |date= |url=http://www.walden.com/walden/properties/terabithia/about_film.php |accessdate=April 25, 2009 |archivedate=March 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326131209/http://www.walden.com/walden/properties/terabithia/about_film.php |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The film was finished by November 2006, because the crew "had to rush" to meet the February 16 deadline.&lt;ref name="moviejungle" /&gt; The film was directed by [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Rugrats]]'' co-creator and former [[Hanna-Barbera]] animator [[Gábor Csupó]], who was first recommended for the job by [[Walden Media]] President [[Cary Granat]]. Although Csupó had never worked on a live-action film before, it "didn't worry Granat in the least".&lt;ref name="csupomoviesonline" /&gt; Csupó stated that he was interested in making the film because he "had the ambition to do a live-action film for a long time", but that he "didn't like anything until I read this book". He described the book as "beautiful" and said that it "moved [him]".&lt;ref name="imaginaryeffects"&gt;{{Cite news| last=Robertson| first=Barbara| title=Imaginary Effects|newspaper=Computer Graphics World|volume=30|issue=3|pages=43–44|date=March 2007| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bridge to Terabithia'' was cinematographer [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]]'s final film before his retirement. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after shooting this film because he wanted his last film to be a good one; "this is such a beautiful story, and it's exactly the kind of movie I want to do at this time in my life".&lt;ref name="prodnotes" /&gt;

===Casting===
[[File:Bailee Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bailee Madison]] was cast as May Belle Aarons.]]

Director Csupó stated that they had no actors initially in mind for the film. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csupó "such a beautiful, heartwarming letter" that expressed her love for the book and the character. Csupó said that he cast her because of "her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material". Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began, and "their conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role". Levine said that "it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven."&lt;ref name="prodnotes" /&gt; With regard to the character, Robb said "[Leslie]'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Sheila |title=AnnaSophia Robb Interview, Bridge to Terabithia |publisher=MoviesOnline |date= |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_11262.html |accessdate=April 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216125627/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_11262.html |archivedate=February 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levine stated that "looking for Jesse was a really tough hunt. We needed someone who could go from an introverted boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident, brave leader in Terabithia. That's a heck of a range for such a young actor."&lt;ref name="prodnotes" /&gt; [[Josh Hutcherson]] was not their first choice for the role of Jesse Aarons, but they settled with him because they "felt the chemistry between AnnaSophia Robb and him".&lt;ref name="csupomoviesonline" /&gt; Hutcherson said that the project appealed to him because of "the real life day-to-day drama as well as the arc of the character Jesse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage |first=David |title=Josh Hutcherson&amp;nbsp;— the Terabithia Interview! |publisher=Popcorn.co.uk |date=April 30, 2007 |url=http://www.popcorn.co.uk/page.asp?partid=518 |accessdate=April 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420065029/http://www.popcorn.co.uk/page.asp?partid=518 |archivedate=April 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers cast [[Robert Patrick]] as Jess's hardworking and strict father based on his previous roles in the films ''[[Walk the Line]]'', ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'', and the television series ''[[The Unit]]''. Patrick explained that he related to the story because he was "constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid" himself, and that the film's setting reminded him of where he grew up. He also said that he took on the role because he wanted to star in a film that his children could watch.&lt;ref name="prodnotes" /&gt;

Csupó said that they cast [[Bailee Madison]] as May Belle Aarons after weeks of searching for an actress to play the part. He went on to say that "she had such a charm, even before the camera, she was just like a little sweetheart. She was very confident, she showed up, shook hands with everybody, totally sweet and perky. I said 'WOW!'&amp;nbsp;— she was just stealing everybody's heart on the spot."&lt;ref name="moviejungle" /&gt;

===Design and effects===
Csupó explained that "it was a very conscious decision from the very beginning that we're not going to overdo the visual effects because of the story's integrity and the book's integrity", because there was only a brief mention of Jess and Leslie fighting imaginary creatures in the forest in the novel. With that in mind, they "tried to do the absolute minimum, which would be required to put it into a movie version".&lt;ref name="csupomoviesonline" /&gt;

In designing the fantasy creatures found in Terabithia, Csupó wanted to make creatures that were "little more artsy, imaginative, fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies", and drew inspiration from [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[Ridley Scott]]. Dima Malanitchev came up with the drawings for the creatures with Csupó's guidance.&lt;ref name="imaginaryeffects" /&gt; Csupó chose to have [[Weta Digital]] render the 3D animation because he "was impressed with their artistic integrity, the teamwork, the [fact that] people were really nice, and also they responded to our designs very positively". Weta modified some of the creature designs, but ultimately remained faithful to Csupó's original designs.&lt;ref name="imaginaryeffects" /&gt;

There were around 100 crew members from Weta working on the effects for the film. Weta was already working on animating the creatures while the film was being shot, and Weta crew members were on-set for all the scenes that involved special effects during the filming. Weta visual effects supervisor [[Matt Aitken (special effects artist)|Matt Aitken]] explained that process involved in interpreting the creatures was "split into two steps". First, natural-looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by Csupó and Malanitchev, and this was done mostly through Photoshop collages done by visual effects art director Michael Pangrazio. The second step was to figure out animation or motion styles that best suited these creatures.&lt;ref name="vfx" /&gt;

Leslie's costumes in the film were designed to look as if the character "might have made some of them herself", and they were updated from those described in the book to reflect what would currently be considered eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bridge to Terabithia: The Official Movie Companion|last=Paterson|first=David|authorlink=|year=2007|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=|isbn=0-06-121531-7|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Producer and screenwriter [[David L. Paterson]] is the [[Bridge to Terabithia (novel)|novel]]'s author's son, and his name was featured on its dedication page. The story was based on his real-life best friend, [[Lisa Christina Hill|Lisa Hill]], who was struck by [[lightning]] and killed when they were both eight years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Paterson, Katherine| title = Terabithia.com&amp;nbsp;- Katherine Paterson&amp;nbsp;- Questions| publisher=Terabithia.com| date =| url = http://www.terabithia.com/questions.html| accessdate = April 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kohn| first = Diana| title = Lisa Hill and the ''Bridge to Terabithia'' (Internet Archive version)| publisher=[[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Voice]]| year = 2004| url = http://www.takoma.com/archives/copy/2005/06/features_takomaarchives0605.html | accessdate = April 25, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060522104539/http://www.takoma.com/archives/copy/2005/06/features_takomaarchives0605.html |archivedate = May 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel, and she agreed "not only because he's [her] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay, mostly because of Leslie's death; "if you can believe this, I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Oleck| first = Joan| title = ''Bridge to Terabithia'' Hits the Big Screen| journal = [[School Library Journal]]| volume = 53| issue = 2| pages = 20| date = February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important thing for Paterson was to keep the spirit of the book alive while finding a way to transform it from "a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium". Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridge to Terabithia production notes|url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2007/terabithia_production_details.htm|accessdate=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Paterson focused on "bringing out the emotions of the story," he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way", David said. Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book. Csupó reasons that the movie "deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that", so it "made more sense" to make the characters older.&lt;ref name="csupomoviesonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_11264.html|title=Gabor Csupo Interview, Director Bridge to Terabithia|accessdate=December 2, 2008|last=Roberts|first=Sheila|date=|work=|publisher=MoviesOnline|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629010420/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_11264.html |archivedate=June 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for ''Bridge to Terabithia'' and the film ''[[Flicka]]'' in that "...at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also went on to say that there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for ''Bridge to Terabithia''.&lt;ref name="soundtracknet" /&gt; He did so as Csupó requested him to not compose "your typical Hollywood Score"; he then mixed up orchestral melody with "a bit of a modern flavor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/fmw/issues/FM_Weekly_021907.pdf | title=Crossing the Bridge | author=Schweiger, Daniel | date=February 19, 2007 | issue=3 | journal=Film Music Weekly | publisher=Global Media Development Group | pages=6–7 | accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score he composed for the film is described as "very large" compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit." The official soundtrack for the film was released as ''Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia'' by [[Hollywood Records]] on February 13, 2007.&lt;ref name="soundtracknet"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title = SoundtrackNet : Interview&amp;nbsp;- Aaron Zigman| publisher=[[SoundtrackNet]]| date =February 2007| url = http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=219| accessdate = April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes===
*"I Learned from You" is originally sung with [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] from the [[Hannah Montana (soundtrack)|''Hannah Montana'' soundtrack]]. This is a new version without Billy Ray Cyrus and with different lyrics.
*"[[Look Through My Eyes]]", "[[Right Here (Jeremy Camp song)|Right Here]]" and "When You Love Someone" are not heard in the film. "Look Through My Eyes" is originally from ''[[Disneymania 4]]'', "Right Here" is from Camp's album ''[[Stay (Jeremy Camp album)|Stay]]'' and "When You Love Someone" is from [[Bethany Dillon]]'s album ''[[So Far: The Acoustic Sessions]]''.

==Release==

===Marketing and promotion===
The promotion and advertising for the film was met with criticism and controversy. The filmmakers distanced themselves from the advertising campaign for the film, saying that it was deliberately misleading and made the film seem to be about, or occurring in, a fantasy world.&lt;ref name="scifi"&gt;{{cite web| last = Szymanski| first = Mike| title = ''Terabithia'' Ads Mislead?| publisher=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)#Sci Fi.com|Sci Fi.com]]| date = February 7, 2007| url = http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=40014&amp;type=0| accessdate = April 25, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209210133/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=40014&amp;type=0 |archivedate = February 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Paterson was surprised by the trailer, but understood the marketing reasoning behind it, saying:
{{cquote|Although there is a generation that is very familiar with the book, if you are over 40, then you probably haven't, and we need to reach them. [...] Everyone who read the book and sees the trailer says, 'What is this? This is nothing like the book. What are you doing, Dave?' And I say, 'You know what you're seeing is 15 seconds of a 90-minute film. Give me a little leeway and respect. Go see it, and then tell me what you think.&lt;ref name="scifi" /&gt;}}

Critics commented on the film's misleading advertisement campaign. One critic said the film was actually "grounded in reality far more than in fantasy",&lt;ref name="nytimesbrigerev" /&gt; while another thought, "far from a computer generated escapist fantasy, this film is an unpretentious and touching tale of preteen companionship and loss".&lt;ref name="bridgevoicerev" /&gt;

===Distribution===
The film premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] on February 16, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070206006421/en/Bridge-Teribithia-Essay-Contest-Offers-Big-Prizes#.U6YMzfldWJI | title=`Bridge to Teribithia'' Essay Contest Offers Big Prizes to Students and Teachers Exclusively at Hollywood’s El Capitan Theatre from 2/16&amp;nbsp;– 3/29 | date=February 6, 2007 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson, an alumnus of [[The Catholic University of America]], held a special advance screening of the film for members of the CUA community at the [[AFI Silver]] Theatre in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] on February 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| title=CUA This Week| url=http://thisweek.cua.edu/default.cfm?issue=2007Jan29This%20Week.htm&amp;startdate=01/29/2007| publisher=[[The Catholic University of America]]| date=January 26, 2007| accessdate=May 2, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225235026/http://thisweek.cua.edu/default.cfm?issue=2007Jan29This%20Week.htm&amp;startdate=01%2F29%2F2007#| archive-date=2012-02-25| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened in the United Kingdom on May 4, 2007, and in New Zealand June 7, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=''Bridge To Terabithia'' 2007| url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/b/Bridge-To-Terabithia/index-1885857.html| publisher=[[Yahoo!]]| accessdate=May 10, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625221102/http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/b/Bridge-To-Terabithia/index-1885857.html | archivedate=June 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a strong second place domestic opening over the [[Presidents' Day]] weekend, grossing "a higher-than-expected" $28,536,717 from 2,284 screens, earning an average of $9,885 per screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamann |first=John |title=Weekend Box Office Wrap-Up for February 16 to February 18, 2007 |publisher=[[Box Office Prophets]] |date=February 18, 2007 |url=http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/column/index.cfm?columnID=9943 |accessdate=April 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810173215/http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/column/index.cfm?columnID=9943 |archivedate=August 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening Friday box office was $6.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Briody |first=Tim |title=Friday Box Office Analysis |publisher=[[Box Office Prophets]] |date=February 17, 2007 |url=http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/column/index.cfm?columnID=9942 |accessdate=April 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810184350/http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/column/index.cfm?columnID=9942 |archivedate=August 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a worldwide gross of [[US dollar|US$]]137 million, taking in $82 million in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;

The DVD and high definition Blu-ray version shared the same special features; including: "Digital Imagination: Bringing Terabithia to Life", "Behind the Book: The Themes of ''Bridge to Terabithia''", "[[Keep Your Mind Wide Open]]" music video by Robb, and two audio commentaries, the first with director [[Gabor Csupo]], writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman, and the second with producer Lauren Levine and actors Hutcherson and Robb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Swindoll, Jeff |title=DVD Review: ''Bridge to Terabithia'' |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1318695.php |publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]] |date=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=May 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927022312/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1318695.php |archivedate=September 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
[[File:AnnaSophia Robb (20050209).jpg|thumb|upright|[[AnnaSophia Robb]]'s portrayal of Leslie Burke was highly praised; one critic enjoyed her "engaging" performance", and thought "only the story's vibrant young heroine [...] draws us in enough to care".&lt;ref name="usarevrobb" /&gt;]]
''Bridge to Terabithia'' received positive reviews from film critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 85% based on 157 reviews, with an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 7.2/10. The site's consensus is, that the film is "a faithful adaptation of a beloved children's novel and a powerful portrayal of love, loss, and imagination through children's eyes. Dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhance the imaginative film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bridge_to_terabithia/|title=''Bridge to Terabithia'' (2007)|publisher=[[Flixster]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 74% based on 25 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bridge-to-terabithia|title=''Bridge to Terabithia''|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Berardinelli]] of ReelViews called ''Bridge to Terabithia'' "easily the best family feature of the early year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Berardinelli| first = James| authorlink = James Berardinelli| title = Review: ''Bridge to Terabithia''| publisher = ReelViews| year = 2007| url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/b/bridge_terabithia.html| accessdate = April 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the script for being "utterly recognizable and authentic", and thought Robb and Hutcherson were "perfectly cast". Hornaday wrote that although the final five minutes succumbed to "oversweet sentiment", viewers would remember the film's "warmth and respect with which it pays homage to first love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Hornaday, Ann| title=''Bridge'': Crossing Into The Heart of Childhood| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/15/AR2007021502089.html| work=[[The Washington Post]]| date=February 16, 2007| accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Grose]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' commended director Csupó for omitting "cutesy tween stereotypes", and felt Jess's relationship with his father elevated ''Bridge to Terabithia'' from "a good kids movie to a classic contender".&lt;ref name="bridgevoicerev"&gt;{{cite web|author=Grose, Jessica|title=''Bridge to Terabithia''|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-02-06/film/bridge-to-terabithia/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=February 6, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background "to find magic in the everyday", and thought Csupó directed "like someone intimate with the pain of being different, allowing each personality more than a single characteristic". The reviewer praised all the leads for their strong performances, especially Deschanel and Madison. Catsoulis found the film was able to handle adult topics "with nuance and sensitivity", and being consistently smart and "delicate as a spider web", it was the kind of children's movie "rarely seen nowadays".&lt;ref name="nytimesbrigerev"&gt;{{cite web|author=Catsoulis, Jeannette|title=''Bridge to Terabithia''&amp;nbsp;- Transcending Pain, a Friendship Fed on Imagination|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/02/16/movies/16tera.html?ref=movies| work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 16, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam di Nunzio of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' praised Hutcherson and Robb's performances, saying that "the film's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see the world through children's eyes. The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint."&lt;ref name="suntimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Nunzio|first=Miriam|title=Imagination triumphs in ''Bridge to Terabithia''|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=February 16, 2007|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/258783,WKP-News-bridge16.article|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218073703/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/258783%2CWKP-News-bridge16.article|archivedate=February 18, 2007|accessdate=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the critical acclaim, not all reviews were as positive. Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote that "for a movie about the power of imagination, ''Bridge to Terabithia'' is not as clever as you would hope". Puig called the film a "serviceable translation" of the novel, but thought the adult characters were caricatured. The reviewer found the real-life portions of the movie were "derivative and simplistic", but found Jess's emotional tumult felt "powerfully authentic, and this is where the film finds its truth and soul".&lt;ref name="usarevrobb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Puig, Claudia|title=''Bridge to Terabithia'' holds up well enough|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2007-02-15-terabithia_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|date=March 4, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' critic Joe Morgenstern felt that despite the occasional misuse of enchantment—"brief spasms of overproduced fantasy"—the novel's screen adaptation was told with "agreeable simplicity in between computer-generated monsters". Morgenstern was disappointed with the performances by the young members of the cast, which he described as "appealing but unpolished". Morgenstern thought Csupó lacked experience directing actors, and that although Deschanel was the best adult performer, she seemed self-directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morgenstern, Joe|title=Film Review|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB117158480724710454|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 16, 2007|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Gregory Kirschling was confused by the main characters' lack of excitement towards Terabithia, and felt the film could not decide if it was "a fantasy or a coming-of-age story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirschling, Gregory|title=''Bridge to Terabithia'' (2007)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20011869,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=February 14, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and nominations===
''Bridge to Terabithia'' was nominated for seven awards, of which it won five. Josh Hutcherson was nominated at the 2008 [[Saturn Award]]s for "Best Performance by a Younger Actor".&lt;ref name="saturn"&gt;{{cite web|author=Olson, Dale |title=The Saturn Awards (Presented by The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films) |url=https://www.saturnawards.org/nom_34.doc |publisher=[[Saturn Award]] |date= |accessdate=May 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211153345/http://www.saturnawards.org/nom_34.doc |archivedate=December 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; AnnaSophia Robb was nominated for a [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award]] for "Best Young Actress".&lt;ref name="critics"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=''Into the Wild'' leads Critics' Choice nominations|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/2007-12-11-critics-choice-awards_N.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 11, 2007|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won five awards at the [[Young Artist Award]]s, including "Best Family Feature Film (Fantasy or Musical)".

'''''Carnal Knowledge''''' is a 1971 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Mike Nichols]] and written by [[Jules Feiffer]]. It stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Art Garfunkel]], [[Ann-Margret]], and [[Candice Bergen]].

==Plot==
The story follows the sexual exploits of two [[Amherst College]] [[roommate]]s over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term "ballbuster" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure is to deny pleasure to men; he extends this term to mean women who want to get married instead of accepting that men mostly want unattached sex. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman.

The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged.

In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. 

Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unknown to Sandy, she is pursued by Jonathan, who feels a physical attraction for her. They have sex. Jonathan tries to convince Susan not to have sex with Sandy, but after some delays, Susan is also having sex with Sandy. Part I ends with Susan and Jonathan breaking up.

Part II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his "perfect woman". Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of Jonathan's physical requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow. Jonathan finds that this purely physical relationship is no more satisfying than his previous relationship with Susan. Bobbie leaves her job at Jonathan's suggestion. She then becomes depressed, sleeping long hours doing nothing but sleeping in the apartment she shares with Jonathan. The relationship deteriorates. Jonathan berates Bobbie for not cleaning up the apartment while he is out working a nine-to-five job all day. He claims that he doesn't understand why breakups always have to end with "poison."

Sandy's relationship with Susan is faring no better. Sandy is dissatisfied and bored with the physical part of their relationship, even though he and Susan "do all the right things." He relates how they are "patient with each other" and concludes with a statement that perhaps sex is not "meant to be enjoyable with a person you love". He says that being in bed with Susan as she tells him what to do is like taking orders on a short order drill.
 
Sandy and Susan end their relationship. He begins dating Cindy (Cynthia O'Neal) next. Sandy, Cindy, Jonathan and Bobbie find themselves together at Jonathan's apartment, where Jonathan suggests privately to Sandy that they trade partners, to "liven things up a bit." Sandy goes to the bedroom looking for Bobbie. Cindy dances with Jonathan and reprimands him for attempting to bed her with Sandy nearby, but indicates she is open to seeing him on his own, saying he should contact her at a more appropriate time. In the meantime, upset by an earlier fight with Jonathan about her desire to get married, Bobbie has attempted suicide. She is found by Sandy, who rings the hospital to have her taken to intensive care.

Part III opens with now-middleaged Jonathan presenting a slideshow entitled "Ballbusters on Parade" to Sandy (now in his 40s) and his 18-year-old girlfriend, Jennifer ([[Carol Kane]]). The slideshow consists of pictures of Jonathan's various loves throughout his life. He skips awkwardly over a slide of Susan, but not before Sandy notices. He also shows an image of Bobbie, saying they are divorced and had one child together, and he is paying her alimony. Jennifer leaves in tears. Sandy idolizes his new lover, explaining that "she knows worlds which I cannot begin to touch yet." Jonathan believes his friend is deluding himself.

Time passes. Jonathan remains successful, but is alone. A prostitute ([[Rita Moreno]]) is with him, and they go through a ritual dialogue about male/female relationships which is apparently a script written by Jonathan. At the end, the prostitute recites a monologue (again scripted by Jonathan) praising his power and "perfection," which apparently has become the only way Jonathan can now get an erection.

==Cast==
* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Jonathan Fuerst
* [[Art Garfunkel|Arthur Garfunkel]] as Sandy
* [[Candice Bergen]] as Susan
* [[Ann-Margret]] as Bobbie
* [[Rita Moreno]] as Louise
* [[Carol Kane]] as Jennifer

==Production==
The script was originally written as a play. Jules Feiffer sent it to Mike Nichols, who thought it would work better as a film.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols Meets Jules Feiffer: Mike Nichols &lt;/ref&gt;  The script contains numerous four-letter words, some of which were rarely heard on the screen before this time.

==Legal problems==
The changes in the morals of American society of the 1960s and 1970s and the general receptiveness by the public to frank discussion of sexual issues was sometimes at odds with local community standards. A theatre in [[Albany, Georgia]], showed the film. On January 13, 1972, the local police served a search warrant on the theatre, and seized the film. In March 1972, the theatre manager, Mr. Jenkins, was convicted of the crime of "distributing obscene material". His conviction was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]]. On June 24, 1974, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] found that the State of Georgia had gone too far in classifying material as obscene in view of its prior decision in ''[[Miller v. California]]'', {{ussc|413|15|1973}} (the ''Miller'' standard), and overturned the conviction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/censored/walkthrough/film2|title=University of Virginia Library Online Exhibits - CENSORED: Wielding the Red Pen|website=explore.lib.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Jenkins v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|418|153|1974}}. The court also said that, {{quote|Our own viewing of the film satisfies us that ''Carnal Knowledge'' could not be found … to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. Nothing in the movie falls within … material which may constitutionally be found … "patently offensive" … While the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including "ultimate sexual acts" is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times. There is no exhibition whatever of the actors' genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes. There are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene… Appellant's showing of the film ''Carnal Knowledge'' is simply not the "public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial gain" which we said was punishable…}}

==Reception==
===Critical response===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gave the film a score of 86% based on reviews from 28 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/carnal_knowledge/|title=Carnal Knowledge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}
''Carnal Knowledge'' was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama]] (Jack Nicholson), [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]] (Art Garfunkel), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] (Ann-Margret).

==In popular culture==
* A 1971 ''[[All in the Family]]'' episode "Gloria Poses in the Nude" has Archie and Edith coming home after watching the film. Edith thought it was a religious film because she thought the title of the film was ''Cardinal Knowledge'' until Archie corrects her. 
* The 1992 ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' episode "Carnal Knowledge" has Kevin Arnold and his friends attempting to sneak in to see the film despite being underage.
* In the 1992 ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip]]", [[George Costanza]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] ponder whether Candice Bergen showed her breasts in the film.
* The 1993 animated series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' has an episode titled "Carnival Knowledge" which is a [[pun]] on the movies title, although the episode itself has very little to do with the film.

==Home media==

[[File:E. D. Babbitt.png|thumb|Edwin Dwight Babbitt an early proponent of Chromotherapy]]
'''Chromotherapy''', sometimes called '''color therapy''', '''colorology''' or '''cromatherapy''', is an [[alternative medicine]] method, which is considered [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Facts on File Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromotherapists claim to be able to use [[light]] in the form of [[color]] to balance "energy" lacking from a person's body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels.

Color therapy is distinct from other types of [[light therapy]], such as [[Neonatal jaundice|neonatal jaundice treatment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1108807 |pmc=1545706 |year=1975 |author1=Dobbs |first1=R.

The potential risk of retinal damage linked to chromotherapy has been discussed by French skeptic and lighting physicist Sébastien Point. Although Point considers that LED lamps at domestic radiance are safe in normal use for the general population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/features/shouldnt-afraid-leds/|title=Why you shouldn't be afraid of LEDs - European Scientist|author=|date=1 February 2018|website=europeanscientist.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  Some evidence that white LEDs are toxic for Human at domestic radiance?, Radioprotection, september 2017 , https://www.radioprotection.org/articles/radiopro/abs/2017/04/radiopro170025/radiopro170025.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
he also pointed out the risk of overexposure to light from LEDs for practices like chromotherapy, when duration and time exposure are not under control.&lt;ref&gt;S.Point, the danger of chromotherapy, Skeptical Inquirer, Vol.41, N°4, July/August 2017 skepdigest.awardspace.us/The_Danger_of_Chromotherapy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrp.asso.fr/medias/sfrp/documents/Divers/Fiche%20lampes%20%C3%A0%20Led%20SFRP%20-%20Anglais%20_%2006-2018%20(2).pdf S. Point and A. Barlier-Salsi, LED lighting and retinal damage.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[Avicenna]] (980–1037), seeing color as of vital importance both in [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and in [[Therapy|treatment]], discussed chromotherapy in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. He wrote that "color is an observable symptom of disease" and also developed a chart that related color to the [[temperature]] and physical condition of the body. His view was that red moved the blood, blue or white cooled it, and yellow reduced muscular pain and inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ecam/neh137 |pmid=16322805 |pmc=1297510 |year=2005 |author1=Azeemi |first1=S. T. |title=A Critical Analysis of Chromotherapy and Its Scientific Evolution |journal=Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=481–488 |last2=Raza |first2=S. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Civil War General [[Augustus Pleasonton]] (1801–1894) conducted his own experiments and in 1876 published his book ''The Influence Of The Blue Ray Of The Sunlight And Of The Blue Color Of The Sky'' about how the color [[blue]] can improve the growth of crops and livestock and can help heal diseases in humans. This led to modern chromotherapy, influencing scientist Dr. Seth Pancoast (1823–1889) and Edwin Dwight Babbitt (1828–1905) to conduct experiments and to publish, respectively, ''Blue and Red Light; or, Light and Its Rays as Medicine'' (1877) and ''The Principles of Light and Color''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Paul. (2001). ''Banvard's Folly: Tales of Renowned Obscurity, Famous Anonymity, and Rotten Luck''. Picador. p. 229. {{ISBN|0-330-48689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Indian-born American-citizen scientist [[Dinshah P. Ghadiali]] (1873–1966), published ''The Spectro Chromemetry Encyclopaedia'', a work on color therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarcz, Joe. [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/spectro.html "Colorful Nonsense: Dinshah Ghadiali and His Spectro-Chrome Device"]. Quackwatch.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghadiali claimed to have discovered why and how the different colored rays have various therapeutic effects on organisms. He believed that colors represent chemical potencies in higher octaves of vibration, and for each organism and system of the body there is a particular color that stimulates and another that inhibits the work of that organ or system. Ghadiali also thought that by knowing the action of the different colors upon the different organs and systems of the body, one can apply the correct color that will tend to balance the action of any organ or system that has become abnormal in its functioning or condition. Dinshah P. Ghadiali's son Darius Dinshah continues to provide information about color therapy via his Dinshah Health Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing non-pharmaceutical home color therapy, and his book ''Let There Be Light''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dinshah | first=Darius | title=Let There be Light | isbn=978-0933917309 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5wBLPwAACAAJ | year=2012 | publisher=Dinshah Health Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] had described Ghadiali as "perhaps the greatest quack of them all". In 1925, Ghadiali was accused of rape and arrested in Seattle and sentenced under the [[Mann Act]] for five years at the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta]]. According to Gardner, photographs of Ghadiali at work in his laboratory are "indistinguishable from stills of a grade D movie about a mad scientist".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. pp. 211-212. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century "color healers" claimed colored glass filters could treat many diseases including [[constipation]] and [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name = NYT&gt;{{cite news | last = Gruson | first = L | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/science/color-has-a-powerful-effect-on-behavior-researchers-assert.html?&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Color has a powerful effect on behavior, researchers assert | date = 1982-10-19 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colored chakras==
[[File:Chakra silhouette.png|thumb|100px|A New Age conceptualisation of the chakras of Indian body culture and their positions in the human body]]

Practitioners of [[ayurvedic medicine]] believe the body has seven "[[chakra]]s", which some claim are 'spiritual centers', and which are held to be located along the [[Vertebral column|spine]]. [[New Age]] thought associates each of the chakras with a single color of the visible light spectrum, along with a function and organ or bodily system. According to this view, the chakras can become imbalanced and result in physical diseases, but application of the appropriate color can allegedly correct  such imbalances.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite book | last = Parker | first = D | year = 2001 | title = Color Decoder | isbn = 978-0-7641-1887-6 | publisher = Barron's }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purported colors and their associations are described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/a/colorpsych.htm | title = Color Psychology: How Colors Impact Moods, Feelings, and Behaviors | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[About.com]] | last = van Wagner | first = K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific reception ==

Chromotherapy is regarded by health experts as [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;Raso, Jack. (1993). ''Mystical Diets: Paranormal, Spiritual, and Occult Nutrition Practices''. Prometheus Books. pp. 256-257. {{ISBN|0-87975-761-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swan, Jonathan. (2003). ''Quack Magic: The Dubious History of Health Fads and Cures''. Ebury Press. p. 216. {{ISBN|978-0091888091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book published by the [[American Cancer Society]], "available scientific evidence does not support claims that alternative uses of light or color therapy are effective in treating cancer or other illnesses".&lt;ref name="ACS"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ades | first = Terri | year = 2009 | title = Complete Guide to Complementary &amp; Alternative Cancer Therapies | isbn = 9781604430530 | publisher = American Cancer Society | pages = 210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photobiology]], the term for the scientific study of the effects of light on living tissue, has sometimes been used instead of the term chromotherapy in an effort to distance it from its roots in Victorian [[mysticism]] and to strip it of its associations with symbolism and magic.&lt;ref name = NYT/&gt; [[Light therapy]] is a specific treatment approach using high intensity light to treat specific sleep, skin and mood disorders.

''Circle'' was intended to be a series of publications so is sometimes referred to as a journal or magazine, although only one issue was actually produced.

Contributors are listed and categorized as painters, sculptors, architects, and writers on the front cover. The main texts are Gabo's essay "The Constructive Idea in Art" that is the main statement by the artist on his work and [[Piet Mondrian]]'s seminal essay "Plastic Art and Pure Plastic Art". As well as these, others featured are:

In [[engineering]], '''compensation''' is planning for [[unintened consequence|side effect]]s or other unintended issues in a [[design]]. In a more simpler term, it's a "counter-procedure" plan on expected side effect performed to produce more efficient and useful results.  The design of an [[invention]] can itself also be to compensate for some other existing issue or [[Action (philosophy)|exception]].

One example is in a [[voltage-controlled oscillator|voltage-controlled crystal oscillator]] (VCXO), which is normally affected not only by [[voltage]], but to a lesser extent by [[temperature]].  A temperature-compensated version (a TCVCXO) is designed so that [[heat]] buildup within the [[enclosure (engineering)|enclosure]] of a [[transmitter]] or other such [[machine|device]] will not alter the [[piezoelectric effect]], thereby causing [[frequency drift]].

Another example is [[motion compensation]] on [[digital camera]]s and [[video camera]]s, which keep a picture steady and not blurry.

Other examples in [[electrical engineering]] include:
* A [[voltage source|constant voltage]] device compensates for low or high voltage in an [[electrical circuit]], keeping its output the same within a given [[interval (mathematics)|range]] of input.
* [[Error correction]] compensates for [[data corruption]].
* [[Gray coding]] compensates for errors on [[rotary encoder]]s and [[linear encoder]]s.
* Debouncing compensates for [[jitter]] in an [[electrical]] [[switch]] (see Contact Bounce section in Switch article).
* A [[resistor]] or [[inductor]] compensates for [[negative resistance]] in [[gas-discharge lamp|gas-discharge lighting]].
* [[Frequency compensation]] is used in [[feedback]] [[control systems]] to avert oscillations.

There are also examples in [[civil engineering]]:
* [[Expansion joint]]s in [[sidewalk]]s, [[building]]s, and [[bridge]]s compensate for [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] and [[Thermal expansion|contraction]].
* Various devices between a [[structure]] and its [[Foundation (architecture)|Foundation]] compensate for [[earthquake]] movements, either actively or passively.

== Railways ==

* On railways, steep gradients on sharp curves have an equivalent gradient slightly steeper than the stated value.  This is because of extra friction of the wheel on the rails, and because wagons stretch out on the chord rather than on the arc, and may thus cause trains to stall.  To '''compensate''', the gradient of [[ruling grade]]s is slightly reduced from say 1 in 50 to 1 in 53.

'''Contemporary African art''' is commonly understood to be art made by artists in Africa and the African diaspora in the post-independence era. However, there are about as many understandings of contemporary African art as there are curators, scholars and artists working in that field. All three terms of this "wide-reaching noncategory [sic]"&lt;ref&gt;Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). "Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art – Production, Exhibition, Commodification", in Farrell, L. A., V. Byvanck (eds), ''Looking Both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora''. New York: Museum for African Art, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; are problematic in themselves: What exactly is "contemporary", what makes art "African", and when are we talking about art and not any other kind of creative expression? Western scholars and curators have made numerous attempts at defining contemporary African art in the 1990s and early 2000s and proposed a range of categories and genres. They triggered heated debates and controversies especially on the foundations of postcolonial critique. Recent trends indicate a far more relaxed engagement with definitions and identity ascriptions. The global presence and entanglement of Africa and its contemporary artists have become a widely acknowledged fact that still requires and provokes critical reflection but finds itself beyond the pressure of self-justification.

== Scope ==
Although African art has always been contemporary to its producers, the term "contemporary African art" implies a particular kind of art that has conquered, or, as some would say, has been absorbed by the international art world and art market since the 1980s. It is in that decade when Europe and the US became aware of art made in Africa by individual artists, thus breaking with the colonial tradition of assuming collective "ethnic" origins of so-called "tribal art" as found in most ethnographic collections.&lt;ref name="Firstenberg, Lauri 2003 p. 37-41"&gt;Firstenberg (2003). "Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art", in Farrell and Byvanck (eds), ''Looking Both Ways'', pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''Magiciens de la terre'' by [[Jean-Hubert Martin]] in 1989 is widely considered (but also challenged as) a key exhibition in this very recent history of international reception of African and other non-western art.  However, this reception, too, has its roots in an exotizing and mystifying view on African culture from a dominant western position, as [[Rasheed Araeen]] argued in his response to ''Magiciens de la terre''.&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"&gt;Araeen, Rasheed (1989). "Our Bauhaus Others' Mudhouse", ''Third Text'' no. 6, pp. 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Firstenberg, Lauri (2003). “Negotiating the Taxonomy of Contemporary African Art – Production, Exhibition, Commodification”, in Farrell, L. A., Byvanck, V. (eds), ''Looking both Ways: Art of the Contemporary African Diaspora''. New York: Museum for African Art, pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, although this exhibition and many that followed had a strong influence in creating a kind of a common understanding of what constitutes contemporary African art, it is true that it has been and still is subject to discussions and controversies. Almost every exhibition following ''Magiciens de la terre'' offered a taxonomy or system of categorization that helped to reflect the very notion of contemporary African art, but they failed to recognize the postcolonial need of giving up the Eurocentric epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;Mosquera, Gerardo (1995). “Das Marco-Polo-Syndrom”, in Hermanns, U. (ed.), ''Havanna. Sao Paulo. Junge Kunst aus Lateinamerika''. Berlin: Haus der Kulturen der Welt, p. 34-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firstenberg, Lauri 2003 p. 37-41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"&gt;Nzegwu, Nkiru (1998). "Introduction: Contemporary African Art and Exclusionary Politics", ''Issues in Contemporary African Art''. Binghamton, NY: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary African art is believed to feature particularities typical to African aesthetics while at the same time it shares properties with other international contemporary arts. Therefore, it is both, shaped by and feeding into the globalizing art worlds and art markets, like any other contemporary arts. At the same time, there are a lot of contemporary art practices and forms in African regions and cities that are almost exclusively locally known. While meeting all three requirements of being contemporary, art, and African, they fail to fit into a certain type of art production that has been spreading on the international art market in the last 30 years.

Exhibitions variously showed work by artists based in Africa; by artists using aesthetics typical to African traditions; by African artists living in the West but including aesthetics and topics related to their "roots";&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"/&gt; traditional artworks related to customary practices such as rituals; and urban African art that reflects the modern experience of cultural pluralism and hybridity. Modernity as a colonial and postcolonial experience appears as an intrinsic and significant attribute in most conceptions of contemporary African art. Scholars and curators therefore have proposed a wide range of taxonomies that tried firstly to define what is African about this art, and secondly, the range of genres it covers. Diverse attempts to define particular genres of contemporary African art however mirrored the fascination of art scholars and curators for the appropriation of cultural elements assumed "Western" into "African" modes of expression and traditions. One example is Marshall W. Mount&lt;ref&gt;Mount, Marshall W. (1973). ''African Art: The Years since 1920.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed four categories: first, "survivals of traditional styles", which show continuities in traditional working material and methods such as bronze casting or wood carving; secondly, art inspired by Christian missions; thirdly, souvenir art in the sense of tourist or airport art as defined later by Jules-Rossette;&lt;ref&gt;Jules-Rosette, Bennetta (1984). ''The Messages of Tourist Art: An African Semiotic System in Comparative Perspective.'' Boston: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, an emerging art requiring "techniques that were unknown or rare in traditional African art".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall W. Mount (1973) quoted in: Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). "'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts", in Vogel, S. (ed.), ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentin Y. Mudimbe in turn proposes to think of three currents rather than categories, namely a "tradition-inspired" one, a "modernist" trend, and "a popular art"&lt;ref name="Mudimbe, Valentin Y. 1991 p. 280"&gt;Mudimbe, Valentin Y. (1991). "'Reprendre': Enunciations and Strategies in Contemporary African Arts", in Vogel, S. (ed.), ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby Mount’s categories would be situated somewhere "between the tradition-inspired and the modernist trend”.&lt;ref name="Mudimbe, Valentin Y. 1991 p. 280"/&gt; Similar to other categorizations, this proposal considers the education of the artists as well as the envisaged clientele/patrons as important factors for the respective "currents". In the exhibition catalogue of ''Africa Explores'' (1991), curator Susan Vogel distinguished between "traditional art", "new functional art", "urban art", "international art", and "extinct art".&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Susan, ed. (1991). ''Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art''. Munich: Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting these categories, collector André Magnin proposed to group similar works into sections named "territory", "frontier" and "world" in his survey book ''Contemporary African Art'', thus placing them into "imaginary maps".&lt;ref&gt;Magnin, André, and Jacques Soulillou, eds (1996). ''Contemporary Art of Africa.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach was also criticized by Dele Jegede with convincing arguments against its ethnocentric perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Jegede, Dele (1998). "On Scholars and Magicians: A Review of 'Contemporary Art of Africa'", in Nzegwu, N. (ed.), ''Issues in Contemporary African Art''. Binghamton: International Society for the Study of Africa ISSA, pp. 187-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, he pointed to the hubris of attempts to talk about art of a whole continent, but also to the common reflex to exclude Northern Africa in such considerations and to follow a global rather than "particularistic focus on the study of the art of the continent" that would provide more specific and deeper bodies of knowledge. In the 1990 exhibition ''Contemporary African Artists: Changing Tradition'', the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] tried to take the perspective of the presented artists and distinguished between African artists who refuse outside influences; African artists who adopt modes of Western art; and African artists who fuse both strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Studio Museum, ed. (1990): ''Contemporary African Artists. Changing Tradition''. New York: Studio Museum in Harlem.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonality to all these categorizations is their reliance on dichotomies between art and craft, Europe and Africa, urban and rural, and traditional and contemporary. These dichotomies tend to consider mutual influences in African and European art as an exception rather than the norm. Even more, they fail to think of African art independent from Europe as its counterpart or "influence", resulting in a frequent reproach of African artists "copycatting" or "mimicking" European achievements of modernism.&lt;ref name="Oguibe, Olu 1999 p. 16-29"&gt;Oguibe, Olu (1999). "Art, Identity, Boundaries: Postmodernism and Contemporary African Art", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), ''Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace''. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 16–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). ''Contemporary African Art since 1980.'' Bologna: Damiani, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasfir, Sidney L. (1999). ''Contemporary African Art.'' London/New York: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; Such Eurocentric attitudes have been revealingly criticized by theorists such as [[Olu Oguibe]],&lt;ref name="Oguibe, Olu 1999 p. 16-29"/&gt; Rasheed Araeen,&lt;ref name="Araeen, Rasheed 1989 p. 3-16"/&gt; Nkiru Nzegwu,&lt;ref name="Nzegwu, Nkiru 1998 p. 1-18"/&gt; [[Okwui Enwezor]] or Salah Hassan.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Salah (1999). "The Modernist Experience in African Art: Visual Expressions of the Self and Cross-cultural Aesthetics", in Oguibe, O., and O. Enwezor (eds), ''Reading the Contemporary: African Art from Theory to the Marketplace''. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 214–235.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is not easy to solve, and in some cases it is tackled by simply subverting any attempt of categorization. ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa'', directed by [[Clémentine Deliss]] and curated by [[Chika Okeke-Agulu]], Salah Hassan, [[David Koloane]], Wanjiku Nyachae and El Hadji Sy (London, 1995) is a case in point.&lt;ref&gt;Deliss, Clémentine, ed. (1995). ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa.'' Paris/New York: Flammarion.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than grafting binary taxonomies, it narrated seven modern art histories in different parts of Africa by invited curators and artists who were familiar with these recent histories and their respective art scenes. The exhibition proved to offer a highly complex, historically informed and well-researched presentation. Another example for subverting binary taxonomies is the book ''Contemporary African Art after 1980'' by Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke-Agulu.&lt;ref&gt;Enwezor, Okwui, and Chika Okeke-Agulu (2009). ''Contemporary African Art since 1980.'' Bologna: Damiani.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than putting contemporary African art in relation to Western traditions, they contrast it with modern African art, in that it defies linear grand narratives of modernism and is radically postcolonial. "[F]irst, within categories of time, it is neither belated nor does it exist out of time; second, because it is post-historical, it did not emerge out of a succession of historical styles; third, because it is critical of colonial valorization of an authentic past, it is postcolonial; and fourth, in relation to its postcoloniality, it seeks, according to Hans Belting’s thesis, to be post-ethnic […]. Neither being out of time nor belated, contemporary African art strategically inhabits a third epistemological space by being in time."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As they add, this being "fundamentally of its time" counts for all contemporary art, not only the African. In their book, Enwezor and Okeke-Agulu discuss contemporary African art by its approaches and guiding topics rather than trying to define categories on the basis of styles, markets or traditions. Their chapters therefore are designated as "Between postcolonial utopia and postcolonial realism", "Networks of practice" in the globalized field of cultural production, "Politics, culture and critique", "Archive, document, memory", "Abstraction, figuration and subjectivity" and "The body politic: difference, gender, sexuality". Doing so, they locate contemporary African art within a historical perspective, something that had largely missed in previous discussions.

As of May 2016, the Executive Director is Suzy Delvalle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/arts/design/creative-capital-chooses-susan-delvalle-as-president-and-executive-director.html|title=Creative Capital Chooses Susan Delvalle as President and Executive Director|first=Joshua|last=Barone|date=10 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its first year, Creative Capital accepted 1,810 applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith|title=1,810 Artists Seek Grants From a New Foundation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/25/arts/1810-artists-seek-grants-from-a-new-foundation.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in part to offer support to artists affected by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]' (NEA) cuts to funding for individual artists in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="nymag-murphy" /&gt;

== Business model and artist services==
The Harvard Business School published a case study of the Creative Capital business model on March 24, 2010 titled "Creative Capital: Sustaining the Arts." In a description of the study, authors G. Felda Hardymon and Ann Leamon wrote about Creative Capital’s use of a venture capital model, investing in their awardees with money as well as advice on managing their careers so that they can continue improving their careers after they’ve spent the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardymon|first=G. Felda|author2=Ann Leamon|title=Creative Capital: Sustaining the Arts|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=March 24, 2010|pages=24|accessdate=9 October 2012|url=https://hbr.org/product/creative-capital-sustaining-the-arts/an/810098-PDF-ENG}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that sustainability, Creative Capital's system stipulates that awardees whose projects make a profit return a portion of those profits to the organization. Also, many former awardees of Creative Capital become advisors for new awardees.

Creative Capital's approach to artist services centers on the idea that time and advisory services are as important to the creative process as money.  As the awardee's funded project develops, Creative Capital staff meets with awardees to set goals and chart progress. Creative Capital provides funding at benchmark moments for each project, including initial funding, support to build the artist’s personal and professional capacity, follow-up support for project production, funding for the project’s premiere, and support for the project’s expansion beyond its premiere presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Approach|url=http://creative-capital.org/approach|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of this type of support, Sheryl Oring, a Creative Capital awarde, has said, "For mid-career artists like me, Creative Capital can help make the difference between whether we keep making art or give up."&lt;ref name="nymag-murphy" /&gt;

After each new round of awardees is announced, Creative Capital hosts a retreat for their artists, including the most recently announced awardees, those from the previous round, other awardees as consultants as well as people connected to Creative Capital in various ways who act as consultants, workshop leaders or observers. In various workshops and meetings with consultants, artists are taught how to plan the next five years of their lives, in terms of their artistic careers as well their own lives.&lt;ref name="nymag-murphy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Tim|title=Bohemian Boot Camp|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/19151/|publisher=nymag.com|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative Capital hosts a variety of events for its awardees to meet each other and others within the artistic community. Paddy Johnson has written in her noted arts blog, Art Fag City, "These conferences offer grantees an amazing opportunity to connect with other artists and a wide range of curators, distributors, and artistic directors through mixers, meetings with consultants, and artist presentations. They also ask grantees to return to the conference every couple of years, which keeps them in touch with a constantly expanding network of creative art folk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Paddy|title=Expanding The Creative Capital Network|url=http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/07/30/expanding-the-creative-capital-network/|publisher=Art Fag City|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional Development Program==
In 2003, Creative Capital founded its Professional Development Program (PDP) which offers a series of evening-, one-day- or weekend-length workshops for artists on marketing, strategic planning, self-management, fundraising, web strategies. In both presenting these workshops in-person nationally and broadcasting some online in the form of "webinars," the program shares skills taught to Creative Capital grantees with other artists across the U.S. These workshops have been described as a “crash course in self-management, strategic planning, fundraising and promotion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Annie|title=Workshop brings 'creative capital'|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/print-edition/2011/06/03/workshop-brings-creative-capital.html|accessdate=10 October 2012|newspaper=Nashville Business Journal|date=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defiant Theatre''' was a [[Chicago]]-based [[theatre]] company founded in 1993 by a group of students from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], which includes [[Nick Offerman]]. The eclectic troupe specialized in productions that emphasized inventive [[stagecraft]], perverse and controversial topics, and skillful [[stage combat]]. While the company is highly regarded for original plays such as ''Action Movie: The Play'' and ''Godbaby'', Defiant Theatre received notable attention for productions of plays by [[Caryl Churchill]], [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Sarah Kane]], and [[William Shakespeare]]. [[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago Magazine]] named Defiant the "Best Experimental Theatre" in their August 1999 Best of Chicago issue. The company disbanded in 2004.

[[Image:Ehrengräber Schild 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Sign, [[Zentralfriedhof]] in [[Vienna]]]]

An '''''Ehrengrab''''' ([[English language|English]]: 'grave of honor') is a distinction granted by certain German, Swiss and Austrian cities to some of their citizens for extraordinary services or achievements in their lifetimes.  If there are no descendants or institutions to care for the gravesites, the communities or cities will take responsibility for the graves and for financing their care.

Many ''Ehrengräber'' also serve to document cultural history; for example, when a cemetery containing artistically notable graves is closed and the graves are moved at public expense.

The basic details of the awarding, financing and care of honorary graves are similarly handled in all German-speaking countries.  Berlin and Vienna maintain the largest number of such sites.

== Cities ==

===  Berlin ===

[[Image:Berlin Ehrengrab.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone tablet ''Ehrengrab'' marker in Berlin]]
&lt;!-- 
[The following material is poorly translated from the German article]
--&gt;

In [[Berlin]] about 200 cemeteries contain approximately 740 tombs of honor with about 800 ''Ehrengräber'' (some tombs honor several members of the same family). Berlin public memorial graves are under the legislation of the Berlin Senate dating to 1952, labeled as "General Instructions for the recognition, transfer and maintenance ..." regarding tombs subject to benefits. The current basis is §12, Paragraph 6 of the "Law on the state-owned and non-state-owned cemeteries in Berlin" (Cemeteries Act) of 1 November 1995.

As such, Berlin provides at public expense honorary graves, available to:
# the dead, for whom the federal government or the government of a country has given a state funeral;
# the deceased, where the honorary title of ''Stadtältester'' has been granted to honorees and their spouses; and
# the deceased who were recipients of honorary pensions or awarded by Berlin for a particular service or have achieved excellence and whose memory lives on in public, as well as their spouses.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luise-berlin.de/ehrung/indexehr.htm Edition Luisenstadt honorary graves in Berlin] {{De-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who have such tombs of honor in Berlin are [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Wilhelm Busch]], [[Theodor Fontane]], [[Valeska Gert]], [[Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm|the brothers Grimm]], [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[Hildegard Knef]], [[Otto Lilienthal]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Marg Moll]], [[Helmut Newton]], [[Ernst Reuter]], [[Joachim Ringelnatz]], [[Heinrich Zille]], and [[Arnold Zweig]].

The Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery contains a socialist monument with graves of honor, among them are the socialists [[Karl Liebknecht]], and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].

===  Vienna ===

Graves of honor are called ''Gewidmete Gräber der Stadt Wien'' (Dedicated tombs of the City of Vienna). The name ''Ehrengräber'' is reserved for tombs in the Central Cemetery of Vienna. To make the cemetery more attractive, famous citizens such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] were exhumed and transferred to the cemetery. Funerary monuments were built for others, such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. Hundreds of graves of honor are found in cemeteries in Vienna.

===  Zurich ===

The city of [[Zurich]] maintains an anonymous tomb of honor near the Nordheim crematorium. It is a common tomb for people who have donated their bodies to the Anatomical Institute of the [[University of Zurich]] for the needs of science and wished that their urn would be stored there. Some graves originate from the medical faculties of universities in other cities of Switzerland, Germany and Austria, and the maintenance costs for the graves are generally borne by the responsible institutions.

'''''Erased de Kooning Drawing''''' is an early work of US artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]]: an almost blank piece of paper in a simple gilded frame.  The work was created in 1953 by Rauschenberg [[eraser|erasing]] a drawing he obtained from Dutch artist [[Willem de Kooning]].  Rauschenberg asked his friend [[Jasper Johns]] to add a written caption to the frame, which reads: "Erased de Kooning Drawing, Robert Rauschenberg, 1953”.  It is considered a [[Neo-Dada]]ist [[conceptual art]]work, with similarities affinities to [[Added Art]], although with material removed from the original work rather than added.  It has been held by the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] since 1998, which describes the work as a "drawing [with] traces of drawing media on paper with label and gilded frame".

==Development==
The work is a development from Rauschenberg's early [[Monochrome painting|monochrome]] white paintings that he first created in summer 1951.  After creating a series of completely blank white paintings, Rauschenberg set out to discover whether an artwork could be produced entirely through erasure.  He started with erasing his own drawings, but felt that the result was not sufficiently creative, so he decided to seek a drawing from another more established artist - clearly already a work of art - that he could erase.  He approached de Kooning, an artist he admired, to ask for a drawing that he could erase to create a new work of art.  After some persuasion, de Kooning gave Rauschenberg a densely worked drawing in crayon, ink, pencil and charcoal, deliberately steering away from works that he did not like, or simple pencil drawings that would be too easy for Rauschenberg to erase.   It took Rauschenberg approximately two months to obliterate as much of de Kooning drawing as he could, using a variety of different erasers.  The plain gilded frame and inscription by Jasper Johns are important parts of the work: without them, a viewer would struggle to interpret the work.

==Existing copies==
No photographs exist of the de Kooning work before its erasure, but digital photographs made by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2010 enhanced the remaining traces of the underlying drawing, although some may have been erased by de Kooning as part of the initial creation of the work before he gave it to Rauschenberg. De Kooning's original drawing appears to be studio sketch, with several figures facing in different directions, including at least one female, probably made with pencil and charcoal.

==Exhibitions==
The work, including its frame, measures {{convert|25.25|*|21.75|*|0.5|in|cm}}. It was not exhibited in public until 1963, but Rauschenberg would show it to visitors to his studio, and it became well known.  Some considered the destruction of a de Kooning drawing to be an act of vandalism; others recognised the concept of Rauschenberg's new work.  It was bought by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1998 using a gift from [[Phyllis Wattis]].

'''Figure–ground organization''' is a type of perceptual grouping which is a vital necessity for recognizing objects through vision. In [[Gestalt psychology]] it is known as identifying a ''figure'' from the back''ground''. For example, you see words on a printed paper as the "figure" and the white sheet as the "background".&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "Chapter 4: Sensation and Perception, Vision II: Recognizing What We Perceive." Psychology. ; Second Edition. N.p.: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 149-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The most famous example of figure–ground perception is probably the [[Rubin vase|faces–vase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin described]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (1921) ''Visuell Wahrgenommene Figuren : Studien in psychologischer Analyse''. Kobenhaven: Gyldendalske boghandel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (2001). Figure and Ground. In Yantis, S.(Ed.), ''Visual Perception''. (pp. 225-229). Philadelphia, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; This drawing exemplifies one of the key aspects of figure–ground organization, edge-assignment and its effect on shape perception. Notice in the faces/vase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the two curvy edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outwards, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will then settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them. Functional brain imaging shows that when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region &lt;ref&gt;Schacter, L.D., Gilbert, D.T., Wegner, D.M. (2011). "Psychology (2nd ed.)." New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasson, U., Hendler, T., Ben Bashat, D., and Malach, R. (2001). Vase or face? A neural correlate of shape-selective grouping processes in the human brain. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 13, 744–753.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual process==
How does the brain decide in a visual scene which item is the figure and which are part of the ground? This perceptual decision can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size helps us distinguish between the figure and the ground, since smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can help us distinguish figure from ground, because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue, because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. But it's at times difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is really part of neither, it equally defines both the figure and the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Evidently, the process of distinguishing figure from ground (sometimes called figure–ground segmentation) is inherently probabilistic, and the best that the brain can do is to take all relevant cues into account in order to generate a probabilistic best-guess. In this light, [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] figure–ground segmentation models have been proposed to simulate the probabilistic inference by which the brain may distinguish figure from ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|author2=Peterson, MA|title=A Bayesian observer replicates convexity context effects in figure–ground perception.|journal=Seeing and perceiving|year=2012|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=365–95|pmid=22564398|doi=10.1163/187847612X634445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=L|author2=Lee, L|title=Perceptual information processing system.|journal=USPatent Patent Application 10/618,543,|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic applications==
Figure–ground organization is used to help artists and designers in composition of a 2D piece. Figure–ground reversal may be used as an intentional [[visual design]] technique in which an existing image's foreground and background colors are purposely swapped to create new images.

==Non-visual==
Figure–ground perception can be expanded from visual perception to include abstract (i.e. non-visual) concepts such as melody/harmony, subject/background and positive/negative space.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2016}} The concept of figure and ground fully depends on the observer and not on the item itself.&lt;ref name="figure and ground"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R |title=Psychology the science of behaviour-figure and ground |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=USA |isbn=978-0-205-64524-4 |pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of figure–ground problems==
[[File:Star-jeans.jpg|thumb|Type 2: The actual ground is the figure.]]
There are three types of figure–ground problems:
#The figure and the ground compete.
#The figure should be the ground and the ground should be the figure.
#The figure and ground create an [[optical illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohr L. Creating Graphics for Learning and Performance: Lessons in Visual Literacy Cleveland, OH: Prentice-Hall, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Passed for White''''' is a 1960 film directed and adapted for the screen by [[Fred M. Wilcox (director)|Fred M. Wilcox]] from a novel of the same name by [[Reba Lee]] "as told to" [[Mary Hastings Bradley]]. The film stars [[Sonya Wilde]] and [[James Franciscus]] and features [[Jimmy Lydon]], Patricia Michon, and Isabel Cooley. It was released by [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] on March 18, 1960.

==Plot==
Bernice Lee ([[Sonya Wilde]]) is a young woman of mixed African and European ancestry, living in [[Chicago]] with her family, who is mistaken for a purely white woman by a white man, who tries to hit on her repeatedly. Her brother, more obviously of mixed heritage, fights off the man. Bernice's grandmother consoles her when she confides her troubles.

After a failed attempt at looking for employment as a black woman, she decides to leave town. She begins to use the name Lila Brownell and [[Passing (racial identity)|live as a white woman]]. On the plane to [[New York City]] she meets and eventually marries the man of her dreams – Rick Leyton ([[James Franciscus]]) – and fails to mention her African ancestry, an important omission as [[Interracial marriage in the United States|miscegenation]] is not [[Loving v. Virginia|a constitutional right]] in 1960. James and his wealthy family and friends are white. Her white friend Sally (Patricia Michon), and black maid Bertha (Isabel Cooley) both advise her not to tell him. She becomes pregnant, and fears the child will have black features or coloring – and gets a book to read about this unlikely possibility, which she hides.  Rick eventually discovers it and their maid claims the book belongs to her.

Lila goes into premature labor and has a stillborn child, but cries out "Is the baby black?" after she awakens from anesthesia. This leads Rick to suspect that his wife has been unfaithful. Eventually, she and her husband divorce without Bernice ever having revealed her true name or past. She then returns to her family in Chicago and her original identity.

{{update|reason=Only a single sentence regarding the "lost" Kubrick interview discovered in July 2018 has been tacked on to the end of the lede. This needs to be fleshed out in the article proper|date=September 2018}}
Since its premiere in 1968, the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' has been analysed and interpreted by numerous people, ranging from professional movie critics to amateur writers and science fiction fans. The director of the film, [[Stanley Kubrick]], and the writer, [[Arthur C. Clarke]], wanted to leave the film open to philosophical and allegorical interpretation, purposely presenting the final sequences of the film without the underlying thread being apparent; a concept illustrated by the final shot of the film, which contains the image of the embryonic "Starchild". Nonetheless, in July 2018, Kubrick's interpretation of the ending scene was presented after being newly found in an early interview.&lt;ref name="IW-20180705"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharf |first=Zack |title=‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ Lost Interview Goes Viral: Did Stanley Kubrick Finally Explain the Film’s Ending? - One of the most enigmatic movie endings in history becomes a little clearer with input from the man who directed it. |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/2001-a-space-odyssey-stanley-kubrick-explains-ending-video-1201981455/ |date=July 5, 2018 |work=[[IndieWire]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SYFY-20180705"&gt;{{cite web |last=Slayton |first=Nicholas |title=In Lost Interview, Stanley Kubrick Explains The Ending of 2001: A Space odyssey |url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/in-lost-interview-stanley-kubrick-explains-the-ending-of-2001-a-space-odyssey |date=July 5, 2018 |work=[[SyfyWire]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SF-20180706"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=Ben |title=Stanley Kubrick Explains The ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ Ending in Rediscovered Interview |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2001-a-space-odyssey-ending/ |date=July 6, 2018 |work=[[Slashfilm]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180418"&gt;{{cite news |last=Handy |first=Bruce |title=Sometimes a Broken Glass Is Just a Broken Glass + Comment |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/opinion/2001-a-space-odyssey-broken-glass.html?comments#permid=26617466 |date=April 5, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Openness to interpretation==
Kubrick encouraged people to explore their own interpretations of the film, and refused to offer an explanation of "what really happened" in the movie, preferring instead to let audiences embrace their own ideas and theories. In a 1968 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', Kubrick stated:

{{quote|You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film—and such speculation is one indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level—but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for ''2001'' that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point.&lt;ref&gt;Norden, Eric. Interview: Stanley Kubrick. Playboy (September 1968). Reprinted in: [[Gene D. Phillips|Phillips, Gene D.]] (Editor). ''Stanley Kubrick: Interviews''. University Press of Mississippi, 2001. {{ISBN|1-57806-297-7}} pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Neither of the two creators equated openness to interpretation with meaninglessness, although it might seem that Clarke implied as much when he stated, shortly after the film's release, "If anyone understands it on the first viewing, we've failed in our intention." When told of the comment, Kubrick said "I believe he made it [the comment] facetiously. The very nature of the visual experience in ''2001'' is to give the viewer an instantaneous, visceral reaction that does not—and should not—require further amplification."&lt;ref name='MCALEER'/&gt; When told that Kubrick had called his comment 'facetious', Clarke responded

{{quote|I still stand by this remark, which does not mean one can't enjoy the movie completely the first time around. What I meant was, of course, that because we were dealing with the mystery of the universe, and with powers and forces greater than man's comprehension, then by definition they could not be totally understandable. Yet there is at least one logical structure—and sometimes more than one—behind everything that happens on the screen in "2001", and the ending does not consist of random enigmas, some critics to the contrary.&lt;ref name='MCALEER'/&gt;}}

In a subsequent discussion of the film with Joseph Gelmis, Kubrick said his main aim was to avoid "intellectual verbalization" and reach "the viewer's subconscious". He said he did not deliberately strive for ambiguity, that it was simply an inevitable outcome of making the film non-verbal, though he acknowledged that this ambiguity was an invaluable asset to the film. He was willing then to give a fairly straightforward explanation of the plot on what he called the "simplest level", but unwilling to discuss the metaphysical interpretation of the film which he felt should be left up to the individual viewer.&lt;ref&gt;"The Film Director as Superstar" (Doubleday and Company: Garden City, New York, 1970) by Joseph Gelmis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clarke's novel as explanation==
[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|novel of the same name]] was developed simultaneously with the film, though published after its release.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Clarke, The Lost Worlds of 2001. London: Sidgwick and Jackson, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to explain the ending of the film more clearly. Clarke's novel explicitly identifies the monolith as a tool created by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic forms, through biomechanics, and finally has achieved a state of pure energy. The book explains the monolith much more specifically than the movie, depicting the first (on Earth) as a device capable of inducing a higher level of consciousness by directly interacting with the brain of pre-humans approaching it, the second (on the Moon) as an alarm signal designed to alert its creators that humanity had reached a sufficient technological level for space travel, and the third (near Jupiter in the movie but on a satellite of Saturn in the novel) as a gateway or portal to allow travel to other parts of the galaxy. It depicts Bowman traveling through some kind of [[interstellar space|interstellar]] switching station which the book refers to as "Grand Central," in which travelers go into a central hub and then are routed to their individual destinations. The book also depicts a crucial utterance by Bowman when he enters the portal via the monolith; his last statement is "Oh my God—it's full of stars!" This statement is not shown in the movie, but becomes crucial in the film based on the sequel, ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]''.

The book reveals that these aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Bowman explores the hotel room methodically, and deduces that it is a kind of zoo created by aliens—fabricated from information derived from television transmissions from Earth intercepted by the TMA-1 monolith—in which he is being studied by the invisible alien entities. He examines some food items provided for him, and notes that they are edible, yet clearly not made of any familiar substance from Earth. Kubrick's film leaves all this unstated.&lt;ref name='IRAMEAN'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palantir.net/2001/meanings/essay08.html |title=Authorship of 2001 |accessdate=2 February 2008 |last=DeMet |first=George |publisher=Palantir.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] urged those baffled by the film to read Clarke's novel:

{{quote|After seeing ''Space Odyssey'', I read Arthur Clarke's book. I found the book gripping and intellectually satisfying, full of the tension and clarity which the movie lacks. All the parts of the movie that are vague and unintelligible, especially the beginning and the end, become clear and convincing in the book. So I recommend to my middle-aged friends who find the movie bewildering that they should read the book; their teenage kids don't need to.&lt;ref name='MCALEER'&gt;{{cite book | last = McAleer | first = Neil | authorlink = | title = Arthur C. Clarke: The Authorized Biography | publisher = Contemporary Books | date = 1 December 1993 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8092-3720-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Clarke himself used to recommend reading the book, saying "I always used to tell people, 'Read the book, see the film, and repeat the dose as often as necessary'", although, as his biographer Neil McAleer points out, he was promoting sales of his book at the time.&lt;ref name='MCALEER'/&gt; Elsewhere he said, "You will find my interpretation in the novel; it is not necessarily Kubrick's. Nor is his necessarily the 'right' one – whatever that means."&lt;ref name='MCALEER'/&gt;

Film critic Penelope Houston noted in 1971 that the novel differs in many key respects from the film, and as such perhaps should not be regarded as the skeleton key to unlock it.&lt;ref name='KEY'&gt;{{cite book | last = Houston | first = Penelope | authorlink = | title = Sight and Sound International Film Quarterly, Volume 40 No. 2, Spring 1971 | publisher = British Film Institute | date = 1 April 1971 | location = London | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley Kubrick was less inclined to cite the book as a definitive interpretation of the film, but he also frequently refused to discuss any possible deeper meanings during interviews. During an interview with Joseph Gelmis in 1969 Kubrick explained:

{{quote|It's a totally different kind of experience, of course, and there are a number of differences between the book and the movie. The novel, for example, attempts to explain things much more explicitly than the film does, which is inevitable in a verbal medium. The novel came about after we did a 130-page prose treatment of the film at the very outset. This initial treatment was subsequently changed in the screenplay, and the screenplay in turn was altered during the making of the film. But Arthur took all the existing material, plus an impression of some of the rushes, and wrote the novel. As a result, there's a difference between the novel and the film. ... I think that the divergencies between the two works are interesting. Actually, it was an unprecedented situation for someone to do an essentially original literary work based on glimpses and segments of a film he had not yet seen in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Kubrick interviewed by Joseph Gelmis (1969) http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Author Vincent LoBrutto, in ''Stanley Kubrick: A Biography'', was inclined to note creative differences leading to a separation of meaning for book and film:

{{quote|The film took on its own life as it was being made, and Clarke became increasingly irrelevant. Kubrick could probably have shot 2001 from a treatment, since most of what Clarke wrote, in particular some windy voice-overs which explained the level of intelligence reached by the ape men, the geological state of the world at the dawn of man, the problems of life on the Discovery and much more, was discarded during the last days of editing, along with the explanation of HAL's breakdown."&lt;ref&gt;LoBrutto, Vincent. "Stanley Kubrick" Da Capo Press, 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-571-19393-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Religious interpretations==

In an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Kubrick said "On the deepest psychological level the film's plot symbolizes the search for [[God]], and it finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God . . . The film revolves around this metaphysical conception, and the realistic hardware and the documentary feelings about everything were necessary in order to undermine your built-in resistance to the poetical concept."&lt;ref name="KFAQ2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |title=The Kubrick FAQ (pt. 2) |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by [[Eric Nordern]] in Kubrick's interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' if ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' was a religious film, Kubrick elaborated:&lt;ref name="krusch-q12"&gt;[[#krusch-q12|The ALT.MOVIES.KUBRICK FAQ.]] Extract: [http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q12.html What did Kubrick have to say about what 2001 "means"?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I will say that the [[God]] concept is at the heart of ''2001'' but not any traditional, [[anthropomorphic]] image of God. I don't believe in any of Earth's [[monotheistic]] religions, but I do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our [[galaxy]] alone, that each star is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion galaxies in just the [[observable universe|visible universe]]. Given a planet in a stable orbit, [[Circumstellar habitable zone|not too hot and not too cold]], and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created by the interaction of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually emerge. It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are high. Now, the [[Sun]] is by no means an old star, and its planets are mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are billions of planets in the universe not only where intelligent life is on a lower scale than man but other billions where it is approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of thousands of millions of years in advance of us. When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made in a few millennia—less than a microsecond in the chronology of the universe—can you imagine the evolutionary development that much older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from [[Organism|biological species]], which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into [[immortality|immortal]] machine entities—and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the [[chrysalis]] of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and [[spirit]]. Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence ungraspable by humans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same interview, he also blames the poor critical reaction to ''2001'' as follows:&lt;ref name="krusch-q12"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps there is a certain element of the lumpen literati that is so dogmatically [[atheist]] and [[materialist]] and Earth-bound that it finds the grandeur of space and the myriad mysteries of cosmic intelligence [[anathema]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Allegorical interpretations==

The film has been seen by many people not only as a literal story about evolution and space adventures, but as an [[allegory|allegorical]] representation of aspects of philosophical, religious or literary concepts.

===Nietzsche allegory===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophical tract ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', about the potential of mankind, is directly referred to by the use of [[Richard Strauss]]'s musical piece of the same name.&lt;ref name="KFAQ2"/&gt; Nietzsche writes that man is a bridge between the ape and the [[Übermensch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nietzsche | first = Friedrich | authorlink = Friedrich Nietzsche | title = Thus Spoke Zarathustra | publisher = Penguin Classics| date = 1883 | location = | pages = Prologue section 3 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-81-7026-220-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in the ''New York Times'', Kubrick gave credence to interpretations of 2001 based on ''Zarathustra'' when he said: "Somebody said man is the missing link between primitive apes and civilized human beings.  You might say that is inherent in the story too. We are semicivilized, capable of cooperation and affection, but needing some sort of transfiguration into a higher form of life. Man is really in a very unstable condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In 2001, Will Love Be a Seven-Letter Word?|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/041468kubrick-2001.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the chapter ''Of the Three Metamorphoses'', Nietzsche identifies the child as the last step before the Uberman (after the camel and the lion), lending further support to this interpretation in light of the 'star-child' who appears in the final scenes of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nietzsche | first = Friedrich | authorlink = Friedrich Nietzsche | title = Thus Spoke Zarathustra | publisher = Penguin Classics| date = 1883 | location = | pages = Discourses section 1 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-14-044118-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald MacGregor has analysed the film in terms of a different work, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', in which Nietzsche refers to the human conflict between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] modes of being. The Apollonian side of man is rational, scientific, sober, and self-controlled. For Nietzsche a purely Apollonian mode of existence is problematic, since it undercuts the instinctual side of man. The Apollonian man lacks a sense of wholeness, immediacy, and primal joy. It is not good for a culture to be either wholly Apollonian or Dionysian. While the world of the apes at the beginning of ''2001'' is Dionysian, the world of travel to the moon is wholly Apollonian, and HAL is an entirely Apollonian entity. Kubrick's film came out just a year before the Woodstock rock festival, a wholly Dionysian affair. MacGregor argues that David Bowman in his transformation has regained his Dionysian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0013.html |title=The Kubrick Site: '2001' &amp; The Philosophy of Nietzsche |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict between humanity's internal [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysus and Apollo]] has been used as a lens through which to view many other Kubrick films especially ''A Clockwork Orange'', ''Dr. Strangelove'', ''Lolita'', and ''Eyes Wide Shut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.skadi.net/showthread.php?t=22137 |title=Kubrick &amp; Nietzsche – Skadi Forum |publisher=Forums.skadi.net |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conception allegory===
[[File:2001child2.JPG|thumb|right|The Star Child looking at the Earth]]

''2001'' has also been described as an allegory of human [[fertilisation|conception]], [[birth]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sheridan |first=Chris |title=Stanley Kubrick and Symbolism |url=http://www.chrissheridan.com/kubrick/2001.html |quote=Reproducing |accessdate=10 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321104428/http://www.chrissheridan.com/kubrick/2001.html |archivedate=21 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this can be seen through the final moments of the film, which are defined by the image of the "star child", an [[in utero]] fetus that draws on the work of [[Lennart Nilsson]].&lt;ref name="Burgoot2006p339"&gt;{{cite book | last = Burfoot | first1 = Annette | chapter = The Fetal Voyager: Women in Modern Medical Visual Discourse | editor = Shteir, Ann |editor2=Lightman, Bernard | date = 2006 | title = Figuring it out: science, gender, and visual culture | publisher = UPNE | isbn = 978-1-58465-603-6 | page = 339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The star child signifies a "great new beginning",&lt;ref name="Burgoot2006p339" /&gt; and is depicted naked and ungirded, but with its eyes wide open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Barry Keith | date = 2010 | title = Shadows of Doubt: Negotiations of Masculinity in American Genre Films | publisher = Wayne State University Press | isbn = 978-0-8143-3457-7 | page = 135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand journalist Scott MacLeod sees parallels between the spaceship's journey and the physical act of conception. We have the long, bulb-headed spaceship as a sperm, and the destination planet Jupiter (or the monolith floating near it) as the egg, and the meeting of the two as the trigger for the growth of a new race of man (the "star child"). The lengthy pyrotechnic light show witnessed by David Bowman, which has puzzled many reviewers, is seen by MacLeod as Kubrick's attempt at visually depicting the moment of conception, when the "star child" comes into being.&lt;ref name="WHEAT"/&gt;

Taking the allegory further, MacLeod argues that the final scenes in which Bowman appears to see a rapidly ageing version of himself through a "time warp" is actually Bowman witnessing the withering and death of his own species. The old race of man is about to be replaced by the "star child", which was conceived by the meeting of the spaceship and Jupiter. MacLeod also sees irony in man as a creator (of HAL) on the brink of being usurped by his own creation. By destroying HAL, man symbolically rejects his role as creator and steps back from the brink of his own destruction.&lt;ref name="WHEAT"/&gt;

Similarly, in his book, ''The Making of Kubrick's 2001'', author [[Jerome Agel]] puts forward the interpretation that [[Discovery One]] represents both a body (with vertebrae) and a sperm cell, with Bowman being the "life" in the cell which is passed on. In this interpretation, Jupiter represents both a female and an ovum.&lt;ref name='AGEL'&gt;{{cite book | last = Agel | first = Jerome | authorlink = | title = The Making of Kubrick's 2001 | publisher = Signet | date = 1 April 1970 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-451-07139-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheat's triple allegory===
An extremely complex three-level allegory is proposed by [[Leonard F. Wheat]] in his book, ''Kubrick's 2001: A Triple Allegory''. Wheat states that, "Most... misconceptions (of the film) can be traced to a failure to recognize that 2001 is an allegory – a surface story whose characters, events, and other elements symbolically tell a hidden story... In 2001's case, the surface story actually does something unprecedented in film or literature: it embodies three allegories." According to Wheat, the three allegories are:
# [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophical tract, ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', which is signalled by the use of [[Richard Strauss]]'s music of the same name. Wheat notes the passage in ''Zarathustra'' describing mankind as a [[acrobatics|rope dancer]] balanced between an [[ape]] and the [[Übermensch]], and argues that the film as a whole enacts an allegory of that image.
# [[Homer]]'s epic poem ''[[The Odyssey]]'', which is signalled in the film's title. Wheat notes, for example, that the name "Bowman" may refer to [[Odysseus]], whose story ends with a demonstration of his prowess as an [[archery|archer]]. He also follows earlier scholars in connecting the one-eyed HAL with the [[Cyclops]], and notes that Bowman kills HAL by inserting a small key, just as Odysseus blinds the Cyclops with a stake.&lt;ref name="WHEAT"/&gt; Wheat argues that the entire film contains references to almost everything that happens to Odysseus on his travels; for example, he interprets the four spacecraft seen orbiting the Earth immediately after the ape sequence as representing [[Hera]], [[Athena]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the protagonists of the [[Judgment of Paris]], which begins the [[Epic Cycle]] events of the [[Trojan War]] that conclude in Homer's ''Odyssey''.
# [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s theory of the future symbiosis of man and machine, expanded by Kubrick into what Wheat calls "a spoofy three-evolutionary leaps scenario": ape to man, an abortive leap from man to machine, and a final, successful leap from man to 'Star Child'.&lt;ref name="WHEAT"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wheat | first = Leonard | authorlink = | title = 'Kubrick's 2001: A Triple Allegory' | publisher = Scarecrow Press | date = 21 June 2000 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8108-3796-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wheat uses acronyms, as evidence to support his theories. For example, of the name ''Heywood R. Floyd'', he writes "''He'' suggests Helen – [[Helen of Troy]]. ''Wood'' suggests wooden horse – the [[Trojan Horse]]. And ''oy'' suggests [[Troy]]." Of the remaining letters, he suggests "''Y'' is Spanish for ''and''. ''R'', ''F'', and ''L'', in turn, are in ''R''e''FL''ect." Finally, noting that ''D'' can stand for ''downfall'', Wheat concludes that Floyd's name has a hidden meaning: "Helen and Wooden Horse Reflect Troy's Downfall".&lt;ref name="WHEAT"/&gt;

==The Monolith==
As with many elements of the film, the iconic [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]] has been subject to countless interpretations, including religious, alchemical,&lt;ref&gt;Elsholz, Jean-Marc. "''2001 : L'Odyssée de l'espace'', Le Grand Œuvre", ''Positif'' no. 439 (September 1997): 87–92.&lt;/ref&gt; historical, and evolutionary. To some extent, the very way in which it appears and is presented allows the viewer to project onto it all manner of ideas relating to the film. The Monolith in the movie seems to represent and even trigger epic transitions in the history of [[human evolution]], evolution of man from [[ape]]-like beings to civilised people, hence the [[odyssey]] of mankind.&lt;ref name='COLLINS'&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = Paul | authorlink = |author2=Phillip | title = The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship: An Examination of Epistemic Autocracy, From the 19th to the 21st Century | publisher = BookSurge Publishing | date = 23 June 2006 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-4196-3932-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='MKZINE'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkzine.com/Essays/Twi-Semiotic%20Deception.html |title=The Semiotic Deception of September 11th |accessdate=2 February 2008 |last=Collins |first=Phillip |publisher=mkzine.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215004452/http://www.mkzine.com/Essays/Twi-Semiotic%20Deception.html |archivedate=15 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent LoBrutto's biography of Kubrick notes that for many, Clarke's novel is the key to understanding the monolith.&lt;ref name='LOB'&gt;{{cite book |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography |publisher=Da Capo |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-306-80906-4 |quote=0-306-80906-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|310}} Similarly, Geduld observes that "the monolith ...has a very simple explanation in Clarke's novel", though she later asserts that even the novel does not fully explain the ending.

''Rolling Stone'' reviewer Bob McClay sees the film as a four-movement symphony, its story told with "deliberate realism".&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in {{cite book |title=The making of 2001, a space odyssey|last=Schwam |first=Stephanie |authorlink= |date=2000 |publisher= Random House | isbn=0-375-75528-4|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Geduld believes that what "structurally unites all four episodes of the film" is the monolith, the film's largest and most unresolvable enigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Filmguide to 2001: a space odyssey |last=Geduld |first=Carolyn |authorlink= |date=1973 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location= |isbn= |pages=40, 63 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each time the monolith is shown, man transcends to a different level of [[cognition]], linking the [[Protohistory|primeval]], [[futuristic]] and [[Mysticism|mystic]] segments of the film.&lt;ref name='TWOT'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/twot.html |title=2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) |accessdate=5 February 2008 |last=Dirks |first=Tim |work=The Greatest Films of All Time |publisher=filmsite.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; McClay's ''Rolling Stone'' review notes a parallelism between the monolith's first appearance in which tool usage is imparted to the apes and the completion of "another evolution" in the fourth and final encounter with the monolith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The making of 2001, a space odyssey|last=Schwam |first=Stephanie |authorlink= |date=2000 |publisher= Random House|isbn=0-375-75528-4|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Tim Dirks ends his synopsis saying "The cyclical evolution from ape to man to spaceman to angel-starchild-superman is complete".&lt;ref name="filmsite.org"/&gt;

The monolith appears four times in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'': on the African savanna, on the moon, in space orbiting Jupiter, and near Bowman's bed before his transformation. After the first encounter with the monolith, we see the leader of the apes have a quick flashback to the monolith after which he picks up a bone and uses it to smash other bones. Its usage as a weapon enables his tribe to defeat the other tribe of apes occupying the water hole who have not learned how to use bones as weapons. After this victory, the ape-leader throws his bone into the air, after which the scene shifts to an orbiting weapon four million years later, implying that the discovery of the bone as a weapon inaugurated human evolution, hence the much more advanced orbiting weapon 4 million years later.&lt;ref name="filmsite.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/twot.html |title=2001: A Space Odyssey |author=Tim Dirks |work= |publisher=AMC |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and second encounters of humanity with the monolith have visual elements in common; both apes, and later astronauts, touch the monolith gingerly with their hands, and both sequences conclude with near-identical images of the sun appearing directly over the monolith (the first with a crescent moon adjacent to it in the sky, the second with a near-identical crescent Earth in the same position), both echoing the sun–earth–moon [[Syzygy (astronomy)|alignment]] seen at the very beginning of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/twot.html |title=2001: A Space Odyssey |author=Tim Dirks |work= |publisher=AMC |accessdate=25 February 2011}} He notes that in the ape encounter "With the mysterious monolith in the foreground, the glowing Sun rises over the black slab, directly beneath the crescent of the Moon." and that on the moon "Again, the glowing Sun, Moon and Earth have formed a conjunctive orbital configuration."&lt;/ref&gt; The second encounter also suggests the triggering of the monolith's radio signal to Jupiter by the presence of humans,&lt;ref&gt;See original Rolling Stone review by Bob McClay reproduced in {{cite book |title=The making of 2001, a space odyssey |last=Schwam |first=Stephanie |authorlink= |date=2000 |publisher= Random House|isbn= 9780375755286 |pages=164–165 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the premise of Clarke's source story "The Sentinel".

In the most literal narrative sense, as found in the concurrently written novel, the Monolith is a tool, an artifact of an alien civilisation. It comes in many sizes and appears in many places, always in the purpose of advancing intelligent life. Arthur C. Clarke has referred to it as "the alien Swiss Army Knife";&lt;ref name='LOB'/&gt; or as [[Heywood Floyd]] speculates in ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', "an emissary for an intelligence beyond ours. A shape of some kind for something that has no shape."

The fact that the first tool used by the protohumans is a weapon to commit murder is only one of the challenging evolutionary and philosophic questions posed by the film. The tool's link to the present day is made by the famous graphic match from the bone/tool flying into the air, to a weapon orbiting the earth. At the time of the movie's making, the space race was in full swing, and the use of space and technology for war and destruction was seen as a great challenge of the future.&lt;ref name='INTERP'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/46/2001.htm |title=The Interpretative Odyssey of 2001 |accessdate=5 February 2008 |last=Castle |first=Robert |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the use of tools also allowed mankind to survive and flourish over the next 4 million years, at which point the monolith makes its second appearance, this time on the Moon. Upon excavation, after remaining buried beneath the lunar surface for 4 million years, the monolith is examined by humans for the first time, and it emits a powerful radio signal—the target of which becomes Discovery One's mission.

In reading Clarke or Kubrick's comments, this is the most straightforward of the monolith's appearances. It is "calling home" to say, in effect, "they're here!" Some species visited long ago has not only evolved intelligence, but intelligence sufficient to achieve space travel. Humanity has left its cradle, and is ready for the next step. This is the point of connection with Clarke's earlier short story, "[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]", originally cited as the basis for the entire film.

The third time we see a monolith marks the beginning of the film's most cryptic and psychedelic sequence, interpretations of the last two monolith appearances are as varied as the film's viewers. Is it a "star gate," some giant cosmic router or transporter? Are all of these visions happening inside Bowman's mind? And why does he wind up in some cosmic hotel suite at the end of it?&lt;ref name='TWOT'/&gt;

According to Michael Hollister in his book ''Hollyworld'', the path ''beyond the infinite'' is introduced by the vertical alignment of planets and moons with a perpendicular monolith forming a cross, as if the astronaut is about to become a new [[salvation|saviour]]. Bowman lives out his years alone in a neoclassical room, brightly lit from underneath, that evokes the [[Age of Enlightenment]], decorated with classical art.&lt;ref name='HWORLD'&gt;{{cite book | last = Hollister | first = Michael | authorlink = | title = Hollyworld | publisher = AuthorHouse | date = 25 July 2006 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-4259-4657-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bowman's life quickly passes in this neoclassical room, the monolith makes its final appearance: standing at the foot of his bed as he approaches death. He raises a finger toward the monolith, a gesture that alludes to the [[Michelangelo]] painting of ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', with the monolith representing God.&lt;ref name='HOLLISTER'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelhollister.com/reviews/2001ASpaceOdyssey.htm |title=2001: A Space Odyssey |accessdate=4 February 2008 |last=Hollister |first=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monolith is the subject of the film's final line of dialogue (spoken at the end of the "Jupiter Mission" segment): "Its origin and purpose still a total mystery". Reviewers McClay and [[Roger Ebert]] have noted that the monolith is the main element of mystery in the film, Ebert writing of "The shock of the monolith's straight edges and square corners among the weathered rocks", and describing the apes warily circling it as prefiguring man reaching "for the stars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19680412/REVIEWS/804120301/1023 |title=2001: A Space Odyssey |author= Roger Ebert|work= |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Webster suggests the final line relates to how the film should be approached as a whole, noting "The line appends not merely to the discovery of the monolith on the moon, but to our understanding of the film in the light of the ultimate questions it raises about the mystery of the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Love and Death in Kubrick:A Critical Study of the Films from Lolita Through Eyes Wide Shut |last=Webster |first=Patrick |authorlink= |date=2010 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=9780786459162 |page=66 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerard Loughlin]] claimed in a 2003 book that the monolith is Kubrick's representation of the cinema [[Projection screen|screen]] itself: “it is a cinematic conceit, for turn the monolith on its side and one has the letterbox of the cinemascope screen, the blank rectangle on which the star-child appears, as does the entirety of Kubrick’s film."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5WZwCtrqJ8kC&amp;pg=PA73 Gerard Loughlin p73 "Alien Sex: The Body and Desire in Cinema and Theology" (first edition 2003 Oxford: Blackwell. Challenges in contemporary theology)]&lt;/ref&gt; The internet-based film critic Rob Ager later produced a video essay also espousing this theory. The academic Dan Leberg complained that Ager had not credited Loughlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnovisjournal.org/2011/08/08/fanboys-in-the-ivory-tower-an-attempted-reconciliation-of-science-fiction-film-academia-and-fan-culture/ "Fanboys in the Ivory Tower: An Attempted Reconciliation of Science Fiction Film Academia and Fan Culture" By Dan Leberg – Gnovis Journal Volume XI Issue II Spring 2011 – August 8th, 2011 ].&lt;/ref&gt;

== HAL ==
[[File:HAL9000.svg|thumb|Artist's rendering of HAL 9000's camera eye]]
The [[HAL 9000]] has been compared to [[Frankenstein's monster]]. HAL is an artificial intelligence, a sentient, synthetic, life form. According to John Thurman, HAL’s very existence is an abomination, much like Frankenstein’s monster. "While perhaps not overtly monstrous, HAL’s true character is hinted at by his physical 'deformity'. Like a Cyclops he relies upon a single eye, examples of which are installed throughout the ship. The eye’s warped wide-angle point-of-view is shown several times—notably in the drawings of hibernating astronauts (all of whom HAL will later murder)."&lt;ref name='WPTHURMAN'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cineprism.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/kubrick%E2%80%99s-frankenstein-hal-in-2001-a-space-odyssey/ |title=Kubrick's Frankenstein: HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey |accessdate=8 February 2008 |last=Thurman |first=John |work=Cinema Prism |publisher=Kubrick's Frankenstein: HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick underscores the Frankenstein connection with a scene that virtually reproduces the style and content of a scene from [[James Whale]]’s 1931 ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. The scene in which Frankenstein's monster is first shown on the loose is borrowed to depict the first murder by HAL of a member of Discovery One's crew—the empty pod, under HAL's control, extends its arms and "hands", and goes on a "rampage" directed towards astronaut Poole. In each case, it is the first time the truly odious nature of the "monster" can be recognised as such, and only appears about halfway through the film.

Clarke has suggested in interviews, his original novel, and in a rough draft of the shooting script that HAL's orders to lie to the astronauts (more specifically, concealing the true nature of the mission) drove him "insane".&lt;ref&gt;This is the subject of Chapter 27 of the novel.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel does include the phrase "He [HAL] had been living a lie"—a difficult situation for an entity programmed to be as reliable as possible. Or as desirable, given his programming to "only win 50% of the time" at chess, in order for the human astronauts to feel competitive. Clarke also gives an explanation of the ill-effects of HAL being ordered to lie in computer terms as well as psychological terms, stating HAL is caught in a "[[Möbius strip|Möbius]] [[feedback loop]]."

While the film remains ambiguous, one can see evidence in the film that since HAL was instructed to deceive the mission astronauts as to the actual nature of the mission and that deception opens a Pandora's box of possibilities. During a [[Poole versus HAL 9000|game of chess]], although easily victorious over Frank Poole, HAL makes a subtle mistake in the use of [[descriptive notation]] to describe a move, and when describing a [[forced mate]], fails to mention moves that Poole could make to delay defeat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chess.com/article/view/2001-a-chess-space-odyssey 2001: A Chess Space Odyssey] ''Chess.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Poole is seen to be mouthing his moves to himself during the game and it is later revealed that HAL can lip read. HAL's conversation with Dave Bowman just before the diagnostic error of the AE-35 unit that communicates with Earth is an almost paranoid question and answer session ("Surely one could not be unaware of the strange stories circulating...rumors about something being dug up on the moon...") where HAL skirts very close to the pivotal issue concerning which he is concealing information. When Dave states "You're working up your crew psychology report," HAL takes a few seconds to respond in the affirmative. Immediately following this exchange, he errs in diagnosing the antenna unit. HAL has been introduced to the unique and alien concept of human dishonesty. He does not have a sufficiently layered understanding of human motives to grasp the need for this and trudging through the tangled web of lying complications, he falls prey to human error.

The follow-up film ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'' further elaborates Clarke's explanation of HAL's breakdown. While HAL was under orders to deny the true mission with the crew, he was programmed at a deep level to be completely accurate and infallible. This conflict between two key directives led to him taking any measures to prevent Bowman and Poole finding out about this deception. Once Poole had been killed, others were eliminated to remove any witnesses to his failure to complete the mission.

One interesting aspect of HAL's plight, noted by Roger Ebert, is that this supposedly perfect computer actually behaves in the most human fashion of all of the characters.&lt;ref name='RE'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970327/REVIEWS08/401010362/1023 | title = 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) | accessdate = 13 May 2011 | last = Ebert | first = Roger | date = 27 March 1997 | publisher = [[rogerebert.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has reached human intelligence levels, and seems to have developed human traits of paranoia, jealousy and other emotions. By contrast, the human characters act like machines, coolly performing their tasks in a mechanical fashion, whether they are mundane tasks of operating their craft or even under extreme duress as Dave must be following HAL's murder of Frank. For instance, Frank Poole watches a birthday transmission from his parents with what appears to be complete apathy.

Although the film leaves it mysterious, early script drafts made clear that HAL's breakdown is triggered by authorities on Earth who order him to withhold information from the astronauts about the purpose of the mission (this is also explained in the film's sequel ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]''). Frederick Ordway, Kubrick's science advisor and technical consultant, stated that in an earlier script Poole tells HAL there is "...&amp;nbsp;something about this mission that we weren't told. Something the rest of the crew knows and that you know. We would like to know whether this is true", to which HAL responds: "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know."&lt;ref name="visual-memory_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0075.html |title=The Kubrick Site: Fred Ordway on "2001" |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; HAL then falsely predicts a failure of the hardware maintaining radio contact with Earth (the source of HAL's difficult orders) during the broadcast of Frank Poole's birthday greetings from his parents.

The final script removed this explanation, but it is hinted at when HAL asks David Bowman if Bowman is bothered by the "oddities" and "tight security" surrounding the mission. After Bowman concludes that HAL is dutifully drawing up the "crew psychology report", the computer makes his false prediction of hardware failure. Another hint occurs at the moment of HAL's deactivation when a video reveals the purpose of the mission.

== Military nature of orbiting satellites ==
Stanley Kubrick originally intended, when the film does its famous match-cut from prehistoric bone-weapon to orbiting satellite, that the latter and the three additional satellites seen be established as orbiting nuclear weapons by a voice-over narrator talking about nuclear stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;See Alexander Walker's book ''Stanley Kubrick, Director'' p.&amp;nbsp;181–182. This is the 2000 edition. The 1971 edition is titled "Stanley Kubrick Directs".&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Kubrick intended that the Star Child would detonate the weapons at the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|2000|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Kubrick decided that this would create too many associations with his previous film ''Dr. Strangelove'' and he decided not to make it so obvious that they were "war machines".&lt;ref name=Bizony&gt;{{cite book | last = Bizony | first = Piers |authorlink=Piers Bizony | title = 2001 Filming the Future | publisher = Sidgwick and Jackson | date = 2001 | location = London | isbn = 1-85410-706-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick was also confronted with the fact that, during the production of the film, the US and USSR had agreed not to put any nuclear weapons into [[outer space]] by signing the [[Outer Space Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article IV]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}

[[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]] in a book he wrote with Kubrick's assistance and authorisation, states that Kubrick eventually decided that as nuclear weapons the bombs had "no place at all in the film's thematic development", now being an "orbiting red herring" which would "merely have raised irrelevant questions to suggest this as a reality of the twenty-first century".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|2000|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Canadian TV documentary ''2001 and Beyond'', Clarke stated that not only was the military purpose of the satellites "not spelled out in the film, there is no need for it to be", repeating later in this documentary that "Stanley didn't want to have anything to do with bombs after Dr. Strangelove".&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite video | people = Michael Lennick | date= 7 January 2001 |title=2001 and Beyond |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437770/combined |medium = television | publisher = Discovery Channel Canada |location=Canada |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''New York Times'' interview in 1968, Kubrick merely referred to the satellites as "spacecraft", as does the interviewer, but he observed that the match-cut from bone to spacecraft shows they evolved from "bone-as-weapon", stating "It's simply an observable fact that all of man's technology grew out of his discovery of the weapon-tool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiviokubrick.it/english/words/interviews/1968love.html |title=In 2001, Will Love Be a Seven-letter Word? |author=William Kloman |date=14 April 1968 |work=archiviokubrick|accessdate=31 August 2010}} The interview is available from many other online sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing in the film calls attention to the purpose of the satellites. James John Griffith, in a footnote in his book ''Adaptations As Imitations: Films from Novels'', wrote "I would wonder, for instance, how several critics, commenting on the match-cut that links humanity's prehistory and future, can identify—without reference to Clarke's novel—the satellite as a nuclear weapon".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur C. Clarke, in the TV documentary ''2001: The Making of a Myth'', described the bone-to-satellite sequence in the film, saying "The bone goes up and turns into what is supposed to be an orbiting space bomb, a weapon in space. Well, that isn't made clear, we just assume it's some kind of space vehicle in a three-million-year jump cut".&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite video |people=Joyce, Paul (director) Doran, Jamie (producer) Bizony, Piers (assoc. producer) |date=2001 |title=2001: The Making of a Myth |medium=Television production |publisher=Channel Four Television Corp. | location=UK | time=15:56 |ref=ID }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This documentary is featured on the 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) Special Edition DVD released in 2007. Clarke also referred to the "bone-to-bomb cut" in the earlier "Channel 4" documentary (1996) on Kubrick's larger body of work "The Invisible Man".&lt;/ref&gt; Former NASA research assistant Steven Pietrobon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sworld.com.au/steven/ |title=Steven S. Pietrobon |publisher=Sworld.com.au |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "The orbital craft seen as we make the leap from the Dawn of Man to contemporary times are supposed to be weapons platforms carrying nuclear devices, though the movie does not make this clear."&lt;ref name="2001 Studio Model Reference Page"/&gt;

The vast majority of film critics, including noted Kubrick authority Michel Ciment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kubrick: The Definitive Edition |last=Ciment|first=Michel|origyear=1980|date=1999|publisher=Calmann-Levy|isbn=0-571-19986-0 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted the satellites as generic spacecraft (possibly Moon bound).&lt;ref&gt;See numerous reviews on "The Kubrick Site" [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/] and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception that the satellites ''are'' nuclear weapons persists in the minds of some viewers (and some space scientists). Due to their appearance there are statements by members of the production staff who still refer to them as weapons. Walker, in his book ''Stanley Kubrick, Director'', noted that although the bombs no longer fit in with Kubrick's revised thematic concerns, "nevertheless from the national markings still visible on the first and second space vehicles we see, we can surmise that they are the Russian and American bombs."&lt;ref&gt;See Alex Walker's book "Stanley Kubrick, Director p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Walker in a later essay&lt;ref&gt;''The making of 2001, a space odyssey'' by Stephanie Schwam p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that two of the spacecraft seen circling Earth were meant to be nuclear weapons, after asserting that early scenes of the film "imply" nuclear stalemate. Pietrobon, who was a consultant on ''2001'' to the Web site ''Starship Modeler'' regarding the film's props, observes small details on the satellites such as Air Force insignia and "cannons".&lt;ref&gt;Pietrobon himself puts the word "cannons" in quotation marks, perhaps to indicate the ambiguity of the structure.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, [[US Air Force]] insignia, and flag insignia of [[flag of the People's Republic of China|China]] and [[flag of Germany|Germany]] (including what appears to be an [[Iron Cross]]) can be seen on three of the satellites,&lt;ref&gt;Pietrobon notes on the Starship Modeler website [http://www.starshipmodeler.com/2001/2001ref.htm] that the markings on the first and second satellites seen denote them as American and German respectively. The Iron Cross can be seen in close-up at [http://www.starshipmodeler.com/2001/bmb5_cr.jpg]. Pietrobon states "It's unclear as to where that is a functional detail, such as an RCS thruster, or whether this model was supposed to represent something from the modern German arsenal." See 20:07 in 2007 DVD issue of film.&lt;/ref&gt; which correspond to three of the bombs stated countries of origin in a widely circulated early draft of the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0057.html |title=The Kubrick Site: The '2001' Screenplay (1965) |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production staff who continue to refer to "bombs" (in addition to Clarke) include production designer Harry Lange (previously a space industry illustrator), who has since the film's release shown his original production sketches for all of the spacecraft to Simon Atkinson, who refers to seeing "the orbiting bombs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.underview.com/bhpatfilming.html |title=The Underview: Simon Atkinson |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Ordway, the film's science consultant, sent a memo to Kubrick after the film's release listing suggested changes to the film, mostly complaining about missing narration and shortened scenes. One entry reads: "Without warning, we cut to the orbiting bombs. And to a short, introductory narration, missing in the present version".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0075.html |title=The Kubrick Site: Fred Ordway on "2001" |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple production staff aided in the writing of Jerome Agel's 1970 book on the making of the film, in which captions describe the objects as "orbiting satellites carrying nuclear weapons"&lt;ref&gt;p. 88 within the somewhat lengthy photo insert which has no page numbering. Note on pg. 72 states "Captions on the following pages were prepared with the assistance of Messrs. Kubrick, Clarke, Trumball, and Pederson."&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Gary Lockwood (astronaut Frank Poole) in the audio DVD commentary&lt;ref name="2001:A Space Odyssey"&gt;{{cite video | people=Jan Harlan, Stanley Kubrick |date=October 2007 |title=2001:A Space Odyssey |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/31212/2001-a-space-odyssey-two-disc-special-edition/ |format=DVD |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Bros |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; says the first satellite is an armed weapon, making the famous match-cut from bone to satellite a "weapon-to-weapon cut". Several recent reviews of the film mostly of the DVD release refer to armed satellites,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/31297/2001-a-space-odyssey/] [http://www.dvdsavant.com/s2444spac.html]{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/2001twodisc.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216182533/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/2001twodisc.php |archivedate=16 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}[http://www.notcoming.com/reviews/2001]&lt;/ref&gt; possibly influenced by Gary Lockwood's audio commentary.

A few published works by scientists on the subject of space exploration or space weapons tangentially discuss ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and assume at least some of the orbiting satellites are space weapons.&lt;ref&gt;''Military Space Power: A Guide to the Issues (Contemporary Military, Strategic, and Security Issues)'' by James Fergusson &amp; Wilson Wong. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to space: the science of spaceflight'' by Thomas Damon.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, details worked out with input from space industry experts, such as the structure on the first satellite that Pietrobon refers to as a "conning tower", match the original concept sketch drawn for the nuclear bomb platform.&lt;ref name="2001 Studio Model Reference Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starshipmodeler.com/2001/2001ref.htm |title=2001 Studio Model Reference Page |publisher=Starship Modeler |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bizony|2001|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modelers label them in diverse ways. On the one hand, the ''2001'' exhibit (given in that year) at the Tech Museum in San Jose and now online (for a subscription) referred merely to "satellites",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2001exhibit.org/exhibits/france/exhibit/exhibit4.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717100033/http://www.2001exhibit.org/exhibits/france/exhibit/exhibit4.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 July 2012 |title=2OO1: exhibit.org&amp;nbsp;– Exhibitions |publisher=2001exhibit.org |accessdate=22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while a special modelling exhibition at the exhibition hall at Porte de Versailles in Paris also held in 2001 (called ''2001 l'odyssée des maquettes (2001: A Modeler's Odyssey)'') overtly described their reconstructions of the first satellite as the "US Orbiting Weapons Platform".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rider |first=Chuck |url=http://www.arapress.com/planete_s2.php |title=Dixième Planète Special Issue No. 2 |publisher=ARA Press |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203172217/http://arapress.com/planete_s2.php |archivedate=3 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some, but not all, space model manufacturers or amateur model builders refer to these entities as bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comet-miniatures.com/browse.php?s_categ=2&amp;zone=11] calls them bombs, model manufacturer AJAMODELS manufactures a model of the German "satellite"[http://www.modelermagic.com/?p=19751]. Website [http://www.planet3earth.co.uk/Orion_2_cargoplane.htm] describes their model in the text as an "orbital satellite" appearing in quotes but the image's internal jpeg title calls it a bomb.&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception that the satellites are bombs persists in the mind of some but by no means all commentators on the film. This may affect one's reading of the film as a whole. Noted Kubrick authority [[Michel Ciment]], in discussing Kubrick's attitude toward human aggression and instinct, observes "The bone cast into the air by the ape (now become a man) is transformed at the other extreme of civilization, by one of those abrupt ellipses characteristic of the director, into a spacecraft on its way to the moon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0108.html The Kubrick Site: Slavoj Zizek on Eyes Wide Shut&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Ciment's reading of a cut to a serene "other extreme of civilization", [[List of science fiction authors|science fiction novelist]] [[Robert J. Sawyer|Robert Sawyer]], speaking in the Canadian documentary ''2001 and Beyond'', sees it as a cut from a bone to a nuclear weapons platform, explaining that "what we see is not how far we've leaped ahead, what we see is that today, '2001', and four million years ago on the African veldt, it's exactly the same—the power of mankind is the power of its weapons. It's a continuation, not a discontinuity in that jump."&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;

Kubrick, notoriously reluctant to provide any explanation of his work, never publicly stated the intended functions of the orbiting satellites, preferring instead to let the viewer surmise what their purpose might be.

'''''Isle of the Dead''''' ({{lang-de|Die Toteninsel}}) is the best-known painting of [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] artist [[Arnold Böcklin]] (1827–1901). Prints were very popular in central Europe in the early 20th century—[[Vladimir Nabokov]] observed in his novel ''[[Despair (novel)|Despair]]'' that they could be "found in every Berlin home".&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, Vladimir (1936; English translations 1937, 1965), ''[[Despair (novel)|Despair]]'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Böcklin produced several different versions of the mysterious painting between 1880 and 1901.

== Description and meaning ==
All versions of ''Isle of the Dead'' depict a desolate and rocky islet seen across an expanse of dark water. A small rowboat is just arriving at a [[water gate]] and [[seawall]] on shore.&lt;ref&gt;That the boaters are arriving at, and not departing from, the island is an assumption. The oarsman is positioned to row ''away'' from the shore, but in some versions the ripples of the boat’s wake suggest that they are moving forward. Hubert, Locher (2004), "Arnold Böcklin: Die Toteninsel. Traumbild des 19. Jahrhunderts"; In: ''Kunsthistorische Arbeitsblätter'' [Translation: "Arnold Böcklin: The Isle of the Dead; Dream Image of the 19th Century"; In: ''Art History Worksheets''], ''[[Zeitschrift für Studium und Hochschulkontakt]]''; Issue 7/8, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; An oarsman maneuvers the boat from the stern. In the bow, facing the gate, is a standing figure clad entirely in white. Just behind the figure is a white, [[festoon]]ed object commonly interpreted as a [[coffin]]. The tiny islet is dominated by a dense grove of tall, dark [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress trees]]—associated by long-standing tradition with cemeteries and mourning—which is closely hemmed in by precipitous cliffs. Furthering the funerary theme are what appear to be sepulchral portals and windows on the rock faces.

Böcklin himself provided no public explanation as to the meaning of the painting, though he did describe it as “a dream picture: it must produce such a stillness that one would be awed by a knock on the door.”&lt;ref&gt;[[John Culshaw|Culshaw, John]] (1949), ''Rachmaninov: The Man and his Music'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To Marie Berna he wrote on 29 June 1880: "Am letzten Mittwoch ist das Bild "Die Gräberinsel“ an sie abgegangen. Sie werden sich hineinträumen können in die Welt der Schatten, bis sie den leisen lauen Hauch zu fühlen glauben, den das Meer kräuselt. Bis sie Scheu haben werden die feierliche Stille durch ein lautes Wort zu stören."&lt;/ref&gt; The title, which was conferred upon it by the art dealer [[Fritz Gurlitt]] in 1883, was not specified by Böcklin, though it does derive from a phrase in an 1880 letter he sent to the painting’s original commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Upon completing Alexander Günther’s version, Böcklin sent him a letter saying that "... finally with the Toteninsel finished I think it will make quite the impression” (“...Endlich ist die Toteninsel soweit fertig, dass ich glaube, sie werde einigermaßen den Eindruck machen...“)&lt;/ref&gt; Not knowing the history of the early versions of the painting (see below), many observers have interpreted the oarsman as representing the boatman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] who ferried souls to the underworld in [[Greek mythology]]. The water would then be either the [[River Styx]] or the [[River Acheron]] and his white-clad passenger a recently deceased soul transiting to the afterlife.

== Origins and inspiration ==
[[File:English Cemetery, Florence.jpg|thumb|English Cemetery in Florence|English Cemetery, Florence]]
[[File:Pontikonisi Island 05-06-06.jpg|thumb|Greek island [[Pontikonisi]], near [[Corfu]], was probably the inspiration for the painting]]
[[File:Ostrvo Sveti Đorđe (Island of Saint George) - Bay of Kotor, Montenegro - 28 July 2010 - (1).jpg|thumb|Montenegrin island [[Sveti Đorđe|Saint George]] near [[Perast]], is another very likely contender as the inspiration for the painting]]
''Isle of the Dead'' evokes, in part, the [[English Cemetery, Florence|English Cemetery]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], where the first three versions were painted. The cemetery was close to Böcklin's studio and was also where his infant daughter Maria was buried. (In all, Böcklin lost 8 of his 14 children).

The model for the rocky islet was perhaps [[Pontikonisi]], a small, lush island near [[Corfu]] which is adorned with a small chapel amid a cypress grove,&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2005), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HwSvhu1kLikC&amp;dq=Harrison+AND+Rachmaninoff&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qX0mQwAJW2&amp;sig=w8ylvmx89X6MK4nnlk-bsjMpA3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA17,M1 Rachmaninoff]'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps in combination with the mysterious rocky island of [[Strombolicchio]] near the famous volcano [[Stromboli]], Sicily. (Another less likely candidate is the island of [[Ponza]] in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].)

Michael Webber. "London Galleries: Peace and War." Apollo 93 (June 1971), p.&amp;nbsp;510, states that it was painted in the [[Bay of Kotor]] in [[Montenegro]], and that it inspired the composer [[Rachmaninoff]]. This claim is supported by the similarity between the painting and the island of [[Sveti Đorđe|St. George]] near [[Perast]], which is lined by cypress groves and houses a church dedicated to [[Saint George]].

== Versions ==

Böcklin completed the first version of the painting in May 1880 for his patron [[Alexander Günther]], but kept it himself. In April 1880, while the painting was in progress, Böcklin's Florence studio had been visited by Marie Berna, née Christ (widow of financier Dr. [[Georg von Berna]] [1836–65] and soon-to-be wife of the German politician [[Waldemar, Count of Oriola]] [1854–1910]). She was struck by the first version of this "dream image" (now in the [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]), which sat half completed on the easel, so Böcklin painted a smaller version on wood for her (now in the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in [[New York City]]). At Berna's request, he added the coffin and female figure, in allusion to her husband's death of [[diphtheria]] years earlier. Subsequently, he added these elements to the earlier painting. He called these works ''Die Gräberinsel'' ("Tomb Island").&lt;ref&gt;The artist apparently used this title for the rest his life, as indicated by a congratulatory telegram on the occasion of the Count's 70th birthday (1897) in which the artist refers to "...die glücklichen Besitzer der Gräberinsel..." ("... the lucky owner of ‘Tomb Island’...").&lt;/ref&gt; (Sometimes the "Basel" version is credited as the first one, sometimes the "New York".) It was acquired by the [[Gottfried Keller-Stiftung]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="bundesmusen-gks-ausleihe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesmuseen.ch/gks/01475/index.html?lang=de|title=Gottfried Keller-Stiftung: Ausleihe und Reproduktionen|publisher=bundesmuseen.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third version was painted in 1883 for Böcklin’s dealer Fritz Gurlitt. Beginning with this version, one of the burial chambers in the rocks on the right bears Böcklin's own initials: "A.B.". (In 1933, this version was put up for sale and a noted Böcklin admirer, [[Adolf Hitler]], acquired it. He hung it first at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] in [[Obersalzberg]] and, then after 1940, in the New [[Reich Chancellery]] in [[Berlin]]. It is now at the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]], Berlin.)

Financial imperatives resulted in a fourth version in 1884, which was ultimately acquired by the entrepreneur and art collector Baron [[Heinrich Thyssen]] and hung at his [[Berliner Bank]] subsidiary. It was burned after a bomb attack during [[World War II]] and survives only as a black-and-white photograph.

A fifth version was commissioned in 1886 by the [[Museum der bildenden Künste|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Leipzig]], where it still hangs.[[File:Böcklin - Die Lebensinsel -1888.jpeg|thumb|''Isle of Life'', 1888]]

In 1888, Böcklin created a painting called ''Die Lebensinsel'' ("Isle of Life"). Probably intended as an antipole to the ''Isle of the Dead'', it also shows a small island, but with all signs of joy and life. Together with the first version of the ''Isle of the Dead'', this painting is part of the collection of the Kunstmuseum Basel.

In 1901 a final version by Arnold Böcklin and his son Carlo Böcklin was made and is on display in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

'''James Lynam Molloy''' (c.August 1837 &amp;ndash; 4 February 1909) was an Irish composer, poet, and author.

==Biography==
James L. Molloy was born near Rahan in [[County Offaly]] and attended [[St Edmund's College (Ware)]] as a student between 1851 and 1855 along with his brother [[Bernard Charles Molloy|Bernard]], who later became an [[Member of parliament|MP]].&lt;ref&gt;Kay, David J S. ''The People of St Edmund's College'' (The Edmundian Association: 2003) {{ISBN|0-9546125-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After leaving the College, he went to the [[Catholic University of Ireland|Catholic University]] in [[Dublin]], graduating in 1858. Further studies brought him to [[London]], [[Paris]], and [[Bonn]], before he settled in London from about 1863 with a lawyer's degree. However, he never practiced law. Instead, he worked as a private secretary to the then attorney general. He was a war correspondent for the ''London Standard'' on the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and traveled widely, particularly in France. From 1880 he lived in [[Henley-on-Thames]] near London.  

Molloy's first songs date from 1865, but his career really took off with the regular London ballad concerts from the late 1860s and particularly during the 1870s. His most often quoted successes in his own lifetime were songs like ''Clochette'' (1867), ''Thady O'Flynn'' (1869), ''Eily's Reason'' (1871), ''Dresden China'' (1875), ''Darby and Joan'' (1878), ''Love's Old Sweet Song'' (1884), and ''The French Partridge'' (1904). "[[Love's Old Sweet Song]]" proved to be a best-seller for many years, particularly popular with sailors, and immortalized in [[James Joyce|Joyce's]] ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. Conan Doyle references ''The Old Sweet Song'' in ''His Last Bow'', 1917.&lt;ref&gt;See 'Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel', Jane Stanford, Carrowmore, 2017,  pp. 59, 60&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his songs were written in collaboration with [[W. S. Gilbert]], including ''Thady O'Flynn'' (used in the operetta ''[[No Cards]]''), ''Corisande'' (1870) and ''Eily's Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Reginald: ''W. S. Gilbert: An Anniversary Survey and Exhibition Checklist with Thirty-five Illustrations'', The Biographical Society of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From early on, his music included songs relating to Ireland, and although many of them made no use of Irish traditional melodic or rhythmic elements, they gained such a popularity in the early 20th century that some gained a folksong status. These include his still-famous ''Kerry Dance'' (1879) and ''Bantry Bay'' (1889) to which he wrote both words and music. 

Many contemporary writers considered Molloy's songs to be above average. An 1867 concert review remarks: "Mr Molloy's songs are (to use a common expression) 'for the drawing-room,' but there is more in them than in the generality of effusions written now-a-days for young lady amateurs, who cannot perceive the charm of a higher order of composition."&lt;ref&gt;Review headed "Mr. W. Bollen Harrison’s Concert", in: ''The Era'', 22 Dec. 1867, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1874 song ''Don't be Sorrowful, Darling'' has been described as "One of Molloy's simple little ballads, with a great deal in it. Music and Words are equally earnest and impressive."&lt;ref&gt;"New Music", in: ''The Exeter and Plymouth Gazette'', 4 Sep. 1874, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Molloy did frequently manage to respond to demands for the popular with a product that could also satisfy a certain artistic standard. In an obituary on Molloy, the well-known lyric poet [[Fred Weatherly|Fred Weatherley]] claimed that Molloy "will be remembered, or certainly his songs will, long after the 'superior' and so-called 'art-songs' of to-day are forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;Fred E. Weatherly: "Recollections of J. L. Molloy", in: ''The Musical Herald'', 1 March 1909, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, Molloy also wrote a book called ''Our Autumn Holiday on French Rivers''. He died in [[Henley-on-Thames]].

The '''Magerius Mosaic''' is a 3rd-century [[Roman mosaic]] discovered in 1966 in the [[Tunisia]]n village of [[Smirat]] and presently displayed in the [[Sousse Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.archaeology.co.uk/cwa/world-news/the-magirius-mosaic.htm|title=The Magerius Mosaic|work=[[Current Archaeology]]| date=October 3, 2007| accessdate =June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic presumably decorated a country villa belonging to a man named Magerius.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;

At the centre of the mosaic a steward is shown with four moneybags on a tray. Each moneybag symbolises a thousand [[denarii]]. The steward is surrounded by four named leopards, being speared by four named hunters. The mosaic presents a very rare evidence of the actual sums paid for animals used in the [[amphitheatre]] spectacles.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; Two of the three other figures on the mosaic are presumably deities, despite the adjacent Latin inscription ''Mageri''.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; A figure striding forward on the left is usually identified as the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; Another figure, with a saucer-shaped object in his right hand, and a staff in his left, is  usually identified as [[Bacchus]] or [[Liber Pater]].&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film has received positive reception from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 100% of 20 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.7 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maidan (2014)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/maidan/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean]] rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film holds an average score of 86, based on 9 reviews, indicating a 'Universal acclaim' response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/maidan |title=Maidan (2014): Reviews |work=Metacritic |publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Felperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a positive review and said that "[t]his stunning, epic-scaled film harkens back to the heroic, journalistic roots of documentary-making and yet feels ineffably modern and formally daring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/maidan-cannes-review-706197|title='Maidan': Cannes Review|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Jay Weissberg wrote that "In contrast with most documentaries made in the wake of an historic event, "Maidan" will last beyond the current Ukrainian upheaval to stand as compelling witness and a model response to a seminal moment too fresh to be fully processed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-maidan-1201192882/|title=Film Review: 'Maidan'|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Marshal, reviewing the film for [[Screen International]],  said that "[e]ven in the midst of the molotovs, Loznitsa's sincere and memorable document retains its fascination with those small details that make us human, and make democracy worth fighting for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/maidan/5072357.article|title=Maidan|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Atkinson of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called it "Easily the most rigorous, vital, and powerful movie of 2014, Sergei Loznitsa's ''Maidan'' may be a perfect [[André Bazin|Bazinian]] cinema-machine - reality is captured, crystallized, honored for its organic complexity, and delivered unpoisoned by exposition or emphasis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2014-12-10/film/maidan/|title=Maidan Reveals a Ukrainian Uprising -- and the Crackdown|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Pulver, in a review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated: "[i]n some ways it's perfect, in its Eisenstein-esque refusal to compromise on the idea of the crowd as the key participant. In other ways, though, its sternness hampers it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/21/cannes-2014-maidan-film-review-ukraine1|title=Cannes 2014: Maidan review – an unblinking look at Ukraine's history in action|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Feinstein of ''[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker Magazine]]'' wrote that "''Maidan'' is gorgeous if stark. It never crosses the line into aestheticizing the revolution, the suffering and brutality that come along with it. Its artfulness stems from obsessive precision. You register ''Maidan'' just as you do the well-known paintings of horror from, say, the Spanish Civil War and the French Revolution: Not an interpretation, but an artwork capturing the truth of a historic moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/88644-never-the-twain-shall-meet-maidan/|title=Never the Twain Shall Meet: Maidan|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Walber of Nonfics, called the film "a portrait of a people, a place and a moment rather than a dissertation on its context or implications. It is raw, unflinching cinema for a troubled nation in a great and terrible moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonfics.com/maidan-review/|title='Maidan' Review: A Grand, Unflinching Epic of the Ukrainian Revolution|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oleg Ivanov of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, writing that "[i]t puts the viewer inside Maidan, allowing them to draw their own conclusions about the ideas and agendas espoused by the movement's leaders and participants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/maidan|title=FILM REVIEW|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About the director ==
Among the contemporary artists who became filmmakers, [[Ihor Podolchak]]is a figure odious. Unlike [[Matthew Barney]] and [[Marina Abramović]] he does not balance on the verge of conceptual [[video art]] but he is engaged in cinematography in its pure form&lt;ref name="АЛИК ШПИЛЮК"&gt;Шпилюк, Алик.

Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (Page 16)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last Christie book to be published under the Collins Crime Club imprint although [[HarperCollins]] continue to be the writer's UK publishers.

The book contains eight short stories and did not appear in the United States; however, in 2010, an audio book and the Kindle edition were released, which included six stories from the book, plus ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw's Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]''.

==Literary significance and reception==

[[Robert Barnard]]: "Posthumous collection, containing several good and good-ish Marple cases previously only available in the States.

''A Talent to Deceive – an appreciation of Agatha Christie'' – Revised edition (Page 197). Fontana Books, 1990. {{ISBN|0-00-637474-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This collection was issued for Kindle by HarperCollins in October 2010, ISBN B0046RE5FY and in July 2012, ISBN B008I5CNPE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/agatha-christie/miss-marples-final-cases.htm |title=Miss Marple's Final Cases |publisher=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest audio edition includes an additional short story, originally published in ''The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding'' collection, ''Greenshaw's Folly''.

===First publication of stories===

The first UK magazine publication of all the stories is as follows:
* ''Strange Jest'': First published in issue 643 of the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in July 1944 under the title of ''The Case of the Buried Treasure''. (This was the final short story Christie wrote for the ''Strand''.)
* ''The Tape-Measure Murder'': First published in issue 614 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in February 1942 under the title of ''The Case of the Retired Jeweller''.
* ''The Case of the Caretaker'': First published in issue 613 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in January 1942.
* ''The Case of the Perfect Maid'': First published in issue 616 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in April 1942 under the shortened title of ''The Perfect Maid''.
* ''Sanctuary'': First published in the October 1954 issue of ''Woman's Journal''. This story was specially written by Christie for the [[Westminster Abbey]] restoration appeal fund of that year. The story was sold to the highest bidder with the funds going to the appeal. The Magazine did not state the sum that they paid but noted that it was "considerable".
* ''The Dressmaker's Doll'': First published in the December 1958 issue of ''Woman's Journal''.
* ''Miss Marple Tells a Story'' was not written for magazine publication initially but was a special commission from the [[BBC]] for a series called ''Short Story'' as announced in ''[[The Times]]'' on 27 March 1934. It is further unusual in that the story was read out by Christie herself, in the manner of her previous broadcasts of ''[[The Scoop and Behind The Screen|Behind the Screen]]'' (1930) and ''[[The Scoop and Behind The Screen|The Scoop]]'' (1931). The twenty-minute broadcast took place on Friday, 11 May 1934 at 9.20pm on the [[BBC National Programme|National Programme]]. The text was first published in Volume 3, Issue 64 of the weekly UK magazine ''Home Journal'' on 25 May 1935 under the title ''Behind Closed Doors'' and with an illustration by Michael Bernard.
* The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' of 6 April 1934 stated that ''In a Glass Darkly'' was being read out by Christie on [[BBC Radio]] that night as part of the ''Short Story'' series. However, the programme billings on the same page stated the broadcast was by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] with a story titled ''Dilemma''&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Mirror'' 6 April 1934 (Page 24)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Radio Times]]'' also states that this was the broadcast made. The text of Christie's story was first published in the December 1934 issue of the monthly ''Woman's Journal''.

'''Neo-primitivism''' was a Russian [[art movement]] which took its name from the 31-page pamphlet ''Neo-primitivizm'', by [[Aleksandr Shevchenko|Aleksandr]] {{harvtxt|Shevchenko|1913}}. In the pamphlet Shevchenko proposes a new style of modern painting which fuses elements of [[Cézanne]], [[Cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]] with traditional Russian '[[folk art]]' conventions and motifs, notably the [[russian icon]] and the [[lubok]].

==Neo-primitive artists==
Russian artists associated with Neo-primitivism include:

*[[David Burlyuk]]
*[[Marc Chagall]]
*[[Pavel Filonov]]
*[[Natalia Goncharova]]
*[[Mikhail Larionov]]
*[[Kasimir Malevich]]
*[[Aleksandr Shevchenko]]
*[[Igor Stravinsky]]

[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[National Gallery, London]] 1434.  Among other changes, his face was higher by about the height of his eye, hers was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.  Each of his feet was underdrawn in one position, painted in another, and then overpainted in a third.  These alterations are seen in infra-red reflectograms.]]
A '''pentimento''' (plural '''pentimenti''') is an alteration in a painting, evidenced by traces of previous work, showing that the artist has changed their mind as to the composition during the process of painting. The word is [[Italian language|Italian]] for ''repentance,'' from the verb ''[[wikt:pentirsi|pentirsi]]'', meaning to repent.

==Significance==
Pentimenti may show that a composition originally had an element, for example a head or a hand, in a slightly different place, or that an element no longer in the final painting was originally planned.  The changes may have been done in the [[underdrawing]] of the painting, or by the visible layers of paint differing from the underdrawing, or by the first painted treatment of the element having been over-painted.

Some pentimenti have always been visible on the final painting with careful inspection; others are revealed by the increasing transparency that some paint acquires after several centuries. Others, especially in the underdrawing, can only be seen with modern methods such as [[X-ray]]s and [[Infrared reflectography#Art history|infrared reflectography]] and photographs.  These are able to record photographically some [[pigment]]s, depending on their chemical composition, which remain covered by later paint layers. For example, [[white lead]], a common pigment, will be detected by X-ray, and [[carbon black]] underdrawings can often be seen with great clarity in infra-red reflectograms.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221432/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/72881.html] These methods have greatly expanded the number of pentimenti art historians are aware of, and confirmed that they are very common in the works of many [[old master]]s, from [[Jan van Eyck]] onwards.
[[File:OldGuitaristLady.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The face of the woman in the image that ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''is painted over. These marks would not usually be described as ''pentimenti'' as the subjects are totally different]]

Pentimenti are considered especially important when considering whether a particular painting is the first version by the original artist, or a second version by the artist himself, or his workshop, or a later copyist. Normally secondary versions or copies will have few if any pentimenti, although this will not always be the case, as in ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'' by [[Caravaggio]].  Like [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and many other masters, Caravaggio seems rarely to have made preliminary drawings, but to have composed straight onto the canvas.  The number of pentimenti found in the work of such masters naturally tends to be higher.

Marks revealing a totally different subject, for example in ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''by [[Picasso]], are not usually described as pentimenti - the artist has abandoned his ''earlier composition'' to begin a new one. In cases where a composition has been changed by a later painter or restorer, marks showing the original composition would not be described as pentimenti either—it must be the original painter who has changed his mind.

==Usage in English==
The term is usually treated as an Italian word and therefore written in italics, depending on the style used in the individual context.  The fully anglicised word ''pentiment'' (plural ''pentiments'') is much rarer, though included in the [[Grove Dictionary of Art]].  The distinction between singular and plural is also rather flexible; some writers refer to a change of just one outline as ''pentimenti'', whilst others treat each area that has been changed as a single ''pentimento''. The word "pentimento" is occasionally used synonymously with "palimpsest", but strictly the latter is used for documents and parchments which, due to fading, have been reused.

==Examples==
[[File:Cardsharps.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' in the [[Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth]].]]
[[File:La casa de Nazaret, por Zurbarán.jpg|thumb|right|''Christ and the Virgin in the House at Nazareth'' by [[Zurbarán]], Cleveland.]]
A portrait in the [[National Gallery, London]] of Jacques de Norvins by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] was painted in 1811–12 when the sitter was [[Napoleon]]'s Chief of Police in Rome. Originally, instead of the curtain at the left, there was a fully painted bust of a boy's head on top of a small column.  Probably this was a bust of Napoleon's son, who was known as the King of Rome. The presumption is that this was overpainted with the curtain after the fall of Napoleon, either by Ingres himself, or another artist.&lt;ref&gt;The National Gallery, Complete Illustrated Catalogue, National Gallery Publications, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85709-050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bust can just be made out in the enlarged online photo, with its chin level with the sitter's hair-line; the top of the column was level with the middle of the sitter's ear.  These may always have been (just) visible, or have become so by the paint becoming transparent with age.  Few viewers of the painting would notice the bust without it being pointed out.  Strictly speaking, these alterations might not be described as pentimenti, because of the presumed lapse of time, and because another artist may have made the change.[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3291]

An example by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] can be found in his work ''[[Leonardo Da Vinci|Salvator Mundi]]'', which was sold to a private collector for more than $450 million after being restored by Christie's auction house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/leonardo-da-vinci-painting-salvator-mundi-sells-for-450-3-million-1510794281|title=Leonardo da Vinci Painting ‘Salvator Mundi’ Smashes Records With $450.3 Million Sale|first=Kelly|last=Crow|date=16 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work  by [[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' in the [[Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth]], has a number of typical minor pentimenti, altering the position of the figure on the right, which are revealed by infra-red reflectograms.  These are used in discussing the painting and comparing it to another version of the subject in [[Bari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kimbellart.org/database/conservation.cfm?acquisition_id=AP%201987.06 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001114100/http://www.kimbellart.org/database/conservation.cfm?acquisition_id=AP%201987.06 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Zurbarán]] in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] shows that the size of a white cloth was expanded after the dark background under-paint had been applied; the expanded area is a darker white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/zurPent.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221750/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/zurPent.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, as a result of the discovery of pentimenti after conservation and cleaning, the [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld Institute]] changed its opinion on its version of Manet’s ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' from that of it being a copy to  it being a preparatory painting that predates the version in the Louvre. Pentimenti were visible once the old varnish was removed, including alterations to the curve of the back of the female nude and one of the male figure's cap, suggesting that the Courtauld picture is a preparatory work.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Baily, "London version of Manet’s Le déjeuner sur l’herbe predates the bigger picture in Paris", The Art Newspaper, 26 Nov 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term has sometimes been used in a modern sense to describe the appearance of the sides of buildings with painted advertising.  Often old ads are painted over with newer ads and the paint wears away to reveal the older layers. Examples in [[Amsterdam]], [[New York City]] and elsewhere have been photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fadingad.com/009.html|title=Amsterdam Ediglyph|last=Jump|first=Frank H.|date=2008-02-28|website=www.fadingad.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankjump.com|title=Fading Ad Campaign|website=www.frankjump.com|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name changes==
'''Ladislas Weisz''' was born June 13, 1899 in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. [[Antisemitism]] forced his family to change their name to the more Hungarian "''Péri''". When he moved to Germany, he was known as '''Laszlo Péri'''. After he moved to [[England]], he adopted the name "'''Peter Peri'''". His grandson, an artist born in 1971, also has the name [[Peter Peri]].

==Career==
Born in 1899, in Budapest into a large, [[Proletariat|proletarian]] Jewish family Peri became politicised at an early age. In 1919, he finished an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, and became a student at the workshops for proletariat fine arts in 1919. He was in contact with [[Lajos Kassák]] and the Activists. In 1917, he began his career as an actor at the MA Theater School, studying with János Mácsza. As part of a theatre company he went to [[Prague]] where he heard about the fall of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Republic of Councils]]. He studied architecture in 1919–20 in Budapest and [[Berlin]]. He lived for a short time in Paris in 1920, in the house of a socialist baker, before being forced to leave the country due to his political activities.

Peri moved to Vienna, then on to Berlin in 1921, where he created his first abstract geometric reliefs. In February 1922, he had a show with [[László Moholy-Nagy|Moholy-Nagy]] at [[Der Sturm Gallery]], Berlin. In 1923, his portfolio containing twelve [[linocut]]s was published by Der Sturm Verlag. His contributions to [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] at the time were to challenge the surface of the wall by producing irregularly shaped wall reliefs and to open up new planes; namely the discovery of concrete as a potential sculptural medium, colouring it if necessary, and the appreciation of the hard contour as a visual device, as seen in his [[collage]]s and linoprints. These could be used to create a visual medium hovering between the relief and architecture; whereas Moholy-Nagy's ''Glasarchitektur'' achieved this using paint and canvas, Péri used less conventional media.

At the ''Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung'' in May 1923, between the contributions of Van Doesburg and El Lissitzky’s ‘Proun Room’ he showed his three-piece {{cvt|7|m|ft}}x{{cvt|17|m|ft}} composition which, while it may also have been executed in paint on wood, had pretensions to be executed in concrete. Peri, joined the [[German Communist Party]] (KPD) in 1923. His 1924, constructivist design for a Lenin tribute for the German art exhibition in Moscow, marked the end of his investigations into the non-objective.

That same year Peri began to work for the Berlin municipal architectural office and was there from 1924 to 1928. Probably motivated by a vision to put his [[Productivism|productivist]] values into action, but frustrated he quit the job in 1928. In 1928, he signed the manifesto and statutes of the [[Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists|Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany]] (''Assoziation Revolutionärer Bildener Künstler Deutschlands'') (ARBKD) (ASSO) which, like other new and militant Communist art organisations, called for a reinvigoration of the idea of "proletarian culture" and suitably positive images of working-class life and culture. He was also a mMember of ''Die Abstrakten'' (The Abstracts) and ''Rote Gruppe'' (Red Group). In 1929, he returned to representational painting and sculpture.

Peri immigrated to England in 1933, after his wife Mary Macnaghten granddaughter of social reformer [[Charles Booth (social reformer)|Charles Booth]] was arrested in possession of Communist propaganda. In 1934, Peri contributed "several forceful works in coloured concrete" to the AIA (Artists’ International Association) exhibition The Social Scene. He made contact with [[John Heartfield]]. In England, he lived first in Ladbroke Grove, then in Hampstead; in 1938, he moved to a studio in Camden Town where he worked until 1966. While in Hampstead, Peri joined the recently founded English section of the Artists International (later to be known as Artists International Association), an association composed largely of commercial artists and designers whose declared intention was to mobilise "the international unity of artists against Imperialist War on the Soviet Union, Fascism and Colonial oppression".{{cn|date=July 2017}}  In July 1938, he had a solo exhibition London Life in Concrete in an empty building at 36 Soho Square. In 1939, he became a British citizen and took the name "Peter Peri". In November 1948, he held a solo show Peri's People at the AIA Gallery. Late in the 1940s he did a series of commissions for the London County Council. In 1951, Peri produced a sculptural group ''[[The Sunbathers]]'' for the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;The sculpture was rediscovered in 2017: ''Guardian'' Friday 21 April 2017 "Naked ambition: £15,000 appeal to revive nude sunbather statues" by Mark Brown

When the [[Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] opened in 1960, Peri was commissioned to "represent the life and activities [of [[Coventry]]] in modern terms and materials"; the work is known simply as ''The Coventry Sculpture''&lt;ref&gt;''Coventry Gallery's Help for Local Artists'', [[The Times]], 9 March 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Peri joined the [[Quaker]] faith and produced a small bronze sculpture of a Quaker Meeting, much loved by the students of [[Woodbrooke]] Study Centre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodbrooke.org.uk/ Woodbrooke Quaker Centre website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birmingham]], where it is now located.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/qmh/2239272233/ Quaker Meeting sculpture on Flickr] (accessed 23 February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Peri died January 19, 1967.

[[Adolf Mahr]], keeper of Irish Antiquities in the National Museum in Dublin wrote in 1930; "''The figure was found, while cutting turf, under 3 to 4 feet of peat....It is made of yew, its height being 3 feet, 8 and five eighths inches''".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Mahr | first = Adolf | year = 1930 | title = A wooden idol from Ireland | journal = Antiquity |volume=4 |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in [[Ralaghan]] bog, which has since been drained, on a boundary.

'''''Saint Candidus'''''  is a painting by [[Ayne Bru]] conserved at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The knight, standing, is dressed in dark armour with a shield, halberd and sword, a fur-lined green tabard, a purple stole and a red cap with a medal featuring the bust of Christ. This is [[Saint Candidus]], a warrior in the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] legion who was martyred along with Saint Maurice. Like the panel of the ''[[Martyrdom of Saint Cucuphas]]'', this painting was part of the old high altarpiece in the [[monastery of Sant Cugat del Vallès]]. [[Ayne Bru]], one of the most important names from the Catalan [[Cinquecento]], was a painter of Central-European origin and training whose work speaks for the influence of Flemish culture and of the art produced in [[Venice]] in the period straddling the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=064049-000  The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Ildefonsus''''' is a 1609 painting by [[El Greco]]. It and his ''[[Saint Peter (El Greco)|Saint Peter]]'' were both painted for the [[Iglesia de San Vicente, Toledo]]. It has also previously been misidentified as [[Pope Eugene I]] or [[saint Blaise]]. It is now in the [[Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial]].

[[Ildefonsus]] is shown in a chasuble, pallium and mitre, holding a bishop's staff and an open book. The full robes emphasise the model's anatomy, showing [[Michelangelo]]'s influence on El Greco.

A '''sound editor'''  is a creative professional responsible for selecting and assembling [[sound recordings]] in preparation for the final [[Audio mixing (film and television)|sound mixing]] or [[Audio mastering|mastering]] of a television program, motion picture, video game, or any production involving [[recorded sound|recorded]] or [[sound synthesis|synthetic]] sound.  Sound editing developed out of the need to fix the incomplete, undramatic, or technically inferior sound recordings of early [[talkies]], and over the decades has become a respected filmmaking [[craft]], with sound editors implementing the aesthetic goals of [[Sound design#Film|motion picture sound design]].

The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognizes the artistic contribution of exceptional sound editing with the [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]].

There are primarily three divisions of sound that are combined to create a final mix, these being dialogue, effects, and music.  In larger markets such as New York and Los Angeles, sound editors often specialize in only one of these areas, thus a show will have separate dialogue, effects, and music editors.  In smaller markets, sound editors are expected to know how to handle it all, often crossing over into the mixing realm as well.  Editing effects is likened to creating the sonic world from scratch, while dialogue editing is likened to taking the existing sonic world and fixing it.  Dialogue editing is more accurately thought of as "production sound editing", where the editor takes the original sound recorded on the set, and using a variety of techniques, makes the dialogue more understandable, as well as smoother, so the listener doesn't hear the transitions from shot to shot (often the background sounds underneath the words change dramatically from take to take).  Among the challenges that effects editors face are creatively adding together various elements to create believable sounds for everything you see on screen, as well as memorizing their sound effects library.

==Equipment==

The essential piece of equipment used in modern sound editing is the [[digital audio workstation]], or DAW.  A DAW allows sounds, stored as computer files on a host computer, to be placed in timed synchronization with a motion picture, mixed, manipulated, and documented.  The standard DAW system in use by the [[American film industry]], as of 2012, is [[Avid Technology|Avid]]'s [[Pro Tools]], with the majority running on [[Apple Computer|Mac]]s.  Another system in use presently is [[Yamaha]] owned [[Steinberg]]'s cross platform DAW [[Nuendo]] running on [[Apple Computer|Mac]]s using [[operating system]] [[Mac OS X]] but also on [[Windows XP]]. Other systems historically used for sound editing were:
* [[WaveFrame]], manufactured by [[WaveFrame (company)|WaveFrame]] of [[Emeryville]], [[California|CA]]
* Several DAWs have been manufactured by [[Fairlight (company)|Fairlight]]
* [[SonicSolutions]]
* [[AMS-Neve]] Audiofile
* AudioVision manufactured by Avid

The WaveFrame, Fairlights, and Audiofile were of the "integrated" variety of DAW, and required the purchase of expensive proprietary hardware and specialized computers (not standard PCs or Macs).  Of the two surviving systems, Pro Tools still requires some proprietary hardware (either a low cost portable device such as the "Mbox" or the more expensive multichannel A/D,D/A converters for more professional high end applications), while Nuendo (a successor to [[Cubase]]) is of the "host based" variety.

==Sound-effects library==
Sound-effects editors typically use an organized catalog of sound recordings from which sound effects can be easily accessed and used in film soundtracks. There are several commercially distributed sound-effects libraries available, the two most well-known publishers being [[Sound Ideas]] and The Hollywood Edge. Online search engines, such as [[Sounddogs]], A Sound Effect and Sonniss allow users to purchase sound effects libraries from a large online database.

Many sound effects editors make their own customized sound recordings which are accumulated into highly prized personal sound effects libraries. Often, sound effects used in films will be saved and reused in subsequent films. One exemplary case in point is a recording known as the "[[Wilhelm Scream]]" which has become known for its repeated use in many famous films such as ''[[The Charge at Feather River]]'' (1953), Pierre Marette Story (1957), ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992). Credited with naming and popularizing this particular recording is sound designer [[Ben Burtt]].

==History==

===Early talkies===
The first sound process to substantially displace [[silent film]]s in the moviegoing market was the [[Vitaphone]] process.  Under the Vitaphone process, a [[microphone]] recorded the sound performed on set directly to a [[phonograph]] master, which made Vitaphone recordings impossible to cut or resynchronize, as later processes would allow. This limited the Vitaphone process to capturing musical acts or one-take action scenes, like [[Vaudeville]] routines or other re-creations of stage performances; essentially, scenes that required no editing at all. However, [[Warner Brothers]], even as early as ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'', began experimenting with the mixing of multiple phonograph recordings and intercutting between the "master" sync take and coverage of other angles. The original mixing console used to make the master recording of ''The Jazz Singer'', still viewable in the Warner Bros. Studio Museum, has no more than four or five knobs, but each is still visibly labeled with the basic "groups" that a modern [[sound designer]] would recognize: "music", "crowd", and so on.

Warner Bros. developed increasingly sophisticated technology to sequence greater numbers of phonograph sound effects to picture using the Vitaphone system, but these were rendered obsolete with the widespread adoption of [[sound-on-film]] processes in the early 1930s.

===Mechanical editing===
In a sound-on-film process, a microphone captures sound and converts it into a signal that can be photographed on film.  Since the recording is imposed linearly on the medium, and the medium is easily cut and glued, sounds recorded can be easily re-sequenced and separated onto separate tracks, allowing more control in mixing.  Options expanded further when optical sound recording processes were replaced with magnetic recording in the 1950s. Magnetic recording offered a better [[signal-to-noise ratio]], allowing more tracks to be played simultaneously without increasing noise on the full mix.

The greater number of options available to the editors led to more complex and creative sound tracks, and it was in this period that a set of standard practices became established which continued until the [[Digital data|digital]] era, and many of the notional concepts are still at the core of sound design, computerized or not:

* Sounds are assembled together onto '''tracks'''.  Many tracks are mixed together (or "dubbed together") to create a final film.
* A track will generally contain only one "type" or '''group''' of sound.  A track that contains dialogue only contains dialogue, a track that contains music should only contain music.  Many tracks may carry all the sound for one group.
* Tracks may be mixed a group at a time, in a process called '''predubbing'''.  All of the tracks containing dialogue may be mixed at one time, and all of the tracks containing [[Foley artist|foley]] may be mixed at another time.  In the process of predubbing, many tracks can be mixed into one.
* Predubs are mixed together to create a '''final dub'''.  On the occasion of the final dub, final decisions about the balance between different groups of sounds are made.

Historically the '''Dubbing Mixer''' (UK) or '''Re-Recording Mixer''' (US) was the specialist who mixed all the audio tracks supplied by the Dubbing Editor (with the addition of 'live sounds' such as Foley) in a special Dubbing Suite. As well as mixing, he would introduce equalization, compression and filtered sound effects, etc. while seated at a large console.  Often two or three mixers would sit alongside, each controlling sections of audio, e.g., dialogue, music, effects.

In the era of optical sound tracks, it was difficult to mix more than eight tracks at once without accumulating excessive [[noise]].  At the height of magnetic recording, 200 tracks or more could be mixed together, aided by [[Dolby]] noise reduction.  In the digital era there is no limit. For example, a single predub can exceed a hundred tracks, and the final dub can be the sum of a thousand tracks.

=== Digital sound ===
The mechanical system of sound editing remained unchanged until the early 1990s, when [[digital audio workstation]]s acquired features sufficient for use in film production, mainly, the ability to synchronize with picture, and the ability to play back many tracks at once with CD-quality [[fidelity]].  The quality of 16-bit audio at a 48&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sampling rate]] allowed hundreds of tracks to be mixed together
with negligible noise.

The physical manifestation of the work became computerized: sound recordings, and the decisions the editors made in assembling them, were now digitized, and could be versioned, done, undone, and archived instantly and compactly.  In the magnetic recording era, sound editors owned trucks to ship their tracks to a mixing stage, and transfers to magnetic film were measured in hundreds of thousands of feet.  Once the materials arrived at the stage, a dozen recordists and mix technicians required a half an hour to load the three or four dozen tracks a predub might require.  In the digital era, 250 hours of stereo sound, edited and ready to mix, can be transported on a single 160 GB [[hard drive]].  As well, this 250 hours of material can be copied in four hours or less, as opposed to the old system, which, predictably, would take 250 hours.

Because of these innovations, sound editors, as of 2005, face the same issues as other computerized, "knowledge-based" professionals, including the loss of work due to outsourcing to cheaper labor markets, and the loss of royalties due to ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights.

===Animation sound editing===
In the field of animation, traditionally the sound editors have been given the more prestigious title of "film editor" in screen credits. As animated films are more often than not planned to the frame, the traditional functions of a film editor are often unnecessary. [[Treg Brown]] is known to cartoon fans as the sound effects genius of [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. Other greats of the field have included [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] of the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]], Greg Watson and Don Douglas at [[Hanna-Barbera]], and Joe Siracusa of [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and various TV cartoon studios.

'''''The Death of Marat''''' ({{lang-fr|La Mort de Marat}} or ''Marat Assassiné'') is a 1793 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]] of the murdered French revolutionary leader [[Jean-Paul Marat]]. It is one of the most famous images of the [[French Revolution]]. David was the leading French painter, as well as a [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] and a member of the revolutionary [[Committee of General Security]]. The painting shows the radical journalist lying dead in his bath on July 13, 1793 after his murder by [[Charlotte Corday]]. Painted in the months after Marat's murder, it has been described by [[T. J. Clark (art historian)|T. J. Clark]] as the first modernist painting, for "the way it took the stuff of politics as its material, and did not transmute it".

==The murder==
Marat (24 May 1743 – 13 July 1793, 18th century France) was one of the leaders of the Montagnards, the radical faction ascendant in French politics during the [[Reign of Terror]] until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. Charlotte Corday was a [[Girondin]] from a minor aristocratic family and a political enemy of Marat who blamed him for the [[September Massacre]]. She gained entrance to Marat's rooms with a note promising details of a counter-revolutionary ring in Caen.

Marat suffered from a skin condition that caused him to spend much of his time in his bathtub; he would often work there. Corday fatally stabbed Marat, but she did not attempt to flee. She was later tried and executed for the murder.

==David's politics ==
As well as being the leading French painter of his generation, David was a prominent Montagnard, and a [[Jacobin]], aligned with Marat and [[Maximilian Robespierre]]. A deputy of the Museum section at the [[National Convention|Convention]], he voted for the death of the King, and served on the Committee of General Security, where he actively participated in the sentencing and imprisonment of many and eventually presided over the "section des interrogatoires". He was also on the [[:fr:Comité d'instruction publique|Committee of Public Instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Wildenstein, pp. 43–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style==
[[File:Death of Marat by David (detail).jpg|thumb|Detail of ''The Death of Marat'' showing the paper held in Marat's left hand. The letter reads (in French) "Il suffit que je sois bien malheureuse pour avoir droit a votre bienveillance" or in English, "Given that I am unhappy, I have a right to your help"]]
Marat's figure is idealized.&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/david-death-of-marat.html Smarthistory], David's Death of Marat, accessed 28 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the painting contains no sign of his skin problems, his skin appears clean and unblemished. David, however, drew other details from his visit to Marat's residence the day before the assassination: the green rug, the papers, and the pen. David promised his peers in the National Convention that he would later depict their murdered friend invocatively as "''écrivant pour le bonheur du peuple''" (writing for the good of the people). ''The Death of Marat'' is designed to commemorate a personable hero. Although the name [[Charlotte Corday]] can be seen on the paper held in Marat's left hand, she herself is not visible. Close inspection of this painting shows Marat at his last breath, when Corday and many others were still nearby (Corday did not try to escape). Therefore, David intended to record more than just the horror of martyrdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

   | title = Jacques-Louis David's 'Marat' | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]
  | year = 2000  | pages = 16–17 | isbn = 0-521-56337-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, for realistic as it is in its details, the painting, as a whole, from its start, is a methodical construction focusing on the victim, a striking set up regarded today by several critics as an "awful beautiful lie"— certainly not a photograph in the forensic scientific sense and barely the simple image it may seem (for instance, in the painting, the knife is not to be seen where Corday had left it impaled in Marat's chest, but on the ground, beside the bathtub).

''The Death of Marat'' has often been compared to ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's Pietà]]''. Note the elongated arm hanging down in both works. David admired [[Caravaggio]]'s works, especially ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]'', which mirrors ''The Death of Marat'''s drama and light.

David sought to transfer the sacred qualities long associated with the monarchy and the Catholic Church to the new French Republic. He painted Marat, martyr of the Revolution, in a style reminiscent of a Christian martyr, with the face and body bathed in a soft, glowing light.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; As Christian art had done from its beginning, David also played with multileveled references to classical art. Suggestions that Paris could compete with Rome as capital and mother city of the Arts and the idea of forming a kind of new [[Roman Republic]] appealed to French Revolutionaries, who often formed David's audience.

== Later history ==
[[File:Charlotte Corday.jpg|thumb|''Charlotte Corday'' by [[Paul Jacques Aimé Baudry]], painted 1860.]]
[[File:MunchDerToddesMarat1907.JPG|thumb|One of two versions of ''Death of Marat'' made by [[Edvard Munch]] in 1907]]
Widely admired during the Terror whose leaders ordered several copies of the original work (copies made in 1793–1794 by David's pupils to serve propaganda), ''The Death of Marat'' slowly ceased to be 'frontpage history' after Robespierre's overthrow and execution. At his request, it was returned to David in 1795, himself being prosecuted for his involvement in the Terror as a member of the Comité de Sureté Général (he would have to wait for Napoleon's rise to become prominent in the arts once more). From 1795 to David's death, the painting languished in obscurity. During David's exile in Belgium, it was hidden, somewhere in France, by [[Antoine Gros]], David's dearest pupil. In 1826 (and later on), the family tried to sell it, with no success at all. It was rediscovered by the critics in the mid-nineteenth century, especially by [[Charles Baudelaire]] whose famous comment in 1846{{elucidate|date=June 2016}} became the starting point of an increased interest among artists and scholars. In the 20th century, the painting inspired several painters (among them Picasso and Munch who delivered their own versions), poets (Alessandro Mozzambani) and writers (the most famous being Peter Weiss with his play ''[[Marat/Sade]]'').

The original painting is currently displayed at the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museum of Fine Arts]] in Brussels, being there as a result of a decision taken by the family to offer it, in 1886, to the city where the painter had lived quietly and died in exile after the fall of Napoleon. Some of the copies (the exact number of those completed remains uncertain) made by David's pupils (among them, [[Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli]] and Gérard) survived, notably visible in the museums of Dijon, Reims, and Versailles. The original letter, with bloodstains and bath water marks still visible, has survived and is currently intact in the ownership of [[Robert Lindsay, 29th Earl of Crawford]].&lt;ref&gt;The Earl of Crawford has the largest collection of French revolutionary manuscripts in Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists have also depicted the death of Marat, sometimes long after the facts, whose works refer or not to David's masterpiece. Among these later works, the ''Charlotte Corday'' by [[Paul Jacques Aimé Baudry]], painted in 1860, during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], when Marat's "dark legend" (the angry monster insatiably hungry for blood) was widely spread among educated people, depicts [[Charlotte Corday]] as a true heroine of France, a model of virtue for the younger generations. The versions of Picasso and Munch are less trying to refer to the original context in itself than to confront modern issues with those of David, in terms of style. Brazilian artist [[Vik Muniz]] created a version composed of contents from a city landfill as part of his "Pictures of Garbage&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, ''A Modern Marat'', https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703440004575548581385394008&lt;/ref&gt;" series.

==Company history==
The Hawaii Project was founded in 2014 by Mark Watkins. Prior to The Hawaii Project, he was CEO and co-founder of [[Goby (search engine)]], a mobile recommendation engine for finding things to do, since acquired by Telenav. Prior to that, he was VP of Engineering for Endeca, a search company acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]] for $1.075B.&lt;ref name="oracle-acquisition"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/Boston/businessupdates/2011/10/oracle-buys-endeca/tHRB2UzIBhbhkB5V5RhrFN/index.html |title=Oracle buys Endeca |work=Boston.com |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2011-10-18 |last=Farrell |first=Michael B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the company was rooted in the founder's frustration at not finding out about new books from his favorite authors.&lt;ref name=bostinno&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/04/14/best-new-books-the-hawaii-project-tells-you-what-to-read/| title=This New Startup Hunts Down the Books You're Bound to Love| author=Rebecca Strong| date=14 April 2015| publisher=Bost Inno| accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tivaevae''' or '''tivaivai''' ({{lang-rar|tīvaevae}}) in the [[Cook Islands]], '''tifaifai''' in [[French Polynesia]], is a form of artistic [[quilting]] traditionally done by [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] women. The word literally means "patches",&lt;ref name="Giuffre2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Anne Giuffre|title=Collective Creativity: Art and Society in the South Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zObDf1mQj20C&amp;pg=PA30|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-9168-2|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the pieces of material sewn together. The tivaevae are either made by one woman or can be created in groups of women called ''vainetini''. The ''vainetini'' use this time together to bond, sing and catch up on village news.&lt;ref name="Giuffre2009" /&gt;

==Traditional uses==
Tivaevae are often given on very special occasions either to important visitors, as birthday and wedding gifts or used to cover the body of a loved one who has died. They are often displayed during important events like the traditional boys' [[First haircut#Polynesian boys|hair-cutting ceremonies]], birthdays and weddings.&lt;ref name="Herle2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anita Herle|title=Pacific Art: Persistence, Change, and Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgXLIe1lojkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA142|date=January 2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2556-0|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By custom, a tivaevae is not measured by monetary value nor production cost. Its value is said to be reflected by the love and patience that the creator(s) have put into making a stunning work of art. Cook Islands women often described their tivaevae as being "something from the heart".&lt;ref name="Boundless2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Boundless|title=Art History, Volume II: 1400-present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra7pAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA418|date=23 August 2013|publisher=Boundless|isbn=978-1-940464-26-8|pages=418–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tivaevae are rarely seen for sale on the islands. The Atiu Fibre Arts Studio on [[Atiu]] is the only place in the Cook Islands where they are commercially produced and available for purchase.&lt;ref name="Hunt2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Errol Hunt|title=Rarotonga &amp; the Cook Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5akbBi6sso8C&amp;pg=PA49|year=2003|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-083-9|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The tivaevae's origins are uncertain. Rongokea (1992) believes it to be an imported art form, and cites two sets of Christian missionaries in the 19th century as possible origins. While it is known that these female missionaries taught the indigenous women how to sew, it is not certain that they taught them the craft of quilting or making bed coverlets. The [[appliqué]] style of tivaevae quilting appears to have been influence by Pennsylvanian German [[scherenschnitte]] or Victorian folded paper-cutting traditions.&lt;ref name="LalFortune2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brij V. Lal|author2=Kate Fortune|title=The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pPpJl8E5wC&amp;pg=PA551|date=January 2000|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2265-1|pages=551–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple origins and influences thus seem likely.

As an art form, tivaevae replaced [[barkcloth]] production in [[Tahiti]] and the Cook Islands by the late 19th century: the function and nature of barkcloth production was transferred to tivaevae.&lt;ref name="Stevenson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Stevenson|title=The Frangipani is Dead: Contemporary Pacific Art in New Zealand, 1985-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUGQiQekULcC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2008|publisher=Huia Publishers|isbn=978-1-86969-325-1|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Weather Machine''''' is a [[Lumino kinetic art|lumino-kinetic]] [[bronze sculpture]] and columnar machine that serves as a [[weather beacon]], displaying a [[Weather forecasting|weather prediction]] each day at noon. Designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc., the approximately {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=1}} tall sculpture was installed in 1988 in the northwest corner of [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. Two thousand people attended its dedication, which was broadcast live nationally from the square by ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' weatherman [[Willard Scott]]. The machine cost $60,000.

During its daily two-minute sequence, which includes a trumpet [[fanfare]], mist, and flashing lights, the machine displays one of three metal symbols as a prediction of the weather for the following 24-hour period: a sun for clear and sunny weather, a [[Great Blue Heron|blue heron]] for [[drizzle]] and transitional weather, or a [[dragon]] and mist for rainy or stormy weather. The sculpture includes two [[bronze]] [[Anemometer|wind scoops]] and displays the temperature via vertical colored lights along its stem. The [[air quality index]] is also displayed by a light system below the [[stainless steel]] globe. Weather predictions are made based on information obtained by employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square from the [[National Weather Service]] and the Department of Environmental Quality. Considered a tourist attraction, ''Weather Machine'' has been called "bizarre",&lt;ref name=Carlin&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/travel/what-s-doing-in-portland-ore.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=What's Doing In: Portland, Ore.|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=April 23, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Peter|last=Carlin|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|issn=0362-4331|oclc=1645522}}&lt;/ref&gt; "playful",&lt;ref name=Rotarian&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=May 1990|work=The Rotarian|title=Pioneer Courthouse Square|pages=26–27|publisher=Rotary International|volume=156|issn=0035-838X|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "unique",&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{Cite news|title=Downtown Portland Public Art|date=April 12, 1991|first=Phil|last=Hunt|work=[[The Oregonian]]|page=R26|location=Portland, Oregon|issn=8750-1317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "wacky",&lt;ref name=McInerny&gt;{{Cite news|title=63-Year-Old Local Scribe Rises From Bedridden, Troubled Youth to Dance Literary Waltz of Words|date=October 16, 1988|first=Vivian|last=McInerny|work=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon|page=L01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been compared to a giant [[Sceptre|scepter]].

The machine, whose height is reported to be between {{convert|25|and|33|ft|m}},&lt;ref name=Carlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rotarian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; includes two bronze [[Anemometer|wind scoops]] that turn in opposite directions.&lt;ref name=Bella/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; It also indicates the temperature (when 20 [[Fahrenheit|°F]] or above)&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt; via vertical colored lights along the sculpture's stem.&lt;ref name=Hortsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;&lt;ref name=PPR/&gt; Measured by an internal gauge, the machine displays blue lights for below freezing, white lights for above freezing and red lights to mark every ten degrees (°F).&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; Referring to an additional light system (below the [[stainless steel]] globe) that indicates air quality, ''The Oregonian'' reported in 1988 that a green light indicates good air quality, amber reflects "semismoggy"&lt;ref name=Bella/&gt; air and a red light indicates poor air quality.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; However, in 1998 one writer for ''The Oregonian'' warned: "you don't want to breathe so much when the white light is on".&lt;ref name=Hortsch/&gt; Pioneer Courthouse Square employees enter air quality information into the machine's computer following routine checks with the Department of Environmental Quality.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;

In addition to its pre-dawn dedication on national television, ''Weather Machine'' had a public dedication at noon on August 24, attended by Mayor [[Bud Clark]] and other city officials.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sunshine/&gt; On that day, the machine displayed the sun symbol and a green light for good air quality, and indicated a temperature of {{convert|82|F|C|0}}. Following the fanfare, known officially as "Fanfare for Weather Machine with Four Trumpets", jazz singer Shirley Nanette led the crowd in a rendition of "[[You Are My Sunshine]]".&lt;ref name=Sunshine/&gt; Portland had good weather in the days following its dedication, preventing visitors from seeing all three symbols for an extended length of time (though all three symbols are displayed briefly during the daily two-minute sequence). This prompted the executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square to consider altering the machine's schedule so that the public would have a chance to see all three symbols.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; The sculpture maintained good health until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating from noon and the temperature gauge had difficulties working properly.&lt;ref name=Under&gt;{{Cite news|title=Under the Weather|date=December 1, 1995|page=C01|work=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the machine malfunctioned and stopped operating for about a week.&lt;ref name=Saker/&gt;

==Reception==

In the weeks following ''Weather Machine''{{'s}} dedication, an estimated 300 to 400 people gathered at the square daily to witness the noon sequence.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; Following the dedication, ''The Oregonian'' published: "It takes nothing from its fascination to know that a human on the staff of the square will be making the daily phone calls to the Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality, and pushing the necessary buttons to cue the pillar's performance&amp;nbsp;... They have given Portland an attraction no other city has. We're going to like it."&lt;ref name=Sunshine/&gt;

Ponzi described the machine as "light-hearted . . . active, distinctive—and fun".&lt;ref name=Bella/&gt; O'Donnell, who inspired the sculpture, called it a "gentle spectacle" and described the work as "a cartoon contraption, an odd little thingamajig. It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in the bright light of day."&lt;ref name=TO/&gt; In 1994, ''The Oregonian'' reported that O'Donnell regarded ''Weather Machine'' with a "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" and stated that he "[didn't] think it's all that attractive".&lt;ref name=Nokes&gt;{{Cite news|title=Are We All Wet?|date=March 3, 1994|first=R. Gregory|last=Nokes|work=The Oregonian|page=D01|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: "Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well&amp;nbsp;. . . And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round."&lt;ref name=McInerny/&gt;&lt;ref name=TO/&gt;

In 1995, ''The Oregonian''{{'s}} Jonathan Nicholas wrote, "To this day, nobody is exactly sure what happens when the thing sounds off each day at noon. It's like having a [[John Kitzhaber|governor in blue jeans]]. We can't really explain it: It just happens."&lt;ref name=Ponzi/&gt; Grant Butler of ''The Oregonian'' gave the machine's trumpet fanfare as one of three examples of ways in which people could be certain it was noon in Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dining Cheap Eats Saigon Kitchen Cart|date=June 28, 2002|first=Grant|last=Butler|work=The Oregonian|page=17|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20765">The '''well-made play''' ({{lang-fr|la pièce bien faite}}, pronounced {{IPA-fr|pjɛs bjɛ̃ fɛt|}}) is a [[Drama|dramatic genre]] from [[nineteenth-century theatre]] first codified by French dramatist [[Eugène Scribe]]. Dramatists [[Victorien Sardou]], [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], and [[Emile Augier]] wrote within the genre, each putting a distinct spin on the style. The well-made play was a popular form of entertainment. By the mid-19th century, however, it had already entered into common use as a derogatory term.&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;Banham (1998), 964, 972–3, 1191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the other [[Realism (theatre)|realistic]] dramatists of the later 19th century ([[August Strindberg]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Anton Chekhov]]) built upon its technique of careful construction and preparation of effects in the genre [[problem play]]. "Through their example", Marvin Carlson explains, "the well-made play became and still remains the traditional model of [[Dramaturgy|play construction]]."&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;Carlson (1993, 216).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scribe Eugène 2.jpg|210px|thumb| Eugène Scribe]]

In the English language, that tradition found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]]'s ''Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship'' (1912),&lt;ref&gt;Archer, William. Playmaking: a Manual of Craftsmanship. Public domain. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10865&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States with [[George Pierce Baker]]'s ''Dramatic Technique'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;J L Styan, ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice I'', quoted by Innes (2000, 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]

The form has a strong [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] flavour, involving a tight [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] that takes place close to the end of the play. The well-made play retains the shape of [[Aristotle]]'s ideal [[Greek tragedy|Greek-tragedy]] model outlined in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-made play can be broken down into a specific set of criteria.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scribe|first1=Eugene|last2=ed. introd. Stanton |first2=Stephen|title=Camille and Other Plays|date=1956|publisher=Hill and Wang|isbn=0809007061}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the story depends upon a key piece of information kept from some characters, but known to others (and to the audience). Most of the story takes place before the action of the play begins, making the beginning of the play a late point of attack. Exposition during act one explains actions that precede the opening scene, and generates the audience's sympathy for the hero (or heroes) over their rival (or rivals). The plot moves forward in a chain of actions that use minor reversals of fortune to create suspense. The pace builds towards a climactic obligatory scene, in which the hero triumphs. This scene contains a climactic reversal of fortune, or [[peripeteia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McBride|first1=Augusto Boal ; translated by Charles A. &amp; Maria-Odilia Leal|title=Theatre of the oppressed|date=1985|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|location=New York|isbn=0930452496|edition=5th print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dénouement follows, in which all remaining plot points are unraveled and resolved.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"/&gt;

A recurrent device that the well-made play employs is the use of letters or papers falling into unintended hands, in order to bring about [[plot twists]] and climaxes.&lt;ref name="Camille and Other Plays"/&gt; The letters bring about an unexpected and climactic reversal of fortune, in which it is often revealed that someone is not who they pretend to be. Mistaken or mysterious identity as a basis for plot complications is referred to as ''qui pro quo''.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanton|first1=Stephen S.|title=Shaw's Debt to Scribe|journal=MLA|date=December 1961|volume=76|issue=5|pages=575–585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, Beth. "Acting Out: Qui pro Quo in the Context of Interwar Warsaw." East European Politics &amp; Societies (2012): 0888325412467053.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene Scribe]] contributed over 300 plays and opera libretti to the dramatic literature canon. Thirty-five of these works are considered well-made-plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Encyclopædia Britannica Editors|title=well-made play|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639300/well-made-play|website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===French Neoclassicism: a standard form===
History of French Neoclassic form lays a critical foundation for Scribe, who draws upon devices determined by the [[French Academy]] to create his dramatic structure. French Neoclassicism conceives of [[Verisimilitude]], or the appearance of a plausible truth, as the aesthetic goal of a play.&lt;ref name="Ashgate Publishing, Ltd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibbett|first1=Katherine|title=The Style of the State in French Theater, 1630-1660: Neoclassicism and Government.|date=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.,}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1638, the [[French Academy]] codified a system by which dramatists could achieve Verisimilitude in a verdict on the [[Pierre Corneille|Le Cid debate]].&lt;ref name="Ashgate Publishing, Ltd"/&gt;  The monarchy enforced the standards of French Neoclassicism with a system of censorship under which funding and practice permits were issued to a limited number of theater companies.&lt;ref name="Brockett &amp; Hildy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hildy|first1=Franklin J.|last2=Brockett|first2=Oscar G.|title=History of the theatre|date=2007|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-205-47360-1|edition=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system underwent small modifications, but remained essentially the same up until the [[French Revolution]]. Until then, restrictive laws inhibited the growth of new practices with the exception of those advocated by a few intrepid dramatists such as [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]], and [[Beaumarchais]]. After the [[French Revolution]], adherence to the form became an artistic choice instead of a political necessity.

===Boulevard theatres: new forms===
Although Scribe drew heavily upon Neoclassic devices, he used them in original ways that would not have been acceptable without new popular forms, such as those developed at the Boulevard theatres.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Theater and Revolution: the culture of the French stage|date=1980|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to work around the formal monopoly of the [[Comédie Française]] in the middle of the 18th century, theater troupes experimenting with new dramatic forms sprang up along the Boulevard du Temple. Their aim was to escape the censors, and please the public. Popular reception of the boulevard theatres' explorations helped to crack the edifice of Neoclassic form.&lt;ref name="History of the theatre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hildy|first1=Oscar G. Brockett ; Franklin J.|title=History of the theatre|date=2007|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-205-47360-1|edition=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the French Revolution, French theater opened to the influence of practices that had meanwhile developed in other places around Europe.&lt;ref name="French Revolution, Carlson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Marvin A.|title=The Theatre of the French Revolution|date=1966|publisher=Cornell UP|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribe's development of a form that could be used repeatedly to turn out new material suited the demands of a growing middle class theater audience.&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=edited, with an introduction to the well-made play by Stephen S.|title=Camille, and other plays|date=1999|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|isbn=0809007061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===On Scribe, Dumas fils, Augier, and Sardou===

Scribe's influence on theater, according to Marvin J. Carlson, "cannot be overestimated".&lt;ref name="Cornell UP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Marvin|title=Theories of the Theatre: A Historical and Critical Survey from the Greeks to the Present|date=1984|publisher=Cornell UP|location=Ithaca and London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson observes that, unlike other influential theater thinkers, Scribe did not write prefaces or manifestos declaiming his ideas. Scribe influenced theater, instead, with craftsmanship. He honed a dramatic form into a reliable mould that could be applied not only to different content, but to different content from a variety of playwrights. Carlson identifies a single instance of Scribe's critical commentary from a speech Scribe gave to the Académie française in 1836. Scribe expressed his view of what draws the audiences to theater:

"not for instruction or improvement, but for diversion and distraction, and that which diverts them [audience] most is not truth, but fiction. To see again what you have before your eyes daily will not please you, but that which is not available to you in every day life - the extraordinary and the romantic."&lt;ref name="Cornell UP"/&gt;

Although Scribe advocated for a theater of amusement over didacticism, other writers, beginning with [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], adopted Scribe's structure to create didactic plays. In a letter to a critic, Dumas ''fils'' states,"... if I can find some means to force people to discuss the problem, and the lawmaker to revise the law, I shall have done more than my duty as a writer, I shall have done my duty as a man.".&lt;ref name="History of the theatre"/&gt; Dumas' thesis plays are plays written in the well-made style that take clear moral positions on social issues of the day. [[Emile Augier]] also used Scribe's formula to write plays addressing contemporary social issues, although he declares his moral position less strongly.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, John Russell. The Rise and Fall of the Well-Made Play, Great Britain: Routledge, Cox and Wyman, Ltd.,1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, the well-made play had fallen out of critical favor.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw was among those who held the form in low regard, "Why the devil should a man write like Scribe when he can write like Shakespeare or Moliere, Aristophanes or Euripides? Who was Scribe that he should dictate to me or anyone else how a play should be written?"&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt; In reference to the form's tendency to favor amusing plot twists over complexly drawn characters, Shaw referred to the genre as Sardoodledom after [[Victorien Sardou]], who also wrote in the well-made style.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt;

===Shaw and Ibsen===
The opening to the preface to ''Three Plays by Brieux'' offers another example of Shavian disdain for the well-made plays. Shaw identifies the process of creating them as an industry, and their creators as “literary mechanics” instead of artists. To convey how vulgar he finds a widely used playwrighting formula, Shaw interprets the aphorism "Art for art's sake," as "Success for money's sake."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, George Bernard. ‘’Three Plays by Brieux’’. New York: Brentano’s, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay published in [[Modern Language Association|PMLA]] in 1951, ''Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw’s Dramatic Theory and Practice'', Milton Crane reasons that Shaw’s disparagement of the classic well-made formula, and his desire to pry Ibsen’s work away from association with the works of Scribe and Sardou, serve a specific agenda. Crane argues that Shaw aims to prevent his own use of the well-made formula from linking his plays with work considered out of fashion. Shaw’s theory of the [[problem play]] and discussion ideas align his plays with Ibsen’s, and distinguishes them from stale plays of the past. Crane observes that Shaw, by his own admission, learned dramatic structure from contemporary popular theatre which was then dominated by the well-made formula.&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt; Crane goes on to argue how that formula is present in [[List of works by George Bernard Shaw|''Pygmalion'', ''Man and Superman'', and ''The Doctor’s Dilemma'']].&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Milton. "Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw's Dramatic Theory and Practice." PMLA 66.6 (1951): 879-85. JSTOR [JSTOR]. Web. 4 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The problem play====
 [[File:Henrik Ibsen as a young man.jpg|thumb|Henrik Ibsen as a young man]]

Shaw discusses the notion of the [[problem play]] in an essay of the same title published in 1895.&lt;ref name="Problem Play from Shaw on Theatre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=George Bernard|editor1-last=West|editor1-first=E.J.|title=Shaw on Theatre|date=1958|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|location=New York|chapter=Problem Play}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines a problem play as one that puts a person or people in conflict with an institution, confronting a contemporary social question. He cites the "Woman question" as a contemporary example. Ibsen's engagement with the "Woman question" in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' qualifies those works as problem plays. Shaw distinguishes between the problem play and literature with conflicts reflecting a more universal view of the human condition. Works whose fundamental conflict does not pit human against institution, he argues, are more apt to remain relevant through generations. He cites ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', and ''[[Les Misérables]]'' as examples of stories whose conflicts involve more eternal human questions. Shaw observes that the immediacy of the institutional question addressed in a problem play will render the play "flat as ditchwater" once society progresses and the issue is resolved.&lt;ref name="Problem Play from Shaw on Theatre" /&gt; Although Ibsen was hailed by feminists, he did not regard himself as an advocate for any particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Christopher. "Henrik Ibsen, Speech at the Festival of the Norwegian Women's Rights League, Christiana, 26 May 1898." A Sourcebook on Naturalist Theatre. London: Routledge, 2000. 74-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The well-made play and modern drama====
Ibsen's aim, according to Raymond Williams, was to express tragedies in the human condition. Ibsen qualifies a human tragedy as the state "[when a person] stands in a tight place; he cannot go forwards or backwards.”&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Raymond|title=Drama from Ibsen to Brecht|date=1973|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=978-0140214925|edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also cites the specific characteristic that distinguishes his and Ibsen's modern drama from the preceding well-made formula. The well-made formula, Shaw observes, can be divided into three sections: Exposition, Situation, Unraveling. The plays of Ibsen and Shaw, Shaw himself asserts, do not end with a classic unraveling. Their work can be divided as: Exposition, Situation, Discussion.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

==Offshoots==
[[Oscar Wilde|Oscar Wilde's]] ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' exaggerates many of the conventions of the well-made play, such as the missing papers conceit (the hero, as an infant, was confused with the manuscript of a novel) and a final revelation (which, in this play, occurs about thirty seconds before the final curtain).&lt;ref name="Stanton, Shaw's Debt to Scribe" /&gt;

[[Henrik Ibsen|Henrik Ibsen's]] ''[[A Doll's House]]'' follows most of the conceits of the well-made play, but transcends the genre when, after incriminating papers are recovered, Nora rejects the expected return to normality.  Several of Ibsen's subsequent plays build on the general construction principles of the well-made play.  ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) can be seen as a deliberate, meta-theatrical deconstruction of the [[Eugène Scribe|Scribean]] formula.  Ibsen sought a compromise between [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and the well-made play which was fraught with difficulties since life does not fall easily into either form.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[George Bernard Shaw]] scorned the "well-made play", he accepted the form, and even thrived by it, for it concentrated his skills on the conversation among characters, his greatest asset as a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other classic twists on the well-made play can be seen in his use of the General's coat and the hidden photograph in ''[[Arms and the Man]]''.

Also, [[J. B. Priestley]]'s 1946 ''[[An Inspector Calls]]'' may in some ways be considered a "well-made play" in that its action happens before the play starts, and in the case of the older Birlings no moral change takes place. The similarity between Priestley's play and this rather conservative genre might strike some readers/audiences as surprising because Priestley was a socialist. However, his play, like Ibsen's ''A Doll's House'' transcends this genre by providing another plunge into chaos after the return to normality.  He replaced the dramatic full stop with a question mark by revealing in the last scene that the 'inspector' who has exposed the complicity of a prosperous industrial family in the murder or suicide of a working-class girl, is not an inspector at all (perhaps a practical joker, an emanation of the world to come, or a manifestation of the world to come), and the curtain falls on the news that a real girl has died and a real inspector is on the way.&lt;ref&gt;Elsom, John. ''Post-War British Theatre''. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of well-made plays also lend themselves to comedies of situation, often [[farce]]. In ''[[Quintessence of Ibsenism|The Quintessence of Ibsenism]]'', [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] proposed that [[Ibsen]] converted this formula for use in "serious" plays by substituting discussion for the plausible dénouement or conclusion. Thus, plays become open-ended, as if there were life for the [[protagonist]]s beyond the last act curtain.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard. The Quintessence of Ibsenism. New York: Brentano's, 1913. Print.

==Site description==

WhatsOnMyBookshelf, when compared to other book swapping&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive list see:  http://www.swaptrees.com/swap_books.php and http://www.librarything.com/wiki/index.php/Comparison_of_Book_Swapping_Websites&lt;/ref&gt; communities, had a relatively small but dedicated community of swappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   = http://www.moneytalksnews.com/2011/12/13/the-4-best-sites-for-trading-in-your-old-books/ |title =  The 4 Best Sites for Trading in Your Old Books |last  =  Colley|first = Angela |date  = |website = Money Talks News |publisher  = |accessdate = 2013-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site started out as a home for fiction books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115879588172669481 |title = Online Book Swapping |last  = Vascerallo |first = Jessica |date  = September 21, 2006 |website = WSJ Online |publisher  =|accessdate = 2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Registering and using the site was free, the only requirements that users needed to provide their addresses and they should be able to ship books to other users through postal services.

==Swapping method==

The site used a point system as a form of book swapping currency. This method makes using the site flexible, however less personal than other book swapping communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   =  http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6097014-7.html?part=rss&amp;tag=6097014&amp;subj=news |title = Points and other forms of currency allow more flexibility, but Swaptree's person-to-person system makes it more appealing to some |last  = Yamamoto |first = Mike |date  = 2006-07-21|website = CNET |publisher  =|accessdate = 2013-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New users received a 1-point bonus per every five book that they registered. After having registered the first 100 books, this incentive is no longer valid and users receive points only for shipping books to other users (which means that the users have to pay the postal fees for sending the books, but receiving a book is free). Though the site offers a free service, users may purchase 5 points per month if they wish to (purchased points cost $2 each).

Book value points are calculated based upon the new book price of the book in question ($20 – 1 credit point).

Users can request a book by adding it to their shopping cart. The user in possession of the book has to ship it within 5 days and mark the request as “sent”. Similarly, the recipient is obligated to mark the request as “received” immediately upon delivery.

The site has an [[API]], and it is possible to embed WhatsOnMyBookshelf in other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jun/21/comment.guardianweeklytechnologysection |title = It's a new online chapter for books |last  = Keegan |first = Victor |date  = 2007-06-21 |website = The Guardian |publisher  =|accessdate = 2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Firefox add-on is also available to users so that they can manage their wish-lists.

==Ranking and Technical Information==

According to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] page ranks, the site was the 6,296,551th most popular website in the world as of 7 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;whatsonmybookshelf.com page metrics on Alexa (as of July 8, 2013): http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/whatsonmybookshelf.com&lt;/ref&gt; The site is officially registered by WhatsOnMyBookshelf (Moscow, PA), with Dan Ostermayer as its technical and administrative contact.&lt;ref&gt;WHOIS result for whatsonmybookshelf.com, http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=whatsonmybookshelf.com.
