'''198 Contemporary Arts and Learning''', also known as the '''198 Gallery''' or '''198''', is an art space and gallery in [[Railton Road]], [[Brixton]], London.&lt;ref name="De Souza2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Souza|first1=Pauline|editor1-last=Donnell|editor1-first=Alison|title=Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134700257|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VfdpdZ9DwH0C&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22198%20Gallery%22&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22198%20Gallery%22&amp;f=false|chapter=198 Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation, originally named Roots Community, was founded in 1988 by John 'Noel' Morgan and Zoe Lindsay-Thomas.&lt;ref name="Davis2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Lucy|last2=Bayode|first2=Folami|editor1-last=Atkinson|editor1-first=Dennis|editor2-last=Dash|editor2-first=Paul|title=Social and Critical Practice in Art Education|date=2005|publisher=Trentham Books|isbn=9781858563114|pages=81–90|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rOKmJsHYT0YC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22198%22%20railton%20road&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q=%22198%22%20railton%20road&amp;f=false|chapter=The 198 Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay-Thomas was a minicab driver and Morgan was manager of the Vargus Social Club in Landor Road. The organisation eventually changed its name to 198 Gallery, after its location on [[Railton Road]].

198's initial remit was to promote the work of contemporary African, Caribbean and Asian artists whose work represented the diversity of British society. 198 later expanded their policy to include artists from outside the UK.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2016}}
'''Altermodern''', a [[portmanteau word]] defined by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]], is an attempt at contextualizing art made in today's global context as a reaction against standardisation and commercialism. It is also the title of the [[Tate Britain]]'s fourth Triennial exhibition curated by Bourriaud.

==Concept==
In his keynote speech to the 2005 Art Association of Australia &amp; New Zealand Conference, Nicolas Bourriaud explained:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723130718/http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/aaanz05/abstracts/nicolas_bourriaud |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Artists are looking for a new modernity that would be based on translation: What matters today  is to translate the cultural values of cultural groups and  to connect them to the world network. This “reloading process” of  modernism according to the twenty-first-century issues could be called altermodernism, a movement connected to the creolisation of cultures and the fight for autonomy, but also the possibility of producing singularities in a more and more standardized world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Altermodern can essentially be read as an artist working in a [[hypermodernity|hypermodern]] world or with supermodern ideas or themes.

==Exhibitions==

===Tate Britain 2009===
The Tate exhibition includes a series of four one-day events (called "Prologues"), aiming to "introduce and provoke debate" around the Triennial’s themes. Each Prologue includes lectures, performances, film and a manifesto text and attempts to define what the curator sees as the four main facets of Altermodern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tate-triennial-2009-prologue-1-okwui-enwezor-specious-modernity-speculations]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of literature by era}}

Before the spread of writing, [[oral literature]] did not always survive well, though some texts and fragments have persisted. {{ill|August Nitschke|de|August Nitschke}} sees some [[fairy tale]]s as literary survivals dating back to [[Last glacial period | Ice Age]] and [[Mesolithic | Stone Age]] narrators.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''''Apse of Santa María d'Àneu''''' is a romanesque [[apse]] of the church of [[Santa Maria, Àneu]], the transferred [[fresco]]s from which are now exhibited at [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]], in [[Barcelona]].
The decoration of the apse of the church of Santa María d’Àneu combines themes and motifs from the Old and [[New Testament]]s. Originally painted at the Church of Santa María d’Àneu (La Guingueta d’Àneu, [[Lleida]])&lt;ref name="MNAC"&gt;[http://www.spainisculture.com/en/obras_de_excelencia/museo_nacional_de_arte_de_cataluna_mnac/abside_santa_maria_aneu.html Comment on Apse of Santa María d'Àneu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The church of Santa María d'Àneu is located in the upper valley of the Noguera Pallaresa, [[Pyrenees]] mountain region. The building once belonged to a Benedictine Monastery, it is divided into a [[nave]] and aisles by six pairs of piers, taking the shape of a cross. The east end concludes in three semicircular apses, the central apse was decorated with frescoes.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;Kuhn, Ch. L., Romanesque Mural Painting of Catalonia, Cambridge, 1930, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Maria in Àneu was the most important church in the Àneu Valley and belonged to the cathedral chapter of Urgell. From the stylistic circle of Pedret, of Lombardic influence, the decoration of the apse reveals the existence of an elaborate iconographic and theological programme setting off the prophetic hopes of the Old Testament—that is, hope in the coming of a Messiah who was to redeem humanity—against fulfillment of the prophecies—that is, the coming of the Messiah announced by the prophets.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;Post, Ch.R., A History of Spanish Painting, Cambridge, 1930, I, p. 136-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya dates the original work at the end of 11th century – beginning of 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=98d7f9bb3c2477d50327e48363fbd12d787959e035446012bc8afbd858e64243?inventoryNumber=015874-000 Technical Aspects from MNAC Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is speculation that the paintings were completed at the beginning of the 13th century at the time when Romanesque styles were breaking down and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Art was coming of age.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;

== Description ==
The iconography of the painting is suggestive of the Old Testament through the presence of the prophets in reverential attitudes. In the vault portion of the apse, the Epiphany or Adoration of the Magi is represented, with Mary, Jesus, and the three eastern kings baring gifts.  Wheels of fire from Jehovah’s chariot are depicted in the lower register, conforming to Ezekiel’s vision.&lt;ref name="Esteller"&gt;Esteller, E.,MNAC Romanesque Art Guide, Barcelona, 1998, p. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  To the right and left are the [[archangels]] Michael and Gabriel holding banners and scrolls with the inscription PETICIVS and POSTVLATIVS.  Bordering the central window of the lower zones are two six-winged [[seraphim]], in their hands they hold live coals with tongs which they place in the mouths of two crouching figures. In the left lower zone, there are two tonsured (meaning scalp has been shaved) figures who might be Saints Benedict and Bernard or one of them might be a portrait of a local deacon on account of the realism in the face of the figure.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;  The theory that these figures are patrons of the church is strengthened by the discovery of similar figures in related frescoes at the monastery of Saint Peter of [[Berga]].  The third archangel, [[Raphael]], does not appear with the others in the semidome but in the lower section.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

At the bottom is the announcement, the biblical prophecy, represented by means of combined images of the visions of Isaiah and Ezequiel. In keeping with the first, two magnificent seraphim with three pairs of wings each purify the mouth of the
prophets with glowing embers which they are holding with tongs. Next to them are the prophets, represented with their hands together in an attitude of reverence.

At the same time, the seraphim intone the Trisagion, or song of praise to the Lord, represented by the letters SCS, SCS, SCS, which mean ‘holy, holy, holy’. From this moment, the word of the prophets will be the word of God. Beneath the central
window are the wheels of fire of Yahweh’s chariot, described in Ezequiel’s vision, which symbolise the presence of the Lord. On the vault was the Virgin and Child, representing the accomplishment of the prophecies, in the scene from Epiphany,
with two archangels, Michael and Gabriel, patrons of sinners, in a representation very similar to that in the apse from Santa Maria in Cap d'Aran (The Cloisters, New York). A third archangel, Raphael, is represented on the right of the semicylinder,
perhaps as the introducer of the two donor clergymen who appear on the left of the apse.

== Composition ==
The frescoes are attributed to the [[Circle of the Master of Pedret]].  The Master of Pedret was the first significant painter of the Catalon Romanesque period and is named for the wall paintings at the church of [[Southern apse from Pedret|San Quirze de Pedret]] in Berga.&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art (1993).  The Art of Medieval Spain (AD 500-1200), New York. Distributed by Harry N Abrams, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The Apse at Aneu represents the end of a tradition, during this time the painter might have felt himself at liberty to relax old rules and abandon strict division into zones, therefore filling the bottom section not with lines of Apostles, but with less rigid elements of the prophetic vision.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
The Àneu frescos make a complete break with the normal Catalan artistic scheme.  The lower zone is unique and unrelated to the upper portion of the apse.  The Byzantine influence appears to be strong in the style of the frescos, the seraphim have been noted to resemble those in the crypt at the cathedral of [[Anagni]], near Rome.  In addition there are touches of pure [[Realism (arts)|realism]], this is seen in the details such as the unshaven face of the figure at the left of the lower register and the thin and deeply wrinkled face of [[Magus]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;  The painting could represent direct borrowings from Byzantium or importations from Byzantine Art via [[Lombardy]], Italy.  This influence is shown in the costume of the Wise Men (or Maji) which is representative of the eastern court.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; Other features linking the artwork to Italy are the decorative border, simulated drapery (they have waves and circular medallions), and the geometrical border is similar to the one in the Roman church of San Carlo in [[Prugiasco]] (Switzerland).&lt;ref name="Esteller" /&gt;

'''''Barbershop''''' is a 2002 American [[comedy film]] [[film director|directed]] by [[Tim Story]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbershop (2002)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303714/combined|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by State Street Pictures and released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on September 13, 2002. Starring [[Ice Cube]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], and [[Anthony Anderson]], the movie revolves around social life in a [[barber]]shop on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]]. ''Barbershop'' also proved to be a star-making vehicle for acting newcomers [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Michael Ealy]]. It is the first film in the [[Barbershop (film series)|''Barbershop'' film series]].

==Plot==
On a cold winter day, Calvin Palmer Jr. ([[Ice Cube]]) decides he has had enough of trying to keep open the [[barber]]shop his father handed down to him. He cannot borrow, revenues are falling, and he seems more interested in [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s to bring in easy money. Without telling his employees or the customers, he sells the barbershop to a greedy loan shark, Lester Wallace ([[Keith David]]), who secretly plans to turn it into a [[striptease|strip club]].

After spending a day at work, and realizing just how vital the barbershop is to the surrounding community, Calvin rethinks his decision and tries to get the shop back - only to find out Wallace wants double the $20,000 he paid Calvin to return it, and before 7 pm that day. Right after he admits to the employees that he sold the barber shop, and that it would be closing at the end of the day, the police arrive to arrest one of the barbers, Ricky ([[Michael Ealy]]). He is accused of driving his pickup truck into a nearby market to steal an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], but it's revealed that Ricky's cousin J.D. ([[Anthony Anderson]]) committed the crime after borrowing Ricky's truck. As this would be Ricky's '[[Three strikes law|third strike]]', he could be sentenced to life in prison. Calvin uses the $20,000 from Lester to bail Ricky out of jail, but because J.D. set him up, Ricky is still angry.

Calvin reveals that he found a gun in Ricky's locker in the barbershop and shows it to him. They stop the car and Ricky throws the gun into the river, proving that he does not want to get into any more trouble. Then they both go to confront Lester, as well as J.D. and Billy (Lahmard Tate), who took the ATM to Lester's place without his knowledge, still trying to pry it open. Calvin and Ricky demand that Lester give the barbershop back. Angered, Lester orders his bodyguard Monk to pull out his gun. The police arrive just in time to save Calvin and Ricky and arrest J.D. and Billy. Calvin and Ricky see the ATM, and get a $50,000 reward for returning it to police. They get the money, and the barbershop reopens with even better business than before. In the meantime, Calvin's wife Jennifer ([[Jazsmin Lewis]]) has given birth to a baby boy.

==Production==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Produced on a $12 million budget, ''Barbershop'', with a story by Mark Brown and a screenplay by Brown, Marshall Todd, and Don D. Scott, was filmed in Chicago during the winter of 2001 to early 2002. The filmmakers used a storefront in the [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago community area]] (79th Street and Exchange Avenue) that was once a [[laundromat]] to build the set for Calvin's barbershop, and the set was duplicated on a [[soundstage]]. Similar to what he achieved with his 1997 film ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'', producer [[George Tillman Jr.]] wanted to portray African Americans in a more positive and three-dimensional light than many other [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] films had in the past. This film also features three original songs by [[R&amp;B]] singer/songwriter Sherod Lindsey.

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=November 2012}}&lt;!-- needs comments from individual critics, with references --&gt;
The film received positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a "Certified Fresh" rating and a score of 82% based on 124 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/barbershop/|title=Barbershop|date=13 September 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the critical consensus "Besides bringing on the laughs, ''Barbershop'' displays a big heart and demonstrates the value of community." Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 66% based on reviews from 29 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/barbershop|title=Barbershop|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels, spin-off and television series==
{{Anchor|Sequels}}
In 2004, MGM released the [[sequel]], ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]''. All of the original cast returned, but director [[Tim Story]] did not. This film was directed by [[Kevin Rodney Sullivan]]. In the same year, [[Billie Woodruff]] directed a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film entitled ''[[Beauty Shop]]'', with [[Queen Latifah]] as the lead (Latifah's character made her debut in ''Barbershop 2''). ''Beauty Shop'' was pushed back from a late summer 2004 release, and finally reached theaters in March 2005.

During the fall of 2005, State Street and Ice Cube debuted ''[[Barbershop: The Series]]'' on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] [[cable television|cable]] [[television network|network]], with [[Omar Gooding]] taking over [[Ice Cube]]'s role of Calvin. The character "Dinka" is renamed "Yinka" on ''Barbershop: The Series'', as "Dinka" is not a typical Nigerian name (although a certain tribe in the Nigerian middle belt bears the name "Dimka"). In addition, Isaac's last name is changed from "Rosenberg" to "Brice", and the character Ricky has been replaced by a more hardened ex-con, Romadal.

In 2014, a third ''Barbershop'' film was announced, titled ''[[Barbershop: The Next Cut]]''. In late March of that year, MGM executives revealed that they have been negotiating deals with Ice Cube to appear in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/mgm-re-opens-barbershop-for-business-with-ice-cube-deal/|title='Barbershop' Sequel In Works With Ice Cube At MGM - Deadline|author=Mike Fleming Jr|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, MGM announced that the studio has been setting up deals with Cedric the Entertainer, Queen Latifah, [[Lisa Maffia]], and [[Nicki Minaj]] to appear in the film. [[Malcolm D. Lee]] directed the film and [[New Line Cinema]] distributed it.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming Jr., Mike (March 25, 2015). [http://deadline.com/2015/03/barbershop-3-new-line-ice-cube-mgm-1201398929/ New Line Joins MGM And Will Release ‘Barbershop 3.′] ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on April 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbershop: The Next Cut - ComingSoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movie/barbershop-the-next-cut-2016|website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Barbershop (soundtrack)}}
A soundtrack containing hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on August 27, 2002 by [[Epic Records]]. It peaked at #29 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and #9 on the [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]].

'''''Bishop Petros with Saint Peter the Apostle''''' ({{Lang-pl|Biskup Petros ze świętym Piotrem Apostołem}}) is a [[Nubia]]n Christian wall painting from the last quarter of the 10th century.{{Sfn|Mierzejewska|2016|loc="Opis"}}{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} Made with [[tempera]] on [[silt]] [[plaster]] using a [[Fresco-secco|''al secco'']] [[fresco]] technique, it depicts Petros, the bishop of [[Faras]] between 974 and 997. The anonymous work was discovered in the ruins of [[Faras Cathedral]], an important religious centre of Nubia, in modern [[Sudan]]. Rescued from flooding when [[Lake Nasser]] was created, since 1964 it is part of the Faras Gallery of the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]].{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

The painting, which used to be part of a larger composition, representing King [[Georgios II of Makuria]] with the [[Virgin and Child]], was painted on the west wall of the chapel located in the southern [[nave]] of the cathedral.  The portrait of the bishop was placed to the right of the image of the king. The representation of the two highest hierarchs of the state along with their [[patron saints]] indicated the supernatural origin of the power of the nobles and symbolized the unity of the clerical and secular power.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|p=182}}

The image was created in Petros' lifetime, which is suggested by the inscription in Greek accompanying the painting, wishing him "many years [of life]".{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} The painting is considered one of the most precious images of Nubian officials found in the Cathedral of Faras{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} and is also one of six best preserved portraits of bishops discovered there.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|p=176}}

== History ==
The painting, like most other pieces of {{Interlanguage link multi|Christian Nubian art|pl|3=Chrześcijańskie malarstwo nubijskie|lt=Nubian art}} in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Faras Gallery|pl|3=Galeria Faras im. Profesora Kazimierza Michałowskiego w Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie}} of the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]], was recovered by Polish archaeologists during the so-called Nubian Campaign, an international effort led by [[UNESCO]] prior to construction of the [[Lake Nasser|Nasser Dam]]. The excavations, carried out between 1961 and 1964, discovered a religious complex in the town of Faras (ancient Pachoras), near modern Sudanese-Egyptian border. Well-preserved ruins of a large Christian cathedral from 7th to 14th centuries contained well-preserved wall religious paintings.{{Sfn|Sulikowska|2015|loc=¶ 1–12}}

Since the area was to be flooded by the waters of the artificial Lake Nasser, a team of Polish archaeologists led by [[Kazimierz Michałowski]] was allowed to recover the artifacts. A major part was then transported to the [[National Museum of Sudan]], where a team of Polish scientists led by [[Józef Gazy]] carried out {{Interlanguage link multi|Conservation and restoration of Faras wall paintings|pl|3=Konserwacja i restauracja malowideł ściennych z Faras|lt=their conservation}}. Some 40 per cent were transported to the National Museum of Warsaw, becoming the nucleus of the future Faras Gallery.{{Sfn|Sulikowska|2015|loc=¶ 1–12}}

The image itself was painted by an anonymous artist some time during bishop Petros' tenure, between 974 and 999 AD.{{Sfn|Michałowski|1974}} It represents the so-called yellow and red style, typical of a transitional period between the white style of 9th century and later multicolour style introduced in the 11th century and typical of all later wall paintings at Faras until its abandonment in the 14th century. Other images representative of the yellow and red style found at Faras represent King Georgios, a ''Virgin and Child'', ''Three Men in the Fiery Furnace'', as well as a Passion Cycle. The red and yellow style paintings are considered among the most interesting, both visually and for their theological message.{{Sfn|Michałowski|1974}}

== Description ==
[[File:Faras_-_Restoration_in_MNW-04.jpg|thumb|Work on conservation and restoration of the fresco in Warsaw's National Museum, 1964–1966]]

The dark-skinned bishop is depicted wearing his liturgical robes, complete with a narrow, white handkerchief (''[[encheiron]]'') wound around the index finger of his right palm. With it he points at a [[Gospel Book]] he holds in his other arm.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

Petros is dressed in a long white robe (''[[sticharion]]'') with vertical green stripes. His yellow ''[[phelonion]]'' (a type of [[chasuble]]), in the shape of an elongated ellipse, is adorned with a pattern of a red net, with precious stones sewn into the fabric. The edge of the chasuble is also adorned with a strip of fabric with green and red jewels. Bishop's ''[[epitrachelion]]'' is decorated with yellow wheels with a green circuit and red rectangles.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|p=178}} The ''[[omophorion]]'', one of symbols of episcopal dignity, is white with a pattern of circles and rectangles.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|pp=181–182}} The head of the bishop is wrapped in a turban characteristic of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] hierarchs, which could suggest that Petros was a [[Monophysitism|monophysite]].{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|pp=186–188}}

Behind the bishop stands Saint [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]], dressed in a white crown signifying martyrdom. The saint has both hands on the shoulders of the bishop.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} This pose, common in Nubian painting of the epoch, signifies the fact that the saint protects and supports the bishop,{{sfn|Martens-Czarnecka|2006|p=35}} but also points at the supernatural character of bishop's power.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

Around the head of Saint Peter there is a black inscription in Greek: SAINT PETER THE APOSTLE MARTYR OF THE CROSS ABBA PETROS BISHOP AND METROPOLITAN OF PACHORAS [may he live] MANY YEARS.{{Sfn|Mierzejewska|2016|loc="Opis"}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10538">A '''Bit-hilani''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''Bīt-Ḫilāni'', meaning 'house of pillars') is an ancient architectural type of palace. It seems to have become popular at the end of the tenth and during the ninth century BCE during the early [[Iron Age]] in northern Syria although it may have originated as early as the [[Bronze Age]]. Contemporary records call it a Hittite-style palace, probably after the [[Neo-Hittite]] kingdoms of northern Syria.

The oldest excavated building described as ''Hilani'' by its excavator [[Sir Leonard Woolley]] is a palace&lt;ref&gt;A [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001717/https://feldman.berkeley.edu:453/?course=nes190a&amp;do=detail&amp;imgid=00535 plan] of the Palace of Niqmepa at Tell Atchana, the ancient Alalakh.&lt;/ref&gt; in level IV at [[Alalakh]] dated to the 15th century BCE. The palace is thought to have been built by [[Niqmepa, King of Alalakh|Niqmepa]], a son of [[Idrimi]] of the royal family of the [[Amorite]] state of [[Yamhad]] based in [[Halab]].

A building at the citadel (Büyükkale) of the Hittite capital [[Hattusa]] may also have been of the hilani type.&lt;ref&gt;The detached building (labeled as building E on most plans) lies near the north west corner of the palace area of the citadel, between the large reception hall and the more private building in the northernmost corner of the citadel. It does not seem to have been incorporated in the court systems and may thus have served as a more private reception building. During excavations an archive was found within the building. The [https://archive.is/20120802185613/http://www.hattuscha.de/English/kingspalace.htm plan of the building] seems rather symmetrical and is more similar to those unearthed in Sam'al and Carchemish than for example the palace of Kapara at Guzana.

The palace,&lt;ref&gt;A [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001744/https://feldman.berkeley.edu:453/?course=nes120a&amp;do=detail&amp;imgid=00546 plan] of the palace with the adjoining Skorpians Gate. Illustrations from "The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient." 5th ed. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996 by Henri Frankfort.&lt;/ref&gt; with a rich decoration of statues and relief orthostats, was excavated by [[Max von Oppenheim]] in 1911. Some of the finds were taken to [[Berlin]], and most of them destroyed when von Oppenheim's private museum was hit during a bombing raid in November 1943. The [[National Museum of Aleppo]] has reconstructed the pillared portico in front of its entrance.

Other buildings of this type have been excavated among others at [[Tell Tayinat]],&lt;ref&gt;Brief [https://www.utoronto.ca/tap/past.htm description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419221106/http://www.utoronto.ca/tap/past.htm |date=April 19, 2009 }} of the construction periods the found hilani type buildings belonged to, with the oldest (Building XIII) dated to around 950 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qatna]], [[Sam'al]], [[Sakçagözü]], [[Carchemish]], [[Tell Seh Hamad]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schechhamad.de/ Website] of the excavation (in german).

When claiming to have built in the style of a hilani, most builders probably referred to the pillared portico with [[antechamber]] such as:

[[Sargon II]], King of [[Assyria]] 722–705 BCE, at his new city of [[Dur-Sharrukin]], begun in 713 BCE. An isolated building of which not much is known yet has been located in the western corner of the palace terrace.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A portico, patterned after the Hittite palace, which in the language of Amurru they call a bit-hilani, I built in front of the palaces' gates."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]] (704–681 BC), claims to have done some building in [[Niniveh]] in the style of a bit-hilani. Nothing similar to a ''hilani'' has to date been identified without doubt at his palace, known today as the South-West Palace in Niniveh, finished in 694 BCE. The building in question may not have been found yet.

This type of design with a large central space surrounded by a double wall with smaller rooms taking up the space within the walls may be based on designs first used in the late [[Ubaid period]] in southern Mesopotamia such as the [[Ubaid house]]. Pillared porticos as gates or grand entrances were used by several cultures of the Bronze Age around the eastern Mediterranean sea. The examples of the Hittites and the Myceneans may be the best known. Through the [[megaron]]s and [[propylaea]] of the [[Mycenaean Greece|mycenaean]] palaces the style may have lived into classical Greek designs. The late ''hilani'' of the levant may well be the combination of the old broad room concept with a Hittite-style portico. In recent traditional architecture it may have a late resemblance in the design of the [[liwan]] house.

'''The British Catholic Stage Guild''', the main organisation for [[Roman Catholics]] in British entertainment, was founded in 1911. The aim of the Guild, as laid out in the 1931 Year Book, was ''"to establish and encourage spiritual, artistic and social intercourse among [Roman] Catholics connected with the theatrical and allied professions"''. The Guild is now known as the [http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=14489 '''Catholic Association of Performing Arts'''] (CaAPA). 

Its current details include: 
*Address: Corpus Christi Church, #1 Maiden Lane, London, UK, WC2E 7NB 
*Telephone: 020 7240 1221 
*Registered charity number: 267957
*Chair: Frank Comerford 
*CaAPA National Chaplain: Fr Chris Vipers
*CaAPA Chairman of Trustees: Monsignor Vladimir Felzmann 

Current membership includes such noted performers as [[Valerie Masterson]] and [[Simon Callow]], as well as numerous less well-known performers, such as actor Martin O'Brien, who co-founded ACTS (Association of Catholics in Theatre and on Screen) in 2005, and is the current Artistic Director of the CaAPA-affiliated Ten Ten Theatre. 

Deceased former members of the Guild include actors [[Sir Alec Guinness]] (a former Vice-President of the Guild), [[Patricia Hayes]] (who was a former Chair of the Guild, as was her son, actor [[Richard O'Callaghan]]), [[Danny La Rue]], [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] (a former Chair), [[Margaretta Scott]], [[Moira Lister]], [[Eamonn Andrews]] (a former Chair), [[Lionel Jeffries]] (a former Chair) and [[Frank Finlay]]. Guinness and Jeffries were both converts. Member [[Vince Powell]] was a noted television writer and producer. ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' star [[Joe Gladwin]] was Northern representative before his death.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Directory of England and Wales, 1981, pg 393&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Activities of the Guild since then have been numerous and varied, including links with other denominations in services and carols, play readings, Students' Evenings, [[AIDS]] awareness Masses, music halls, recitals, and concerts. 

Past events have included a Memorial Mass for former Vice-President of the Guild, [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]], which was attended by his widow, Dame [[Judi Dench]], and their daughter, actress [[Finty Williams]]; a reception at the Garrick Club for Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]], which was hosted by [[Frank Finlay]]. Members of the Catholic Stage Guild and the [[English National Opera]] provided the entertainment; a fund-raising Quiz Night at Holy Apostles Church, [[Pimlico]] and a talk at the CAA, 20 Bedford Street, by [[Piers Paul Read]], the official biographer of the Guild's late Vice-President, Sir [[Alec Guinness]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Stage Guild website"&gt;[http://caapa.org.uk/diary/index.html/ Catholic Stage Guild website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celtic mazes''' are [[Line (mathematics)|straight-line]] [[spiral]] [[pattern|patterns]] that have been drawn all over the world since [[prehistory|prehistoric times]]. The patterns originate in early [[Celts|Celtic]] developments in stone and metal-work, and later in medieval [[Insular art]]. Prehistoric spiral designs date back to [[Gavrinis]] (c. 3500 BCE).&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;Meehan, Aidan (1993). ''Celtic Design: Maze Patterns'', pp. 7–8. {{ISBN|0-500-27747-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The straight-line spirals of Celtic labyrinths originated in [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] and [[lozenges]] and are drawn by the Celts using a [[connect the dots]] method.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

Celtic labyrinths are found among carvings at [[Camonica Valley]], occupied by the Celts early in the first millennium, most older than the one [[Knossos]] or Classical style example found there. The mythology associated with the labyrinths also suggest Celtic origin. For example, the labyrinths containing eyes or a figure with horns and a snake about its waist imply the deity [[Cernunnos]]. Lastly, Celtic examples resembling the Cretan model but featuring path-line reversal (the path of one is traceable as the line of the other) suggest Celtic pre-knowledge of their construction. Methods of constructing  Classical labyrinths from figure with serpent through waist and ocular spiral may be demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

'''Ceramic glaze''' is an impervious layer or coating of a [[vitreous enamel|vitreous]] substance which has been fused to a [[ceramic]] body through firing. Glaze can serve to color, decorate or waterproof an item.&lt;ref name="Division"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics of U.S. Businesses Main Page|url = https://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|website = www.census.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = EN-US|first = Company Statistics|last = Division|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126030511/http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|archive-date = 2015-11-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glazing renders [[earthenware]] vessels suitable for holding liquids, sealing the inherent [[porosity]] of unglazed [[biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]] earthenware. It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]]. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.

Most [[pottery]] produced in recent centuries has been glazed, other than pieces in unglazed [[terracotta]], [[biscuit porcelain]] or some other types. [[Tile]]s are almost always glazed on the surface face, and modern [[architectural terracotta]] is very often [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]].  Glazed brick is also common.  Domestic sanitary ware is invariably glazed, as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for [[overhead power line]]s.

The most important groups of traditional glazes, named after their main [[ceramic flux]]ing agent, are:

*[[Lead-glazed earthenware]], is shiny and transparent after firing, which needs only about {{convert|800|C}}.  It has been used for about 2,000 years around the Mediterranean, in Europe, and China. It includes ''[[sancai]]'' and [[Victorian majolica]].
*[[Tin-glazed pottery]], which coats the ware with an opaque white glaze. Known in the [[Ancient Near East]] and then important in [[Islamic pottery]], from which it passed to Europe. Includes [[faience]], [[maiolica]], [[majolica]] and [[Delftware]].   
*[[Salt glaze pottery|Salt-glazed ware]], mostly European stoneware. It uses ordinary salt.
*[[Ash glaze]], important in East Asia, simply made from wood or plant ash, which contains [[potash]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. 
*[[Feldspath]]ic glazes of porcelain.

Modern [[materials technology]] has invented new vitreous glazes that do not fall into these traditional categories.

==Composition==
Glazes need to include a [[ceramic flux]] which functions by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other glaze materials. Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers [[silica]], and sometimes [[boron trioxide]].  These glass formers may be included in the glaze materials, or may be drawn from the clay beneath. 
 
Raw materials of ceramic glazes generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]], act as [[ceramic flux|flux]] and therefore lower the melting temperature. [[Alumina]], often derived from [[clay]], stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CsrDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=%C2%A0Raw+materials+of+ceramic+glazes+generally+include+silica,+which+will+be+the+main+glass+forme#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Raw%20materials%20of%20ceramic%20glazes%20generally%20include%20silica,%20which%20will%20be%20the%20main%20glass%20forme&amp;f=false|title=S.Chands Success Guide (Q&amp;A) Inorganic Chemistry|last=Madan|first=Gaurav|date=2005|publisher=S. Chand Publishing|isbn=9788121918572|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorants, such as [[iron oxide]], [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]], or [[cobalt carbonate]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and sometimes opacifiers like [[tin oxide]] or [[zirconium oxide]], are used to modify the visual appearance of the fired glaze.

==Process==
[[File:Enderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|thumb|[[İznik tiles]] in the [[Enderûn Library]], [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]]]]
Glaze may be applied by dry-dusting a dry mixture over the surface of the clay body or by inserting salt or soda into the kiln at high temperatures to create an atmosphere rich in sodium vapor that interacts with the aluminium and silica oxides in the body to form and deposit glass, producing what is known as [[salt glaze pottery]]. Most commonly, glazes in aqueous suspension of various powdered [[mineral]]s and metal [[oxide]]s are applied by dipping pieces directly into the glaze. Other techniques include pouring the glaze over the piece, spraying it onto the piece with an [[airbrush]] or similar tool, or applying it directly with a brush or other tool.

To prevent the glazed article from sticking to the [[kiln]] during firing, either a small part of the item is left unglazed, or it's supported on small refractory supports such as [[kiln spurs]] and [[Stilt (ceramics)|Stilt]]s that are removed and discarded after the firing. Small marks left by these spurs are sometimes visible on finished ware.

Decoration applied under the glaze on pottery is generally referred to as [[underglaze]]. Underglazes are applied to the surface of the pottery, which can be either raw, "greenware", or "[[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]"-fired (an initial firing of some articles before the glazing and re-firing).&lt;ref&gt;"Cleaning Biscuit Fired Ceramic Ware" Hulse D.K, Barnett W.C. UK Pat.Appl.GB2287643A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denio"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chemistry for potters|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|date = 1980-04-01|volume = 57|issue = 4|pages = 272|doi = 10.1021/ed057p272|first = Allen A.|last = Denio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Roller Kilns For The Fast Biscuit And Glost Firing Of Porcelain" Rodriguez Mamolar M.J., De La Fuente Revuelta J. Ceram. Inf.(Spain) 20, No.202. 1994. Pg. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt; A wet glaze—usually transparent—is applied over the decoration. The pigment fuses with the glaze, and appears to be underneath a layer of clear glaze. An example of underglaze decoration is the well-known "[[Blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]" [[porcelain]] famously produced in [[Spode|England]], [[Delftware|the Netherlands]], China, and [[Imari porcelain|Japan]]. The striking blue color uses [[Cobalt blue|cobalt]] as cobalt oxide or cobalt carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;'Ceramics Glaze Technology.' J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Polychrome glazed pottery statue of heavenly guardian.jpg|thumb|[[Sancai]] lead-glazed figure of heavenly guardian, [[Tang dynasty]]]]

Decoration applied on top of a layer of glaze is referred to as [[overglaze]]. Overglaze methods include applying one or more layers or coats of glaze on a piece of [[pottery]] or by applying a non-glaze substance such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or metals (e.g., [[gold leaf]]) over the glaze.

Overglaze colors are low-temperature glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing being called the '''glost firing''', then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and comes out of the kiln, its texture is smoother due to the glaze.

==History==
Historically, glazing of ceramics developed rather slowly, as appropriate materials needed to be discovered, and also firing technology able to reliably reach the necessary temperatures was needed.

Glazed brick goes back to the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC.  The [[Iron Pagoda]], built in 1049 in [[Kaifeng]], [[China]], of glazed bricks is a well-known later example.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite book

Lead glazed earthenware was probably made in China during the Warring States Period (475 – 221 BCE), and its production increased during the Han Dynasty. High temperature proto-celadon glazed stoneware was made earlier than glazed earthenware, since the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE).  &lt;ref name="Zhiyan"&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Kofun period]] of Japan, [[Sue ware]] was decorated with greenish natural [[ash glaze]]s. From 552 to 794 AD, differently colored glazes were introduced. The three colored glazes of the [[Tang Dynasty]] were frequently used for a period, but were gradually phased out; the precise colors and compositions of the glazes have not been recovered. Natural ash glaze, however, was commonly used throughout the country.

In the 13th century, flower designs were painted with red, blue, green, yellow and black overglazes. Overglazes became very popular because of the particular look they gave [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].

From the eighth century, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic pottery]], usually in the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref name="Environment"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/publications/factsheet-nitrogen-dioxide-no2|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Department of the|last = Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative ceramic pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref name="Missoun, F. 2010"&gt;Missoun, F., M. Slimani, and A. Aoues. "Toxic Effect of Lead on Kidney Function in Rat Wistar." African Journal of Biochemistry Research 4.2 (2010): 21–27. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==

=== Metal oxide chemistry ===
Metals used in ceramic glazes are typically in the form of metal oxides.

==== Lead(II) oxide ====
Ceramic manufacturers primarily use [[lead(II) oxide]] (PbO) as a flux for its low melting range, wide firing range, low surface tension, high index of refraction, and resistance to [[devitrification]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lehman, Richard. ''Lead Glazes for Ceramic Foodware''. 1st ed. Research Triangle Park: International Lead Management Center, 2002. [http://www.ilmc.org/Publications/ILMCFinalCombo8-02B.pdf  International Lead Management Center  ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In polluted environments, [[nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) to produce [[nitrous acid]] ({{chem|HNO|2}}) and [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2{{chem|NO|2}} → {{chem|HNO|2}} + {{chem|HNO|3}}

Soluble [[Lead(II) nitrate]] ({{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}}) forms when lead(II) oxide (PbO) of leaded glazes is exposed to [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}) 

PbO + 2{{chem|HNO|3}} → {{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Because lead exposure is strongly linked to a variety of health problems, collectively referred to as [[lead poisoning]], the disposal of leaded glass (chiefly in the form of discarded CRT displays) and lead-glazed ceramics is subject to [[toxic waste]] regulations.

==== Chromium(III) oxide ====
[[Chromium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Cr|2|O|3}}) is used as a colorant in ceramic glazes. Chromium(III) oxide can undergo a reaction with [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) and atmospheric oxygen in temperatures reached by a kiln to produce [[calcium chromate]] ({{chem|CaCrO|4}}). The oxidation reaction changes chromium from its +3 [[oxidation state]] to its +6 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heating Temperature Dependence of Cr(III) Oxidation in the Presence of Alkali and Alkaline Earth Salts and Subsequent Cr(VI) Leaching Behavior|journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date = 2013-06-04|issn = 0013-936X|pages = 5858–5863|volume = 47|issue = 11|doi = 10.1021/es4001455|pmid = 23635007|first = Bram|last = Verbinnen|first2 = Pieter|last2 = Billen|first3 = Michiel|last3 = Van Coninckxloo|first4 = Carlo|last4 = Vandecasteele}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(VI) is very soluble and the most mobile out of all the other stable forms of chromium.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chromium as an Environmental Pollutant: Insights on Induced Plant Toxicity|journal = Journal of Botany|date = 2012-05-20|pages = 1–8|volume = 2012|doi = 10.1155/2012/375843|first = Helena|last = Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chem|Cr|2|O|3}} + 2CaO + {{frac|3|2}}{{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|CaCrO|4}}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Chromium may enter water systems via industrial discharge. Chromium(VI) can enter the environment directly or oxidants present in soils can react with chromium(III) to produce chromium(VI). Plants have reduced amounts of chlorophyll when grown in the presence of chromium(VI).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Prevention ===
Chromium oxidation during manufacturing processes can be reduced with the introduction of compounds that bind to calcium.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ceramic industries are reluctant to use lead alternatives since leaded glazes provide products with a brilliant shine and smooth surface. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has experimented with a dual glaze, barium alternative to lead, but they were unsuccessful in achieving the same optical effect as leaded glazes.

The '''Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia''' ('''CACSA''') was an [[art museum]] and [[art space]] located in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]]. In late 2016 it merged with the [[Australian Experimental Art Foundation]] to form [[ACE Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadsheet.com.au/adelaide/art-and-design/ace-our-sleeves|title=An ACE Up Our Sleeves|work=Broadsheet|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CACSA was one of Australia's most prominent contemporary art organisations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Art and AsiaPacific: Issues 33-36|publisher=Fine Art Press|year=2002|issn=1039-3625|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its mission was "promote, develop and support contemporary art practice and critical thinking through South Australian, national and international exhibitions, publications, debate and associated activities."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacsa.org.au/?page_id=629|title=About|publisher=The Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Electronic-disturbance-theater.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0, photo by Kinsee Morlan]]
The '''Electronic Disturbance Theater''' ('''EDT'''), established in 1997 by [[performance artist]] and writer [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], is an electronic company of cyber activists, critical theorists, and performance artists who engage in the development of both the theory and practice of non-violent acts of defiance across and between digital and non-digital spaces. [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], Brett Stalbaum, Stefan Wray, and Carmin Karasic collectively form EDT.  Taking the idea of the American [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s, the EDT members have always used their real names.  As a collective group they organize and program [[computer software]] to show their views against anti-propagandist and [[military]] actions, and begin mobilizing micronetworks to act in solidarity by staging [[virtual sit-ins]] online and allowing the emergence of a collective presence in direct digital actions.

==Background==
The EDT created a program called [[FloodNet]] to allow [[electronic civil disobedience]] (ECD). This was a form of [[hacktivism]] which would help create the simulation of a [[sit-in]] protest over the [[Internet]] simply known as a [[virtual sit-in]] demonstration to disrupt Zapatista oppressors' websites, by overloading their [[computer networks]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]].  The Electronic Disturbance Theater group believe that the Internet should not be used purely as a means for [[communication]] and [[data exchange]]; it is also a forum for direct action.

==Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0==
Current active members of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, who refer to themselves as Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.digicult.it/it/digimag/issue-062/no-borders-struggles-the-electronic-disturbance-theatre-2-0/ |title=Lotte senza confini. l'electronic disturbance theatre 2.0 |trans-title=Struggle Without Borders: The Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0 |publisher=Digimag |number=62 |first=Micha |last=Cardenas |language=Italian |date=March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; include Brett Stalbaum, Amy Sara Carroll, [[Elle Mehrmand]], [[Micha Cárdenas]], and [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)]]. 

The group has received a storm of media attention for their 2007 project, the ''Transborder Immigrant Tool'' (TBT), which sends experimental poetry to users in addition to helping them find water and safe routes when crossing the [[Mexican American border|Mexican-American border]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arte-util.org/projects/transborder-immigrant-tool/|title=Arte Útil  / Transborder Immigrant Tool|website=www.arte-util.org|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDT have described this project as the next step of electronic civil disobedience, or ECD 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-8159-after-the-storm.html |title=After the Storm |publisher=San Diego CityBeat |first=Kinsee |last=Morlan |date=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transborder Immigrant Tool was shown in numerous museums and galleries in 2010, including the California Biennial at the [[Orange County Museum of Art]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]], and the [[Galería de la Raza]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocma.net/index.html?page=past&amp;show=exhibit&amp;e_id=3126 |title=2010 California Biennial |publisher=Orange County Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcasd.org/press/artists-announced-here-not-there-san-diego-art-now-exhibition-–-opens-june-6-2010-museum-conte |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804112913/http://www.mcasd.org/press/artists-announced-here-not-there-san-diego-art-now-exhibition-%E2%80%93-opens-june-6-2010-museum-conte |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 4, 2012 |title=Artists announced for Here not there: San Diego art now exhibition – opens june 6, 2010, at Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego in La Jolla |publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego |date=April 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galeriadelaraza.org/eng/events/index.php?op=view&amp;id=2418 |title=Transborder Immigrant Tool |publisher=Galeria de la Raza}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is maintained by [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Electronic Disturbance Theater is currently under investigation for their [[virtual sit-in]] in support of the 2010 March 4 strikes and occupations in support of public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/09/virtual_protest_as_ddos/ |title='Virtual sit-in' tests line between DDoS and free speech |publisher=The Register |first=Dan |last=Goodin |date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FloodNet==
[[File:Screenshot_of_Electronic_Disturbance_Theater_Floodnet_from_September_9th_1998.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Floodnet software, September 9th, 1998]]
The group's objective was, with the use of [[digital media]] and internet based [[technology]], to demonstrate [[nonviolent resistance]] in support of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebels residing in the state of [[Chiapas]] in [[Mexico]]. EDT uses both [[e-mail]] and the Internet to promote their work around the world, encouraging fellow supporters to [[download]] and run a tool based on [[HTML]] (Hyper Text Makeup Language) and [[Java applet]] (an internet program used to help support interactive web-based features or programs that a HTML cannot provide alone) called FloodNet.  FloodNet is a computer-based program, created by members of the Electronic Disturbance theater company [http://www.carminka.net/ Carmin Karasic] and Brett Stalbaum.&lt;ref name="Forbes_Floodnet"/&gt;

The FloodNet program would simply reload a [[URL]] for short several times, effectively slowing the [[website]] and [[network server]] down (a [[DDOS attack]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/floodnet&lt;/ref&gt; if a high number of [[protest]]ers were to join in the [[sit-in]] at one time. The EDT would first execute the FloodNet [[software]] in what would be for them a [[dress rehearsal]] before attacking their main targets on April 10, 1998, and a month later, on both Mexican and American government websites, representing both the Mexican President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] and American President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="Wired_Floodnet" /&gt;

FloodNet would work on this basic idea taken from street theater practices and political rallies and protest, but instead present it on a much larger and international stage, with the facilitation of macro-networks and non-digital forms of action.

The EDT's mission was to allow the voices of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation to be heard, after the attack on the small remote village of [[Acteal]] in Chiapas, Mexico. The [[Paramilitary]], a government-funded military squad, surrounded a [[Catholic church]] during a Tsotsil Mayan (a spoken Mexican language from around the Chiapas area of Mexico). For the next several hours the Paramilitary shot everyone to death, those inside the church and any who tried to escape, resulting in the death of fifteen children, nine men, and twenty-one women, four of whom were pregnant, on December 22, 1997. This event became known as the [[Acteal Massacre]]. Those who were convicted of this crime were later released in the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] to the outrage of many, after ignoring eyewitness reports and allowing those who confessed to this crime on humanity. Instead, the Supreme Court focused on the mismanagement of the investigation and the fabrication of evidence.

The Electronic Disturbance Theater took notice of these actions when others did not and arranged their first act of electronic civil disobedience against the [[Mexican Government]]. In a subsequent version of FloodNet, those who had [[download]]ed the FloodNet [[Computer program|program]] in support of the Zapatistas were asked to repeatedly input the names of those that had lost their lives at the hands of the Mexican Army in military attacks.  This would then target the [[Server (computing)|servers]] to return an error message each time these URLs would be requested.  This data request would be stored in a [[server log|server's error log]] and in the eyes of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Electronic Disturbance Theater group, a symbolic list of those 45 Acteal civilians who had died straight to their [[murder]]ers.  If enough people used the FloodNet [[applet]], this would cause the computer server running the website to overload, so that when a regular visitor or someone working within the site tried to access the website or send company based [[email]]s and files, the pages would either load extremely slowly or not at all.  This worked on the same basis of a real sit-in demonstration, where the [[protester]]s block the entrance to a public building of their oppressors and preventing access to the building.

With around 25% of the world's population in one way or another connected to the [[World Wide Web]], with the use of dial-up internet connection, wired or wireless internet [[broadband]] connection and even [[mobile internet]] technology, every one of these means of [[communication]] can allow the internet to be used as a means of non-violent action within [[human rights]], and is viewable around the world, and can be translated into different languages but most importantly not controlled by the [[government]].  The EDT networked performances have already opened access and communication between three unlikely micro-networks: [[net.art]], net.activism, and net.hackers. With technology always evolving there is no telling how these areas will grow.

However, on June 10, 1998, the EDT struck the Mexican Secretaria de Gobernacion (Secretary of Government), which is involved in [[immigration policies]] as well as Mexico's federal public security forces working in conjunction with the [[military]] Zapatista communities in Chiapas unsuccessfully.  The Mexican government would have a [[program (machine)|program]]med [[countermeasure]] in place. This is what the EDT believe took place.  A countermeasure built into the operating [[JavaScript]] was placed in the [[Secretaria de Gobernacion]]'s website that was designed to activate whenever FloodNet was directed toward its servers.  Upon activation, the website would open window after window on the FloodNet user's [[Internet browser]]. If the FloodNet user remained connected long enough, their browser, whether it is [[Netscape]] or [[Internet Explorer]], could crash the activist's computer, forcing the activist to reboot their system and stopping the FloodNet program at the source.  The EDT has since dealt with both the Mexican government both online and offline and the [[United States Department of Defense]], which has now inserted a [[counter attack]] system into their internet browser-based coding to prevent any more FloodNet-based attacks to the system and server.

The FloodNet system was used again against the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1999, where the group would release their online civil disobedience software to the public under the name "Disturbance Development's Kit".

==Cyber terrorism?==
{{tone|date=August 2015}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The Electronic Disturbance Theater has been, and is likely to remain, a heated topic of debate within its areas of activity such as: [[political]] up rise, civil disobedience, [[hacktivism]], and acts which cave been called [[cyber terrorism]].  The FloodNet program enables protesters to voice their grievances in a non-violent sit-in style, without having to attend protests and rallies in person. Additionally FloodNet incorporated Usernames which allowed protesters to be protected from potential retaliation, as their real names did not have to be used. There are those who have criticized that FloodNet constitutes an inappropriate use of [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] which impinges upon the right of those affected to use the internet which those same detractors claim should be free for anyone to use despite [[political views]]. A particular example of FloodNet detractors is [[The Virtual Republic]], their representatives view EDT's blockage of both [[communications]] and [[data]] as an act of cyber terrorism.  [[The Virtual Republic]] believes the system should be open for all internet users, and should be accessible with a simple point-and-click, furthermore it is their opinion that those individuals or groups which might impede the free access to internet resources should be [[banned]].  Protesters are asked to [[protest]] outside of their oppressors' physical location by means which will not affect the business conducted within. Representatives of The Virtual Republic have further opined that actions of the EDT are nothing more than [[agit-prop]] and act only to block data in the struggle for the development of [[democracy]] and human rights.

The '''Entertainment Software Rating Board''' ('''ESRB''') is an American [[self-regulatory organization]] that assigns [[Video game content rating system|age and content ratings]] to consumer [[video game]]s. The ESRB was established in 1994 by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of [[video game controversy|controversial video games]] with excessively violent or [[Sex and nudity in video games|sexual content]].

The board assigns [[Content rating|ratings]] to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the [[motion picture rating system]]s used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of "content descriptors" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. The ESRB maintains a [[ethics code|code of ethics]] for the advertising and promotion of video games—ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences. In 2011, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and [[mobile app]]s, which utilizes a survey answered by the product's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff. Through the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] (IARC), this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. Alongside its game rating operation, the ESRB also provides certification services for [[online privacy]] on websites and mobile apps.

The ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American [[video game industry|video game]] and retail industries; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB's highest age ratings, and do not stock games which have not been rated. Additionally, major [[console manufacturer]]s will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only. The ESRB ratings system is not enforced under federal laws in any of the countries where it is actively used, although it is enforced under provincial laws in some regions of Canada.

Due to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] for being the "strongest" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite its positive reception, the ESRB has still faced criticism from politicians and other [[watchdog group]]s for the structure of its operations, particularly in the wake of a 2005 [[Hot Coffee mod|incident]] that surrounded the organization's handling of "hidden", objectionable content in a [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas|game]] which could be accessed using a [[Game mod|user-created modification]].

Critics of the ESRB have asserted that the organization has a [[conflict of interest]] because of its [[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]] in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.

== History ==

===Background===
Video games with objectionable content date back as far as 1976; the arcade game ''[[Death Race (video game)|Death Race]]'' required users to run over "[[gremlin]]s" with a vehicle and avoid the [[gravestone]]s they leave behind. Although its graphics were relatively primitive, the game's overall theme and the sound effects made when gremlins were killed were considered disturbing by players, prompting media attention.&lt;ref name="sn-controversal"/&gt; A developer known as [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]] became known for making sexually explicit [[adult video game]]s for the [[Atari 2600]] console, but garnered the most attention with its controversial 1982 game ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', which infamously featured a crude simulation of the [[rape]] of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] woman. [[Atari]] received numerous complaints about the game, and responded by trying to sue the game's makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml | title=Gamespy's Top Ten Shameful Games | publisher=IGN Entertainment | work=GameSpy | accessdate=November 17, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426012823/http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml | archivedate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Phoenix: The Fall &amp; Rise of Video Games | last=Herman | first=Leonard | year=1997 | page=88 | isbn=0964384825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[North American video game crash of 1983|1983 industry crash]], caused by the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted a higher degree of [[Closed platform|regulation]] by future console manufacturers: when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) was launched in the [[United States]] in 1985, [[Nintendo of America]] instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a [[10NES|lockout chip]] to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-nintendobanned"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo: Banned in the USA|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-banned-in-the-usa/|work=GamesRadar|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/06/7076-2/ | title=ESRB to game firms: lying will cost one million dollars | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 1987 about the suitability of a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|film-like rating system]] for video games, a representative of the [[Software Publishers Association]] said that "Adult computer software is nothing to worry about. It's not an issue that the government wants to spend any time with ... They just got done with [[Parents Music Resource Center|a big witchhunt in the music recording industry]], and they got absolutely nowhere". The association did recommend voluntary warnings for games like ''[[Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards]]'' (1987).&lt;ref name="CGW"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date= January 1988|last=Williams|first=John|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Goodbye "G" Ratings: The Perils of "Larry"|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&amp;pub=2&amp;id=43 |pages = 48–49|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation and early years ===
Video games' progression into the 1990s brought dramatic increases in graphics and sound capabilities, and the ability to use [[full-motion video]] (FMV) content in games. In the [[United States Senate]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] of [[Connecticut]] and [[Herb Kohl]] of [[Wisconsin]] led [[1993 Congressional hearings on video games|hearings on video game violence]] and the corruption of society which began in 1992. Two games of this era were specifically cited in the hearings for their content; the [[fighting game]] ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' featured realistic, digitized sprites of live-action actors, blood, and the ability to use violent "[[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|fatality]]" moves to defeat opponents, while ''[[Night Trap]]'' featured 90 minutes of FMV content, with scenes that were considered to be sexually suggestive and [[Sexual exploitation|exploitive]].&lt;ref name="sn-controversal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rogues Gallery: Controversial Video Games|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/38876/the-rogues-gallery-controversial-video|work=ShackNews|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inappropriate Content: A Brief History of Videogame Ratings and the ESRB|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/the-needles/1300-Inappropriate-Content-A-Brief-History-of-Videogame-Ratings-and-the-ESRB|work=The Escapist|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Nintendo]] and [[Sega]] had differing views on objectionable content in video games; a port of ''Mortal Kombat'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] was censored to remove the game's overly violent content, whereas the port for Sega consoles retained much of this content, which helped increase sales.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-nintendobanned"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-worstcoinop"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2006/06/28/top-10-tuesday-worst-coin-op-conversions | title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Coin-op Conversions | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=June 27, 2006 | accessdate=March 18, 2014 | last=Harris | first=Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sega had implemented its own voluntary ratings system, the [[Videogame Rating Council]] (VRC), largely to rate games released for its own consoles. ''Mortal Kombat'' and ''Night Trap'' were rated "MA-13" and "MA-17" on Sega's scale respectively. During the hearings, [[Howard Lincoln]] and Bill White (chairmen of Nintendo and Sega's U.S. divisions respectively) attacked each other's stances on objectionable content in video games; Lincoln condemned Sega for even releasing ''Night Trap'' and felt it "simply has no place in our society", while White argued that Sega was more responsible to consumers because they actually had a rating system in place, rather than a blanket presumption that all its games would be suitable for general audiences.&lt;ref name="Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29"/&gt; Fragmentation would also develop in the classification of games; [[The 3DO Company]] created their own age-based rating system, the [[3DO Rating System]], for games released on its [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] platform, and the [[Recreational Software Advisory Council]] (RSAC) was formed for rating PC games, which used a system that rated the intensity of specific classes of objectionable content, but did not use age recommendations. However, Lieberman did not believe that these systems were sufficient, and in February 1994, threatened to propose the creation of a federal commission for regulating and rating video games.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"/&gt;

With the threat of federal regulations, a group of major video game developers and publishers, including [[Acclaim Entertainment]] and [[Electronic Arts]] along with Nintendo and Sega, formed a political trade group known as the [[Entertainment Software Association|Interactive Digital Software Association]] in April 1994, with a goal to create a self-regulatory framework for assessing and rating video games. While Sega had proposed that the industry use its VRC rating system, Nintendo representatives objected to the idea because they did not want to associate themselves with the work of their main competitor; instead, a vendor-neutral rating system known as the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was developed. The formation of the ESRB was officially announced to Congress on July 29, 1994. The ESRB was officially launched on September 16, 1994; its system consisted of five age-based ratings; "Early Childhood", "Kids to Adults" (later renamed "Everyone" in 1998), "Teen", "Mature", and "Adults Only". The ESRB would also use "descriptors" with brief explanations of the content contained in a game.&lt;ref name="Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Kohler |title=July 29, 1994: Videogame Makers Propose Ratings Board to Congress |date=July 29, 2009 |work=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/07/dayintech_0729/ |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/news.aspx|title=Press releases and announcements from ESRB|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. arcade gaming industry did not adopt the ESRB system, with the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) having cited "fundamental differences between the coin-operated and consumer segments of the video game industry" as reasoning. The AAMA, the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association, and the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry, adopted their own three-tier "Parental Advisory System" in 1994, which uses three color-coded levels of content intensity (designated by green, yellow, and red stickers affixed to arcade cabinet artwork).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://coin-op.org/pas-frequently-asked-questions/|title=PAS - Frequently Asked Questions|work=AAMA - American Amusement Machine Association|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theater-group-to-impose-ratings-on-arcade-games/1100-6075491/|title=Theater group to impose ratings on arcade games|last=Layton|first=Thomas|date=2003-09-19|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion and recent developments ===
Alongside its efforts to classify video games, the ESRB also formed a division known as Entertainment Software Rating Board Interactive (ESRBi), which rated internet content using a similar system to its video game ratings. ESRBi also notably partnered with the [[internet service provider]] [[America Online]] to integrate these ratings into its existing [[parental controls]].&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vchip-debate"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Monroe E.|title=The V-chip debate: content filtering from television to the Internet|year=1998|isbn=1136684328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copa-speech"&gt;{{cite web|title=TESTIMONY OF DR. ARTHUR POBER PRESIDENT OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE RATING BOARD BEFORE THE COMMISSION ON CHILD ONLINE PROTECTION|url=http://www.copacommission.org/meetings/hearing2/pober.test.pdf|publisher=Commission on Child Online Protection|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESRBi was discontinued in 2003.&lt;ref name="esrb-timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB History|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/chronology.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Dr. Arthur Pober, the original president of the ESRB, stepped down so he could focus on academics. In November 2002, he was formally replaced by Patrica Vance, who formerly worked for [[The Princeton Review]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref name="lat-strategy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Strategy for Parents: Use Ratings, Be Informed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/26/news/tt-42068|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=April 13, 2014|first=Jinny|last=Gudmundsen|date=October 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-newpresident"&gt;{{cite web|title=New President Named To ESRB|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/92492/New_President_Named_To_ESRB.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the ESRB introduced a new rating, "Everyone 10+", designating games with content of a relatively higher impact than those of games rated "Everyone", but still not high enough to garner a "Teen" rating.&lt;ref name="ftc-ratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-e10plus"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Introduces E10+ Game Rating|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2005/03/02/esrb-introduces-e10-game-rating|work=IGN|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the growth of [[smartphone]] use, in November 2011, [[CTIA – The Wireless Association|CTIA]], a group of major U.S. companies representing the wireless industry, and ESRB announced the co-development of a free, voluntary ratings process for [[Mobile app|mobile]] [[app store]]s. The system uses ESRB's icons and content descriptors, along with four additional "Interactive Elements" ("Digital Purchases", "Shares Info," "Shares Location," and "Users Interact") to inform users of an app's behavior in regards to data collection and interactions with others. [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[T-Mobile US]] were among the first to implement the system for their own application storefronts, and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Phone Store|Windows Phone Marketplace]] already supported ESRB ratings upon its introduction.&lt;ref name="cnet-kneecap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ctia-appratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB, CTIA Detail Voluntary Mobile App Rating System|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/128390/ESRB_CTIA_Detail_Voluntary_Mobile_App_Rating_System.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku-esrblootboxes"/&gt; ESRB president Patricia Vance explained that the partnership was intended to help broaden the ESRB's reach into the mobile market, and that "consumers, especially parents, benefit from having a consistently applied set of ratings for games rather than a fragmented array of different systems."&lt;ref name="poylgon-iconupdate"/&gt;

In November 2012, the ESRB and other video game ratings boards, including [[PEGI]], the [[Australian Classification Board]], and [[USK]] among others, established a consortium known as the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] (IARC). The group sought to design an online, questionnaire-based rating process for digitally-distributed video games that could generate ratings for multiple video game ratings organizations at once. The resulting ratings information is tied to a unique code, which can then be used by online storefronts to display the corresponding rating for the user's region.&lt;ref name="ign-ausiarc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting Digitally-Distributed Games Classified in Australia to Be Cost-Free|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free|website=IGN.com|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-consistency"&gt;{{cite news|title=Game Makers Push to Make Ratings Consistent Across All Platforms|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324595904578117484171808510|accessdate=March 17, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three major console makers, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have all committed to supporting IARC for their digital storefronts, including ESRB ratings for North American markets.&lt;ref name="gibiz iarc consoles"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-03-17-esrb-expanding-to-mobile-digital-platforms | title = ESRB expanding to mobile, digital platforms | first = James | last = Brightman | date = March 17, 2015 | accessdate = November 27, 2017 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Play Store]] was updated in March 2015 to adopt and display ESRB ratings for apps in North America through IARC.&lt;ref name="verge-googleplayesrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Play adopts industry standard for age ratings on mobile games|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8231207/google-play-esrb-iarc-game-ratings|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows Store]] also implemented IARC in January 2016.&lt;ref name="gibiz-iarcwindows"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows Store adopts IARC rating system|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-01-07-windows-store-adopts-iarc-rating-system|website=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS App Store|App Store]] still uses its own generic age rating system and does not use the ESRB or IARC systems.&lt;ref name="cnet-kneecap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple, Google kneecap 'universal' content rating for apps|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57332972-94/apple-google-kneecap-universal-content-rating-for-apps/|work=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tc-ctiaapps"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/29/ctia-and-esrb-debuts-app-rating-system-no-buy-in-from-google-or-apple/ | title=CTIA And ESRB Debut App Rating System, No Buy-In From Google Or Apple | publisher=[[AOL]] | work=TechCrunch | accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating process==
To obtain a rating for a game, a publisher submits a detailed questionnaire and a DVD containing footage of the most graphic and extreme content found in the game to the ESRB, including content related to the game's context, storyline, reward system, unlockable and otherwise "hidden" content, and other elements that may affect its rating. They may also provide printed copies of the game's script and lyrics from songs in the game. The footage is reviewed by a team of at least three raters, who discuss what the most appropriate and "helpful" rating for the game would be, based on the footage and details provided. Raters represent various demographics, including parents, along with [[Gamer|casual and "hardcore" gamers]]. Raters were formerly hired on a part-time basis, but in 2007, ESRB transitioned to a team of seven full-time raters, who all live in the [[New York City]] area.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gs-fulltime"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/esrb-hiring-full-time-raters/1100-6166197/ | title=ESRB hiring full-time raters | publisher=[[CNET Networks]] | work=GameSpot | accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gi-ratingsgame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-notyetrated"&gt;{{cite web|title=This Game Is Not Yet Rated: Inside The ESRB Ratings System|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130387/this_game_is_not_yet_rated_inside_.php?|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-changes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/09/5311-2/ | title=ESRB makes changes in wake of Hot Coffee | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"/&gt;

If a publisher does not agree with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|The Punisher]]'' was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating.&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"/&gt; There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-notyetrated"/&gt;

When the game is ready for release, the publisher sends copies of the final version of the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are [[Game testing|play tested]] for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the content of their games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a product recall, if deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs about ESRB|url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place [[news embargo|embargoes]] on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/esrb-reins-premature-game-leaks/ | title=ESRB Reins In Premature Game Leaks | publisher=Future Publishing | work=Edge | date=June 19, 2008 | accessdate=March 18, 2014 | last=Graft | first=Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the ESRB introduced its Short Form, a free streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable games as a way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games. Rather than having raters review each product (the Long Form), publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for [[mobile app]]s.&lt;ref name="ctia-appratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-googleplayesrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-busyjob"&gt;{{cite news|title=Busy Job of Judging Video-Game Content to Be Ceded to Machines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/arts/video-games/video-games-rating-board-questionnaire.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 19, 2014|first=Seth|last=Schiesel|date=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB planned to phase out the Short Form for digital-only games, instead directing those developers and publishers to use the similar free questionnaire-driven IARC program, which was being adopted beyond mobile app stores, including the Nintendo eShop and PlayStation Store, as a requirement for posting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/67069/esrb-confirms-digital-games-will-still-get-free-ratings/ | title = ESRB confirms digital games will still get free ratings | first = Natalie | last = Clayton | date = May 18, 2018 | accessdate = May 18, 2018 | work = [[PC Games Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to concerns from Sony on the growing number of indie game titles that were receiving physical releases alongside retail ones, the ESRB began instituting new rules around August 2017 that any retail product was mandated to undergo the standard Long Form review for the game, disallowing the use of the Short Form for such titles. Alongside this, ESRB introduced a "value tier" for the Long Form review process for games developed at lower budgets (under $1 million), with a cost of $3000 for obtaining the retail rating. This decision has impacted the choice of several boutique indie game publishers, who have either cancelled plans for retail versions or had to stop selling retail versions to comply with the new ESRB rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/new-rating-requirement-makes-life-harder-for-smaller-ga-1820296023 | title = New Rating Requirement Makes Life Harder For Smaller Game Publishers | first= Ethan | last= Gach | date = November 9, 2017 | accessdate = November 10, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ESRBrating.PNG|thumb|right|160px|A typical ESRB rating label, listing the rating and specific content descriptors for ''[[Rabbids Go Home]]''.]]

ESRB ratings are primarily identified through icons, which are displayed on the packaging and promotional materials for a game. Each icon contains a stylized alphabetical letter representing the rating.  In addition to the main age-based, ratings, ESRB ratings also incorporate one or more of 30 "content descriptors" which provide detailed information about the specific types and levels of objectionable content contained in a game, including categories covering different levels of [[violence]], language, [[Sex and nudity in video games|sexual content]], [[Sex and nudity in video games|nudity]], use of [[alcoholic beverage]]s or other [[drug]]s, crude and mature humor, or [[gambling]]. The full label, containing both the descriptors and rating, are typically displayed on the back of a game's packaging.&lt;ref name="ftc-ratings"/&gt;

Games which incorporate [[online game|online]] features must display the additional notice "Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB" (previously "Game Experience May Change During Online Play"), which disclaims that the rating only applies to the content contained within the game itself, and does not cover any [[user-generated content]] available within.&lt;ref name="escapist-op"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obsolescence Pending: Rating the ESRB|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_223/6647-Obsolescence-Pending-Rating-the-ESRB|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=The Escapist|date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escapist-didnotbreak"&gt;{{cite web|title="Boobies Did Not Break the Game": The ESRB Clears the Air On Oblivion|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/op-ed/797-Boobies-Did-Not-Break-the-Game-The-ESRB-Clears-the-Air-On-Oblivi|website=The Escapist|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games that provide post-release [[downloadable content]] must have ensure that the new content remains consistent with the original ESRB rating; otherwise the ESRB requires that the original game be re-evaluated and remarked with the more appropriate rating in considering this new content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2008/04/esrb-dlc-must-m/ | title = ESRB: Downloadable Content Must Maintain Original Rating | first = Earnest | last = Cavalli | date = April 17, 2008  | accessdate = November 27, 2017 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings information also disclaims if a game offers digital goods or other premiums (including downloadable content, [[microtransaction]]s, and "[[loot boxes]]") that require payment of real money to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/new-video-game-label-will-be-required-for-in-game-purchases/|title=ESRB mandating new label for games with microtransactions|date=2018-02-27|work=CNET|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of the ratings icons themselves have been updated several times; originally carrying a stylized, pixelated look, they were first updated in 1999 to carry a cleaner appearance. In August 2013, the rating icons were streamlined again; the textual name of the rating became black text on white, the "content rated by" tagline was removed, and [[registered trademark symbol]]s were moved to the bottom-right corner. The changes were intended to increase the icons' clarity at smaller sizes (such as on mobile devices), reflecting the growth in the digital distribution of video games.&lt;ref name="poylgon-iconupdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/2/4580328/esrb-tweaks-rating-icons-digital-mobile-future-patricia-vance-interview | title=ESRB tweaks rating icons for digital and mobile future | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=Polygon | accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
The ESRB rating system is primarily enforced on a [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulatory]] basis by the [[Video game industry|video game]] and [[Retail industry|retail industries]]; in markets where it is used, retailers typically enforce the "Mature" rating using [[photo identification]], and refuse to stock video games that have not been rated by the organization, or are rated "Adults Only".&lt;ref name="ars-housebill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-esrblaw"/&gt; Modern [[video game console]]s may also include [[parental controls]] that can be configured to restrict games played by specific users, using factors such as their ESRB rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0270-kids-parents-and-video-games#controls|title=Kids, Parents, and Video Games|date=2012-06-26|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/video-games-how-to-setup-parental-controls-version-1431990207/|title=Gaming with guidance: How to set up parental controls on modern consoles, handhelds, and computers|date=2017-05-09|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB has also taken action against video game distributors who use the ratings icons in advertising without authorization or having actually been issued the rating by the board.&lt;ref name="gibiz-wartune"/&gt;

[[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest digital distribution storefront for personal computers, does display ratings when available, and allows games to be categorized and filtered based on categories, but an ESRB rating is not mandatory. As of June 2018, following complaints regarding inconsistent enforcement of its previous guidelines, Steam only bans the sale of games that contain blatantly illegal content, or games that it classifies as being "straight up [[trolling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/31/16570552/steam-adult-games-uncensored-patches|title=Steam blocking adult game developers from sharing uncensored patches|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gibiz iarc consoles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/361305/steam-threatens-to-remove-anime-style-adult-games|title=Steam Threatens to Remove Anime-Style Adult Games|work=PC Magazine|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/active-shooter-game-steam-1202822402/|title=Valve Criticized Over ‘Appalling’ School Shooting Game on Steam|last=Fogel|first=Stefanie|date=2018-05-25|work=Variety|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/the-sex-games-that-steam-censors-1680718912|title=The Sex Games That Steam Censors|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there have been attempts at the state and federal level to introduce laws requiring retailers to enforce the ESRB ratings system. In 2004, California Assemblyman [[Leland Yee]] sponsored a state bill requiring retailers to stock M-rated games on separate shelves that are at least {{convert|5|ft|in}} from the ground. The bill was passed, after it was modified to only require that retailers promote awareness of the ESRB ratings system to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4324 | title = Schwarzenegger Signs California Video Games Bill | work = [[Gamasutra]] |publisher=UBM plc | date = September 22, 2004 | accessdate=  November 2, 2010 | first =David | last = Jenkins | first2= Simon | last2= Carless }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, California passed AB 1179, a second bill sponsored by Yee, which banned the sale of "violent video games" to minors. The term was defined using a variation of the [[Miller test]] (originally created to judge whether a work is [[obscenity|obscene]]), separate from any rating the game may have received. In a landmark ruling, the law was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'', which ruled that AB 1179 was unconstitutional because video games are a [[Freedom of the press|protected form of expression]].&lt;ref name="ars-housebill"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/01/house-bill-wants-5000-fine-for-video-games-without-esrb-rating/ | title=House bill wants $5,000 fine for video games without ESRB rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/ftc-report-retailers-clamping-down-on-m-rated-game-sales/ | title=FTC report: retailers clamping down on M-rated game sales | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-esrblaw"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/id-please-bill-would-mandate-carding-for-m-rated-game-buys/ | title=ID, please: Bill would mandate carding for M-rated game buys | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra analysis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6191/video_game_regulation_and_the_.php | title = Video Game Regulation and the Supreme Court: Schwarzenegger v.

In [[Canada]], ESRB ratings are enforced under provincial laws by film ratings boards in [[Manitoba]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]], and [[Saskatchewan]]. As in the U.S., most retailers voluntarily enforce the ratings regardless.&lt;ref name="manitoba-esrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video and Computer Game Update|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/mfcb/pdf/game_update.pdf|work=[[Manitoba Film Classification Board]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ofrb-videogames"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video and Computer Games|url=http://www.ofrb.gov.on.ca/english/page15.htm|work=[[Ontario Film Review Board]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208132646/http://www.ofrb.gov.on.ca/english/page15.htm|archivedate=February 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vsun-california"&gt;{{cite web|title=California seeks gaming age limits|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=09f7b9c0-f538-495c-97df-5bbfd8faadee&amp;sponsor=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140318212437/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=09f7b9c0-f538-495c-97df-5bbfd8faadee&amp;sponsor=|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 18, 2014|work=[[Vancouver Sun]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the implementation of the [[Film Classification Act, 2005]], which gave it the power to enforce ESRB ratings, the [[Ontario Film Review Board]] had used its own powers to classify the M-rated ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' as a film and give it a [[Canadian motion picture rating system|"Restricted" rating]], legally barring its sale to those under 18. By contrast, the [[British Columbia Film Classification Office]] considered the ESRB rating to be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bcfilmclass.com/decisions/2004/manhunt.pdf | title=Opinion Review: In the Matter of Manhunt published by Rockstar Games | date=February 6, 2004 | publisher=[[British Columbia Film Classification Office]] | accessdate=October 12, 2006 | format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214090109/http://bcfilmclass.com/decisions/2004/manhunt.pdf |archivedate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-rrated"/&gt;

== Marketing ==
The ESRB enforces guidelines that have been adopted by the video game industry in order to ensure responsible advertising and marketing practices. These include ensuring that game packaging, advertisements, and trailers properly display rating information, restricting where advertising materials for games rated "Teen" or higher can appear, forbidding publishers from "glamoriz[ing] or exploiting" a game's rating in advertising, and requiring online marketing of games rated "Mature" or higher to be restricted to users who are [[Age gate|appropriately aged]].&lt;ref name="gibiz-wartune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wartune advertising runs afoul of ESRB|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-05-10-wartune-advertising-runs-afoul-of-esrb|website=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-enforcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enforcement|url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/enforcement.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the ESRB to restrict video game advertising "to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate."&lt;ref name="esrb-principles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles and Guidelines for Responsible Advertising Practices|url=https://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles_guidlines.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board also forbids ratings from other organizations from being shown alongside ESRB ratings on publishers' websites or social media outlets.&lt;ref name="gb-esrbtraliers"/&gt; A group of online gaming publications known as the ESRB Website Council operates under a similar code of conduct, which requires them to display ESRB ratings information for games that they cover, and implement systems to restrict access to audiovisual content depicting M or AO-rated games to users who are appropriately aged.&lt;ref name="esrb-ewccode"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Website Council "Code of Conduct" |url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/downloads/ewc_code.pdf |publisher=ESRB |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824172525/http://www.esrb.org/ratings/downloads/ewc_code.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the ESRB eased certain restrictions on the promotion of M-rated games. Firstly, trailers for games that are or are anticipated to be rated "Mature" can be cleared by the ESRB as being appropriate for "general" audiences—similarly to the [[MPAA rating system#Advertising materials|"green band"]] ratings issued by the MPAA for film trailers. Secondly, the board began to allow, on a case-by-case basis depending on the target demographic of the game, M-rated games to be [[cross-promotion|cross-promoted]] in the marketing materials of games with lower ratings.&lt;ref name="gb-esrbtraliers"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Changes Rules for Marketing Mature-Rated Video Games|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/esrb-changes-rules-for-marketing-mature-rated-vide/1100-4602/|website=Giant Bomb|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online privacy ==
In addition to its video game ratings operation, the ESRB also offers an [[online privacy]] program which helps websites adopt [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] and data usage practices which comply with relevant laws and best practices for the collection and use of personal information, and provides "Privacy Certified" seals indicating certification under the ESRB's privacy guidelines. In June 2013, the service was extended to mobile apps, with a particular emphasis on helping application developers comply with the then-upcoming changes to the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]].&lt;ref name="ars-esrbprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB’s privacy badge all about best practices, not anonymity|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/07/esrbs-privacy-badge-all-about-best-practices-not-anonymity/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-privacycertification"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB will extend privacy certification services to mobile developers|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/26/4466196/esrb-will-extend-privacy-certification-services-to-mobile-developers|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat-esrbprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB expands its ‘Privacy Certified’ services for mobile apps|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/06/25/esrb-expands-its-privacy-certified-services-for-mobile-apps/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The ESRB has considered its system to be effective, due in part to initiatives by the Board to promote enforcement and consumer awareness of the system, and efforts by retailers to prevent the sale of M-rated games to minors.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-decry"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB, game retailers decry "bad report card"|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/12/5665-2/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year following its 1994 launch, the ESRB rating system had achieved widespread usage across the console game industry, although adoption was not yet as high within the PC gaming industry. Lieberman and Kohl also reported that some retailers were reluctant to the idea of removing older, non-rated games from their shelves, and that some retail employees lacked knowledge of the new system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=One Year Later, Is Senator Lieberman Satisfied?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] reported 20% of underaged [[mystery shopper]]s were able to successfully purchase an M-rated video game from a selection of retailers—a 22 percent reduction from 2007.&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings" /&gt; By 2011, these numbers had dropped further to 13%.&lt;ref name="ars-ftc2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC: kids thwarted 87% of the time on M-rated game purchases|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/ftc-kids-thwarted-87-of-the-time-on-m-rated-game-purchases/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2009 Report to [[United States Congress|Congress]], the FTC recognized the ESRB for having "the strongest self-regulatory code" of all entertainment sectors because of its enforcement of advertising and marketing guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/ftc-praises-us-game-regulation-code | title=FTC Praises US Game Regulation Code | publisher=Future Publishing | work=Edge | date=December 4, 2009 | accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-mratedvideo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/03/m-rated-video-the-esrb-and-video-game-trailers/ | title=M-rated video: the ESRB and video game trailers | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings accuracy===
The ESRB has often been accused of not rating certain games, such as ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' and the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, harshly enough for violence and other related themes, and for lacking [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] in certain aspects of the ratings process. Critics have argued that some games only received the M rating rather than the stricter AO rating because of the commercial effects of such a rating; console manufacturers and most retailers refuse to distribute AO-rated games, dramatically affecting their commercial availability. An ESRB representative stated that the Board uses the AO rating when warranted, even due to violence, and that in most occasions, publishers would edit the game to meet the M rating to ensure wide commercial availability instead of keeping the AO rating.&lt;ref name="gi-ratingsgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ratings Game: The Controversy Over The ESRB |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200610/N06.1004.1635.57594.htm |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=March 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023055510/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200610/N06.1004.1635.57594.htm |archivedate=October 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-worldratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB president Patricia Vance's plan for a world ratings solution|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/168233/ESRB_president_Patricia_Vances_plan_for_a_world_ratings_solution.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmoney-snuff"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/26/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ | title=Snuff games and ratings | publisher=[[Time Warner]] | work=[[CNNMoney]] | accessdate=March 19, 2014 | date=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film classification boards of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]] respectively classified the M-rated games ''[[Soldier of Fortune (video game)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' and ''Manhunt'' as [[film]]s due to concerns over the nature of their content, and gave them [[Canadian motion picture rating system|"Restricted"]] ratings, legally restricting their sale to adults.&lt;ref name="cbc-rrated"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ontario-slaps-r-rating-on-video-game-1.473046 |work=CBC News |title=Ontario slaps 'R' rating on video game |date=March 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-manitobaviolent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manitoba moves to rate violent video games|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba-moves-to-rate-violent-video-games-1.477320|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a correlation between the M rating and sales; a 2007 study by Electronic Entertainment Design and Research found that M-rated games "have both the highest average [[Metacritic]] scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States", and [[NPD Group]] found that 7 of the top 20 video games of 2010 (including the #1 game, ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'') were M-rated, even though only 5% of games released that year carried the rating.&lt;ref name="ars-5percentm"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: 5% of games given M rating, including 29% of big sellers|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/03/in-2010-5-percent-of-games-were-rated-m/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-higherrating"&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: M rated games have higher scores, better sales|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/11/study-m-rated-games-have-higher-scores-better-sales/|website=Engadget|publisher=AOL|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] criticized the ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating, arguing because it has a [[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]] in the video game industry, it did not want to perform actions that would affect their commercial availability. The organization stated that "study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took [[Hot Coffee mod|explicit porn]] to get ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We have been calling for AO ratings for the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request." The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was "imposing its own narrow values and morality on the rest of the country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF's study and "[[report card]]" used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.&lt;ref name="ars-decry"/&gt;

On the other hand, some have felt that the "Mature" rating is too broad; [[video game journalism|video game journalist]] Ben Kuchera noted that ''[[Halo 3]]''—a [[sci-fi]] [[first-person shooter]] whose level of violence was, in his opinion, comparable to a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film, had received an M rating for "Blood and Gore," "Mild Language" and "Violence". He argued that "having a game like ''Halo 3'' share the same rating as ''[[Saints Row IV]]'', which carries the 'Blood,' Intense Violence,' 'Partial Nudity,' 'Sexual Content,' 'Strong Language' and 'Use of Drugs' descriptors was always silly, and it weakened the thrust of the ratings system." Likewise, he felt that the tone and content of the PG-13 rated film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was relatively harsher to children than that of the ''[[Saints Row (series)|Saints Row]]'' series due to the latter's light-hearted tone, but still noted that "as parents we know what's right and what isn't for our kids, and being aware of the content they consume is a large part of our job as parents."&lt;ref name="polygon-destinyrating"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuchera|first1=Ben|title=Destiny's Teen rating fixes Halo's goofiest problem: a Mature rating that never made sense|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/26/5845600/destiny-esrb-teen-rating-halo|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', the most recent installment in the franchise, received a "Teen" rating instead of "Mature". Microsoft [[Xbox]] division executive Aaron Greenberg argued that consumers had been "surprised" by the M rating on previous installments "given the style of the game and the lack of real graphic violence and things like that", but that the "Teen" rating would theoretically enable the game to reach a broader audience of younger players.&lt;ref name="gamespot-halo5teen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Halo 5's Teen Rating Will Improve Sales, Xbox Exec Says|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-5s-teen-rating-will-improve-sales-xbox-exec-s/1100-6431866/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adults Only rating ===
The "Adults Only" (AO) rating has attracted a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which has been criticized for stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers' objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is "true in every entertainment medium", but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable would be a good thing for the ESRB system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/168266/We_could_use_more_Adults_Only_games_says_ESRBs_Vance.php|title=We could use more 'Adults Only' games, says ESRB's Vance|date=April 10, 2012|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are [[Think of the children|generally considered children's products]]; for example, the availability of a [[Wii]] version of ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' was condemned by Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] over fears that children could use the game's [[Wii Remote|motion controls]] to act out the game's "many graphic torture scenes and murders".&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Adults Only rating may be pointless and harmful to games as an art form|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/10/5362502/adults-only-rating-pointless-and-harmful-games-as-art-form|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/10/5397680/the-cold-war-on-the-ao-rating-must-stop-if-gaming-is-to-grow-up|title=The cold war on the Adults Only rating must stop if gaming is to grow up|date=February 20, 2014|author=Ben Kuchera|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-mutedviolence"&gt;{{cite web|title=A history of (muted) violence|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/8/4595050/adults-only-ao-games|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes towards AO-rated games have also been influenced by the types of games that have received the rating; Peter Payne, head of [[Peach Princess]], a publisher of English translations of Japanese [[eroge]] [[visual novel]]s, believed that the "Adults Only" rating had acquired a "smutty" and "tasteless" reputation since the majority of AO-rated titles were either niche pornographic titles such as eroge games, or immature titles such as ''[[Riana Rouge]]'' (which ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' described as a game which had the quality of an [[adult movie]], and "[aimed] to do nothing more than tell low-brow jokes and show nude women prancing around") and ''[[Lula 3D]]'' (whose packaging advertised the inclusion of "Bouncin' [[Breast|Boobs]] Technology").&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-mutedviolence"/&gt;

By contrast, the ESRB has only officially issued the AO rating for extreme violence three times: ''[[Thrill Kill]]'', a fighting game with heavy sexual overtones, received an AO rating with content descriptors for "Animated Violence" and "Animated Blood and Gore". Due to objections over the game's content, ''Thrill Kill'' was canceled by [[Electronic Arts]] after it acquired the North American operations of the game's publisher, [[Virgin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-512347.html |title=EA kills 'Thrill Kill' game before release |work=[[ZDNet]] |date=October 15, 1998 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116223732/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-512347.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' also received an AO rating for its extreme violence; while the uncut version would be released exclusively for PCs, the console versions were edited to meet the M rating criteria.&lt;ref name="gamespot-manhunt2pc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/manhunt-2-pc-gets-ao-rating/1100-6216220/ | title=Manhunt 2 PC gets AO rating | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-manhuntsaga"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/06/the-manhunt-saga-esrb-assigns-ao-rating/ | title=The Manhunt Saga: ESRB assigns AO rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-manhunt2newrating"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/08/manhunt-2-will-see-halloween-release-date-after-getting-m-rating/ | title=Manhunt 2 will see Halloween release date after getting M rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, ''[[Hatred (video game)|Hatred]]'', a controversial game whose plot centers around a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, received the rating for its extreme violence and harsh language; one of the game's developers disputed the rating, arguing that "its violence isn't really that bad and this harsh language isn't overused", but also acknowledged the rarity of their situation.&lt;ref name="polygon-hatredao"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hatred given Adults Only rating in US and Canada|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/16/7557639/hatred-esrb-ao-rating|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: revels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/16/6988687/the-worst-trailer-of-the-year-revels-in-slaughtering-innocents |accessdate=October 16, 2014 |title=The worst trailer of the year revels in slaughtering innocents |last=Campbell |first=Colin |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TNPdKo0E?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/16/6988687/the-worst-trailer-of-the-year-revels-in-slaughtering-innocents |archivedate=October 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GabeApology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crossley|first=Rob|title=Gabe Newell Steps in to Reinstate Controversial Shooter on Steam|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newell-steps-in-to-reinstate-controversial-sh/1100-6424263/|publisher=''[[GameSpot]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hidden content===
{{main|Hot Coffee mod|ESRB re-rating of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion}}
In 2005, members of the [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] community discovered that the PC version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' could be modified to unlock an incomplete sex [[minigame]] known as "Hot Coffee", which [[Rockstar North]] had decided to leave out of the final game. The discovery of the minigame caused [[California State Assembly]]man [[Leland Yee]] to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB, arguing that the ESRB was not doing its job properly. US Senators [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Joe Lieberman]] also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the minigame was created by the mod community and was not a part of the original game. This was disproven when it was discovered that a third-party cheat device could be used to unlock the "Hot Coffee" scenes in console versions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4702737.stm |title=Hidden sex scenes hit GTA rating |publisher=BBC News |date=July 21, 2005 |accessdate=December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation, the ESRB changed its rating from M to AO, setting a precedent that games can be re-rated due to the presence of pertinent content that exists on the game's disc, even if that content is programmed to not be playable without modification or unauthorized use of a third-party cheat device.&lt;ref name="escapist-boobiesdidnotbreak"&gt;{{cite web|title="Boobies Did Not Break the Game": The ESRB Clears the Air On Oblivion|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/op-ed/797-Boobies-Did-Not-Break-the-Game-The-ESRB-Clears-the-Air-On-Oblivion|work=The Escapist|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of a version excluding the content, the rating was reverted to M.&lt;ref name="RevertToMRating"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6152490.html |title=FTC Hot Coffee ruling scalds, but doesn't burn Take-Two |publisher=CBS Interactive |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715081911/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6152490.html |archivedate=July 15, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' had its rating changed from T to M due to "more detailed depictions of blood and gore than were considered in the original rating", along with a third-party mod for the PC version allowing the use of topless female characters. The game's publisher, [[Bethesda Softworks]], decided not to re-edit the game or contest the new rating, but noted that ''Oblivion''{{'}}s content was "not typical" of games with the M rating, and that the game "does not present the central themes of violence that are common to those products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf |title=ESRB Changes Rating For The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion From Teen to Mature |publisher=ESRB |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206215229/http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148897.html | title=Oblivion rerated M for Mature | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | date=May 3, 2006 | accessdate=December 18, 2006 | last=Sinclair | first=Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148925.html |title=Bethesda responds to Oblivion rerating |publisher=CBS Interactive |work=GameSpot |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310221919/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148925.html |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of these two incidents, the ESRB changed its policies in June 2006 to account for hidden content; publishers must disclose information surrounding all unlockable or otherwise "hidden" content in the game as part of the ratings process, and publishers can be fined up to US$1 million if they are found to have misrepresented the content of their game after further reviews.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-changes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"/&gt; In response to the aftermath of Hot Coffee and the resulting policy changes, ESRB President Patricia Vance stated that in her opinion, "there is no other industry self-regulatory system willing or capable of imposing such swift and sweeping sanctions on its own members, which in this particular case resulted in the removal of a top-selling product from the market and a major loss of sales."&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt; However, several U.S. politicians, including Senator [[Sam Brownback]], [[California]] Senator [[Leland Yee]], and [[Michigan]] Senator [[Fred Upton]] (who was a major critic against Rockstar during the controversy), still felt that the ESRB had "lost" its trust of consumers, believing that video game developers were taking advantage of the board's [[conflict of interest]] with the industry to incorporate objectionable content into their products without the ESRB's full knowledge.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/96828/Yee_Blasts_ESRB_For_Grand_Theft_Auto_San_Andreas_Rating.php|title=Yee Blasts ESRB For Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Rating|date=July 5, 2005|author=[[Simon Carless]]|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc|UBM]]|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-truthact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-vgda"/&gt;

In late 2006, both Upton and Brownback tabled bills to place governmental oversight on aspects of the ESRB rating process, and make it illegal for publishers to misrepresent the playable content of a video game to a ratings board; Upton proposed a bill known as the  [[Video Game Decency Act]], explaining that developers had "done an end-run around the process to deliver violent and pornographic material to our kids", and that the bill would "[go] hand in hand with the mission of the industry’s own ratings system." Brownback proposed a bill known as the [[Truth in Video Game Rating Act]], which would have also forced the ESRB to have full, hands-on access to games instead of just video footage, and have initiated a government study on the "effectiveness" of the organization and the possibility of forming a ratings organization independent from the video game industry.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-truthact"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brownback Re-Intros Truth in Video Game Rating Act|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/103712/Brownback_ReIntros_Truth_in_Video_Game_Rating_Act.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-vgda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Game Decency Act of 2006 Introduced To Senate|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11070|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microtransactions ===
In October 2017, in response to growing criticism of the [[loot box]] model for video game [[microtransactions]] (which grant chances at earning randomized items of various rarities, typically cosmetic in nature, in exchange for payment), the ESRB stated their opinion that they were not a form of gambling. They described them as a voluntary and optional aspect of a video game, and comparable to [[booster pack]]s for [[collectible card game]]s because their purchase guarantees that a user will receive items at all, but not necessarily high-value items all the time. The ESRB added that games that contain actual wagering of real money would hold the Adults Only rating.&lt;ref name="kotaku-esrblootboxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/esrb-says-it-doesnt-see-loot-boxes-as-gambling-1819363091|title=ESRB Says It Doesn't See 'Loot Boxes' As Gambling|last=Schreier|first=Jason|date=October 11, 2017|work=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/state-legislators-weigh-law-to-block-battlefront-ii-sale-w512412 | title = State Legislators Weigh Law to Block Sale of 'Battlefront II' to Children | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = November 22, 2017 | accessdate = November 22, 2017 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2018, U.S. senator [[Maggie Hassan]] asked the ESRB to examine if games with loot box microtransactions were being marketed in an "ethical and transparent way" that "adequately protects the developing minds of young children from predatory practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/us-senator-demands-review-of-loot-box-policies-citing-potential-harm/|title=US Senator demands review of loot box policies, citing potential harm [Updated]|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB subsequently announced on February 27, 2018, that it would introduce a new label for any games that contain "the ability to purchase digital goods or premiums with real world currency". The announcement was criticized for being overreaching and ambiguous, as it applies to not only microtransactions, but any purchases of digital goods in relation to a game (which includes [[downloadable content]]), and would thus apply to almost all modern video games. Patrica Vance stated that the ESRB avoided references to specific types of microtransactions, so that the advisory label could be understood by parents unaware of specific details. Vance added that the ESRB was "unable to find any evidence that children specifically have been [psychologically] impacted by loot boxes" or that they caused children to develop "some sort of tendency towards gambling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/after-months-of-controversy-esrb-will-add-in-game-purc-1823356171|title=After Months Of Controversy, ESRB Will Add 'In-Game Purchases' Label To Games|last=Schreier|first=Jason|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17058400/esrb-in-game-purchases-label-microtransactions-loot-boxes-regulation-oversight|title=ESRB’s loot box response is new "in-game purchases" label that applies to almost every game|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/esrb-defends-fun-loot-boxes-as-it-starts-labeling-all-in-game-purchases/|title=ESRB defends "fun" loot boxes as it starts labeling all "in-game purchases" [Updated]|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst ESRB ratings are officially recognised in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and their respective territories, most major game publishers extended their use as ''de facto'' in various South American countries (except for Brazil due to [[Brazilian advisory rating system|its own rating system]]), and, in Nintendo's case, some Asian countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4399">'''Film rights''' are rights under [[copyright]] law to produce a [[film]] as a [[derivative work]] of a given item of [[intellectual property]]. In [[US law]], these rights belong to the holder of the copyright, who may sell (or "[[option (filmmaking)|option]]") them to someone in the film industry—usually a [[film producer|producer]] or [[film director|director]], or sometimes a specialist broker of such properties—who will then try to gather industry professionals and secure the financial backing necessary to convert the property into a film. Such rights differ from the right to commercially exhibit a finished motion picture, which rights are usually referred to as "exhibition rights" or "public-performance rights".

==Origins==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the need to secure film rights of previously published or produced source materials still under copyright stems from [[case law]].  In 1907, the [[Kalem Company]] produced a one-reel [[silent film]] version of General [[Lew Wallace]]'s [[novel]] ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'' without first securing film rights.  Wallace's estate and his American publisher, [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] sued for [[copyright infringement]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, establishing the [[precedent]] that all adaptations are subject to copyright.

== Options ==
When producers '''option''' a script, they are purchasing the right to buy certain rights to intellectual property.  A general option fee is 10% of the cost of the rights, should the producers manage to secure full financing for their project and have it "greenlit".    Because few projects actually manage to be greenlit, options allow producers to reduce their loss in the event that a project fails to come to fruition. Should the project be greenlit, an option provides a legally binding guarantee to purchase the film rights.

The contract for an option will specify the length of time it is valid for. If the producer is unable to have their project greenlit within the specified timeframe (e.g. two years), the option will expire. The rights holder can then put the previously optioned rights up for sale again. Or, the contract may allow the producer to renew the option for a certain price.

== Chain of title ==
As it is common for scripts to be stuck in [[development hell]], the options for a script may expire and be resold on multiple occasions. As well, producers who purchase an option and rework the script own the rights to their own derivative work- while the original rights holder owns the underlying rights.  This lineage is referred to as the [[chain of title]].  This lineage can become cloudy if the underlying rights are divided.  Producers may purchase the rights to a specific region (i.e. a country, the entire world, or the universe) and/or they may purchase ancillary rights such as merchandising rights.

In some cases, it may be uncertain as to the exact owners of a particular version of a script and to the exact set of rights.  It is important for an [[entertainment lawyer]] to determine how 'clean' a chain of title is.

'''''Fishing Boats, Key West''''' is a 1903 [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] and graphite [[Drawing|drawing]] by [[Winslow Homer]]. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11120|title=Fishing Boats, Key West|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
Homer executed a quick pencil sketch of the dimensions and layout of the image, over which he used watercolor to fully develop the forms of the clouds, sea, and boats. The highlights of the image are untouched areas of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/American_Drawings_Watercolors_and_Prints_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_37_no_4_Spring_1980|title="American Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints": The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, v. 37, no. 4 (Spring, 1980) {{!}} MetPublications {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Growth of a Leader''''' is a 1964 painting by [[Norman Rockwell]]. It appeared as the 1966 [[Brown &amp; Bigelow]] Boy Scout Calendar. Long-time Rockwell model James Edgerton and his son are depicted as a Scout moving though the stages of a man's Scouting career.

==Creation==
The Edgerton family lived next to Norman Rockwell for 10 years. During that time, four generations of Edgertons posed for Rockwell.&lt;ref name=BGlobe&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=Martine|title=Models for Norman Rockwell's Portraits Reunite|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/09/29/models-for-america/mfgfvQl0lbkutSVFORlYtO/story.html|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time that James "Buddy" Edgerton posed for Rockwell was for the 1945 Boy Scout Calendar illustration, ''[[I Will Do My Best]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrm.org/apprints/?p=375 |title=''I Will Do My Best'' |website=[[Norman Rockwell Museum]] |accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1943.&lt;ref name=radio /&gt;  The final time was for ''Growth of a Leader'', after Rockwell moved from [[Arlington, Vermont]], to [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Carol|title=The Models Behind Rockwell's Portraits|url=http://www.thestory.org/stories/2013-09/models-behind-rockwell-s-portraits|website=The Story|publisher=American Public Media|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the four men depicted, three were modeled after Buddy and the fourth, the Cub Scout, was modeled after his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Momberg|first1=Tom|title=Rockwell Models Share Memories|url=http://www.benningtonbanner.com/stories/rockwell-models-share-memories,319354|newspaper=[[Bennington Banner]]|date= 2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since no one in the Edgerton family was involved in Scouting, all of the uniforms were borrowed from friends.&lt;ref name=BGlobe /&gt;

==Composition==
The painting depicts the stages a man goes through as he moves through the Scouting program, in front of an American flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolgamott|first1=L. Kent|title=Sentimental Journeys|newspaper=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|url=http://journalstar.com/lifestyles/l-kent-wolgamott-column-sentimental-journeys/article_eebe7749-06cc-54ae-9bd7-a071ef183f48.html|date=28 August 2004|page=5 (Section K)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle starts with a young [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]]. As the boy becomes older he moves to the [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and then the [[Sea Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scout/Explorer]] (modern day [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]) programs.&lt;ref name=NSM&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth of a Leader by Norman Rockwell|url=http://www.bsamuseum.org/Exhibitions/CellPhoneTour.aspx|website=National Scouting Museum|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea Scout has an Eagle Scout pin on his uniform. Finally, the man, with flecks of gray in his temples, becomes a Scoutmaster. Each of the figures is looking at a single point off of the canvasing, giving them the feeling of being united in a single purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Williams |first=Monica Bernardette Ellen |title=An Examination of Norman Rockwell's Peace Corps Series: Tradition and Innovation |type=MA |chapter= |url=https://ir.stonybrook.edu/jspui/handle/11401/72352 |date=May 2008 |publisher=[[Stony Brook University]] |access-date= |docket= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
The painting represents the increase in maturity a Scout gains as he goes through the program. This is shown by the physical changes to each of the figures and by the change in expression on each of their faces.&lt;ref name=NSM /&gt;

'''''Hartbeat''''' was a [[CBBC|Children's BBC]] television arts programme presented by [[Tony Hart]]. It was broadcast between 1984 and 1993. The series was a follow on from ''[[Take Hart]]'' and taught children how to design art features and use everyday items to make objects.

==History==
Like its predecessor ''Take Hart'', ''Hartbeat'' featured Hart and the animated [[Plasticine]] character [[Morph (character)|Morph]] and taught children how to design art features and use everyday items to make objects. The first episode was screened on 14 September 1984. Throughout its run it was shown during the afternoons with the first series on Fridays as a standalone programme. The second series onwards adopted the ''Children's BBC'' branding in 1985, when the service was launched, at which time it was moved to Wednesday afternoons where it remained until the series ended in 1993. Each episode was approximately half an hour in length.

==Theme==
''Hartbeat'' continued the themes covered by ''Take Hart'' but was a deliberate attempt to update the image of its predecessor. A more modern set of opening titles using rudimentary [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and a synthesised theme tune were introduced. The theme tune was composed by [[David Owen Smith]].

Several young female co-presenters were added, initially alternating between Margot Wilson, Joanna Kirk, Gabrielle Bradshaw, Alison Miller and Liza Brown. The studio backdrops were also changed to reflect the new direction of the series. In another attempt to move away from the format of ''Take Hart'', a storyline was also featured in each episode to keep casual viewers interested, generally revolving around a topic – e.g. a broken computer, Tony's birthday or something similar. Some fans of ''Take Hart'' felt that the inclusion of storylines was upstaging the premise of the show.

The "''Gallery''" segment, as featured in both ''[[Take Hart]]'' and its predecessor ''[[Vision On]]'', in which viewers would send in their own artworks, also remained in the series and has continued to be used since 1994 in the BBC Children's programme ''[[SMart]]''. In addition, with the advent of computers in schools at this time, Hart would often arrange for professional graphic designers to visit the studio so that they could demonstrate the use of computers in art and craft and show off the latest software made for this purpose.

[[Colin Bennett (UK TV)|Colin Bennett]] continued playing the role of Mr Bennett, the bumbling caretaker from ''Take Hart'', and the end of each episode normally featured a humorous segment where Mr Bennett would distract Tony while in the middle of a task (such as filling up a sink to do the washing up), then after the closing credits Tony would be shown dealing with aftermath caused by Mr Bennett's distraction (such as the sink overflowing and flooding the studio). In the 1989 series Mr Bennett was replaced with the dotty tea lady Elvira Muckett played by Amanda Swift. Elvira could generally be heard calling "Te-ea!" and would "annoyingly" refer to Tony and the co-presenter of the day as "Mr and Mrs Hartbeat". Her first appearance featured her humming the original ''Take Hart'' theme "Left Bank Two" in an attempt to appeal to longer-term viewers.

Eventually Elvira was replaced by an accident-prone cleaning-lady named Alison in 1992 in an attempt to bring back the "comedy" element left by Mr Bennett's departure.

==Popularity==
In its heyday between 1984 and 1990 ''Hartbeat'' regularly attracted over 5 million viewers which was, at the time, a very high figure for a children's television series in the UK.,&lt;ref name="Obituary: Tony Hart"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7836151.stm|title=Obituary: Tony Hart |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate= 2 February 2009 | date=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the most popular series broadcast on [[Children's BBC]].&lt;ref name="Obituary: Tony Hart"/&gt; The popularity of the series led to repeats being screened on the [[Children's BBC]] segment of BBC 2's short-lived daytime television service, ''Daytime on Two'', in a morning slot, during school holidays between 1986 and 1989.&lt;ref name="Obituary: Tony Hart"/&gt;

By 1992 ''Hartbeat'' was felt to have become a shadow of its former self and, with viewing figures on the wane, the BBC finally decided to discontinue the series a year later. The final episode was screened on 17 November 1993.

==Hart's retirement==
Following the cancellation of ''Hartbeat'' Tony Hart took a break from presenting for two years before re-emerging in the show ''Artbox Bunch'' for two series in 1995 and 1996 and then in ''Smart Hart'' for two series in 1999 and 2000 before announcing his retirement from television in 2001.

'''''Heaven's Gate''''' is a 1980 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] film written and directed by [[Michael Cimino]]. Loosely based on the [[Johnson County War]], it portrays a fictional dispute between [[land baron]]s and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] [[immigrant]]s in [[Wyoming]] in the 1890s. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[John Hurt]], [[Sam Waterston]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]], [[David Mansfield]], [[Richard Masur]], [[Terry O'Quinn]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Nicholas Woodeson]], the last two in their first film roles. It is notable for being one of the biggest [[box office bomb]]s of all-time, losing the studio an estimated $37 million ($114 million in 2012 dollars).&lt;ref name="insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisinsider.com/movie-flops-over-the-years-2018-2#1978-sextette-1|title=The biggest box office flop from the year you were born|author=Gabbi Shaw|work=Insider |date=February 27, 2017 |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also initially viewed as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/21/1|title=From hell|first=Joe|last=Queenan|date=March 20, 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticsatlarge.ca/2012/02/michael-ciminos-heavens-gate-and-death.html|title=Critics At Large: Michael Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate and the Death of the Auteur Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spartandog76.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/retro-review-heavens-gate-1980/|title=Retro Review – Heaven’s Gate (1980)|date=March 8, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were major setbacks in the film's production due to cost and time overruns, negative press (including allegations of [[animal abuse]] on-set) and rumors about Cimino's allegedly authoritarian directorial style; the film resultantly opened to scathing reviews, earning only $3.5 million domestically (from an estimated $44 million budget),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-box-office-flops-pictures,0,7165703.photogallery#axzz2tJcnZf9r Eller, Claudia, "The costliest box office flops of all time", ''Los Angeles Times'' (January 15, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; eventually causing its parent studio, [[United Artists]], to collapse, and effectively destroying the reputation of Cimino, previously a rising Hollywood ''[[auteur]]'' from the success of his 1978 film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', winner of the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] in [[51st Academy Awards|1979]].&lt;ref name=Queenan&gt;Queenan, Joe (March 21, 2008).

Retrieved September 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Cimino had an expensive and ambitious vision, pushing it nearly four times over its planned budget. Its resulting financial problems and United Artists' consequent demise led to a move away from the brief 1970s period of [[New Hollywood|director-driven film production]] in the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]], back toward greater [[Studio system|studio control of films]], as had been predominant in Hollywood until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Biskind|Biskind, Peter]] (1998).

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In 1870, two young men, [[Ellen Watson#Life with Averell|Jim Averill]] and Billy Irvine, graduate from [[Harvard College]]. The Reverend Doctor speaks to the graduates on the association of "the cultivated mind with the uncultivated" and the importance of education. Irvine, brilliant but obviously intoxicated, follows this with his opposing, irreverent views. A celebration is then held, after which the male students serenade the women present, including Averill's girlfriend.

Twenty years later, Averill is passing through the booming town of [[Casper, Wyoming]], on his way north to [[Johnson County, Wyoming|Johnson County]], where he is now a [[marshal]]. Poor European immigrants new to the region are in conflict with wealthy, established [[cattle baron]]s organized as the [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]]; the newcomers sometimes steal their cattle for food. [[Nate Champion]] – a friend of Averill and an enforcer for the stockmen – kills a settler for suspected rustling and dissuades another from stealing a cow. At a board meeting, the head of the Association, [[Frank M. Canton|Frank Canton]], tells members, including a drunk Irvine, of plans to kill 125 named settlers, as thieves and anarchists. Irvine leaves the meeting, encounters Averill, and tells him of the Association's plans. As Averill leaves, he exchanges bitter words with Canton. Canton and Averill quarrel, and Canton is knocked to the floor. That night, Canton recruits men to kill the named settlers.

[[Ella Watson]], a Johnson County bordello madam from [[Quebec]], who accepts stolen cattle as payment for use of her prostitutes, is infatuated with both Averill and Champion. Averill and Watson skate in a crowd, then dance alone, in an enormous [[Roller rink|roller skating rink]] called "Heaven's Gate," which has been built by local entrepreneur, John L. Bridges. Averill receives a copy of the Association's death list from a [[baseball]]-playing [[U.S. Army]] [[Captain (United States)|captain]] and later reads the names aloud to the settlers, who are thrown into terrified turmoil. Cully, a [[station master]] and friend of Averill's, sees the train with Canton's posse heading north and rides off to warn the settlers but is murdered ''en route''. Later, a group of men come to Watson's bordello and rape her. Averill shoots and kills all but one of them. Champion, realizing that his landowner bosses seek to eliminate Watson, goes to Canton's camp, and shoots the remaining rapist, then refuses to participate in the slaughter.

Canton and his men encounter one of Champion's friends leaving a cabin with Champion and his friend Nick inside, and a gunfight ensues. Attempting to save Champion, Watson arrives in her wagon and shoots one of the hired guns before escaping on horseback. Champion and his two friends are killed in a merciless barrage, which ends with his cabin in flames. Watson warns the settlers of Canton's approach at another huge, chaotic gathering at "Heaven's Gate." The agitated settlers decide to counterstrike; Bridges leads the attack on Canton's gang. With the hired invaders now surrounded, both sides suffer casualties (including a drunken, poetic Irvine) as Canton leaves to bring help. Watson and Averill return to Champion's charred and smoking cabin, and discover his corpse, along with a handwritten letter documenting his last minutes alive.

The next day, Averill reluctantly joins the settlers, with their cobbled-together siege machines and explosive charges, in an attack against Canton's men and their makeshift fortifications. Again, there are heavy casualties on both sides, before the U.S. Army, with Canton in the lead, arrives to stop the fighting and save the remaining besieged mercenaries. Later, at Watson's cabin, Bridges, Watson, and Averill prepare to leave for good, but they are ambushed by Canton and two others who shoot and kill Bridges and Watson. After killing Canton and his men, a grief-stricken Averill holds Watson's body in his arms.

In 1903 – about a decade later – a well-dressed, beardless, but older-looking Averill walks the deck of his yacht off [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. He goes below, where an attractive middle-aged woman is sleeping in a luxurious boudoir. The woman, Averill's old Harvard girlfriend (perhaps now his wife), awakens and asks him for a cigarette. Silently he complies, lights it, and returns to the deck.

==Historical background==

The basic plot elements of the film were inspired by Wyoming's 1892 [[Johnson County War]], the archetypal cattlemen-homesteaders conflict, which also served as the background for ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' and ''[[The Virginian (1946 film)|The Virginian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Life-Times-Western-Movie/dp/0831755458|last=Hyams|first=Jay|title=The Life and Times of the Western Movie|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster#Imprints|Gallery Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0831755454|pages=115–116|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the film's principal characters bear the names of actual key figures in the war, but the events portrayed in ''Heaven's Gate'' bear little resemblance to actual historical events.&lt;ref name="Davis, John W. 2010"&gt;Davis, John W. (2010). Wyoming Range War: The Infamous Invasion of Johnson County. Norman, Oklahoma: [[University of Oklahoma Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-4106-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While homesteaders did begin to settle northern Wyoming in the 1890s, claiming land under the newly enacted [[Homestead Acts]], there were no [[History of Wyoming|hordes of starving European immigrants]],&lt;ref&gt;Larson, T.A.

[[Nate Champion]], who is portrayed as a murderer and "enforcer" for the stockmen, was actually a popular small rancher in [[Johnson County, Wyoming|Johnson County]], nicknamed "king of the rustlers" by the stockmen because he resisted their tactic of claiming all [[Maverick (animal)|unbranded young cattle]] as their own.&lt;ref name="Davis, John W. 2010"/&gt;

[[Ellen Watson#Life with Averell|Jim Averell]] was another homesteader who lived about {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} southwest of Johnson County. Two years before the Johnson County War began, he and his common-law wife [[Ella Watson]] were murdered by stockmen, who falsely accused Watson of exchanging sexual favors for stolen cattle. There is no evidence that Watson was a bordello madam, as portrayed in the film, nor that Watson or Averell ever knew Nate Champion.&lt;ref name="Davis, John W. 2010"/&gt;

==Production==
In 1971, rising Hollywood film director [[Michael Cimino]] submitted an original script for ''Heaven's Gate'' (then called ''The Johnson County War'') but the project was shelved when it failed to attract big-name talent.&lt;ref name=talent&gt;{{cite web|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=Heaven's Gate: the bomb that almost destroyed Hollywood|date=19 July 2013|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/classic-movies/10131915/Heavens-Gate-the-bomb-that-almost-destroyed-Hollywood.html|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His directorial debut, ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974), was a hit. In 1979, on the eve of winning two Academy Awards ([[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]) for 1978's ''[[The Deer Hunter]],'' Cimino convinced [[United Artists]] to resurrect ''Heaven's Gate'' project with [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], and [[Christopher Walken]] as the main characters. He was given an initial budget of $11.6 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burr|first=Ty|title=Ty Burr revisits ‘Heaven’s Gate’|date=24 November 2012|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2012/11/24/burr-revisits-heaven-gate/km6gp1cBbxY75qxWrFs6tM/story.html|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was also provided with ''[[blank cheque|carte blanche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthews|first=Christopher|title=The Top 10 Biggest Money-Losing Movies of All Time|date=20 March 2012|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|url=http://business.time.com/2012/03/21/the-top-ten-biggest-money-losing-movies-of-all-time/slide/heavens-gate/|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shooting demands, overruns, and endless retakes===

According to legend, by the sixth day of filming the project was already five days behind schedule.&lt;ref name=talent/&gt; As an example of Cimino's fanatical attention to detail, a street built to his precise specifications had to be torn down and rebuilt because it reportedly "didn't look right." The street in question needed to be six feet wider; the set construction boss said it would be cheaper to tear down one side and move it back six feet, but Cimino insisted that both sides be dismantled and moved back three feet, then reassembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtpchcpwUioC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q=heavens%20gate%20street%20rebuilt%20it%20didn't%20look%20right|isbn=9781402736742|title=Movie Idols|year=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|last2=Wrathall|first2=John|last1=Molloy|first1=Mick}}&lt;/ref&gt; An entire tree was cut down, moved in pieces, and relocated to the courtyard where the Harvard 1870 graduation scene was shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cochrane|first=John|title=A Hollywood Elegy: Revisiting Heaven's Gate|date=21 May 2013|url=http://www.charlotteviewpoint.org/article/3053/A-Hollywood-Elegy-Revisiting-Heaven%27s-Gate|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimino had an irrigation system built under the land where the major battlefield scene would unfold, so that it would remain vividly green, to contrast with the red color it would later be awash with after the bloody carnage.&lt;ref name=Dargis /&gt;

Cimino shot more than 1.3 million feet (nearly 220 hours) of footage, costing the studio approximately $200,000 per day in salary, locations, and acting fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_M3nR4wI99AC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20cimino%20shot%20more%20than%201.3%20million%20feet|title=A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood Under the Electronic Rainbow, 1980-1989|last=Prince|first=Stephen|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520232662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, it was said Cimino wished to surpass [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s mark of shooting one million feet of footage for ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979).&lt;ref name=talent/&gt;

Cimino's obsessive behavior soon earned him the nickname "The Ayatollah". Production fell behind schedule as rumors spread of Cimino's demanding up to 50 takes of individual scenes and delaying filming until a cloud that he liked rolled into the frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/38815985?slide=9 |title=The 15 Biggest Box Office Bombs -&gt; ''Heaven's Gate'' #8|work= [[CNBC]]|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the delays, several musicians originally brought to Montana to work on the film for only three weeks ended up stranded, waiting to be called for shoots to materialize, and simply sat there for six months. The experience, as the [[Associated Press]] put it, "was both stunningly boring and a raucous good time, full of [[jam session]]s, strange adventures and curiously little actual shooting." The jam sessions served as the beginning of numerous musical collaborations between Bridges and Kristofferson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Ambrosio|first1=Brian|title=Bridges talks about Montana in advance of Missoula show|url=http://lastbestnews.com/site/2016/03/bridges-talks-about-montana-in-advance-of-missoula-show/|website=Last Best News|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As production staggered forward, United Artists seriously considered firing Cimino and replacing him with another director, reportedly Norman Jewison.&lt;ref name=slave/&gt;

Actor [[John Hurt]] reportedly spent so long waiting around on the production for something to do that he went off and made ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980) for [[David Lynch]] in the interim, and then came back to shoot more scenes on ''Heaven's Gate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=10 stories of excess from the production of Heaven's Gate|date=27 March 2014|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/heavens-gate/29865/10-stories-of-excess-from-the-production-of-heavens-gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Heaven's Gate'' finished shooting in March 1980, having cost nearly $30 million.&lt;ref name=million&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis|first=Manhola|title=The Second Coming of ‘Heaven’s Gate’|date=15 March 2013|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/movies/michael-ciminos-heavens-gate-returns-to-film-forum.html|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, during post-production Cimino changed the lock to the studio's editing room, prohibiting executives from seeing the film until he completed his cut, although Cimino disputed the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abramovitch|first1=Seth|title='Deer Hunter' Director's First Interview in 13 Years: Michael Cimino Touts Clint Eastwood for President, Blasts Rumors He's Becoming a Woman|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/deer-hunter-directors-first-interview-773132|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Oscar-winning editor [[William H.

He wanted awe. The idea was that the magic man was in his workshop doing his magic, and we should all just leave him alone and let him finish."

===Workprint cut and eventual plans for release===
On June 26, 1980, Cimino previewed a [[workprint]] for executives at United Artists that reportedly ran five hours and twenty-five minutes (325 minutes), which Cimino said was "about 15 minutes longer than the final cut would be."&lt;ref name="BachFinalCut"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bach|first=Steven|title=Final Cut: Art, Money, and Ego in the Making of Heaven's Gate, the Film That Sank United Artists|origyear=1985|year=1999|publisher=Newmarket Press|location=New York, NY|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executives flatly refused to release the film at that length and once again contemplated firing Cimino.&lt;ref name = BachFinalCut/&gt; However, Cimino promised them he could re-edit the film and spent the entire summer and fall of 1980 doing so, finally paring it down to its original premiere length of 3 hours and 39 minutes (219 minutes). The original wide-release opening on Christmas of 1979 had come and gone, so UA and Cimino finally set up a release date in November 1980.&lt;ref name=million/&gt;

==Reception==

===Initial reactions===
The final cut finally premiered at New York's Cinema 1 theater on November 19, 1980. The premiere was, by all accounts, a disaster. During the intermission, the audience was so subdued that Cimino was said to have asked why no one was drinking the champagne. He was reportedly told by his publicist, "Because they hate the movie, Michael."&lt;ref name = BachFinalCut /&gt;

''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Vincent Canby]] panned the film, calling it "something quite rare in movies these days - an unqualified disaster," comparing it to "a forced four-hour walking tour of one's own living room." Canby went even further by stating that "[i]t fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the devil to obtain the success of ''The Deer Hunter'' and the Devil has just come around to collect."&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940CE4D61638F93AA25752C1A966948260 |title='Heaven's Gate,' A Western by Cimino |author=[[Vincent Canby|Canby, Vincent]] |date=November 19, 1980 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a sparsely attended one-week run, Cimino and United Artists quickly pulled the film from any further releases, completely postponing a full worldwide release.&lt;ref name="Doc"&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Michael Epstein (film director)|Epstein, Michael]] | year = 2004 | title = Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate | url = //www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5LJ0DmlDlM | format = | medium = television | publisher = Viewfinder Productions | location = | accessdate = | time = | id = | isbn = | oclc = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1981 in [[Los Angeles]], the film resurfaced in a "director's cut" two-hour-twenty-nine-minute (149 minute) version that Cimino had recut for a third time.&lt;ref name=Doc /&gt; Reviewing the shorter cut in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] criticized the film's formal choices and its narrative inconsistencies and incredulities, concluding that the film was "[t]he most scandalous cinematic waste I have ever seen, and remember, I've seen ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] |date=1981| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010302/1023 |title=''Heaven's Gate'' review|work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate= March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' issued a dissenting opinion when he reviewed the shortened film, becoming one of its few American champions and calling it "a true screen epic" while stating that in two decades as a critic, he had never felt "so totally alone."&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;

The film closed after the second week, having grossed only $1.3 million total on its $44 million budget.&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;

In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991230,00.html |title=The 100 Worst Ideas Of The Century |date=June 14, 1999 |accessdate=April 8, 2018|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first1=Melissa |last1=August |first2=Harriet |last2=Barovick |first3=Michelle |last3=Derrow |first4=Tam |last4=Gray |first5=Daniel S. |last5=Levy |first6=Lina |last6=Lofaro |first7=David |last7=Spitz |first8=Joel |last8=Stein |first9=Chris |last9=Taylor}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008, [[Joe Queenan]] declared ''Heaven’s Gate'' the worst film made up to that time. “This is a movie that destroyed the director's career,” he wrote. “This is a movie that lost so much money it literally drove a major American studio out of business. This is a movie about Harvard-educated gunslingers who face off against eastern European sodbusters in an epic struggle for the soul of America. This is a movie that stars Isabelle Huppert as a shotgun-toting cowgirl. This is a movie in which Jeff Bridges pukes while mounted on roller skates. This is a movie that has five minutes of uninterrupted fiddle-playing by a fiddler who is also mounted on roller skates. This is a movie that defies belief.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Queenan|first=Joe|title=From hell|date=20 March 2008|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/21/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reassessments===
In subsequent years, some critics have come to the film's defense, beginning with European critics who praised it after the film played at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] was an early champion of ''Heaven's Gate'' and its reassessment, calling it "one of the few authentically innovative Hollywood films&amp;nbsp;...

Combustible Celluloid. Retrieved November 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] calls the film "a wounded monster" and argues that it takes part in "a rich American tradition ([[Herman Melville|Melville]], [[Henry James|James]], [[Charles Ives|Ives]], [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]], [[Charlie Parker|Parker]]) that seeks a mighty dispersal of what has gone before. In America, there are great innovations in art that suddenly create fields of apparent emptiness. They may seem like omissions or mistakes at first. Yet in time we come to see them as meant for our exploration."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Thomson (film critic)|Thomson, David]] (October 14, 2008).

[[Independent Film Channel|IFC]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these critics have attempted to impugn the motives of the earliest reviewers. Robin Wood noted, in his initial review of the film, reviewers tended to pile on the film, attempting to "outdo [one an]other with sarcasm and contempt."&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Robin|title=Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan|year=1986|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-12966-1|pages=267, 269, 283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the cast and crew have complained that the initial reviews of the film were tainted by its production history and that daily critics were reviewing it as a business story as much as a motion picture.&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt; In April 2011, the staff of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]'' selected ''Heaven's Gate'' as the 12th greatest Western of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/1019/the-50-greatest-westerns-r-the-full-list |title=The 50 greatest westerns|work =[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] |location=London|date= April 2011|accessdate= April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Peter Biskind]] covered the many excesses and problems with the movie in his book ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', he also noted that ''Heaven's Gate'' was not dissimilar to other big-budget, troubled projects of the late 1970s and early 1980s (such as [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' and [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''), and that the backlash against ''Heaven's Gate'' could have easily been directed elsewhere. Biskind speculated that Michael Cimino's personal unpopularity was the main reason this film became so widely reviled.

===2012–13 re-release and acclaim===
In the fall of 2012, the film was re-released to "soak up acclaim" as a 216-minute "[[director's cut]]" at the [[69th Venice Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="2012-nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/venice-film-festival-michael-cimino-revisits-heavens-gate/ |title=Venice Film Festival: Michael Cimino Revisits 'Heaven's Gate' |date= August 31, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |author=Lim, Dennis |publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]'' (''ArtBeats'') }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2012-lemonde"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sotinel.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/08/31/venise-2012-michael-cimino-retrouve-la-cle-du-paradis/ |title=Venise 2012: Michael Cimino retrouve la clé du paradis |date= August 31, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |author=Sotinel, Thomas |work = Le Monde |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2012-lesoir"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lesoir.be/archives?url=/culture/cinema/2012-08-31/mostra-de-venise-cimino-est-enfin-au-paradis-935062.php|title=Mostra de Venise : Cimino est (enfin) au paradis|date= August 31, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2012|author=Crousse, Nicolas|work=Le Soir|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 30 in the presence of Cimino, followed one month later by screening at the [[New York Film Festival]] in the "Masterwork" lineup, along with [[Laurence Olivier]]'s ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'' and [[Frank Oz]]'s director's cut of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''.&lt;ref name="2012-times" /&gt; It was then shown at the [[Lumière Film Festival|Festival Lumière]] in France, where Venice Festival director Alberto Barbera described the film as an "absolute masterpiece" that had disappeared, and whose 1980 cutting was characterized as a "massacre" by nervous producers and had been "one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history" that had destroyed careers (Cimino and Kristofferson) following "annihilat[ing]" critical reviews.&lt;ref name="2012-times" /&gt;

In March 2013, the new director's cut was again featured back in New York City in a week-long run screening at the [[Film Forum]]. A major article by ''New York Times'' critic [[Manohla Dargis]] opined that the film's "second coming&amp;nbsp;... brightens a murky, legendary work of art" in a restoration that also "reveals the contradictions of a great flop."&lt;ref name="Dargis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=The Second Coming of 'Heaven's Gate'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/movies/michael-ciminos-heavens-gate-returns-to-film-forum.html|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017}} An article by Nicholas Barber on the [[BBC]] website in December 2015 traced the history of the critical reception of ''Heaven's Gate'' and concludes: "so much of ''Heaven's Gate'' is patently splendid that it is mind-boggling that anyone could pronounce it an 'unqualified disaster'. And the scenes which were slammed in 1980 as being symptomatic of waste and excess – the Harvard waltz, the massed rollerskating – are the scenes which take your breath away."

==Controversy==

===Impact on the U.S. film industry===
The film's $44 million cost (${{Inflation|US-CAP|44|1980}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-CAP}} dollars) and poor performance at the box office ($3.5 million gross in the United States) generated more negative publicity than actual financial damage, causing [[Transamerica Corporation]], United Artists' corporate owner, to become anxious over its own public image and to abandon film production altogether.

Transamerica then sold United Artists to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which effectively ended the studio's existence. MGM would later revive UA as a subsidiary division. While the money loss due to ''Heaven's Gate'' was considerable, United Artists was still a thriving studio with a steady income provided by the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'', ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[Rocky]]'' franchises. On the other hand, UA was already struggling after the executive walkout in 1978 and several other major box office flops in 1980, including ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'', ''[[Foxes (film)|Foxes]]'' and ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]''.

The fracas had a wider effect on the American film industry. During the 1970s, relatively young directors such as Coppola, Scorsese, [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[George Lucas]], [[William Friedkin]], and [[Steven Spielberg]] had been given large budgets with very little studio control (see [[New Hollywood]]). The studios evolved away from the director-driven film and eventually led to the new paradigm of the [[high concept]] feature, epitomized by ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. However, the directors' power lessened considerably, as a result of disappointing box-office performers such as both Friedkin's ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'' (1977) and ''Cruising'' (1980), and culminating in Coppola's ''[[One from the Heart]]'' and Cimino's ''Heaven's Gate''. As the new high-concept paradigm of filmmaking became more entrenched, studio control of budgets and productions became tighter, ending the free-wheeling excesses that had begotten ''Heaven's Gate''.

The very poor box office performance of the film also contributed to a negative impact on the Western genre, which had enjoyed a revival since the late 1960s. Very few Western films were released from 1980 on by major studios, save for ''[[Pale Rider]]'' and ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'', both released in 1985, and a brief revival in the early 1990s with the Oscar-winning hits ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', ''[[Unforgiven]]'' and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''.

===Accusations of cruelty to animals===
The film was marred by accusations of cruelty to animals during production. One assertion was that live horses were bled from the neck without giving them pain-killers so that their blood could be collected and smeared upon the actors in a scene. The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) asserted that four horses were killed and many more injured during a battle scene. It was claimed that one of the horses was blown up by dynamite. This footage appears in the final cut of the film.

The AHA was barred from monitoring the animal action on the set. According to the AHA, the owner of an abused horse filed a lawsuit against the producers, director, Partisan Productions, and the horse [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangler]]. The owner cited wrongful injury and breach of contract for willfully depriving her Arabian [[gelding]] of proper care. The suit cited "the severe physical and behavioral trauma and disfigurement" of the horse. The case was settled out of court.&lt;ref name="AHA-review"&gt;[http://www.humanehollywood.org/index.php/movie-archive/item/heaven-s-gate "Heaven's Gate"]. [[American Humane Association]]. Retrieved March 19, 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626141144/http://www.humanehollywood.org/index.php/movie-archive/item/heaven-s-gate |date=June 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were accusations of actual [[cockfight]]s, decapitated chickens, and a group of cows disemboweled to provide "fake intestines" for the actors.&lt;ref name="AHA-review" /&gt; The outcry prompted the [[Screen Actors Guild|Screen Actors Guild (SAG)]] and the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP)]] to contractually authorize the AHA to monitor the use of all animals in all filmed media.&lt;ref name="AHA-review" /&gt;

The film is listed on AHA's list of unacceptable films.&lt;ref name="AHA-review" /&gt; The AHA protested the film by distributing an international press release detailing the assertions of animal cruelty and asking people to boycott it. AHA organized [[picketing (protest)|picket lines]] outside movie theaters in Hollywood while local humane societies did the same across the USA. Though ''Heaven's Gate'' was not the first film to have animals killed during its production, it is believed that the film was largely responsible for sparking the now common use of the "No animals were harmed&amp;nbsp;..." disclaimer and more rigorous supervision of animal acts by the AHA, which had been inspecting film production since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/cruelcamera/ "Cruel Camera"].

All available versions released in the UK (including the 2012 directors cut) have mandated BBFC cuts to the animal cruelty.

===Workprint cut, premiere cut and an alternative cut===
Notwithstanding the 325-minute "workprint" cut shown to executives in June 1980, Cimino had rushed through post-production and editing in order to meet his contractual requirements to United Artists, and to qualify for the 1980 [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name = Doc/&gt; The version screened at the November 1980 premiere ran three hours and 39 minutes. Bridges joked that Cimino had worked on the film so close to the premiere that the print screened was still wet from the lab.&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;

After the aborted one-week premiere run in New York, Cimino and United Artists pulled the film; Cimino wrote an open letter to the studio that was printed in several trade papers blaming unrealistic deadline pressures for the film's failure.&lt;ref name="Egan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Egan|first=Jack|title=Bombs Away|accessdate= March 13, 2012 | publisher = ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' (via [[Google Books]]) |date=December 8, 1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Artists reportedly also hired its own editor to try to edit Cimino's footage into a releasable film with no real success.&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

Ultimately, Cimino's second edited version, a 149-minute version, premiered in April 1981 and was the only cut of the film screened in wide release. The original negative for the longer version no longer exists because it was directly edited on for the 149-minute version ([[Separation masters|YCM Separation Masters]] of the longer version was used as the source for the Criterion Collection release).  This cut of the film is not just shorter but differs radically in placement of scenes and selection of takes.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt; This version, after leaving theaters, was not released on home video of any kind in the United States, but was later released on DVD in France ("la Porte du Paradis"). This version has also aired on the MGM HD cable channel and was available free-with-ads on US streaming provider [[Tubi]] from March to November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tubi.tv/2017/03/07/tubi-tvs-march-free-movie-arrivals/|title=Watch Free Movies at Tubi TV: What’s New for March 2017|website=blog.tubi.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/everything-free-tubi-tv-november-2017/|title=Here is Everything FREE on Tubi TV in November 2017|website=cordcuttersnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[Z Channel]] aired the 219-minute 1980 premiere version of the film on cable television – the first time that the longer version was widely exhibited – and which Z Channel dubbed the "director's cut." As critic [[F.X. Feeney]] noted in the documentary ''[[Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession]]'', Z Channel's broadcast of ''Heaven's Gate'' first popularized the concept of a "director's cut." &lt;ref&gt;Cassavetes, Xan (director), Feeney, F.X. (critic). (2004). ''Z: A Magnificent Obsession''. [Film]. [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When MGM (which acquired the rights to United Artists's catalog after its demise) released the film on [[VHS]] and [[videodisc]] in the 1980s, it released Cimino's 219-minute cut with the tagline "Heaven's Gate... The Legendary Uncut Version." Subsequent releases on [[LaserDisc]] and [[DVD]] have contained only the 219-minute cut.

Due to the wide availability of the 219-minute 1980 premiere version of ''Heaven's Gate'' and its frequent labeling as either "uncut" or the "director's cut," Cimino insisted that the so-called "original version" did not fully correspond to his intentions, and that he was under pressure to bring it out for the predetermined date and did not consider the film ready, making even the 219-minute version essentially an "unfinished" film.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;

The 216-minute version shown in Venice is quite similar to the 219-minute version, but with no intermission. Some shots in the second part are slightly shorter and a shot with a single line has been cut (just after John Hurt is beaten by Sam Waterston).

===149-minute cut===
In the 149-minute version of ''Heaven's Gate'' released in 1981, the following scenes are cut:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiewire.com/2014/04/directors-cut-10-theatrical-versions-vs-the-filmmakers-final-vision-87520/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Irvine's speech at the Harvard graduation
* The co-ed circle dancing immediately following graduation
* Averill beating up the brute enforcer (who beats up the immigrant in front of his wife and kids)
* Averill passing the beaten man's widow in the carriage, asking her how she's doing
* The spitting fight between the two immigrant landowners in the cockfight scene
* The entire roller skating dance scene
* A shot of female immigrants carrying a load up the hill
* Champion almost shooting the stock grower that insults Ella Watson
* The scene where Ella Watson first leaves Champion to return to Averill
* The introductory part of the scene where Averill reads the names on the "death list" (the edited version starts with John Bridges firing the gun in the air, to restore order)
* Averill weeping to Bridges that he "hates getting old," while looking at the old photo of himself and his girlfriend
* The immigrants being informed that Averill quit his post, and Watson warning them the stock growers have arrived
* The last five or so minutes of the second battle scene, including the footage of the character crushed under the wagon and the woman killing him in mercy
* That same woman killing herself, post-battle, and Bridges and Averill surveying the carnage
* Any reference to the woman on the boat, presumably Averill's girlfriend or wife, from the end of the film

===2005 radical cut===

===2012 digitally restored Director's Cut===

It premiered at the [[2012 Venice Film Festival]] as part of the Venice Classics series.&lt;ref&gt;Drees, Rich (August 31, 2012).

'''''Life of the Party: A Political Press Tart Bares All''''' is a 2011 memoir by Lisa Baron describing her time as a spokesperson for [[Ralph Reed]].

Lisa Baron is a Jewish woman who, despite not sharing Reed's political reviews, went to work for him. Baron stated that the book reveals previously secret information including Reed's view of the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]] and Baron's sexual life; [[Kirkus Reviews]] stated that sexual encounters "seem almost quaint" since there was a "long list of prominent conservatives who have been caught doing much worse".&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lisa-baron/life-party/|title=Life of the Party|date=2011-05-20|accessdate=2018-11-27}} - Published in print on June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Michelle Goldberg]], an opinion columnist of ''[[The New York Times]]'', characterized the book as "a self-portrait of a cynical, fame-hungry narcissist".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|author=Goldberg, Michelle|authorlink=Michelle Goldberg|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/opinion/trump-supporters-bill-white-bryan-eure.html|work=Op-Ed|title=Maybe They’re Just Bad People|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=2018-11-26|accessdate=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] described the book as "A misguided focus on sex and booze overshadows the moments of insight and inspiration."&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt; It criticized the focus on social life over day-to-day life in politics.&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

It had reached Europe by the 15th century, when it was provided with a decorated stiff leather case with a lid, which includes the Christian [[Christogram|IHS]]; this no doubt helped it to survive over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O3311/beaker-and-case-the-luck-of-edenhall/ |title=The Luck of Edenhall in the Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |date=2012-05-08 |accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/edenhall.html |title=The Luck of Edenhall (Eden Hall) |publisher=Pitt.edu |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glass drinking vessels very rarely survive—or remain in one family—for long enough to acquire a legendary status, so the successful passing of this vessel through many generations of the [[Musgrave family]] of [[Edenhall]], [[Cumberland]] is exceptional. Legend has it that this ancient beaker embodied the continuing prosperity of its owners. Telling the story in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1791, Rev. William Mounsey of Bottesford wrote:
:''Tradition our only guide here, says, that a party of Fairies were drinking and making merry round a well near the Hall, called St. Cuthbert's Well; but being interrupted by the intrusion of some curious people, they were frightened, and made a hasty retreat, and left the cup in question: one of the last screaming out;''

:::''"If this cup should break or fall''
:::''Farewell the Luck of Edenhall!"''

The beaker is now known to be an exceptionally fine and pristine example of 14th-century luxury [[Islamic glass]]. Old stories relating to the "Luck" suggested it found its way to England in the baggage of a returning [[Crusades|Crusader]]. However, recent dating which suggests the Luck was made in the 14th century makes this unlikely as the Crusades ended in the 13th century. The antiquity of the legend surrounding it has not been determined. It was the subject of a German ballad by [[Ludwig Uhland]], later rendered in English by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]; this wrongly says the glass was shattered.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;  A number of rare objects owned by families in the North of England were known as "lucks"; the glass is first documented, and named as the "Luck of Edenhall", in 1677 in the will of Sir Philip Musgrave.

The glass remained intact in the possession of the Musgrave family. In 1926 the glass was loaned to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and in 1958 it was finally acquired for the nation. It remains on permanent view in the Medieval &amp; Renaissance galleries. Eden Hall no longer exists, having been demolished in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcumbria.com/pen/edenhall.htm |title=Edenhall, Cumbria |publisher=Visitcumbria.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221110704/http://visitcumbria.com/pen/edenhall.htm |archivedate=2010-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The story of the Luck of Edenhall is told in the 2004 [[manga]] [[Bartender (manga)|''Bartender'']]. It is also the namesake for the protagonists's bar, Bar Eden Hall.

The legend of the Edenhall Cup is mentioned in the first chapter of [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novel ''The Little House at Allington'', saying that guests had to drink from the cup regardless of the danger that it might break.

'''Meduza''' ({{lang-rus|Медуза}}), '''Meluza''' ({{lang-rus|Мелуза, literally «small», «little»}}) or '''Meluzina''' ({{lang-rus|Мелузина}}) is a mythical creature in [[Russian folklore]]. She was depicted in a Russian [[Lubok|''lubok'']] of the XVII or XVIII century. She is described as half-woman, half-snake, or as the half-woman, half-fish creature{{sfn|Belova|1999|p=175}}{{sfn|Belova, Petruhin|2008|p=180—181}}. She is also said to be the deity of deception&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulit.me/books/enciklopediya-yazycheskih-bogov-mify-drevnih-slavyan-read-297569-48.html Bychkov Andrey Alexandrovich.

==Appearance==
She is represented as a sea monster with the head of a beautiful dark-haired maiden, having the body and belly of a striped beast, a [[Dragon|dragon]] tail with a [[Snake|snake]]'s mouth at the end and legs resembling the legs of an elephant and having the same snake mouths at the end. She also wears a crown. Her snake mouths contained a deadly dragon poison.  She is said to live in the «[[Ocean]]-[[Sea]] near the [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] abyss», in the [[Atlantic Ocean|West Ocean]]{{sfn|Belova|1999|p=175}}{{sfn|Damskiy|1801|p=143—144}}.

'''Sir Michael Anthony Eardley Dummett''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|m|ɪ|t}}; 27 June 1925 – 27 December 2011) was an English academic described as "among the most significant British philosophers of the last century and a leading campaigner for racial tolerance and equality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/8981654/Professor-Sir-Michael-Dummett.html |title=Obituary for Professor Sir Michael Dummett |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=29 December 2011 |location=London |date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, until 1992, [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at the [[University of Oxford]]. He wrote on the history of [[analytic philosophy]], notably as an interpreter of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], and made original contributions particularly in [[philosophy of mathematics|the philosophies of mathematics]], [[philosophy of logic|logic]], [[philosophy of language|language]] and [[metaphysics]]. He was known for his work on truth and meaning and their implications to debates between [[philosophical realism|realism]] and [[anti-realism]], a term he helped to popularize. He devised the [[Quota Borda system]] of proportional voting, based on the [[Borda count]]. In [[mathematical logic]], he developed an [[intermediate logic]], already studied by [[Kurt Godel|Kurt Gödel]]: the Gödel–Dummett logic.

==Education and army service==
Dummett was the son of a merchant of silks. He studied at [[Sandroyd School]] and was a First Scholar at [[Winchester College]], later winning a Major Scholarship to study History at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1943. He was called up that year and served, initially as a private in the [[Royal Artillery]] before joining the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] in India and Malaya. He was also awarded a fellowship to [[All Souls College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB |author=Daniel Isaacson |title=In Memoriam: Michael Dummett (1925–2011) |url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/news__events/older_news/in_memoriam_michael_dummett_1925-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
In 1979, Dummett became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at Oxford, a post he held until retiring in 1992. During his term as Wykeham Professor, he held a Fellowship at [[New College, Oxford]]. He has also held teaching posts at [[Birmingham University]], [[UC Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Harvard University]]. He won the [[Schock Prize|Rolf Schock]] prize in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.su.se/english/research/2.26526 philosophy.su.se]&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[knight]]ed in 1999. He was the 2010 winner of the Lauener Prize for an Outstanding Oeuvre in Analytical Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lauener-foundation.ch/award.php Lauener Prize for an Outstanding Oeuvre in Analytical Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career at Oxford, he supervised many philosophers who have gone on to distinguished careers, including [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]], [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|Adrian Moore]], [[Ian Rumfitt]], and [[Crispin Wright]].

==Philosophical work&lt;!--'Semantic realism (epistemology)', 'Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)' and 'Semantic antirealism (epistemology)' redirect here--&gt;==
His work on the German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] has been acclaimed. His first book ''[[Frege: Philosophy of Language]]'' (1973), written over many years, is now regarded as a classic.  The book was instrumental in the rediscovery of Frege's work, and influenced a generation of British philosophers.

In his 1963 paper "Realism"&lt;ref&gt;Originally a lecture to the Philosophical Society at Oxford in 1963, the paper was first published in 1978 in his book ''Truth and Other Enigmas''. See ''Truth and Other Enigmas'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; he popularised a controversial approach to understanding the historical dispute between [[philosophical realism|realist]] and other non-realist philosophy such as [[idealism]], [[nominalism]], [[Irrealism (philosophy)|Irrealism]]. He characterized all of the latter as [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] and argued that the fundamental disagreement between realist and anti-realist was over the nature of truth. For Dummett, realism is best understood as '''semantic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, i. e., as the view accepting that every declarative sentence of one's language is [[bivalence|bivalent]] (determinately true or false) and [[evidence-transcendent]] (independent of our means of coming to know which),&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/ Logicism and Neologicism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; while anti-realism rejects this view in favour of a concept of knowable (or assertible) truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/#ReaTru Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as [[natural numbers]]), moral categories, the material world, or even thought.  The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as, at base, analogous to the dispute between [[Intuitionism (philosophy of mathematics)|intuitionism]] and [[Platonism]] in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

Franzane Abella commented that Dummett was really interested not in understanding problems via classical logic but via intutionistic logic, and Abella stated that "such mathematical entities are more likely to be an ontological myth for Dummett... because truth cannot be unidentified via intuition, and of course it will fall on the notion of '''logical opaqueness''', which statements are not likely to be understood easily in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=Dummettian Truth |url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/epistclass/dummett.pdf |journal= |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franzane Abella further added that "Dummett has an astounding influence when he brought forward the '''deep-order justificationist semantics'''; this influenced the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]] and the classification of understanding via practices, whether the statement can be refuted or not based on its meaning." Abella summed up by saying that Dummett refuted the theory brought forward by realism about the cognisance of meaning. For example the psychological change in our conceptions of meaning of any statements should be properly grasped, because if not, there exists an alteration and confusion of meaning, and of course a failure in grasping truth-values.

Dummett espoused '''semantic anti-realism''',&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; a position suggesting that truth cannot serve as the central notion in the theory of meaning and must be replaced by [[Verificationism|verifiability]].&lt;ref&gt;Panu Raatikainen, [http://newprairiepress.org/biyclc/vol5/iss1/10/ "The Semantic Realism/Anti-Realism Dispute and Knowledge of Meanings"], ''The Baltic International Yearbook of Cognition, Logic and Communication'' '''5'''(1): 1–13. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic anti-realism is sometimes related to [[semantic inferentialism]].&lt;ref&gt; R. Ramanujam and Sundar Sarukkai (eds), ''Logic and Its Applications'', Springer, 2009, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Dummett was politically active, through his work as a campaigner against racism. He let his philosophical career stall in order to influence civil rights for minorities during what he saw as a crucial period of reform in the late 1960s. He also has worked on the theory of voting, which led to his introduction of the [[Quota Borda system]].

Dummett drew heavily on his work in this area in writing his book ''On Immigration and Refugees'', an account of what justice demands of states in relationship to movement between states.  Dummett in that book argues that the vast majority of opposition to immigration has been founded in racism and says that this has especially been so in the UK.

He has written of his shock on finding anti-Semitic and fascist opinions in the diaries of [[Frege]], to whose work he had devoted such a high proportion of his professional career.&lt;ref&gt;Dummett, Michael, "Preface to the first edition" in ''Frege: Philosophy of Language, Second Edition'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 1981), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections and voting==
{{see also|Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem|Robin Farquharson}}
Dummett and [[Robin Farquharson]] published influential articles on the theory of voting, in particular conjecturing that deterministic voting rules with more than three issues faced endemic [[strategic voting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00355-005-0014-x |title=The work and life of [[Robin Farquharson]] &lt;!-- |authorlink=Michael Dummett --&gt; 
|first=Michael |last=Dummett |journal=Social Choice and Welfare |year=2005 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=475–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dummett–Farquharson conjecture]] was proved by [[Allan Gibbard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Allan |last=Gibbard |title=Manipulation of Voting Schemes: A General Result |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |year=1973 |pages=587–601 |jstor=1914083 |doi=10.2307/1914083}}&lt;/ref&gt; a philosopher and former student of [[Kenneth J. Arrow]] and [[John Rawls]], and by the economist Mark A. Satterthwaite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Satterthwaite |title=Strategy-proofness and Arrow's Conditions: Existence and Correspondence Theorems for Voting Procedures and Social Welfare Functions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=10 |year=1975 |issue=2 |pages=187–217 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(75)90050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of the Farquarson–Dummett conjecture by Gibbard and Sattherthwaite, Dummett contributed three proofs of the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]] in his monograph on voting. He also wrote a shorter overview of the theory of voting for the educated public.

==Card games and tarot==
Dummett was also an established scholar in the field of [[card games]] history, with numerous books and articles to his credit. He is a founding member of the [[International Playing-Card Society]], in whose journal ''[[The Playing-Card]]'' he regularly published opinions, research and reviews of current literature on the subject; he is also a founding member of the [[Accademia del Tarocchino Bolognese]] in [[Bologna]]. His historical work on the use of the tarot pack in [[card games]] — he has said "(t)he fortune telling and occult part of it has never been my principal interest..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rudolf Farra and Maurice Salles |title=An Interview with Michael Dummett: From analytical philosophy to voting analysis and beyond |journal=Social Choice and Welfare |volume=27 |issue=2 |date=October 2006 |doi=10.1007/s00355-006-0128-9 |pages=347–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; — ''The Game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City'', attempted to establish that the invention of Tarot could be set in 15th-century [[Italy]]. He laid the foundation for most of the subsequent research on the game of [[Tarot card games|tarot]], including exhaustive accounts of the rules of all hitherto known forms of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

His analysis of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown prior to the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play an extremely popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that the middle of the 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists, along with a growth in Tarot's popularity. "The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only was it, in these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had ever been before or than it has ever been since...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |year=2004 |title=A History of Games Played With the Tarot Pack: The Game of Triumphs, Vol. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Dummett collaborated with [[Giordano Berti]] and Andrea Vitali to the project of the great Tarot exhibition at Castello Estense in Ferrara; in that occasion he wrote some texts for the catalog of the exhibition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |year=1987 |title="Sulle origini dei Tarocchi popolari" and "Tarocchi popolari e Tarocchi fantastici", in Le carte di Corte. I Tarocchi. Gioco e magia alla Corte degli Estensi, ''Nuova Alfa editoriale, Bologna 1987, pp.78–88''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Roman Catholicism==
In 1944, he was received into the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and remained a practising Catholic. Throughout his career, Dummett published a number of articles on various issues facing the contemporary Catholic Church, mainly in the English [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] journal, ''New Blackfriars''. Dummett published an essay in the bulletin of the Adoremus Society on the subject of liturgy, and a philosophical essay defending the intelligibility of the Catholic Church's teaching on the [[eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Intelligibility of Eucharistic Doctrine" in William J. Abraham and Steven W. Holzer, eds., ''The Rationality of Religious Belief: Essays in Honour of Basil Mitchell'', Clarendon Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1987, one of his contributions to ''New Blackfriars'' sparked considerable controversy, when he seemingly attacked currents of Catholic theology which appeared to him to diverge from orthodox Catholicism and to "imply that, from the very earliest times, the Catholic Church, claiming to have a mission from God to safeguard divinely revealed truth, has taught and insisted on the acceptance of falsehoods." Dummett argued that "the divergence which now obtains between what the Catholic Church purports to believe and what large or important sections of it in fact believe ought, in my view, to be tolerated no longer: not if there is to be a rationale for belonging to that Church; not if there is to be any hope of reunion with the other half of Christendom; not if the Catholic Church is not to be a laughing-stock in the eyes of the world." A debate in the journal over these remarks continued for months, attracting contributions from the theologian [[Nicholas Lash]] and the historian [[Eamon Duffy]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1741-2005/issues 1987 ''New Blackfriars'' '''68'''(809, 811)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and family==

==Early life==
Marcus was born in New York in 1954.&lt;ref name="chadwick1"/&gt; He developed [[Dystonia|generalised dystonia]] when he was eight years old.&lt;ref name="berkeleydailyplanet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2011-11-23/article/38905?headline=Neil-Marcus-Fantastic-Spastic--By-Dorothy-Snodgrass |title=Neil Marcus: Fantastic Spastic. Category: Arts &amp; Events from |publisher=The Berkeley Daily Planet |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Carrie Sandhal's entry in the ''Encyclopedia of American Disability History'', "Marcus was born on January 3, 1954, in White Plains, New York, but spent his childhood in Ojai, California. He is the youngest of five children born to a secular Jewish family. Marcus's family life was full of art; his mother was a musician and his father a filmmaker. His family regularly hosted visiting artists. Marcus was an active child who loved the outdoors and physical activity, qualities that would continue even after the age of eight, when his dystonia manifested itself. His onset of dystonia was painful and disorienting, as diagnosis was elusive and a cure impossible. Marcus struggled with depression throughout his adolescence and began writing in his journal, chronicling his frustrations and joys as a disabled person. He credits his experiences in co-counseling, which he began at age 14, with pulling him out of his depression and spawning his performance aesthetic. Co-counseling involves peer-to-peer, confidential counseling that helps the participants discover themselves and deal with their emotions. Marcus has discussed his relationship with audiences as a form of co-counseling in which he and they share experiences on a journey of discovering self and other." &lt;ref&gt;Sandahl, Carrie. "Marcus, Neil (1954-) Artist and Performer." Encyclopedia of American Disability History. Ed. Susan Burch. New York: Facts on File, 2009. 592-593. Facts on File Library of American History. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 14 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His early career began when Marcus left for college in Washington State, he began to write. Later moving to Berkeley to continue his studies, he became active in the Disability Rights Movement.&lt;ref name=humanbeing&gt;Human Being. Vol. 1. Chicago: The City of Chicago Cultural Affairs, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

He started a street zine in the early 80's, Special Effects, as a form to express what he experienced and learned through his participation in the disabled and independent living movement. Special Effects was distributed in a street zine fashion, as well as by mailing list.&lt;ref name=humanbeing /&gt;

Marcus curated interventions with a cut, copy and paste methodology which encompassed the art, culture, and humor into the political discourse of disability.

''[[Storm Reading]]'', his play in collaboration with Rod Lathim, Roger Marcus and [[Access Theater]], has been shown on television and performed at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]], as well as being featured on [[NPR]] and NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today Show.'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus|first=Neil|title=Storm Reading|url=http://www.newsun.com/StormRead.html|work=Play|publisher=The New Sun|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm Reading challenged audiences to reevaluate conventional ideas about disability and set a standard for performing artists with disabilities, and for performance access technologies.&lt;ref name=bodiesincommotion&gt;"Bodies in Commotion: Disability and Performance." In The University of Michigan press, edited by Carrie Sandahl and Philip Auslander, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Voted ''Best Ensemble and Leading Actor'' in 1992 by DramaLogue Magazine and ''Critic's Choice'' 1992, ''Storm Reading'' had a nearly decade-long run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disabilityhistory.org/people_marcus.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yergeau, Melanie, Elizabeth Brewer, Brenda Jo Brueggemann, and Nicholas Hetrick. "Biographies of Key Contributors in the Field." Arts and Humanities. Ed. Gary L. Albrecht. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2012. 123-75. SAGE knowledge. Web. Disability Key Issues and Future Directions. 14 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus received the 1994 Isadora Duncan Dance Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound/Score/Text for his work, ''Art of Human Being'' &lt;ref&gt;http://izzies.org/award-history/music-sound-text/&lt;/ref&gt;

Brenda Jo Brueggemann shares in an anthology about disability and performance, how she introduces to students to her class: " I show a recorded performance of Storm Reading, especially the opening clip. I have used it to open courses on representations of disability in language, language in literature and culture.  I use it first because Marcus begins with the central issue for disabled people: Their position in relation to being 'human.'"&lt;ref name=bodiesincommotion /&gt;

Marcus has since participated in a range of diverse projects. Since 2008, he has been collaborating with [[Petra Kuppers]] in [[The Olimpias Disability Culture Research Projects]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olimpias|title=The Olimpias Disability Culture Research Projects|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~petra/|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2010, Marcus has also worked on a number of projects with Stephen Lichty, a New York based sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sculpture Center|title=Stephen Lichty and Neil Marcus, Study for Special Effects|url=http://sculpture-center.tumblr.com/post/20467067585/stephen-lichty-and-neil-marcus-study-for-special|publisher=Sculpture Center|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus's poem ''Disabled Country'' introduces the Smithsonian's permanent web exhibition [http://everybody.si.edu/place EveryBody: An Artifact History of Disability in America].

In 2011, Marcus choreographed a videodance with Richard Chen See, a Paul Taylor dancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/26218519&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 video with sculptor Shane Brodie, Marcus embodies the "abstract" in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUT_g8OMR2I abstract art].

The '''Nooitgedacht Glacial Pavements''' comprise a geological feature between [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and [[Barkly West]], [[South Africa]], pertaining to the Palaeozoic-age [[Dwyka Group|Dwyka]] Ice Age, or [[Karoo Ice Age]], (some 300 million years ago) where the glacially scoured (smoothed and striated) ancient bedrock (re-exposed by erosion) was used, substantially more recently, during the [[Later Stone Age]] period in the late [[Holocene]] as panels for [[petroglyphs|rock engravings]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, T. &amp; Rubidge, B. 2005. The story of earth and life: a Southern African perspective on a 4.6-billion-year journey. Kumba Resources. p 195-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice Age==

Some 300-290 million years ago, during [[Dwyka Group|Dwyka]] times, what is now [[Southern Africa]] was, as a result of [[plate tectonics]], near the [[South Pole]] and large ice sheets or [[glaciers]] covered high-lying areas. Geologists term this upland the [[Cargonian Highlands]], stretching from what is now the [[Northern Cape]] through [[Gauteng]] to [[Mpumalanga]]. As the Dwyka glaciers moved, grinding their way southwards, the rocks and rubble that became embedded in their belly smoothed the underlying [[Andesite]] rock pavements and scoured out scratch marks, known as [[Glacial striation|striations]]. As the ice shaped the landscape, the continent of [[Gondwanaland]] continued to drift slowly northwards, ultimately bringing this area into warmer latitudes. As the glaciers melted, a mixture of clay and rock was left behind which eventually consolidated into a rock called [[Tillite]] – the lower-most layer in the [[Karoo sequence]]. Quite large erratics or drop stones carried here by glacial action are found at Nooitgedacht. The changing local environment also created conditions conducive for the burgeoning of life, reflected in the rich fossil record of the Karoo.

==River of diamonds==

Along this portion of its course, the adjacent [[Vaal River]], and earlier generations of rivers and erosion processes, have cut through and swept away a vast mass of Karoo rock and sediment, to re-expose the volcanic Andesite landscape formed 2.7 billion years ago and shaped by glacial action 300 million years ago. At one time – when the diamondiferous pipes penetrated to the surface between 120 and 90 million years ago – it is estimated that about 1&amp;nbsp;km of Karoo sediment overlay the Kimberley-Barkly West area. Diamonds were eroded out of these pipes and caught in pockets of sediment and gravels which, once discovered, changed the course of modern South African history.

Since 1869, the various gravels along the Vaal River have been worked intensively for their content of high-grade alluvial diamonds. The Nooitgedacht diggings were opened in 1949 and closed in 1981. During these 32 years, a total of 80 000 diamonds were found here. The [[Venter Diamond]], a {{convert|511|carat|g|adj=on}} yellow stone, was the largest. 

The standard size of a digger's claim was 15 x 15 metres. The diamond-bearing gravels, covered by a layer of sterile red sand, were washed by hand in simple rotary pans. The left-over concentrate of heavy material was then carefully sorted for diamonds. 

The search for diamonds continues along the Vaal River in the Windsorton, Barkly West and Delportshoop areas and further downstream. 

Diggings on Nooitgedacht itself were opened again in the late 1990s.

Some small-scale diggers in the region still use pick and shovel to eke out a meagre return, but miners using heavy earth-moving equipment obtain far better results. The impacts of this on the environment and on heritage resources are not small.

==Rock Art==

The images found on the andesite glacial pavements at Nooitgedacht are a form of rock art called rock engravings (the term [[petroglyph]] is also sometimes used). They were produced by pecking out the outlines or silhouettes of animals, or ‘geometric’ designs, with a pointed stone (there is no evidence that the artists used metal tools, nor indeed diamonds). They were made by ancestors of San and Khoe people, probably during the past 1500 years. The engravings include depictions of humans, eland, rhinoceros, ostrich, giraffe and anteater. The more abstract forms may depict bags and aprons, as well as ‘geometric’ images such as are common at other sites in the region, particularly [[Driekops Eiland]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

What these different images mean is subject to debate. One argument suggests that whereas sites such as the nearby Wildebeest Kuil, with its profusion of engravings of animals and some human figures, is  quintessentially San/hunter-gatherer in character, sites such as Nooitgedacht and [[Driekops Eiland]], where geometric engravings occur in great numbers, may belong to a different tradition of rock art, a separate Khoekhoe herder rock art tradition. A different perspective does not discount this possibility, but questions whether assigning variability in terms of ethnic or cultural differences in the first instance does not overlook other possible factors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} 

Research at Driekops Eiland suggests that sites such as this, and the ‘geometric’ engravings, bags and aprons present, may have been produced as part of girls’ coming-of-age rites, potentially across the spectrum of both San and Khoekhoe contexts, given the similarities in beliefs and ritual practices.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Diamond Fields Land Dispute==
[[File:Nicolaas Waterboer - Griqua leader and politician of the Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|[[Griqua people|Griqua]] leader and Captain, Nicolaas Waterboer]]
Various claims and counter claims to ownership of this territory were made following the discovery of diamonds in 1869-70. Nooitgedacht featured early on, when the Presidents of the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] Republics met here with the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] Chief [[Nicolaas Waterboer]] and his agent [[David Arnot (Griqua lawyer and diplomat)|David Arnot]], on 18 August 1870. [[File:David Arnot - Griqua agent and diplomat in the Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|David Arnot, [[Griqua people|Griqua]] lawyer and diplomat]]The Griqua representatives walked out in a huff and the Free State proclaimed the territory theirs. But this was not the end of the story, the dispute being settled eventually by the Keate Award (in favour of Waterboer, who placed himself under British protection), and the proclamation of the Crown Colony of [[Griqualand West]] on 27 October 1871.

==Preservation as Heritage Site==
The site was declared a National Monument in 1936 and under South Africa's Act 25 of 1999 is now a Grade 2 Provincial Heritage Site.

[[File:Gallipolifrenchossuary.jpg|thumb|Ossuary at the [[Gallipoli]] [[World War I]] battlefield, containing the remains of 3000 unidentified French soldiers.]]&lt;!--This picture is notable as other pics do not address the use of ossuaries as wartime mass graves --&gt;

An '''ossuary''' is a chest, box, building, well, or site made to serve as the final resting place of human [[skeleton|skeletal]] remains. They are frequently used where burial space is scarce. A body is first buried in a temporary grave, then after some years the skeletal remains are removed and placed in an ossuary. The greatly reduced space taken up by an ossuary means that it is possible to store the remains of many more people in a single tomb than if the original coffins were left as is.

== Persian ==
In [[Persia]], the [[Zoroastrians]] used a deep well for this function from the earliest times (c. 3,000 years ago) and called it ''[[Tower of Silence|astudan]]'' (literally, "the place for the bones"). There are many rituals and regulations in the Zoroastrian faith concerning the ''astudans''.

== Roman Catholic ==

[[Image:Sedlec Ossuary chandelier.JPG|thumb|right|A chandelier of [[Sedlec Ossuary]], [[Czech Republic]], made of skulls and bones.]]
Many examples of ossuaries are found within Europe, including the [[Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]; in south Italy the [[Martyrs of Otranto]]; the [[Fontanelle cemetery]] and [[Purgatorio ad Arco, Naples]] and many others; the [[San Bernardino alle Ossa]] in [[Milan]], Italy; the [[Brno Ossuary]] and the [[Sedlec Ossuary]] in the [[Czech Republic]]; the [[Skull Chapel in Czermna|Czermna Skull Chapel]] in [[Poland]]; and [[Capela dos Ossos]] ("Chapel of Bones") in [[Évora]], [[Portugal]]. The village of [[Wamba, Valladolid|Wamba]] in the province of [[Valladolid]], [[Spain]], has an impressive ossuary of over a thousand skulls inside the local church, dating from between the 12th and 18th centuries. A more recent example is the [[Douaumont ossuary]] in [[France]], which contains the remains of more than 130,000 French and German soldiers that fell at the [[Battle of Verdun]] during [[World War I]]. The [[Catacombs of Paris]] represents another famous ossuary.

The [[catacombs]] beneath the [[Monastery of San Francisco, Lima|Monastery of San Francisco]] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], also contains an ossuary.

==Eastern Orthodox==
[[Image:GreekOssuaries.JPG|thumb|left|190px|Contemporary [[Greece|Greek]] ossuaries made of wood and metal.]]

The use of ossuaries is a longstanding tradition in the [[Orthodox Church]]. The remains of an Orthodox Christian are treated with special reverence, in conformity with the biblical teaching that the body of a believer is a "temple of the Holy Spirit",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:19|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been [[sanctification|sanctified]] and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfigured]] by [[Baptism]], [[Holy Communion]] and the participation in the [[Sacred Mysteries|mystical life]] of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

If there is reason to believe that the departed is a [[saint]], the remains may be placed in a [[reliquary]]; otherwise the bones are usually mingled together (skulls together in one place, [[long bone]]s in another, etc.). The remains of an [[abbot]] may be placed in a separate ossuary made out of wood or metal.

The use of ossuaries is also found among the [[laity]] in the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. The departed will be buried for one to three years and then, often on the anniversary of death, the family will gather with the [[parish priest]] and celebrate a ''[[parastas]]'' (memorial service), after which the remains are disinterred, washed with wine, perfumed, and placed in a small ossuary of wood or metal, inscribed with the name of the departed, and placed in a room, often in or near the church, which is dedicated to this purpose.

==Jewish==

[[Image:Ossuary inscription shalam zion.gif|thumb|Jewish ossuary inscription from [[Second Temple]] period.]]

During the time of the [[Second Temple]], [[Jews|Jewish]] burial customs included primary burials in burial caves, followed by [[secondary burial]]s in ossuaries placed in smaller niches of the burial caves. Some of the limestone ossuaries that have been discovered, particularly around the [[Jerusalem]] area, include intricate geometrical patterns and inscriptions identifying the deceased. Among the best-known Jewish ossuaries of this period are: an ossuary inscribed 'Simon the Temple builder' in the collection of the [[Israel Museum]], another inscribed 'Elisheba wife of [[Tarfon]]', one inscribed 'Yehohanan ben Hagkol' that contained an iron nail in a heel bone suggesting [[crucifixion]], another inscribed '[[James ossuary|James]] son of Joseph, brother of Jesus', the authenticity of which is opposed by some and strongly supported by others, and ten ossuaries recovered from the [[Talpiot Tomb]] in 1980, several of which are reported to have names from the [[New Testament]].

During the Second Temple period, Jewish sages debated whether the occasion of the gathering of a parent's bones for a secondary burial was a day of sorrow or rejoicing; it was resolved that it was a day of fasting in the morning and feasting in the afternoon. The custom of secondary burial in ossuaries did not persist among Jews past the Second Temple period nor appear to exist among Jews outside the land of [[Israel]].

== Largest ossuary ==
The skeletal remains of six million people lie, neatly arranged, in subterranean catacombs (also known as ossuaries or charnal houses) beneath the streets of Paris, France. The city is riddled with an estimated 300&amp;nbsp;km (186 miles) of tunnels and pathways, of which 11,000 square meters (nearly three acres) are packed tightly with the bones of those re-interred from the city's overflowing cemeteries in the late 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2011|last=|first=|publisher=Guinness World Records|year=2010|isbn=978 1 904994 57 2|location=|pages=125|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Catacombs of Paris]].

[[File:Parachico.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Parachico|Parachico dancers]]
The '''''Parachico''''' or '''''Parachicos''''' are traditional dancers from [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]], [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], who dance on the streets of the town during the Great Feast festivity, which takes place from January 15 to 23 every year. The festivity takes place in honor of the local patron saints [[Black Christ of Esquipulas]], [[Saint Anthony Abbot]] and [[Saint Sebastian]]. It is claimed locally, as many of the Catholic festivals are in Latin America, to have its roots in the much older indigenous culture. So it has developed into a hybrid of old indigenous culture and newer Catholic and Spanish cultures. The church where the festival concludes is home to an old tree, which is said to represent the "tree of life" (drawing on Maya and other pre-Hispanic American cultures), which is claimed locally to predate the church, which would suggest that this site was used for ceremonies before the arrival of Catholicism. Honoring the mother of the cured boy (for the feast) is also locally explained, why on certain nights during  the festival, the town's men dress as women and parade through the streets.

The festivities, which include [[Roman Catholic]] religious ceremonies, music, dancing and local cuisine, have been included in [[UNESCO]]'s [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]] on November 16, 2010, listed as "Parachicos in the traditional January feast of Chiapa de Corzo".&lt;ref name=parachico_UNESCO&gt;{{cite web| title=Parachicos in the traditional January feast of Chiapa de Corzo|url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00399 |publisher=UNESCO Culture Sector |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Chiapadecorzo flickr02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Parachicos on the streets|Parachicos dancing on the streets of [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]]]]It has pre hispanic origins, however, the traditional dates back to the seventeenth century with the arrival of the image of San Sebastian Martyr to the then Royal Villa Chiapa or Chiapa of the indians and the building of the temple, completed in the seventeenth century. There are many versions of the history of parachico but all agree to the myth that one day a beautiful woman seeking a cure for her sick son but after visiting doctor and healers, failed to alleviate it. Someone told her to go Chiapas where surely  find the cure, then she moved with all its servants.

She wanted to consult a famous indian healer and went to visit him: "Make way going to spend my lady Maria de Angulo" shouted the servants. The healer recommended to the spanish rich take her sick child to the healing waters of cumbujuyú and bathe him for nine days. This done, the child was healed and in gratitude Maria de Angulo gave food and groceries, while the costumed servants danced to entertain children. 
Others attribute from the name "para chico", translated to for (the) boy.

==Attire==
Parachicos wear wooden masks with [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] features, such as light skin, facial hair and blue eyes, in contrast to Native people's features. They also wear a round headdress, colorful ribbons, striped [[serapes]], embroidered shawls, usually over black or dark shirt and trousers.
Parachicos use metallic [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] locally known as ''chinchin'' or  ''chinchines'', with colorful ribbons attached to the top and/or handles, which are shaken as they dance and chant.

== Declaration as Intangible Cultural Heritage ==
[[File:ParachicosPlaque.jpg|thumb|[[:es:Unesco|UNESCO]] declared plate as intangible cultural heritage]]
On November 16, 2010, the act of parachicos was declared Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO. The decision was adopted at the meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, held in Nairobi, Kenya, under the name "Parachicos in the traditional January feast of Chiapa de Corzo

'''''The Piano Lesson''''' depicts the living room of [[Henri Matisse]]{{'}}s home in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], with his elder son, [[Pierre Matisse|Pierre]], at the piano, the artist's sculpture ''Decorative Figure'' (1908), at bottom left, and, at upper right, his painting ''[[Woman on a High Stool]]''. Matisse began with a naturalistic drawing, but he eliminated detail as he worked, scraping down areas and rebuilding them broad fields of color. The painting evokes a specific moment in time—light suddenly turned on in a darkening interior—by the triangle of shadow on the boy's face and the rhyming green triangle of light falling on the garden. The artist's incising on the window frame and stippling on the left side produce a pitted quality that suggests the eroding effects of light or time, a theme reiterated by the presence of the metronome and burning candle on the piano.&lt;ref&gt;"MoMA | The Collection | Henri Matisse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6586">A '''pickup group''' is a group of professional [[musician]]s, which may be [[session musician]]s who are hired to play for a limited time period—ranging from a single concert or [[sound recording]] session to several weeks of shows—before disbanding.  Pickup groups are formed to play in [[pit orchestra]]s for [[musical theatre]] performances, [[opera]]s, or [[operetta]]s, [[accompaniment|accompany]] jazz singers or instrumental soloists, and act as a temporary [[backup band]] for a pop singer for a tour. As well, pickup groups are hired to perform at social events such as weddings or holiday parties. The size of these ensembles ranges from a three- or four-member rock ensemble or jazz group (e.g., a [[rhythm section]], [[organ trio]] or [[backing band]]) or classical chamber ensemble (e.g., a [[string quartet]]) to a 20-piece jazz [[big band]], a 20-27 member [[pit orchestra]] for a Broadway musical or a 30-100 member [[orchestra]].

==Terminology==
A pickup group may also be called a "pickup band", "pick-up group", "pickup orchestra", or "jobbing band".

==History==
In the 1960s, recordings of [[New York soul]] singers were not typically backed up by longstanding "house bands" which worked on a permanent basis for the record label, as was the case in many Southern US types of [[soul music]]. Instead, New York soul [[accompaniment]] parts were usually recorded by [[session musician]]s who were hired by a music contractor to play for a single recording.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland, David . ''Ladies of Soul''. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2001. p. 135-136&lt;/ref&gt; Since the musicians playing New York soul were not a regular [[backup band]] that played together all the time, the playing was not as loose and spontaneous as a typical Southern US "house band", in which the members played together all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland, David . ''Ladies of Soul''. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2001. p. 135-136&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, since the NYC session players were experienced musicians, they played with a professional style.

==Considerations==
When a music promoter is organizing a multi-city or multi-country tour for a [[lead singer]] or solo instrumentalist (e.g., a solo guitar player or solo flute player), she needs to hire [[accompaniment]] musicians to play the [[chord (music)|chords]], [[bassline]] and harmony parts which are used to support the lead performer. Similarly, if a touring [[Broadway musical]] group is performing a series of shows in cities across a country or around the world (e.g., several weeks of shows in each location), the organizer needs a [[pit orchestra]] to accompany the singers who are performing.

The promoter needs to make a decision as to whether to hire an existing, longstanding [[music ensemble]], [[backing band]] or [[orchestra]] or hire a "pick-up group" in each city or country. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Using a longstanding ensemble will provide a group which has extensive experience performing as a [[musical ensemble]]. This can help the group to play with a more unified sound and style. If the backing band or backing ensemble required for a show is small (e.g., 3-4 musicians), it may be worth the cost of paying for the travel, hotel and food for a longstanding group. However, if the backing ensemble is large–for example, a 20-piece [[big band]] for a jazz singer or a 27-member [[pit orchestra]] for a travelling musical, the cost of travel, hotels and meals for the backup group may be prohibitive.

Alternatively, in each town or city, the producer or promoter can pay a local music contractor to hire a local musicians to form a "pickup" orchestra or a "jobbing band". If a promoter decides to hire a pickup group in each town or city, this means that the promoter does not have to pay for the travel, hotels and meals for these musicians, since they live in the town or city where the show is taking place. There are some disadvantages; using a pickup group requires contractors to pay for a series of rehearsals for the new musicians in each town, so that they can learn the songs/pieces. As well, since the pickup group will not have experience playing together and since they may not have experience performing the songs/pieces in the show, a pickup group may not play with the same "tight" ensemble as a longstanding group which backs up a soloist or musical theatre/opera company on a permanent basis.

==As occupation==
Although the work provided by these ensembles is intermittent and of short duration, these ensembles are an important source of income for freelance musicians and session musicians. Since playing in "jobbing bands" and "pickup groups" only provides a limited amount of work per year, a performer that plays in these types of groups will typically have to have other sources of income, such as teaching music on her instrument. As well, playing in these ensembles give local performers an opportunity to work with well-known national- or international-level touring soloists and conductors.

==Orchestras==
When a [[musical theater]] production, [[operetta]], or [[opera]] is performed in different cities, the production company may hire local musicians in each town for the performance.

==Jazz, rock and pop music groups==
When a [[jazz]] singer or instrumental soloist, pop singer(s) or a [[rock musical]] production that is accompanied by a rock band, pop group or jazz group is on tour, they may hire a band of local musicians (e.g. a [[horn section]] or additional [[rhythm section]] members) in each town that they play in. In some cases, the singer, soloist or production will have a core few musicians that travels with them, such as a piano player, who also acts as a [[bandleader]] (or a violin [[concertmaster]] for an orchestra) for the performances. The core group that travels from town to town may include the essential instruments of a [[rhythm section]]: a musician playing a chordal instrument ([[electric guitar]], [[piano]], [[Hammond organ]], etc.), a bassist ([[electric bass]] or [[double bass]]) and a [[drummer]]. Additional rhythm section members (additional chordal instrument, additional percussionists, etc.) can be hired in each new town or city to add to this core group and provide a fuller sound. Some singers may also hire a small pickup [[string orchestra]] in each town that they play in, to perform backing string [[arrangement]]s.

==History==
The application was developed by two former [[GMW Architects|GMW Computers]] employees who had been involved with  Sonata. After Sonata had "disappeared in a mysterious, corporate black hole, somewhere in eastern Canada in 1992,"&lt;ref name=Crotty71&gt;Crotty, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Ingram and colleague Gerard Gartside then went on to develop Reflex, bought for $30 million by Parametric Technology Corporation ([[PTC (software company)|PTC]]) in July 1996.&lt;ref name=Crotty71 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Parametric+Technology+Corporation+acquires+object-oriented+software...-a018490068 Parametric Technology Corporation acquires object-oriented software technology for project modeling and management] PTC news release dated 11 July 1996 (archived at FreeLibrary.com). Retrieved: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

PTC had identified the architecture, engineering and construction market as a target for its parametric modelling solutions, and bought Reflex to expand into the sector. However, the fit between Reflex and PTC's existing solutions was poor, and PTC's Pro/Reflex gained little market traction; PTC then sold the product to another US company, [[The Beck Group|Beck Construction]], in 1997,&lt;ref name=Crotty72&gt;Crotty, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Some accounts of the date of this transaction vary: Beck Technology, originally an internal group within Beck Construction, says it acquired the intellectual property rights to Reflex from PTC in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beck-technology.com/about_us.html Beck Technology: About us], Beck Technology. Accessed: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}} where it formed the kernel of a parametric estimating package called DESTINI.&lt;ref name=Weisberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilitytechzone.com/news/2006/12/19/2179097.htm BIM software integrates RSMeans for project costing], ''Mobility Techzone'', December 19, 2006. Retrieved: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, several people from PTC set up a new company, Charles River Software (renamed [[Autodesk Revit|Revit]] Technology Corporation in 2000, later (2002) bought by [[Autodesk]]).&lt;ref name=Crotty72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weisberg&gt;Weisberg, David (2008), ''The Engineering Design Revolution: The People, Companies and Computer Systems That Changed Forever the Practice of Engineering''. Chapter 16. Available [http://cadhistory.net/ online]. Retrieved: 17 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonid Raiz]] and [[Irwin Jungreis]] obtained from PTC a non-exclusive, source code development license for Reflex as part of their severance package. In the words of Jerry Laiserin: "While Autodesk Revit may not contain genomic snippets of Reflex code, Revit clearly is spiritual heir to a lineage of BIM 'begats' — RUCAPS begat Sonata, Sonata begat Reflex, and Reflex begat Revit."&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php LaiserinLetterLetters]" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 06 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 letter to ''AEC Magazine,'' Jungreis said:
:"After receiving several hours of instruction in the software architecture of Reflex from Reflex developers, we decided not to use it as our starting point because of several important differences at the very foundations of the software. At that point, we put it aside and never looked at it again. ... Revit was not based on Reflex. No code from Reflex was used...."&lt;ref name="AECM-25May2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating the history of BIM (In response to this article, Dr. Irwin Jungreis, one of the founders of Revit, submitted a letter to AEC Magazine, reproduced in full.)|url=http://aecmag.com/59-features/1352-celebrating-the-history-of-bim|accessdate=21 August 2017|work=AEC Magazine|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established formally in 1889, with performances dating back to 1883, the society is the oldest continual theatre company in Australia, and one of the oldest student theatre groups in the world.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dear Descendants|author=Gunn, J.|publisher=john gunn|isbn=9780977580149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZ3w67iiIF8C|page=66|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-21/sydney-university-dramatic-society-celebrates-125th-anniversary/6485036&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by the [[University of Sydney Union]], SUDS performs over 16 productions a year,&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/current_students/life/cultural_life.shtml|title=Cultural life - Current students - The University of Sydney|publisher=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are directed, designed and performed by its members. As well as traditional theatre, SUDS has been involved in the production and staging of student written productions, experimental plays, improvised theatre, and various [[University of Sydney Revues|comedy revues]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gXVWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yeQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7224%2C4493738|title=The Sydney Morning Herald - Google News Archive Search|publisher=news.google.com|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SUDS currently operates out of the society's own production space, the Cellar Theatre, underneath the Holme Building on the Camperdown Campus of the [[University of Sydney]]. Before this plays were regularly housed in [[St James' Hall, Sydney|St James' Hall]] and the Society's own performance space on George Street,&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; with smaller productions housed in the University's Footbridge and Wallace Theatres.

During the society's heyday SUDS was considered one of the leading production companies in Australia, attracting a range of theatrical talent and audiences beyond its student base.&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51398407|title=16 Mar 1960 - Big hand for 'Open House'|publisher=trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity peaked in the postwar years of the 1950s-60s during which time a large number of prominent actors and personalities passed through its ranks. SUDS is considered to have played a leading role in the establishment of Australian theatre, alongside breakaway group The Sydney Players, during this time.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usyd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/HUL/article/view/5346|title=The Ripples Before the (New) Wave: SUDS, Players and the College Dramatic Societies at the University of Sydney, 1957-61 &amp;#124; Ginters &amp;#124; History of University Life|publisher=ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imodules"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secureau.imodules.com/s/965/images/editor_documents/alumni-magazine/10-march/SAM_cover-story_Mar10.pdf|date=20 April 2010|title=All the world's a stage|author=Elissa Blake|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alumni==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
SUDS has nurtured a number of notable alumni who have gone on to excel in the arts, most notably [[John Bell (Australian actor)|John Bell]]  [[Order of Australia|AO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], who went on to found the [[Bell Shakespeare Company]] following his time at the University of Sydney.&lt;ref name="imodules"/&gt; Other notable members have included Gough Whitlam, a future Prime Minister of Australia, who met his wife Margaret through SUDS,&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gough Whitlam|author=Hocking, J.|date=2008|volume=1|publisher=Miegunyah Press|isbn=9780522855111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PR3CEn4168C|page=76|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personalities Germaine Greer and Clive James both of whom went on to manage the [[Cambridge Footlights]] during its golden era.

'''''The Crystal Bucket''''' is the second selection of [[Clive James]]'s television criticism for ''[[The Observer]]'', for which the [[British Press Awards]] named him 'Critic of the Year' in 1981: "His contribution to the art and enjoyment of TV criticism over the past ten years has been immense. His work is deeply perceptive, often outrageously funny and always compulsively readable."

First published the same year, the volume covers 1976–79; its title is taken from [[Walter Raleigh]]'s ''The Passionate Man's Pilgrimage''.  It is dedicated to the poet [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]]. The compilation ends not with a review but with a tribute to James's friend [[Joyce Grenfell]] who had died at the end of November 1979:  "Joyce Grenfell's death gave pause for thought to all who knew her. Her faith was profound. So was her humour, which was so devoid of malice that some people called her sentimental. She wasn't. She was just greatly good."

Writing in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', [[Gavin Ewart]] expressed the view that James, "didn't get where he is today just by being funny. He is humane, liberal and compassionate.... What he writes is always pertinent and always witty. We owe him a deep debt of gratitude."

'''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion''''' (retitled '''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion''''' in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of [[mythology]] and [[religion]], written by the Scottish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[James George Frazer]]. ''The Golden Bough'' was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–15. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology|The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes]]'' (1855). The influence of ''The Golden Bough'' on contemporary [[European literature]] and thought was substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Karbiener, K. &amp; Stade, G., |title=Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present|volume =2|publisher= Infobase Publishing|date= 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&amp;pg=PA189#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages= 188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of the Golden Bough incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
[[File:Mirror Judgement of Paris Louvre Bj1734.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Judgement of Paris|The Judgement of Paris]]''—an Etruscan bronze-handled mirror of the fourth or third century BC that relates the often misunderstood myth as interpreted by Frazer, showing the three goddesses giving their apple or [[pomegranate]] to the new king, who must kill the old king - Campana Collection, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Sully]]

Frazer attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief and scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, [[human sacrifice]], the [[dying god]], the [[scapegoat]], and many other symbols and practices whose influences had extended into 20th-century culture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamel, Frazer (Editor)|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] is that old religions were [[fertility cult]]s that revolved around the [[worship]] and periodic [[sacrifice]] of a [[sacred king]]. Frazer proposed that mankind progresses from [[Magic and religion|magic]] through [[religious belief]] to scientific thought.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Frazer's thesis was developed in relation to [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of ''The Golden Bough'', a sacred grove where a certain tree grew day and night. It was a transfigured landscape in a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of [[Nemi]], "[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s Mirror", where religious ceremonies and the "fulfillment of vows" of priests and kings were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frazer, Sir James|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was the incarnation of a [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]], a [[solar deity]] who underwent a mystic marriage to a [[goddess]] of the Earth. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend of rebirth is central to almost all of the world's mythologies.

Frazer based his thesis on the pre-Roman priest-king at the [[wiktionary:fane|fane]] of [[Rex Nemorensis|Nemi]], who was ritually murdered by his successor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I first put pen to paper to write ''The Golden Bough'' I had no conception of the magnitude of the voyage on which I was embarking; I thought only to explain a single rule of an ancient Italian priesthood. (''Aftermath'', p. vi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book's title was taken from an incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', illustrated by Turner, in which [[Aeneas]] and the [[Sibyl]] present the golden bough to the gatekeeper of [[Hades]] to gain admission.

Frazer wrote in a preface to the third edition of ''The Golden Bough'' that while he had never studied [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], his friend James Ward, and the philosopher [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of "the nature and historical relations of magic and religion". Frazer saw the resemblance as being that "we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection." Frazer included an extract from Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frazer, James George |title=The Golden Bough.

==Critical reception==
''The Golden Bough'' scandalized the British public when first published, as it included the Christian story of [[Jesus]] and the [[Resurrection]] in its comparative study. Critics thought this treatment invited an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] reading of the [[Lamb of God]] as a relic of a [[pagan]] religion. For the third edition, Frazer placed his analysis of the [[Crucifixion]] in a speculative appendix; the discussion of [[Christianity]] was excluded from the single-volume abridged edition.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Leach, Edmund R. |url= http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |title= Kingship and divinity: The unpublished Frazer Lecture |location= Oxford |origyear= 28 October 1982 |journal= ''HAU: ''Journal of Ethnographic Theory ''1.1'' |date= 2011 |pages= 279–298 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150922093723/http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |archivedate= 22 September 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Smith, Jonathan Z. |title= When the bough breaks |work= History of Religions ''12.4'' |date=1973 |pages= 342–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer himself accepted that his theories were speculative and that the associations he made were circumstantial and usually based only on resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspects of British Calendar Customs|year=1993|editor-first1=Theresa|editor-last1=Buckland|editor-first2=Juliette|editor-last2=Wood|first=E.C.|last=Cawte|page=38|chapter=It's an Ancient Custom—But How Ancient?|isbn=1850752435|location=Sheffield|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "Books like mine, merely speculation, will be superseded sooner or later (the sooner the better for the sake of truth) by better induction based on fuller knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=R. Angus|last=Downie|title=Frazer and the Golden Bough|location=London|publisher=Victor Gallancz|page=112|isbn=978-0-575-00486-3|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, at the inauguration of the [[Frazer Lecture|Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology]], he said: "It is my earnest wish that the lectureship should be used solely for the disinterested pursuit of truth, and not for the dissemination and propagation of any theories or opinions of mine."&lt;ref name="Lienhardt"&gt;{{Citation|issn=0044-8370|volume=24|issue=1|year=1993|first=Godfrey|last=Lienhardt|title=Frazer's anthropology: science and sensibility|pages=1–12|journal=[[Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey Lienhardt notes that even during Frazer's lifetime, social anthropologists "had for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions", and that the lasting influence of ''The Golden Bough'' and Frazer's wider body of work "has been in the literary rather than the academic world."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Robert Ackerman writes that, for British social anthropologists, Frazer is still "an embarrassment" for being "the most famous of them all" while they now dissociate themselves "from much that he wrote." While ''The Golden Bough'' achieved wide "popular appeal" and exerted a "disproportionate" influence "on so many [20th century] creative writers", Frazer's ideas played "a much smaller part" in the history of academic social anthropology. Lienhardt himself dismissed Frazer's interpretations of primitive religion as "little more than plausible constructs of [Frazer's] own Victorian rationalism", while 
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], in his ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'' (1979), wrote: "Frazer is much more savage than most of his 'savages' [since] his explanations of [their] observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances themselves."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Initially, the book's influence on the emerging discipline of [[anthropology]] was pervasive. For example, the Polish anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] read Frazer's work in the original English, and afterwards wrote: "No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Hays &amp; L.L. Langness (Editor) |title= From Ape to Angel: An Informal History of Social Anthropology |pages= 75, 314 |work= The Study of Culture |location= Corte Madera |publisher= Chandler &amp; Sharp |date= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1920s, Frazer's ideas "began to belong to the past": {{Quote|In 1922, simultaneously with the publication of the first abridged edition of ''The Golden Bough'', came Malinowski's ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' and Radcliffe-Brown's ''The Andaman Islanders'', the first outstanding products of the British field research tradition that Frazer had very actively encouraged. As every first-year student knows, these monographs began to point students towards empirical studies of Frazer's 'savages', who, when spoken to in their own homes and languages, were found to have much more of interest to say for themselves than Frazer had to say about them. The central theme (or, as he thought, theory) of ''The Golden Bough''—that all mankind had evolved intellectually and psychologically from a superstitious belief in magicians, through a superstitious belief in priests and gods, to enlightened belief in scientists—had little or no relevance to the conduct of life in an Andamanese camp or a Melanesian village, and the whole, supposedly scientific, basis of Frazer's anthropology was seen as a misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology.&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;}}

[[Edmund Leach]], "one of the most impatient critics of Frazer's overblown prose and literary embellishment of his sources for dramatic effect", was scathing of the [[artistic license]] exercised by Frazer in ''The Golden Bough'', saying: "Frazer used his ethnographic evidence, which he culled from here, there and everywhere, to ''illustrate'' propositions which he had arrived at in advance by ''a priori'' reasoning, but, to a degree which is often quite startling, whenever the evidence did not fit he simply altered the evidence!"&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

[[René Girard]], a French historian, literary critic, and [[Philosophy of social science|philosopher of social science]], "grudgingly" praised Frazer for recognising kingly sacrifice as "a key primitive ritual", but described his interpretation of the ritual as "a grave injustice to ethnology."&lt;ref name="Segal"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Frazerian roots of contemporary theories of religion and violence|journal=[[Religion (journal)|Religion]]|first=Robert A.|last=Segal|pages=4–25|issue=1|volume=37|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scapegoat|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1986|page=120|isbn=978-0-801-83315-1|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girard's "grievances" against ''The Golden Bough'' were numerous, particularly concerning Frazer's assertion that Christianity was merely a perpetuation of primitive myth-ritualism and that the [[New Testament]] Gospels were "just further myths of the death and resurrection of the king who embodies the god of vegetation."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt; Girard himself considered the Gospels to be "revelatory texts" rather than myths or the remains of "ignorant superstition", and rejected Frazer's idea that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice, "whatever definition we may give for that sacrifice."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Girard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1978|page=180|isbn=978-0-804-72215-5|publisher=Athlone Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence==
Despite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, ''The Golden Bough'' inspired much of the creative literature of the period. The poet [[Robert Graves]] adapted Frazer's concept of the dying king sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet's suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess, as reflected in his book on poetry, rituals, and myths, ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948). [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]] refers to Frazer's thesis in his poem "[[Sailing to Byzantium]]". The horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s understanding of religion was influenced by ''The Golden Bough'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joshi, S. T. |title=H. P. Lovecraft: A Life |publisher=Necronomicon Press |location=West Warwick |year=1996 |page=209 |isbn=0-940884-88-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lovecraft mentions the book in his short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lovecraft, H. P. |author2=Turner, James |title=Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year=1998 |page=3 |isbn=0-345-42204-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. S. Eliot]] acknowledged indebtedness to Frazer in his first note to his poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''. [[William Carlos Williams]] refers to ''The Golden Bough'' in Book Two, part two, of his extended poem in five books ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/PatersonWCW|title=Paterson - William Carlos Williams|first=|last=William Carlos Williams|date=5 May 1963|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Golden Bough'' influenced [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Ronald W. |title=Freud: The Man and the Cause |publisher=Jonathan Cape and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |location=London |year=1980 |page=353 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer's work also influenced the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt; the novelist [[James Joyce]],&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt; [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt;

The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] drew on ''The Golden Bough'' in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), where he accepted Frazer's view that mythology is a primitive attempt to explain the world of nature, though considering it only one among a number of valid explanations of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Hero with a Thousand Faces |publisher=New World Library |location=Novato, California |year=2008 |pages=330 |isbn=978-1-57731-593-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later described Frazer's work as "monumental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1960 |page=164 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Weston La Barre]], writing in ''[[The Human Animal (book)|The Human Animal]]'' (1955), described Frazer as "the last of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]]" and wrote that Frazer's work was "an extended footnote to a line in [[Virgil]] he felt he did not understand."&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Animal'' (Chicago, 1954), cited in Langness, ''The Study of Culture'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics of the musician [[Jim Morrison]]'s song "[[Not to Touch the Earth]]" were influenced by the table of contents of ''The Golden Bough''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hopkins, Jerry |author2=Sugarman, Danny |title=No One Here Gets Out Alive |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=179 |isbn=978-0446602280 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s commentaries on ''The Golden Bough'' have been compiled as ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'', edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|title=Phil.uni-passau.de|author=|date=|website=uni-passau.de|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202203/http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|archivedate=14 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ackerman, in his ''The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists'' (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the [[history of ideas]]. The [[myth and ritual school]] includes scholars [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[F. M. Cornford]], and [[Arthur Bernard Cook|A.B. Cook]], who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing [[Modernism|Modernist literature]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has cited ''The Golden Bough'' as one of the most important influences on her book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |page=114 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described it as "a model of intriguing specificity wed to speculative imagination." Paglia acknowledged that "many details in Frazer have been contradicted or superseded", but maintained that the work of Frazer's Cambridge school of classical anthropology "will remain inspirational for enterprising students seeking escape from today's sterile academic climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | date= 10 November 2009 | title= Pelosi’s victory for women | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 22 April 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171608/http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | archivedate= 1 May 2015 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia has also commented, however, that the one-volume abridgement of ''The Golden Bough'' is "bland" and should be "avoided like the plague."&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | date= 10 March 1999 | title= In defense of "The Golden Bough" | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 28 April 2017 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160512072038/http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | archivedate= 12 May 2016 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Temptation of St. Anthony''''' is a [[painting]] by Spanish [[surrealist]] artist [[Salvador Dalí]]. Painted in 1946, it is a precursor to the body of Dalí's work commonly known as the "classical period" or the "Dalí Renaissance".

==History==
Dalí painted ''The Temptation of St. Anthony'' in 1946, in response to a contest held by the [[David L. Loew]]-[[Albert Lewin]] film production company for a painting of [[The temptation of St. Anthony in visual arts|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now at LACMA: Dalí's "The Temptation of St. Anthony"|url=https://unframed.lacma.org/2017/11/20/now-lacma-dal%C3%ADs-temptation-st-anthony/Salvador+Dali's+The+Temptation+of+Saint+Anthony|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be used in the film ''[[The Private Affairs of Bel Ami]]''. This was the only art contest in which Dalí participated, and ultimately his painting was not chosen for the film.

The painting contains many surrealistic elements typical of his work. Significantly, it was the first of his pieces to exhibit his interest in the intermediates between Heaven and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Neret, Gilles. Dalí, edited by Taschen 1994. Bennett, Leonie. Salvador Dalí. Chicago, Ill: Heinemann Library, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is now at the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=bel&gt;{{cite web|title=Dali, ''The Temptation of saint Anthony'' at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|url= https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/nl/de-collectie/salvador-dali-de-bekoring-van-sint-antonius/|accessdate= 13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Artists and authors have long represented the [[Anthony the Great#Temptation|temptation of St. Anthony]] in their art. ''The Temptation of St. Anthony'' is painted with oil on canvas. It depicts a desert-like landscape: a low horizon line with high clouds and dark, warm tones in an azure sky. The figure of St. Anthony kneels in the bottom left corner. He holds up a cross in his right hand and with his left hand supports himself on an ambiguous form. A human skull lies by his right foot. A parade of elephants led by a horse approach St. Anthony. The elephants carry symbolic objects representing temptation: a statue of a nude woman holding her breasts, an obelisk, a building complex confining a nude, disembodied female torso, and a vertical tower. The animals have exaggerated, long, spindly legs, making them appear weightless.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

==Interpretations==
{{Unreferenced section|date= September 2014}}
The title, ''The Temptation of St. Anthony,'' provides clues as to the meaning of the painting and its iconography. In this painting various temptations appear to [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] (the naked man in the painting). One of these is depicted in the form of a horse, representing strength and voluptuousness.

The form of the elephant, carrying on its back the golden cup of lust in which a nude woman is standing, emphasizes the erotic character of the composition. The other elephants are carrying buildings on their backs; the first carries an obelisk inspired by that of [[Bernini]] in Rome, and the second and third are burdened with Venetian edifices in the style of [[Palladio]].

The focal point is the animal parade because it is the largest element in the painting, turning the viewer's focus towards temptation. In the background, another elephant carries a tall tower that displays [[phallic]] overtones, and in the clouds one can glimpse a few fragments of the [[Escorial]], a symbol of temporal and spiritual order.

All temptation must be opposed by Saint Anthony, using his cross to ward off the vision. The saint is naked, suggesting the saint's weakness, and thus juxtaposing it with the power of the cross, which must overcome his temptation.

==Analysis==
The figure in genuflection is assumed to be St. Anthony, whose role, according to spiritual belief, is not to protect one from temptation so much as to be a conductor of the temptation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Here, he is seen as orchestrating the advancing parade of creatures, topped with various representations of erotic imagery.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The rearing horse represents the fountain of desire. The obelisk mounted on the elephant's back is an homage to ''[[Elephant and Obelisk]]'', the Roman obelisk designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. The proceeding elephants carry structures reminiscent of the [[Palladium]] and the next with a [[phallic]] tower.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} In the clouds behind the elephants, glimpses of [[El Escorial]] can be seen, representing spiritual and temporal disorder.

Dalí chose to paint subjects that he considered spiritual, and to reveal hidden powers in them. He believed that all objects possessed this power, and desired to capture it in his painting and his own possession by painting them; this was inspired by a fascination he had with the [[Atom bomb|atomic bomb]], which he found particularly mystical and powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Neret, Gilles. Dalí, edited by Taschen 1994. Bennett, Leonie. ''Salvador Dalí''. Chicago, Ill: Heinemann Library, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By using the artistic style of [[classicism]], Dalí's aim was to use its realism to bring him closer to the spirituality contained in all substances and, therefore, closer to the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Neret, Gilles. Dalí, edited by Taschen 1994. Bennett, Leonie. Salvador Dalí. Chicago, Ill: Heinemann Library, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is the first of his works that uses classicism in this way, and is a precursor to other themes that were brought on by this interest in spirituality, such as [[levitation]] and the neutralization of [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalí, Salvador, Charles Hine, Montserrat Aguer, William Jeffett, David A. Brennan, Elliott H. King, and High Museum of Art. ''Salvador Dalí: The Late Work''. Atlanta [GA.]: High Museum of Art, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its original mandate was to "produce feminist video and film" as an "alternative to male-defined images of women was long overdue."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Video and Film Catalogue|last=Women in Focus|first=|publisher=Women in Focus|year=1982|isbn=|location=Vancouver|pages=2|oclc=606457180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to producing a number of films and videos, including such notable titles as ''Fashion as a Social Control'' (1976)&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/146144717 ''Fashion as a Social Control'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rape is a Social Disease'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/145553640 ''Rape is a Social Disease'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; WIF acted as a distributor of Canadian and International film and video made by women.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivomediaarts.com/archive-library/special-collections/women-in-focus-collection/|title=Women in Focus Collection|last=VIVO|first=|date=2018|website=www.vivomediaarts.com/archive-library/special-collections/women-in-focus-collection/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre also operated a rental library of production and post-production materials, available to members of Women in Focus,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and regularly organized workshops, screenings, trainings and conferences open to both members and the general public.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; From 1978 until 1986 Women in Focus hosted ephemeral visual arts programming in a variety of gallery spaces across Vancouver. In 1986 the Floating Curatorial Gallery, later called the Lateral Gallery, was founded and hosted year-round exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rbscarchives.library.ubc.ca/index.php/vancouver-women-in-focus-society-fonds;rad|title=Vancouver Women in Focus Society Fonds|last=UBC|first=Archives|date=2018|website=rbscarchives.library.ubc.ca/index.php/vancouver-women-in-focus-society-fonds;rad|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arcintern.wordpress.com/about/|title=Women in and out of Focus|last=Bernard|first=Stephane|date=2014-01-30|work=ARClog|access-date=2018-03-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have been active participants in the development of [[radio]] (initially called "[[wireless]]") communications since its beginning. The age of [[radio communication]] began with the development of [[wireless telegraphy]] around 1900, in which [[Morse code]] could be transmitted over large distances using simple [[spark gap]] or [[carbon arc]] transmitting equipment, and various types of detectors for reception. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] achieved international fame in 1901 when he succeeded in sending a simple message in Morse code - the letter "s" - across the Atlantic from [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

==Women as wireless operators==
Women had worked as [[telegraph]] operators since the late 1840s, and it was not long before women telegraphers began to work as wireless operators as well. In early 1901, the announcement of the inauguration of a Hawaiian inter-island communications system noted that four of the fourteen operators were women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047165/1901-02-02/ed-1/seq-1/ "Marconi's System Finally a Success"], ''Honolulu Republican'', February 2, 1901, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Anna Nevins, who had worked as a telegrapher for [[Western Union]], began work as a wireless operator for [[Lee de Forest]]'s station "NY", located at 42 Broadway in [[New York City]].  She was later employed as a wireless operator at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, Louise R., "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications." ''The A.W.A. Review,'' Volume 4, 1989, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early female shipboard operators==
One of the earliest applications of wireless telegraphy was enabling communication between ships at sea and land stations.  While early ships' operators were mostly male, some women entered the field as well.  The primary requirement was a knowledge of Morse code and equipment operation, which many female telegraph operators possessed. Perhaps the earliest woman to operate on shipboard was Medora Olive Newell, an experienced telegrapher who was a passenger on the [[Cunard]] liner Slavonia in 1904, when Hungarian members of the [[Hague]] Peace Commission wished to send a birthday greeting to [[Emperor Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]].
Medora Olive Newell (1872 - December 31, 1946) began work as a telegraph operator in Durango, [[Iowa]], in 1886 at the age of fourteen.  In 1897, she moved to [[Chicago]] and became a commercial operator for the Postal Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Medora O. Newell, ''Long Beach Independent'', Long Beach, CA, January 1, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Medora Olive Newell.jpg|thumb|right|Medora Olive Newell, Early Wireless Telegrapher. Source: ''Chicago Daily Tribune, '', February 13, 1907.]]
Newell’s first-class operator pay enabled her to live a fairly affluent lifestyle; as ''Telegraph Age'' reported in 1909, “Miss Newell has been in the habit of spending her vacations abroad, and has always made these trips the occasion for investigating telegraph and railway management and operation in European countries.”&lt;ref&gt;''Telegraph Age'', June 1, 1909, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; On her return voyage from Europe in 1904, she found herself aboard the Cunard liner Slavonia together with  members of the Hague Peace Commission, who were on their way to the United States to persuade President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to call another international conference to continue the work begun at the Hague in 1899.  The Hungarian members of the delegation wished to send a birthday greeting to Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary by wireless, but the ship’s wireless operator was unable to send the message.  Newell, who, according to ''Telegraph Age'', “had a good working knowledge of wireless,” took her place at the key and soon had successfully transmitted the greeting.  The grateful delegates thanked her for her assistance, and the secretary of the Hungarian parliament invited her to visit Hungary as the guest of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jepsen, ''My Sisters Telegraphic'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Wireless Ship Act of 1910]] required US ships to be equipped with wireless equipment for the first time, and to have an operator on board who was capable of sending and receiving messages. The first woman to be officially employed as a shipboard wireless operator was Graynella Packer, a telegrapher from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], who was employed as a wireless operator for the [[United Wireless Telegraph Company]] aboard the steamship Mohawk from November 1910 to April 1911.&lt;ref name="feminine"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=The Feminine Wireless Amateur | work= The Electrical Experimenter| date=October 1916 | pages= 396–7, 452 | url=https://archive.org/details/electricalexperi04gern/page/396/mode/1up | accessdate= 2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Packer started practicing telegraphy in order to send messages in code to her school friends as a young girl.  She eventually took on telegraphy as a career because her eyes were not strong and 'handling a key is no strain on the sight'.&lt;ref&gt;(January 3, 1911).

Publisher: St. Petersburg (Florida) Evening Independent&lt;/ref&gt;  She became manager of the Postal Telegraph office in Sanford, Florida, before hiring onto the Mohawk as the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity.  After operating in full charge of the wireless, she eventually moved on to become an elected member of the Oklahoma State Bar Association from Oklahoma City in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;(1992)[https://books.google.com/books?id=wdg8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=graynella+packer&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=graynella%20packer&amp;f=false Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Oklahoma State Bar].

The [[Radio Act of 1912]] required radio operators in the U.S. to be licensed for the first time.  The first woman to be licensed as a shipboard operator was Mabelle Kelso, who passed the operator's examination and received her operating license in January 1912.&lt;ref name="operators"&gt;{{cite web | title= YL Amateur Radio Operators: 'Their Struggles and Achievements' | author= Elizabeth (VE7TLK/VA7TK)|work=qsl.net|date=2008| url= http://www.qsl.net/ylradio/archives/YLstor/images/YLSlideShow7.pdf | accessdate= 2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mabelle Kelso was a native of [[Seattle, Washington]], and had been previously employed as a stenographer.  After passing a [[U.S. Navy Department]] examination, she was hired by the United Wireless Telegraph Company and assigned a position as an operator on board the SS Mariposa, a steamship which travelled between Seattle and Alaska. Her appointment as shipboard operator generated some opposition from members of Congress who wished to bar women from holding such positions on seagoing ships; however, she received support from the Pacific Coast Wireless Inspector of United Wireless, who stated that "he knew of no law which would bar Miss Kelso from her position."&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Kelso of Seattle, Only Woman to Hold License as Wireless Operator," ''Atlanta Constitution'', July 7, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"May Flash Law On Wireless Girl," ''Oakland Tribune'', Oakland, California, July 25, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, over 30 women had been licensed as shipboard operators.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications," p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women as radio amateurs==
[[Amateur radio]] became a popular hobby in the early years of the twentieth century, and many hobbyists built their own transmitting and receiving equipment. Some of the earliest women radio amateurs, called "YLs," were Mrs. M.J. Glass of [[San Jose, California]], who operated as station FNFN in 1910, and Olive Heartburg, who operated as station OHK in [[New York City]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications," p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; M.S. Colville, of Bowmanville, [[Ontario]], who began to operate as XDD in 1914, was one of the earliest Canadian YLs.&lt;ref name="operators"/&gt;

The [[Radio Act of 1912]] also required radio amateurs to be licensed. [[Gladys Kathleen Parkin]] (September 27, 1901 - August 3, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= California Death Index, 1940 - 1997 |  work= Ancestry.com | url= http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi | accessdate= 2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the earliest women to obtain a government issued license. In 1916, while a fifteen-year-old high school student at the Dominican College in [[San Rafael, California]], she obtained a first class commercial radio operators' license with the call sign 6SO.
[[File:gladys kathleen parkin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gladys Kathleen Parkin]], 1916. Source: ''The [[Electrical Experimenter]]'', October 1916.]]

Parkin was quoted in an article titled "The Feminine Wireless Amateur," which appeared in the October 1916 issue of ''The Electrical Experimenter'':

"With reference to my ideas about the wireless profession as a vocation or worthwhile hobby for women, I think wireless telegraphy is a most fascinating study, and one which could very easily be taken up by girls, as it is a great deal more interesting than the telephone and telegraph work, in which so many girls are now employed. I am only fifteen, and I learned the code several years ago, by practising a few minutes each day on a buzzer. I studied a good deal and I found it quite easy to obtain my first grade commercial government license, last April. It seems to me that every one should at least know the code, as cases might easily arise of a ship in distress, where the operators might be incapacitated, and a knowledge of the code might be the means of saving the ship and the lives of the passengers. But the interest in wireless does not end in the knowledge of the code. You can gradually learn to make all your own instruments, as I have done with my 1/4 kilowatt set. There is always more ahead of you, as wireless telegraphy is still in its infancy."&lt;ref name="feminine"/&gt; Use of the term "YL" to refer to female radio amateurs was formally adopted by the [[American Radio Relay League]] in 1920.

==World War I and women as radio operators==
[[File:ww1 wireless women.jpg|thumb|right|Naval reservists training as wireless operators, 1916. Source: ''The Electrical Experimenter'', October 1916.]]
As the U.S. prepared to enter [[World War I]], the Navy Department began a program to train women as radio operators who could be called into action in the event of war.  The Girls' Division of the United States Junior Naval Reserve established training camps at the Martha Washington Post, in Edgewater, New Jersey, and the Betsy Ross Post, at Bay Ridge, [[Brooklyn]], where young women were trained to become wireless operators.&lt;ref name="feminine"/&gt;

In January 1917, the [[National League for Women's Service]] (NLWS) was created from the Woman’s Department of the National Civic Federation readiness and relief activities and modelled on similar groups in Britain and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Shanna|title=National League for Woman’s Service: Minute Women of Washington|url=http://www.washingtonhistory.org/research/whc/milestones/aftersuffrage/minutewomen/nlws/|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National League of Women's Services|url=http://brooklynology.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/post/2010/07/29/National-League-of-Womens-Services.aspx|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The League was divided into thirteen national divisions, one of which was "Wireless and Telegraphy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Ida Clyde|author-link=Ida Clyde Clarke|title=American Women and the World War|date=1918|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York; London|url=http://www.gwpda.org/wwi-www/Clarke/Clarke14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the US entered the war in April 1917, the NLWS established  training program for female wireless operators at [[Hunter College]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WOMEN GET INTO WIRELESS SERVICE; Hunter College to Graduate Two Girls Who Are Expert Operators.CLASS DOES MEN'S WORK 100 Students Taking the Course Will Be Qualified to AidIn War Work.

==Women as broadcast radio engineers==
[[File:Violet McKenzie with wireless.png|thumb|right|[[Florence Violet McKenzie]] working with the wireless radio c1922]]
By 1920, the technology had evolved to the point where voice and music could be transmitted as well as Morse telegraphy, and several radio stations began to broadcast regular programs of music and news. In 1920, Eunice Randall (1898-1982), an employee of The American Radio and Research Company, or AMRAD, became an engineer and announcer for the AMRAD radio station, 1XE.  Her interest in radio had begun at the age of nineteen, when she built her own amateur radio equipment and operated with the call sign 1CDP. In addition to her technical duties at 1XE, which included repairing equipment and occasionally climbing the transmitting tower, she read stories for children as "The Story Lady," and gave the police report over the air.

In 1922, the AMRAD station changed its call sign to WGI. Eunice Randall remained as engineer and assistant chief announcer until 1925, when the company went bankrupt and the station was taken off the air.  However, she continued to work as an engineer and draftsman, and resumed her amateur radio activities under the call sign of W1MPP.&lt;ref name="operators"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Remembering the Ladies-- A Salute to the Women of Early Radio | author= Donna L.
