[[Image:Animhorse.gif|right|thumb|200px|A horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from  [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos. The animation consists of 8 drawings, which are "looped", i.e. repeated over and over.]]
An '''animated cartoon''' is a [[film]] for the [[movie theater|cinema]], [[television]] or computer screen, which is made using sequential [[drawing]]s, as opposed to [[animation]] in general, which include films made using [[clay animation|clay]], [[puppet]]s, [[3D modeling]] and other means. Animated cartoons are still created for entertainment, commercial, educational{{sfn|Dalacostaa|2009|p=1}} and personal purposes.

==History==
{{main|History of animation}}

===Early years===
Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of [[motion (physics)|motion]] into a still drawing can be found in [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|p=8}}

A 5,200-year old pottery bowl discovered in [[Shahr-e Sukhteh]], [[Iran]], has five sequential images painted around it that seem to show phases of a goat leaping up to nip at a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevisuallinguist.com/2006/02/burnt-city-animation-vl.html|title=The Visual Linguist: Burnt City animation VL|date=February 15, 2006|publisher=The Visual Linguist|last=Cohn|first=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/8045|title=Oldest Animation Discovered In Iran|publisher=''Animation Magazine''|date=March 12, 2008|last=Ball|first=Ryan|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phenakistoscope]] (1832), [[zoetrope]] (1834) and [[praxinoscope]] (1877), as well as the common [[flip book]], were early animation devices to produce movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but did not develop further until the advent of [[film|motion picture film]].

===Silent era===
[[File:How Animated Cartoons Are Made (1919).webm|thumb|''How Animated Cartoons Are Made'' (1919)]]
The first animated projection (screening) was created in France, by [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]], who was a French science teacher. Reynaud created the [[Praxinoscope]] in 1877 and the [[Théâtre Optique]] in December 1888.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=3–4}} On 28 October 1892, he projected the first animation in public, ''[[Pauvre Pierrot]]'', at the Musée Grévin in Paris. This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used. His films were not photographed, but drawn directly onto the transparent strip.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=5–6}} In 1900, more than 500,000 people had attended these screenings.

The first (photographed) animated projection was ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) by newspaper cartoonist [[J. Stuart Blackton]],{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=7–8}} one of the co-founders of the Vitagraph Company arrived.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=16}} In the film, a cartoonist's line drawings of two faces were 'animated' (or came to life) on a blackboard. The two faces smiled and winked, and the cigar-smoking man blew smoke in the lady's face; also, a circus clown led a small dog to jump through a hoop.

The first animated projection in the traditional sense (i.e., on [[film|motion picture film]]) was ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by the French director [[Émile Cohl]] in 1908.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=9}} This was followed by two more films, ''Le Cauchemar du fantoche'' [''The Puppet's Nightmare,'', now lost] and ''Un Drame chez les fantoches'' [''A Puppet Drama,'' called ''The Love Affair in Toyland'' for American release and ''Mystical Love-Making'' for British release], all completed in 1908.

One of the very first successful animated cartoons was ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914) by [[Winsor McCay]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=16–17}} It is considered the first example of true [[character animation]]. At first, animated cartoons were [[black-and-white]] and silent. [[Felix the Cat]] and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] are notable examples.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=55, 59}}

==="Golden Age"===
{{main|Golden age of American animation}}
From the 1920s to 1960s, theatrical cartoons were produced in huge numbers, and usually shown before a feature film in a movie theater. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] (distributed by [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]], then [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], then [[United Artists]], then [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], then independently), [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]], and [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] (distributed by [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]) were the largest studios producing these 5- to 10-minute "shorts." Other studios included [[Walter Lantz Productions|Walter Lantz]] (distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal]]), [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] (distributed by [[United Artists]]), [[Van Beuren Studios]] (distributed by [[RKO Pictures]]), [[ComiColor Cartoons]] (distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), [[Charles Mintz]] Studios (later [[Screen Gems]]) (distributed by [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]), [[Famous Studios]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), and [[Terrytoons]] (distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]).

The first cartoon to use a [[soundtrack]] was in 1926 with [[Max Fleischer]]'s ''[[My Old Kentucky Home (movie)|My Old Kentucky Home]].'' However the Fleischers used a [[Lee De Forest|De Forest]] sound system and the sound was not completely synchronized with the film.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=89}} [[Walt Disney]]'s 1928 cartoon ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' starring [[Mickey Mouse]] was the first to use a [[click track]] during the recording session, which produced better [[Synchronization|synchronism]]. "[[Mickey Mousing]]" became a term for any movie action (animated or [[live action]]) that was perfectly synchronized with music. The music used is original most of the time, but [[musical quotation]] is often employed. Animated characters usually performed the action in "loops," i.e., drawings were repeated over and over.

Although other producers had made films earlier using 2-strip color, Disney produced the first cartoon in 3-strip [[Technicolor]], ''[[Flowers and Trees]],'' in 1932. Technicians at the Fleischer studio invented [[rotoscoping]], in which animators trace live action in order to make animation look more realistic. However, rotoscoping made the animation look stiff and the technique was later used more for studying human and animal movement, rather than directly tracing and copying filmed movements.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|pp=14}}
Later, other movie technologies were adapted for use in animation, such as [[multiplane camera]]s with ''[[The Old Mill]]'' (1937),{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=51}} [[stereophonic sound]] in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), widescreen processes with the feature-length ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and even [[3-D film|3D]] with ''[[Lumber Jack-Rabbit]]''.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=265}} 

Today, [[traditional animation]] uses traditional methods, but is aided by [[computer]]s in certain areas. This gives the [[animator]] new tools not available that could not be achieved using old techniques.

In 1917, Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] created the first animated feature ever made, ''[[El Apóstol]]'', utilizing cutout animation; however, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of the film, and it is now considered [[lost film|lost]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=49–51}}

In 1937, Disney created the first sound and color animated feature film, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=66–67}}

The name "animated cartoon" is generally not used when referring to full-length animated productions, since the term more or less implies a "short." Huge numbers of animated feature films were, and are still, produced.

==Television==
Competition from television drew audiences away from movie theaters in the late 1950s, and the theatrical cartoon began its decline. Today, animated cartoons for American audiences are produced mostly for television.

American television animation of the 1950s featured quite [[limited animation]] styles, highlighted by the work of [[Jay Ward]] on ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} [[Chuck Jones]] coined the term "illustrated radio" to refer to the shoddy style of most television cartoons that depended more on their soundtracks than visuals.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=231}} Other notable 1950s programs include [[United Productions of America|UPA]]'s ''[[Gerald McBoing Boing]]'',{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=131–132}} [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Huckleberry Hound]]'' and ''[[Quick Draw McGraw]]'',{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} and rebroadcast of many classic theatrical cartoons from [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s [[Walter Lantz]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[MGM]], and [[Disney]].

The Hanna-Barbera cartoon, ''[[The Flintstones]]'', was the first successful [[primetime]] animated series in the United States, running from 1960 to 1966 (and in [[reruns]] since).{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=235}} While many networks followed the show's success by scheduling other cartoons in the early 1960s, including ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Top Cat]]'', and ''[[The Alvin Show]]'', none of these programs survived more than a year (save Scooby-Doo, which, despite not being a primetime cartoon, has managed to stay afloat for over four decades). However, networks found success by running these shows as [[Saturday morning cartoons]], reaching smaller audiences with more demographic unity among children. Television animation for children flourished on Saturday morning, on cable channels like [[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney Channel]]/[[Disney XD]] and [[Cartoon Network]], [[PBS Kids]], and in syndicated afternoon timeslots.

The scheduling constraints of the TV animation process, notably issues of resource management, led to the development of various techniques known now as [[limited animation]]. Full-frame animation ("on ones") became rare in its use outside of theatrical productions in the United States.

Primetime cartoons for mature audiences were virtually non-existent in the mainstream of the United States until the 1990s hit, when ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ushered in a new era of [[adult animation]]. Now, "adult animation" programs, such as, ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'' have increased the number of animated sitcoms on prime-time and evening American television. In addition, animated works from other countries (notably Japan) have had varying levels of airplay in the United States since the 1960s.

===Commercial animation===
Animation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.

The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] "[[Kills Bugs Dead]]" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company. The concept has been used in many countries since.

'''The Arts council of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County''', covering [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]] and [[Forsyth County, North Carolina]], USA, claims to have been the first (1949) locally established [[arts council]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intothearts.org/about/ |title=About Us &amp;#124; The Arts Council of Winston-Salem &amp; Forsyth County |publisher=The Arts Council of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2009/nov/19/20-mondale/c_1/ |title=Joan Mondale applauds Arts Council of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County |publisher=JournalNow.com |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now there are more than 4,000.

==History==
The Arts Council was founded in 1949 with $7,200 in seed money from the Junior League of Winston-Salem. They were the first arts council created in the United States and continue to be a model for similar organizations throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intothearts.org/about/history-of-the-arts-council/ |title=History of the Arts Council |publisher=The Arts Council of Winston-Salem &amp; Forsyth County |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026174947/http://www.intothearts.org/about/history-of-the-arts-council/ |archivedate=October 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, city and county leaders recognized The Arts Council as the official local arts agency for public arts funding. The organization raises funds on an annual basis to support artists and arts and [[cultural organizations]].
The Arts Council owns its office downtown, the Arts Council Theatre, the Downtown Center for the Arts, and a parking lot.

==Community Impact==
The Arts Council states that for 60 years it has aimed to "provide proactive leadership and spark cultural growth." Their sponsored programs provide [[Performing arts education|arts education]] to school children, help artists advance their careers, and help organizations in the community provide performances, exhibits and events throughout the year.  It is estimated that annually they reach 500,000 local residents and school children through programs and initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intothearts.org/who_we_are/impact.asp |title=Who We Are - Community Impact |publisher=The Arts council of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424221204/http://www.intothearts.org/who_we_are/impact.asp |archivedate=April 24, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The arts have a substantial economic impact on Winston-Salem and Forsyth County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intothearts.org/the-creative-economy/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101161753/http://www.intothearts.org/the-creative-economy/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 1, 2011 |title=The Creative Economy |publisher=The Arts Council of Winston-Salem &amp; Forsyth County |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard bluewool textile fading test card is also placed in the same light conditions as the sample under test.
The amount of fading of the sample is then assessed by comparison to the original colour.

A rating between 0 and 8 is awarded by identifying which one of the eight strips on the bluewool standard card has faded to the same extent as the sample under test.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;[http://apps.webcreate.com/ecom/catalog/product_specific.cfm?ClientID=15&amp;ProductID=23850 Faded Card example] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225043448/http://apps.webcreate.com/ecom/catalog/product_specific.cfm?ClientID=15&amp;ProductID=23850 |date=December 25, 2010 }}, Talas.

Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero denotes extremely poor colour fastness whilst a rating of eight is deemed not to have altered from the original and thus credited as being lightfast and permanent.

The [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation in light is responsible for ink fading. As the intensity of UV radiation differs from place to place, the ink fading also depends on place. It will be more in areas with more UV radiation and vice versa. This difficulty is overcome by the bluewool testing method. Absolute values of fading will depend on light intensity. Relative values of fading, comparing the sample with the standard blue test strip, will depend less on intensity. For example, if a pigment is rated as "BW5" it can be expected to fade to the same degree as strip number 5 on a bluewool test card, for any specific light exposure. The method of comparison between the sample and a test strip enables accelerated testing to be carried out under intense artificial illumination.

'''Building typology''' refers to the study and documentation of a set of buildings which have similarities in their type of function or form. There are two ways of looking at the term "building typology". The first is a functional typology that categorizes buildings into groups by the similarity of their use.  A functional building typology under this definition may create groups such as hospitals, schools, and shopping centers (see more examples in the [[list of building types]] by use). The second is a typology that groups buildings according to their forms, which is explained is this article. Formal building typology may be based on configuration, format, or relationships of building to streets and each other. Any single functional type can be subdivided into formal types. For example, the residential functional type may be further subdivided into formal categories such as high rise towers, single family homes, duplexes, and townhouses. The townhouse building is one formal type that has a specific configuration: single units are placed side-by-side with others, vertically oriented up to four stories tall, and facing the street. Many more variations of this formal type are found around the world, each with variations that are the result of local materials, cultural habits, age and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Urban Housing Handbook|last=Firley|first=Eric|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chichester, UK|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documenting a type is the process of discovering the elements of similar forms which are the same. Usually building types are distinguished by their basic form, site configuration, and scale, but not their specific architectural style, color, or even precise use.and are related to the era, the culture, and the environment in which they arise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architectural Composition and Building Typology|last=Cannigia|first=Gianfranco|last2=Maffei|first2=Gianluigi|publisher=Alinea|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Urban Form: Typology for planners and architects|last=Scheer|first=Brenda|publisher=APA Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of autonomous building types arose in part from the general Enlightenment notion of categorization, a prelude to scientific discovery. At first types were intended as ideal models, which could be variously copied. In this sense types were commonly used forms (a [[basilica]], for example), that were adapted over time in new buildings with quite different uses:  from [[Roman Forum|Roman fora]] to early church forms ([[St. Peter's Basilica]]), to 19th century train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of the City|last=Rossi|first=Aldo|publisher=|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that these forms are very similar and are derived from each other is an important way of understanding typology:  types are evolved over time and therefor can convey a sense of history or cultural continuity. The idea of building types as formal configurations was enhanced by [[J.N.L. Durand]], who developed two important works, the ''Parallele (1799)'', a huge, handsome book that reproduced plans, elevations and sections of historic buildings at the same scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recueil et paralle des edifices de tout genre anciens et modern|last=Durand|first=Jean-Nicolas-Louis|publisher=Gille|year=1799|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He categorized them by formal types, so that their basic similarities could be recognized. Following this work, Durand also created a second book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Precise of the lectures on architecture, with graphic portion|last=Durand|first=J.N.L|publisher=|year=1802|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that manipulated and reconfigured the classical elements of architecture—columns, walls, etc. in order to adapt them to new, emerging uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=J.N.L. Durand (1760-1834): Art and science of architecture|last=Villari|first=Sergio|publisher=Rizzoli International|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durand's system, a language of architecture, demonstrated one essential characteristic of types: a way of designing that was neither entirely free of constraint nor overly prescribed.

==Documenting a building type==

Most buildings of any city can be recognized as belonging to a building type. In the US, for example, several residential types exist, such as garden apartments, townhouses, and high rise housing. Each of these may have many subtypes: even within one part of a city there may appear two or three predominant residential types such as a small post-WWII house or a strongly horizontal ranch house.  Anyone can begin to identify types simply by observing the common buildings in a place. Architectural and urban designers document types more thoroughly, by measuring them, dating them, noting similar changes to the type that arise over time, and identifying their recurring locations in the city.

==The uses of building typology in history and practice==
[[File:Delft Voldersgracht 1.JPG|thumb|Houses along the canal in Delft are a type common just to this area.]]
Building types are critical to architects because they are a starting point for designing. One need not reinvent the form if a common building type, say an office building, is wanted. Most architects develop a sense of common building types over time, even without acknowledging their importance. Architects know the approximate dimensions, bulk, site placement, and internal circulation that dictates most types. This allows them to work quickly to determine the parts of the design problem which are unique:  material, orientation, structure, specific dimensions, entrance, and so on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One school of thought in Italy, started by Saverio Muratori, recognizes the importance of typology in providing continuity in the city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These architects have been influential in recognizing the role of type for modern architecture, where the newest buildings are encouraged to actively assimilate many typological characteristics, without imitating historical styles. 
[[File:Duxton Road shophouses 2.JPG|thumb|A common type in Asia is the "shophouse" which has an open shop on the ground floor and rooms above for living.]]
Historians, anthropologists, and architectural historians use the documentation of type as a key to other characteristics in a city, for example events, political control, or economic changes. As theory tells us, when a type evolves over a period of time, this is an indication that conditions in the city have changed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Built for change: neighborhood architecture in San Francisco|last=Moudon|first=Anne Vernez|publisher=MIT Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Moudon documents changes in the types of an Alamo Square&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; neighborhood to tell a kind architectural, cultural and economic history. She also identifies the block, lot and street pattern as key to typological continuity. Multiple studies using this method have identified important building types, for example Chinese [[shophouse]]s, Shanghai's [[Shikumen]] housing, [[Terraced house|terrace housing]] in Great Britain, [[Courtyard neighborhood|Courtyard]] buildings in France, and the atrium houses found in many hot climates. Atrium types are also important for mosques, shopping malls, and some [[Atrium (architecture)|hotels]].

==Building type and urban design==

Common types are the building blocks of the city. Usually, a neighborhood streets and lots are laid out so that the common type can be built there. This occurs today in suburban subdivisions, but it has been a pattern in history, as well. This combination of types, streets and lots is called an [[urban tissue]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or a plan unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alnwick, Northumberland: a Study in Town-Plan Analysis|last=Conzen|first=M.R.G.|publisher=Institute of British Geographers|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When studying a city, a designer identifies the common tissue patterns in place and may decide to link to them, imitate them, or otherwise recognize them as an historical artifact. A movement of urban theorists and practitioners in the US, [[New Urbanism]], has identified building typology as a key to defining more user-friendly places. In trying to preserve neighborhoods or building new ones, building types once again become the building blocks of the city, and may be codified in law as [[form-based code]]s.

A '''color solid''' is the three-dimensional representation of a [[color model]], an analog of the two-dimensional [[color wheel]].  The added spatial [[dimension]] allows a color solid to depict an added dimension of [[color]] variation.  Whereas a two-dimensional color wheel typically depicts the variables of [[hue]] (red, green, blue, etc.) and [[lightness]] (gradations of light and dark), a color solid adds the variable of [[colorfulness]] (either chroma or saturation), allowing the sphere to depict all conceivable colors in an organized three-dimensional structure.

Different color theorists have each designed unique color solids.  Many are in the shape of a [[sphere]], whereas others are warped three-dimensional ellipsoid figures&amp;mdash;these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly.  The color spheres conceived by [[Phillip Otto Runge]] and [[Johannes Itten]] are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Itten, "The Art of Color", 1961. Trans. Ernst Van Haagen. New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1966. {{ISBN|0-442-24038-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The models of Runge and Itten are basically identical, and form the basis for the description below.

Pure, saturated hues of equal brightness are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere.  As in the color wheel, [[Complementary color |contrasting (or complementary) hues]] are located opposite each other.  Moving toward the center of the color sphere on the equatorial plane, colors become less and less saturated, until all colors meet at the central [[Coordinate axis|axis]] as a neutral [[gray]].  Moving vertically in the color sphere, colors become lighter (toward the top) and darker (toward the bottom). At the upper pole, all hues meet in white; at the bottom pole, all hues meet in black.  

The vertical axis of the color sphere, then, is gray all along its length, varying from [[black]] at the bottom to [[white]] at the top.  All pure (saturated) hues are located on the surface of the sphere, varying from light to dark down the color sphere.  All impure (unsaturated hues, created by mixing contrasting colors) comprise the sphere's interior, likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom.

== Usage ==

[[Artists]] and art critics find the color solid to be a useful means of organizing the three variables of color&amp;mdash;hue, lightness, and saturation (or chroma), as modelled in the [[HCL color space|HCL]] and [[HSV_and_HSL|HSL color models]]&amp;mdash;in a single schematic, using it as an aid in the composition and analysis of visual art.

'''Color symbolism''' in [[art]] and [[anthropology]] refers to the use of color as a [[symbol]] in various [[Culture|cultures]].

==Color symbolism in marketing==
Color plays an important role in setting expectations for a product and communicating its key characteristics.&lt;ref name=Asiam&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Aslam |first=Mubeen M. |date=2006 |title=Are You Selling the Right Colour? A Cross‐Cultural Review of Colour as a Marketing Cue |journal=Journal of Marketing Communications |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–30 |doi=10.1080/13527260500247827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color is the second most important element that allows consumers to identify brand packaging.&lt;ref name=Popa&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popa|first=C.N. |last2=Popescu|first2=S. |last3=Berehoiu|first3=R.M.T. |last4=Berehoiu|first4=S.M.T. |date=2013 |title=Considerations regarding use and role of colour in marketing |url=http://managementjournal.usamv.ro/pdf/vol.XIII/Art44.pdf |journal= Scientific Papers Series - Management, Economic Engineering in Agriculture and Rural Development |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=269–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketers for products with an international market navigate the color symbolism variances between cultures with targeted advertising. The car manufacturer, Volkswagen ran a commercial in Italy with a black sheep in the middle of a larger flock symbolizing those who owned a VW Golf as someone unique and self-assured among a crowd of others who were not. In several cultures around the world, a black sheep represents an outcast and is seen as something undesirable. In Italy, a black sheep represents confidence and independence.[[File:Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017.jpg|thumb|Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017]] There are many additional variances in color symbolism between cultures. Cold is symbolized by blue in East Asia, the USA, and Sweden while warmth is symbolized by yellow in the USA and by blue in The Netherlands. Sometimes the meanings of colors are in stark opposition across geographic boundaries, requiring products marketed to specific demographics to account for those changes across different markets. For instance, feminity is symbolized by blue in The Netherlands and pink in the USA., whereas masculinity is symbolized by blue in Sweden and the USA, and red in the UK and France.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt; In some instances color symbolism in marketing is constructed. For companies whose products are defined by the name of their color their sales are susceptible to the symbolism and association of that name. In one example, a company selling a paint color named “off white” more than doubled its sales by renaming the same color as “ancient silk.”&lt;ref name=Popa/&gt;

==Conceptualizations of colors cross-culturally==
Color symbolism has morphed over time. Between the 5th and 17th centuries color was largely related to in a religious context. Blue was symbolic of heaven and white of purity. Today, purity is still symbolized by white in Australia and the USA but by blue in other countries like India. Similarly, the church influenced the perception of colors like crimson and purple. Largely because the dyes for these colors could only be sourced from precious pigments, religious figures like Madonna, Cardinals, and the Virgin were seen in scarlet and purple. [[File:Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart.JPG|thumb|Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart]]Today, purple symbolizes evil and infidelity in Japan, but the same is symbolized by blue in East Asia and by yellow in France. Additionally, the sacred color of Hindu and Buddhist monks is orange. [[File:Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap.jpg|thumb|Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap]] The Renaissance was also a time in which black and purple were colors of mourning. Today, Mourning or death is symbolized by white in East Asia, black in the USA, and blue in Iran, while happiness is symbolized by white in Australia and NZ, and yellow in China.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

There is a general disagreement over whether reactions to color and their symbolism are a result of cultural conditioning or of instinct. Several studies concluded that color is part of the social learning process because of the significant symbolism within the culture. High quality, trustworthiness and dependability are symbolized by blue in the USA, Japan, Korea and green and yellow in China - as well as purple in China, South Korea and Japan. Because of these variances, critical cues vary across cultures. Warning signs are coded differently as danger is symbolized by green in Malaysia, and red in the USA and Mexico. The same color of green symbolizes envy in Belgium and the USA, but envy is symbolized by yellow in Germany and Russia, and purple in Mexico. Even the colors that denote powerful emotions vary. Love is symbolized by green in Japan, red and purple in China, Korea, Japan and the USA. Unluckiness is symbolized by red in Chad, Nigeria and Germany. Luckiness is symbolized by red in China, Denmark and Argentina. The traditional bridal color is red in China and white in the USA. Ambition and desire are symbolized by red in India.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

== Color symbolism in Arabic culture ==
Color has different meanings in different countries.  We can specifically look at the Arabic culture and take it into consideration. We can start with the color white. In the Arabic culture, white is thought of as the color that is symbolic for nature.  Since it related with nature, it has a meaning that is one of positivity. It also relates with that of being clean and pure.  White is a color that is commonly worn during prayers and with that, it symbolizes purity. White’s positive connotation carries out into other aspects.  It is also used as a symbol for positivity in the future. White is also used to symbolize the end of war. You will also see women adorn white at their weddings as a sign of positivity.  Since doves are white, they share the symbolic meaning that comes with the color.  This in turn causes them to be associated with positivity of good news. 

When you look at the color Black in Arabic culture you can find that it is related to funerals and death. Women will often wear black to funerals in order to show that they are sad for those who have passed.  Also relating to death, black is associated with hell. Black is also used to symbolize dark.  Hell is thought to be a dark black place associating black as negative.  Black in general is looked at as having negative connotations around it. For example, the symbolism of a black heart refers to someone who is unkind.  
[[File:Red rose with black background.jpg|thumb]]
Green is a color that is commonly found in Islam.  It is a color found in nature and with this, it is associated with and represents goodness. Green is a color that has an overall positive meaning.   The color green also has to do with truthfulness, again going with positivity.  If you look at phrases, the symbolic meanings are generally positive.  If you look at the phrase green hand, it relates to being generous which is a positive thing. 

Red has an overall positive association with it. Often you will find that red is a color associated with roses and blood.  The color red has to do with love and passion.  In sayings you can find it to have either a negative or positive meaning such as the term red eye relates with anger.  The Arabic culture also associates this color with death.

Blue is related with positivity when discussing it with nature, otherwise it can be related with negative connotations. When used in the phrase blue eyes, it refers to jealousy. A blue body relates with death and therefore is associated with negativity.

Yellow is another color that is also associated with nature and the sun.  Again, since it is a color related with nature, it takes on the symbolic meaning of positivity.  Gold is also categorized under here and is also takes on a positive meaning.  Generally, when used in phrases, the color yellow has to do with negativity.  For example, a yellow smile means to be mean.

==Colors and emotions==
[[File:Emotions - 3.png|thumb]]
Color symbolism is displayed in many ways. One of the most common ways we see color symbolism displayed in through our emotions. In this article Color-emotions associations: Past experience and personal preference it takes a look at how we connect colors with our emotions and how it depends on a person’s preference and or their past experiences. 
	This article first starts out by talking about the different colors and what they are associated with. The first color it talks about is the color blue and how people see blue as comfort and security and how they see orange as being upsetting. The next one they talk about is yellow which is more of a happy color compared to purple which they say is dignified but I have never heard of purple being seen that way. The next one this article talks about which I find very interesting is the color red. People view the color red in two different ways, one being as a strong and passionate color. However, it is also seen in a very different way, people see it as an aggressive color because it is the color of blood. The last color this article talks about is the color green and how just like red it has two different views. Green can be viewed positively as in quietness but can also be viewed negatively as in guilt. 
	This study took a look at how we associate colors with emotions. This study was done and showed that we associated lighter colors such as blue or yellow with more positive emotions. It then showed how we associated darker colors such as grey or black with more native emotions. However, something very interesting that this study did find is that most young prefer the color black over many other colors. 
	The study was done with college aged students to see how they associate their emotions with colors. Many tests were done such as matching tasks and matching color tests to see what colors they associate with their emotions. The study had 44 men and 54 women in it and they again were all college students. They identified a color sample with one emotion only and it showed what emotional response is connected to a color. 
	The results from this study did find that people mostly associate the color green with being the most positive. Over 95% off people said that green s the most positive because it makes them feel relaxed and then comfortable and at peace. It also showed that people saw yellow as the more excited and energetic emotion, with over 90% agreeing with this. 79% of students found that blue was a calming color because it reminded them of the ocean which is known as a calming place. People did have different answers when it came to red because like explained earlier, red is seen in two very different ways, It has been seen as love by many but also as evil because it remind people of blood. Many people did not seem to like the color purple very much as it was not favored by many for their preferences. The color black was seen to be more negative emotions like fear and depression. Overall, this article shows how color can be important because it is how people associate their emotions and things based on color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Kaya &amp; H., Naz &amp; Helen.

'''Conducting''' is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as an [[orchestra]]l or [[Choir|choral]] [[concert]]. It has been defined as "the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture."&lt;ref&gt;Sir George Grove, John Alexander Fuller-Maitland; eds. (1922). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YgBKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA588&amp;dq=conducting+dictionary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjix-69nPbWAhUO42MKHWDCDmoQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=conducting%20dictionary&amp;f=false A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Volume 1]'', p.581. Macmillan. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary duties of the '''conductor''' are to interpret the score created by a composer in a manner which is reflective of the specific indications within that score, set the [[tempo]], ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to "shape" the phrasing where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|first1=Michael|last1=Kennedy|authorlink1=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|first2=Joyce|last2=Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=9780199203833}}&lt;/ref&gt; To convey their ideas and interpretation, conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.&lt;ref name=CambComp3&gt;{{cite book|last=Holden|first=Raymond|chapter=The technique of conducting|page=3|editor-last=Bowen|editor-first=José Antonio|title=The Cambridge Companion to Conducting|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|date=2003|isbn=0-521-52791-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.&lt;ref name=CambComp3 /&gt;

The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the [[full score]], which contains the [[musical notation]] for all the instruments or voices. Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a "count in"). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.

Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor|author=Espie Estrella|date=6 March 2017|website=thoughtco.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. [[Orchestra]]s, [[choir]]s, [[concert band]]s and other sizable [[musical ensemble]]s such as [[big band]]s are usually led by conductors.

==Nomenclature==
The principal conductor of an [[orchestra]] or [[opera]] company is sometimes referred to as a ''[[music director]]'' or ''chief conductor'', or by the German words ''[[Kapellmeister]]'' or ''Dirigent''. Conductors of [[choir]]s or choruses are sometimes referred to as ''choral director,'' ''chorus master,'' or ''choirmaster,'' particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra. Conductors of [[concert band]]s, [[military band]]s, [[marching band]]s and other bands may hold the title of ''band director'', ''bandmaster'', or ''drum major''. Respected senior conductors are sometimes referred to by the Italian word, ''[[maestro]]'' ("master" as in "one who has mastered the art").

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

===Middle Ages to 18th century===
An early form of conducting is [[cheironomy]], the use of hand gestures to indicate [[melody|melodic]] shape. This has been practiced at least as far back as the [[Middle Ages]]. In the [[Christian]] church, the person giving these symbols held a [[Staff of office|staff]] to signify his role, and it seems that as music became [[rhythm]]ically more complex, the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat, acting as an early form of [[Baton (conducting)|baton]].

In the 17th century, other devices to indicate the passing of time came into use. Rolled up sheets of paper, smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period. The large staff was responsible for the death of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], who injured his foot with one while conducting a [[Te Deum]] for the [[Louis XIV of France|King]]'s recovery from illness. The wound became [[gangrene|gangrenous]] and Lully refused amputation, whereupon the gangrene spread to his leg and he died two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Jérôme de La Gorce]]|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42477pg1?q=lully+gangrene&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|title=(1) Jean-Baptiste Lully (Lulli, Giovanni Battista) (i)|work=[[Oxford Music Online]] (New Grove)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|accessdate=8 October 2008}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In instrumental music throughout the 18th century, a member of the ensemble usually acted as the conductor. This was sometimes the [[concertmaster]], who could use his [[bow (music)|bow]] as a baton, or a [[lute]]nist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat. It was common to conduct from the [[harpsichord]] in pieces that had a [[basso continuo]] part. In opera performances, there were sometimes two conductors – the keyboard player was in charge of the singers, and the principal violinist or '''leader''' was in charge of the orchestra.

On Fri, 30 Sep 1791 in Vienna, [[Mozart]]'s opera Die Zauberflöte ([[The Magic Flute]]) premiered at the Theater auf der Wieden (also known as the “Wiednertheater”), with Mozart himself conducting the orchestra, according to documents and publicity posters from that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Edge |first1=Dexter |title=The earliest published report on the premiere of Die Zauberflöte (1 Oct 1791) |url=https://sites.google.com/site/mozartdocuments/documents/1791-10-01 |website=Mozart: New Documents |publisher=Dexter Edge and David Black |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798, [[Joseph Haydn]] conducted the premiere of [[The Creation (Haydn)|Creation]] with his hands and a baton while ''Kapellmeister
Weigl [sat] at the fortepiano.''&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Robbins Landon, Liner notes to The Creation, 1994, Vivarte SX2K 57965&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Verdi conducting Aida in Paris 1880 - Gallica - Restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Giuseppe Verdi]] conducting his opera ''[[Aida]]'' in 1881]]
By the early 19th century (ca. 1820), it became the norm to have a dedicated conductor, who did not also play an instrument during the performance. While some orchestras protested the introduction of the conductor, since they were used to having a concertmaster or keyboard player act as leader, eventually the role of a conductor was established. The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common, as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper. Among the earliest notable conductors were [[Louis Spohr]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Louis-Antoine Jullien]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], all of whom were also composers. Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use in the 2010s. Prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Kurt Masur]], [[James Conlon]], [[Yuri Temirkanov]],&lt;ref&gt;Libbey, Theodore (2006).

''A History of Orchestral Conducting: In Theory and Practice'', p. 521. Pendragon. {{ISBN|9780918728470}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The composers [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Richard Wagner]] attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject. Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor. Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat. Predecessors who focused on conducting include [[François Habeneck]], who founded the [[Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire]] in 1828, though Berlioz was later to be alarmed at Habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal. Pianist and composer [[Franz Liszt]] was also a conductor.

Wagner's one-time champion [[Hans von Bülow]] (1830–1894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of [[Franz Liszt]], whose daughter [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] he married – although she was to abandon him for Wagner. Liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting, who attained remarkable performances).

Bülow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra ("sectional rehearsal"). In his posts as head of (sequentially) the [[Bavarian State Opera]], [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]], and [[Berlin Philharmonic]] he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like [[Richard Strauss]], who at the age of 20 served as his assistant, and [[Felix Weingartner]], who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards. Composer [[Gustav Mahler]] was also a noted conductor.

===20th century===
The next generation of conductors brought technical standards to new levels; perhaps most notable was the Hungarian-born [[Arthur Nikisch]] (1855–1922), who succeeded Bülow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895. He had previously served as head of the [[Leipzig Opera]], [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], and was to serve as music director of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Nikisch premiered important works by [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], who greatly admired his work; [[Johannes Brahms]], after hearing him conduct his [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]], said it was "quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better."

Nikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra. He also made one of the earliest [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] of a complete symphony: the [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven Fifth]] with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913. Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film – alas, silently. The film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra; such later conductors as [[Fritz Reiner]] stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own.

Conductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts. Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes. They were the Italian conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] (1867–1957) and the German conductor [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] (1886–1954). Toscanini played in orchestras under [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and made his debut conducting ''[[Aida]]'' in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor. He is to this day regarded by such authorities as [[James Levine]] as the greatest of all Verdi conductors. But Toscanini's repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like Bülow or, before him, Wagner. Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.

Furtwängler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo – but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly. He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist [[Heinrich Schenker]], who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and [[Resolution (music)|resolutions]] in a piece, a strength of Furtwängler's conducting. Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtwängler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R92264, Herbert von Karajan.jpg|thumb|[[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1941]]

The two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtwängler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way). In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized. Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like [[Leopold Stokowski]] (1882–1977), [[Otto Klemperer]] (1885–1973), [[Herbert von Karajan]] (1908–1989) and [[Leonard Bernstein]] (1918–1990) – incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame – had widely varied techniques.

Karajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s–80s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955–89) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the [[New York Philharmonic]] (1957–69), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe. Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements. Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax. As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 – performing Mahler's [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] – he tried to get the orchestra to produce an "ugly" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).

Both Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways. Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them, he did not talk. Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him – he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc – but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.

In the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique – particularly with the right hand and the baton – became increasingly standardized. Conductors like [[Willem Mengelberg]] in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely, and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time. A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid. Nonetheless, conductors' techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.

[[Women in music#Conducting|Women conductors]] were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like {{ill|Hortense von Gelmini|de}},&lt;ref&gt;David Mutch: "The gathering critical judgement of Hortense von Gelmini, Germany's only woman conductor, is that she has not only the talent but the education, energy, and persistance to make her mark in this difficult and competive profession" – 1976 in: ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' {{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marin Alsop]] and [[Simone Young]] are to be seen conducting leading orchestras. Alsop was appointed music director of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] in 2007 – the first woman ever appointed to head a major US orchestra – and also of the [[Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo]] in 2012, and Alsop was the first woman to conduct on the last night of [[The Proms]]. Young scored similar firsts when she became head of the [[Hamburg State Opera]] and [[Philharmoniker Hamburg]] in 2005; she is also the first woman conductor to record the [[Ring Cycle]] of [[Richard Wagner]]. ''The Guardian'' called conducting "one of the last [[glass ceilings]] in the music industry".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article stated that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the [[Paris National Opera|National Opéra in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Victor Tribot Laspière | title=Une main ferme à l'Orchestre national de France | url=http://www.francemusique.fr/actu-musicale/ou-sont-les-femmes-dans-la-musique-7766 | work=France Musique | date=2013-10-02 | accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Bachtrack'' reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classical-music.com/article/11-of-best-female-conductors |title=11 of today's top women conductors |publisher=Classical-Music.com |date=2015-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mexico has produced several major international conductors, [[Alondra de la Parra]] has become the first Mexican-born woman to attain distinction in the profession. Similarly, Asian origin has become unremarkable, because of the international successes of conductors from the Far East such as [[Seiji Ozawa]], who was the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]'s music director from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts in San Francisco and Toronto, and [[Myung-Whun Chung]], who has held major posts in Germany and France and now is bringing the [[Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra]] to international attention. There is still under-representation of artists of black origin in the conducting profession, but there have been notable exceptions, such as [[Henry Lewis (musician)|Henry Lewis]], [[Dean Dixon]], [[James DePreist]], [[Paul Freeman (conductor)|Paul Freeman]], and [[Michael Morgan (conductor)|Michael Morgan]]. For more information on black conductors, see [[Black conductors]]. According to a 2004 article in ''The Guardian'', "black conductors are rare in the classical music world and even in symphony orchestras it is unusual to see more than one or two black musicians."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/10/edinburgh04.arts|title=Black conductor fears he will remain exception|date=10 August 2004|access-date=19 June 2017|work=The Guardian|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conducting is a means of communicating artistic directions to performers during a performance. Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music. Communication is non-verbal during a performance, however in [[rehearsal]] frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played. During rehearsals, the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section. In amateur orchestras, the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians' attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes.

Conducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression ([[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulation]]) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble. The ability to communicate nuances of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] and expression through gestures is also beneficial. Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the [[sheet music|score]], but may sometimes be spontaneous.

A distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. Typically, orchestral conductors use a [[baton (conducting)|baton]] more often than choral conductors. The grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor.

===Beat and tempo===
&lt;!--[[Ictus]] links directly here.--&gt;
At the beginning of a piece of music, the conductor raises his hands (or hand if he only uses a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin. This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching. The conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds, strings, etc.) or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready. In some choral works, the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes. Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music. The preparatory beat before the orchestra or choir begins is the [[upbeat]]. The [[Beat (music)|beat]] of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand, with or without a baton. The hand traces a shape in the air in every [[bar (music)|bar]] (measure) depending on the [[time signature]], indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Maestro's Mojo – Breaking Conductors' Down by Gesture and Body Part|first=Daniel J.|last=Wakin|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=26 April 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/arts/music/breaking-conductors-down-by-gesture-and-body-part.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images show the most common beat patterns, as seen from the conductor's point of view.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]] indicates the first beat of the bar, and the [[upbeat]] indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar. The instant at which the beat occurs is called the ''[[Wikt:ictus|ictus]]'' (plural: ''{{lang|la|ictūs}}'' or ''ictuses''), and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction. In some instances, "ictus" is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a [[music stand]] where a baton is tapped at each ictus. The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the "preparation", and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the "{{lang|de|takt}}" (the German word for bar, measure and beat).

If the [[tempo]] is slow or slowing, or if the [[time signature]] is [[Metre (music)#Compound metre|compound]], a conductor will sometimes indicate "subdivisions" of the beats. The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.&lt;!---I can't find the words to make this more clear right now, but I don't think this is clear or understandable to the layman yet---not just quadruple metre---&gt;

Changes to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat. To carry out and to control a [[rallentando]] (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions.

While some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach. The second hand can be used for [[Musical cue|cueing]] the entrances of individual players or sections, and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.

During an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.

There is a difference between the "textbook" definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual [[performance practice]] in professional orchestras. With an abrupt, loud [[Dynamics (music)#Sudden changes and accented notes|sforzando]] chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly ''after'' the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.

===Dynamics===
[[dynamics (music)|Dynamics]] are indicated in various ways. The dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements, larger shapes representing louder sounds. Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a [[crescendo]]; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a [[Dynamics (music)|diminuendo]]. Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances.

Dynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume. To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.

===Cueing===
The indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called "cueing". A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful in the case of a [[pedal point]] with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by "engaging" the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible "sniff" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.

===Other musical elements===

Articulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for [[staccato]], to long and fluid for [[legato]]. Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo. Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side. A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up. The end of a note, called a "cutoff" or "release", may be indicated by a circular motion, the closing of the palm, or the pinching of finger and thumb. A release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness.

Conductors&lt;!-- would a reference improve this? Strauss said (light-heartedly) "never look at the brass, it only encourages them", and Karajan sometimes conducted with his eyes closed --&gt; aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor. Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players.

In some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see). For example, in a {{music|time|4|4}} piece that the conductor will beat "in two" (two ictus points or beats per bar, as if it were {{music|time|2|2}}), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his chest.

In most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite. This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement. String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief. Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed. In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to E{{music|b}} clarinet). If the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons, this is called [[attacca]]. The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.

==Roles==

The roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles. In some cases, a conductor will also be the [[musical director]] of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on. A senior conductor may attend some or all of the [[audition]]s for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards. Some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor. The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.

Some conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts. On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts. While a handful of conductors have become well-known [[celebrity|celebrities]], such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], most are only known within the classical music scene.

==Training and education==
[[Image:David Baker (far left) leading the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra.jpg|thumb|220px|[[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]], a music educator, composer and conductor, (far left) leads the [[Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra]] during the [[NEA Jazz Masters]] awards ceremony and concert in 2008.]]
Classical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems of instruction and training. Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience. Universities offer a range of conducting programs, including courses in conducting as part of bachelor's degrees, a small number of Master of Music degrees in conducting, and an even smaller number of [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees in conducting.

In addition, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music. Aspiring conductors need to obtain a broad education about the history of music, including the major periods of [[classical music]] and regarding [[music theory]]. Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the [[piano]] or the [[pipe organ]], a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct. Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.

In 2014, orchestra conductors typically hold a master's degree in music and choir conductors in the US typically hold a bachelor's degree in music.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/mobile/music-directors-and-composers.htm|title=Music Directors and Composers : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelor's degrees (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus. stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.

Another topic that conducting students study is the languages used in Classical music opera. Orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir. As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context. The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra. As such, a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections.

Master of music degrees ([[M.mus.]]) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an [[M.Mus.]] or M.M.) is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting.

[[Doctor of Musical Arts]] (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a [[terminal degree]], and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as [[youth orchestra]]s, school orchestras and community orchestras.

A small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting. These individuals often have achieved renown as instrumental or vocal performers, and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing). Another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).

The average salary of conductors in the US in 2014 was $48,180. A 3% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 to 2024, a slower than average growth rate.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"/&gt;

{{Sound change}}
'''Connected speech''', or '''connected discourse''', in [[linguistics]], is a continuous sequence of [[sound]]s forming [[utterance]]s or [[conversation]]s in [[spoken language]]. Analysis of connected speech shows sound changes affecting linguistic units traditionally described as [[phrase]]s, [[word]]s, [[lexeme]]s, [[morpheme]]s, [[syllable]]s, [[phoneme]]s or [[phone (phonetics)|phone]]s.&lt;ref name="Crystal, 2003"/&gt; The words that are modified by those rules will sound differently in connected speech than in [[citation form]] ([[Lemma (morphology)|canonical form]] or [[isolation form]]).

{{About|the cover performance or recording of an original song|the Steven Wilson album|Cover Version}}In [[popular music]], a '''cover version''', '''cover song,''' or simply '''cover,''' is a new [[concert|performance]] or [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] by someone other than the original artist or composer of a previously recorded, commercially released [[song]].

Before the onset of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, songs were published and several records of a song might be brought out by singers of the day, each giving it their individual treatment. Cover versions could also be released as an effort to revive the song's popularity among younger generations of listeners after the popularity of the original version has long since declined over the years.
[[File:Jimi Hendrix 1967.png|thumb|[[Jimi Hendrix]]'s cover of "All Along the Watchtower" was a bigger hit than [[Bob Dylan]]'s original version]]

On occasion, a cover can become more popular than the original, such as [[Elvis Presley]]'s version of [[Carl Perkins]]' original "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]", [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s 1970 version of [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green's]] and [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s 1968  "[[Black Magic Woman]]", [[Johnny Cash|Johnny Cash's]] version of [[Nine Inch Nails]]' "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]," [[Whitney Houston]]'s versions of [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[I Will Always Love You]]" and of [[George Benson]]'s "[[The Greatest Love of All]]", [[Glenn Medeiros]]'s version of [[George Benson]]'s "[[Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You]]" or [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s version of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[All Along the Watchtower]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/song/t1991287 | title = All Along the Watchtower | accessdate = 2011-01-14 | last = Bush | first = John | publisher = [[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hendrix recording, released six months after Dylan's original, became a [[Top 40|Top 10]] single in the UK in 1968 (US number 20) and was ranked 48th in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].
Another famous example is the Beatles' cover of "[[Twist and Shout]]", originally by [[the Top Notes]], and their cover of the song, "[[Til There Was You]]", by [[Meredith Willson]], among many others.

==History==
The term "cover" goes back decades when cover version originally described a rival version of a tune recorded to compete with the recently released (original) version. The ''Chicago Tribune'' described the term in 1952: "trade jargon meaning to record a tune that looks like a potential hit on someone else's label". Examples of records covered include [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul Williams]]' [[1949 in music|1949]] hit tune "The Hucklebuck" and [[Hank Williams]]' 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19521011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121185725/http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19521011.html |archivedate=2008-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; song "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]". Both crossed over to the popular Hit Parade and had numerous hit versions. Before the mid-20th century, the notion of an original version of a popular tune would have seemed slightly odd&amp;nbsp;– the production of musical entertainment was seen as a [[Music hall|live event]], even if it was reproduced at home via a copy of the [[sheet music]], learned by heart or captured on a [[gramophone record]]. In fact, one of the principal objects of publishing sheet music was to have a composition performed by as many artists as possible.

In previous generations, some artists made very successful careers of presenting revivals or reworkings of once-popular tunes, even out of doing contemporary ''cover versions'' of current hits. Musicians now play what they call "cover versions" (the reworking, updating or interpretation) of songs as a tribute to the original performer or group. Using familiar material (such as evergreen hits, standard tunes or classic recordings) is an important method of learning music styles. Until the mid-1960s most albums, or [[LP album|long playing records]], contained a large number of evergreens or standards to present a fuller range of the artist's abilities and style. (See, for example, ''[[Please Please Me]]''.) Artists might also perform interpretations ("covers") of a favorite artist's hit tunes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bobby Vee |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DHVP |title=BOBBY VEE - Meets the Crickets/I Remember - Amazon.com Music |website=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the simple pleasure of playing a familiar song or collection of tunes.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook]]''&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cover band]] plays such "cover versions" exclusively.

Today three broad types of entertainers depend on cover versions for their principal repertoire:

[[Tribute act]]s or bands are performers who make a living by recreating the music of one particular artist or band. Bands such as [[Björn Again]], [[Led Zepagain]], [[The Fab Four (tribute)|The Fab Four]], [[Australian Pink Floyd Show]], [[The Iron Maidens]] and Glory Days are dedicated to playing the music of [[ABBA]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]] respectively. Some tribute acts salute [[the Who]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and many other [[classic rock]] acts. Many tribute acts target artists who remain popular but no longer perform, allowing an audience to experience the "next best thing" to the original act. The formation of tribute acts is roughly proportional to the enduring popularity of the original act; for example, dozens of Beatles tribute bands have formed and an entire subindustry has formed around [[Elvis impersonator|Elvis impersonation]]. Many tribute bands attempt to recreate another band's music as faithfully as possible, but some such bands introduce a twist. [[Dread Zeppelin]] performs [[reggae]] versions of the Zeppelin catalog and [[Beatallica]] creates heavy metal fusions of songs by the Beatles and [[Metallica]]. There are also situations in which a member of a tribute band will go on to greater success, sometimes with the original act they tribute. One notable example is [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]] who, once the lead singer of [[Judas Priest]] tribute band British Steel, went on to join Judas Priest himself.

[[Cover band|Cover acts or bands]] are entertainers who perform a broad variety of crowd-pleasing cover songs for audiences who enjoy the familiarity of hit songs. Such bands draw from current Top 40 hits and/or those of previous decades to provide nostalgic entertainment in bars, on cruise ships and at such events as weddings, family celebrations and corporate functions. Since the advent of inexpensive computers, some cover bands use a computerized catalog of songs, so that the singer can have the lyrics to a song displayed on a computer screen. The use of a screen for lyrics as a [[aide memoire|memory aid]] can dramatically increase the number of songs a singer can perform.

[[Revivalist artist]]s or bands are performers who are inspired by an entire genre of music and dedicate themselves to curating and recreating the genre and introducing it to younger audiences who have not experienced that music first hand. Unlike tribute bands and cover bands who rely primarily on audiences seeking a nostalgic experience, revivalist bands usually seek new young audiences for whom the music is fresh and has no nostalgic value. For example, [[Sha Na Na]] started in 1969 as a celebration of the [[doo-wop]] music of the 1950s, a genre of music that was not initially fashionable during the hippie counter-culture era. [[The Blues Brothers]] started in 1978 as a living salute to the blues, soul and R&amp;B music of the 1950s and 1960s that was not in vogue by the late 1970s. The Blues Brothers' creed was that they were "on a mission from God" as evangelists for blues and soul music. [[The Black Crowes]] formed in 1984, initially dedicated to reviving 1970s style blues-rock. They started writing their own material in the same vein.

==U.S. copyright law==
{{Globalize|section|date=July 2017}}
Since the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], United States musicians have had the right to record a version of someone else's previously recorded and released tune, whether it is music alone or music with lyrics.&lt;ref name="straight"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_324b.html| title=Must you get permission to record someone else's song?| publisher=[[The Straight Dope]]| date=April 21, 1978 | accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A license can be negotiated between representatives of the interpreting artist and the copyright holder, or recording published tunes can fall under a [[mechanical license]] whereby the recording artist pays a standard royalty to the original author/copyright holder through an organization such as the [[Harry Fox Agency]], and is safe under copyright law even if they do not have any permission from the original author. A similar service was provided by Limelight by [[RightsFlow]], until January 2015, when they announced they will be closing their service. The U.S. Congress introduced the mechanical license to head off an attempt by the [[Aeolian Company]] to monopolize the [[piano roll]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Recording Industry |last=Hull |first=Geoffrey P. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location= |isbn=0-415-96802-X |page=46 |quote=As it became clear in 1908 that Congress was going to give music publishers the right to control mechanical reproduction of their songs, the [[Aeolian Company]] was entering into arrangements with many of the largest music publishers to be the exclusive manufacturer of [[piano roll]]s of their compositions. Fearing that Aeolian might create a piano roll monopoly, Congress responded to pleas of other piano roll manufacturers to subject the mechanical right to a compulsory license.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d1Jc5sQppqwC |accessdate=2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a composer cannot deny anyone a mechanical license for a new recorded version, the composer has the right to decide who will release the first recording of a song. [[Bob Dylan]] took advantage of this right when he refused his own record company the right to release a live recording of "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]".&lt;ref name="straight"/&gt; Even with this, [[pre-release cover version]]s of songs can occasionally occur.

Live performances of copyrighted songs are typically arranged through [[performing rights organization]]s such as [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] or [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]].

==Early 20th century history==
===Multiple versions in various formats or locations===
Early in the 20th century it became common for [[phonograph]] [[record label]]s record companies to have singers or musicians "cover" a commercially successful "hit" tune by recording a version for their own label in hopes of cashing in on the tune's success. For example, ''Ain't She Sweet'' was popularized in [[1927 in music|1927]] by [[Eddie Cantor]] (on stage) and by Ben Bernie and [[Gene Austin]] (on record), was repopularized through popular recordings by Mr. Goon Bones &amp; Mr. Ford and [[Pearl Bailey]] in 1949, and later still revived as 33 &lt;small&gt;1/3&lt;/small&gt; and 45 RPM records by [[the Beatles]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/retros/index.php?page=rchart&amp;y1=1964&amp;m1=06&amp;day1=2&amp;y2=1964&amp;m2=06&amp;day2=2&amp;sent=1 |title=Retro Charts |website=EveryHit.com |date=2000-03-16 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because little promotion or advertising was done in the early days of record production, other than at the local music hall or music store, the average buyer purchasing a new record usually asked for the tune, not the artist. Record distribution was highly localized, so a locally popular artist could quickly record a version of a hit song from another area and reach an audience before the version by the artist(s) who first introduced the tune in a particular format—the "original", "introductory" or "popularizing" artist—was widely available, and highly competitive record companies were quick to take advantage of these facts.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

===Rival outlets and popularized recordings===
This began to change in the late 1930s, when the growing record-buying public began including a younger age group. During the [[Swing era]], when a [[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxer]] went looking for a recorded tune, say "[[In the Mood]]", typically she wanted the version popularized by her favorite artist(s), e.g. the [[Glenn Miller]] version (on RCA Victor's cheaper Bluebird label), not someone else's (sometimes presented on a more expensive record company's label). This trend was marked closely by the charting of record sales by the different artists, not just hit tunes, on the music industry's Hit Parades. However, for sound commercial reasons, record companies still continued to record different versions of tunes that sold well. Most audiences until the mid-1950s still heard their favorite artists playing live music on stage or via the [[Old-time radio|radio]]. And since radio shows were for the most part aimed at local audiences, it was still rare for an artist in one area to reach a mass audience. Also radio stations tended to cater to broad audience markets, so an artist in one vein might not get broadcast on other stations geared to a set audience. So popular versions of jazz, country and western or rhythm and blues tunes, and vice versa, were frequent. Consider ''[[Mack the Knife]]'' (Die Moritat vom Mackie Messer): this was originally from Bertholt Brecht's 1928 [[The Threepenny Opera|Die Dreigroschenoper]]. It was popularized by a 1956 record ''[[Hit Parade]]'' instrumental tune, ''Moritat'', for the Dick Hyman Trio, also recorded by Richard Hayman &amp; Jan August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19560303.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122043551/http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19560303.html |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a hit also for [[Louis Armstrong]] 1956/1959, [[Bobby Darin]], 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/retros/index.php?page=rchart&amp;y1=1959&amp;m1=11&amp;y2=1959&amp;m2=11&amp;sent=1&amp;day1=1&amp;day2=1 |title=Retro Charts |website=EveryHit.com |date=2000-03-16 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ella Fitzgerald]], 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/retros/index.php?page=rchart&amp;y1=1960&amp;m1=04&amp;day1=3&amp;y2=1960&amp;m2=04&amp;day2=3&amp;sent=1 |title=Retro Charts |website=EveryHit.com |date=2000-03-16 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as vocal versions of Mack The Knife.

Europe's [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], like many commercial stations, also sold "air time"; so record companies and others bought air time to promote their own artists or products, thus increasing the number of recorded versions of any tune then available. Add to this the fact that many radio stations were limited in their permitted "[[needle time]]" (the amount of recorded music they were allowed to play), or were regulated on the amount of local talent they had to promote in live broadcasts, as with most national stations like the BBC in the UK.

===Incentives to make duplicate recorded versions of a song===
In the US, unlike most countries, broadcasters pay royalties to authors and publishers. Artists are not paid royalties, so there is an incentive to record numerous versions of a song, particularly in different genres. For example, [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] frequently cut both [[rhythm and blues]] and [[country and western]] versions of [[novelty songs]] like "Good Morning, Judge" and "Don't Roll those Bloodshot Eyes at Me". This tradition was expanded when [[rhythm and blues]] songs began appearing on pop music charts.

In the early days of [[rock and roll]], many tunes originally recorded by [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] and country musicians were still being re-recorded in a more popular vein by other artists with a more toned-down style or professional polish.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Dot Records]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was inevitable because radio stations were reluctant to play formats outside their target audience's taste. By far the most popular style of music in the mid-1950s / mid-1960s was still the professional light orchestra, therefore popular recording artists sought that format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.percyfaithpages.org/tos2.htm |title=The Orchestral Sound2 |website=Percyfaithpages.org |date=1982-08-19 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For many purists these popular versions lacked the raw earthiness of the original introducing artists.

Most did not have the kudos that rebellious teenagers craved, the street credibility&amp;nbsp;— of rock and roll music; most were performed, and some were written, by black artists not heard in popular mass entertainment markets.&lt;ref name=pc4&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19750/m1/ |title=Show 4 - The Tribal Drum: The rise of rhythm and blues. [Part 2] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most parents considered the bowdlerized popular cover versions more palatable for the mass audience of parents and their children. Artists targeting the white-majority family audience were more acceptable to programmers at most radio and TV stations. Singer-songwriter [[Don McLean]] called the cover version a "racist tool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/forum2/view.asp?topic=5432&amp;s=Definition |title=DON MCLEAN ONLINE |website=Web.archive.org |date=February 13, 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213114605/http://www.don-mclean.com/forum2/view.asp?topic=5432&amp;s=Definition+of+a+Cover+Version&amp;l=True |archivedate=2007-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many parents in the 1950s - 60s, whether intentionally racist or not, felt deeply threatened by the rapid pace of social change. They had, for the most part, shared entertainment with their parents in ways their children had become reluctant to do. The jukebox and the [[Dansette|personal record disc player]] were still relatively expensive pieces of machinery&amp;nbsp;— and the [[Transistor radio|portable radio]] a great novelty, allowing truculent teenagers to shut themselves off.

Tunes by introducing or "original" niche market artists that became successful on the mass audience Hit Parade charts are called [[crossover (music)|crossovers]] as they "crossed over" from the targeted country, jazz or rhythm audience. Also, many songs originally recorded by male artists were rerecorded by female artists, and vice versa. Such a cover version is also sometimes called a ''cross cover version'', ''male cover'', or ''female cover''.&lt;!--as in cross dressing?--&gt; Incidentally, until the mid-1930s male vocalists often sang the female lyrics to popular songs, though this faded rapidly after it was deemed decadent in Nazi Germany. Some songs such as "If Only for One Night" were originally recorded by female artists but covered by mostly male artists.

Reworking non-English language tunes and lyrics for the Anglo-Saxon markets was once a popular part of the music business. For example, the 1954 worldwide hit The Happy Wanderer was originally ''[[The Happy Wanderer|Der fröhliche Wanderer]]'', to this must be added ''Hymne a l'amour'', ''Mutterlein'', ''Volare'', ''Seeman'', ''"Quando, Quando, Quando,"'' ''L'amour est bleu'', etc.

==Modern cover versions==
Cover versions of many popular songs have been recorded, sometimes with a radically different style, sometimes virtually indistinguishable from the original. For example, [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]]'s 1992 rap "[[Baby Got Back]]" was covered by indie rock singer [[Jonathan Coulton]] in 2005, in an acoustic [[soft rock]] style. Coulton's cover was then covered, without attribution, in 2013 by the show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and was so similar that Coulton, among others, alleged [[plagiarism]] of his arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doctorow |first=Cory |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jan/31/internet-copyright-law |title=Internet copyright law has to have public support if it's going to work &amp;#124; Technology |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some producers or recording artists may also enlist the services of a sample replay company such as [[Titan Tribute Media]] or [[Scorccio]], in order to replicate an original recording with precision detail and accuracy.

A song may be covered into another language. For example, in the 1930s, a recording of ''[[Isle of Capri (song)|Isle of Capri]]'' in Spanish, by [[Osvaldo Fresedo]] and singer Roberto Ray, is known. [[Falco (musician)|Falco]]'s 1982 German-language hit "[[Der Kommissar (song)|Der Kommissar]]" was covered in English by [[After the Fire]], although the German title was retained. The English version, which was not a direct translation of Falco's original but retained much of its spirit, reached the Top 5 on the US charts. "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]" evolved over several decades and versions from a 1939 [[Solomon Linda]] ''a cappella'' song. Many of singer [[Laura Branigan]]'s 1980s hits were English-language covers of songs already successful in Europe, for the American record market. Numerable English-language covers exist of "[[99 Luftballons]]" by German singer [[Nena]] (notably one by punk band [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]]), one having been recorded by [[Nena]] herself following the success of her original German version. "[[Popcorn (instrumental)|Popcorn]]", a song that was originally completely instrumental, has had lyrics added in at least six different languages in various covers. During the heyday of [[Cantopop]] in Hong Kong in the late 1970s to early 1990s, many hits were covers of English and Japanese titles that have gained international fame but with localized lyrics (sometimes multiple sets of lyrics sung to the same tune), and critics often chide the music industry of shorting the tune-composing process.

Although modern cover versions are often produced for artistic reasons, some aspects of the disingenuous spirit of early cover versions remain. In the album-buying heyday of the 1970s, albums of sound-alike covers were created, commonly released to fill [[bargain bin]]s in the music section of supermarkets and even specialized [[record shop|music stores]], where uninformed customers might easily confuse them with original recordings. The packaging of such discs was often intentionally confusing, combining the name of the original artist in large letters with a tiny disclaimer like ''as originally sung by'' or ''as made popular by''. More recently, albums such as the [[Kidz Bop]] series of [[compact disc]]s, featuring versions of contemporary songs sung by children, have sold successfully.

In 2009 the American musical comedy-drama television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' debuted, featuring several musical performances per episode. The series featured solely cover songs performed by the series' titular [[glee club]] until near the end of its second season with the episode "[[Original Song]]". The series still primarily uses cover songs of both chart hits and show tunes, occasionally as [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] or distinct variations. The show's musical performances have been a commercial success, with over twenty-one million copies of ''Glee'' cast single releases purchased digitally, and over nine million albums purchased worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hot-business-glee-75593|title=Exclusive: Inside the Hot Business of 'Glee{{'-}}|page=2|date=January 25, 2011|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=Lori Burgess|accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updating older songs==
Cover versions (as the term is now used) are often contemporary versions of familiar songs. For example, "[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]" was originally introduced by [[Cliff Edwards]] in the film ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]''. The famous [[Gene Kelly]] version was a revision that brought it up to date for a 1950s Hollywood musical, and was used in the 1952 film ''Singin' in the Rain''. In 1978, it was covered by French singer [[Sheila (singer)|Sheila]] accompanied by the [[B. Devotion]] group, as a [[disco]] song, once more updating it to suit the musical taste of the era. During the disco era there was a trend of taking well known songs and recording them in the disco style. More recently "Singin' In the Rain" has been covered and remixed by British act [[Mint Royale]] for a television commercial for [[Volkswagen]]. Another example of this, from a different angle, is the tune "[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]", many mistakenly believe the [[Fats Domino]] 1956 release to be the original recording and artist. In fact, it was originally introduced on film by [[Gene Autry]] and popularized on the record Hit Parade of [[1940 in music|1940]] by Glenn Miller. The Fats Domino ''[[rock and roll]]'' version is the only one that might currently get widespread airplay on most media. Similarly, "[[Unchained Melody]]" was originally performed by [[Todd Duncan]], featured in the 1955 film ''[[Unchained (film)|Unchained]]'' (based on the non-fiction story ''Prisoners are People'' by Kenyon J. Scudder); [[Al Hibbler]] having the biggest number of worldwide record sales for the vocal version with Jimmy Young's ''cover version'' rival outdoing this in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/retros/index.php?page=rchart&amp;y1=1955&amp;m1=06&amp;y2=1955&amp;m2=06&amp;sent=1&amp;day1=3&amp;day2=3 |title=Retro Charts |website=EveryHit.com |date=2000-03-16 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Les Baxter's Orchestra gaining the big instrumentalist sales, reaching the US Hit Parade number one spot in May 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19550521.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122001651/http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/50s_files/19550521.html |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[The Righteous Brothers]]' later version (top five on the US Hit Parade of September 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/19650828.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111055259/http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/19650828.html |archivedate=2009-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stalling at number 14 in the UK in August) is by far the wider known version, and especially so following its appearance in the 1990 film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]''. "[[House of the Rising Sun]]" has hundreds of versions and in many genres such as folk, blues rock and punk as well as dance and dubstep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houseoftherisingsuns.com/cover_list.php |title=List of House of the Rising Sun covers with Youtube videos |publisher=Houseoftherisingsuns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Baz Luhrmann]] has contemporized and stylized older songs for use in his films. New or cover versions such as [[John Paul Young]]'s "Love Is in the Air" occur in ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'', [[Candi Staton]]'s "Young Hearts Run Free" appear in ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', and adaptations of artists such as [[Nat King Cole]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Elton John]], [[Thelma Houston]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[David Bowie]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[The Police]] are used in ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' The covers are carefully designed to fit into the structure of each film and suit the taste of the intended audience.

Other artists release new versions of their own previous songs, like German singer [[Nena]] who recorded an entire album with great success, with new versions of older hits. Cover songs can be used to display creativity of a performers work through the talent of another artist's previous production. Not to be confused with a Remix, which is defined as altering or distorting the original sound electronically; Cover Versions give a performer the ability to adapt music to their own style, typically allowing them to change the genre of a song and recreating it to their own taste. For example, in 2008, [[Fall Out Boy]] covered [[Michael Jackson]]'s hit song "[[Beat It]]", changing the genre from [[pop rock]] to a more [[punk rock]] feel. This is more common with today's covers, taking older popular music and revamping it to compare with modern popular music. [[Aretha Franklin]]'s cover of [[Otis Redding]]'s "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]" was voted the greatest cover song of all-time, according to Forbes.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popdose.com/the-popdose-100-the-greatest-cover-songs-of-all-time/ |title=The Popdose 100: The Greatest Cover Songs of All Time |website=Popdose.com |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exoticism''' (from 'exotic') is a trend in European art and design, whereby artists became fascinated with ideas and styles from distant regions, and drew inspiration from them. This often involved surrounding foreign cultures with mystique and fantasy which owed more to European culture than to the exotic cultures themselves: this process of glamorisation and stereotyping is called 'exoticization'.

==History of exoticism==

First stimulated by Eastern trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, interest in non-western (particularly "Oriental", i.e. Middle Eastern or Asian) art by Europeans became more and more popular following [[European colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oshinsky|first=Sara J.|title=Exoticism in the Decorative Arts|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/exot/hd_exot.htm|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influences of Exoticism can be seen through numerous genres of this period, notably in music, painting, and decorative art. In music, exoticism is a genre in which the rhythms, melodies, or instrumentation are designed to evoke the atmosphere of far-off lands or ancient times (e.g. [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' and ''Tzigane for Violin and Orchestra'',  [[Claude Debussy|Debussy's]] ''Syrinx for Flute Solo'' or [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov's]] ''[[Capriccio espagnol]]''). Like orientalist subjects in 19th-century painting, exoticism in the decorative arts and interior decoration was associated with fantasies of opulence.

Exoticism, by one definition, is "the charm of the unfamiliar". Scholar [[Alden Jones]] defines exoticism in art and literature as the representation of one culture for consumption by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article08060708.aspx|title=This Is Not a Cruise|author=Alden Jones|date=August 6, 2007|publisher=The Smart Set}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Segalen's important "Essay on Exoticism" reveals Exoticism as born of the age of imperialism, possessing both aesthetic and ontological value, while using it to uncover a significant cultural "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segalen|first=Victor|title=Essay on Exoticism: An Aesthetics of Diversity|year=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important and archetypical exoticist is the artist and writer [[Paul Gauguin]], whose visual representations of [[Tahiti]]an people and landscapes were targeted at a French audience. While exoticism is closely linked to [[Orientalism]], it is not a movement necessarily associated with a particular time period or culture. Exoticism may take the form of [[primitivism]], [[ethnocentrism]], or humanism.

Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. The revival of ancient Greek and Roman art left behind the Academy’s emphasis on naturalism, and incorporated a new found idealism not seen since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=Robert|title=Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society|journal=Art Journal|year=1990|volume=49|issue=1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As classicism progressed, Ingres identified a newfound idealism and exoticism in his work. The Grand Odalisque, finished in 1814, was created to arouse the male view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Karen|title=The Spectatorship of the Affiche Illustrée and the Modern City of Paris, 1880-1900|journal=Journal of Design History|year=2012|volume=25|issue=1|page=24|doi=10.1093/jdh/epr044}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of the exotic figure furthers Ingres’ use of symmetry and line by enabling the eye to cohesively move across the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth-Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ingres’ intention was to make the woman beautiful in his work, his model was a courtesan, which arouse debate.

Édouard Manet’s [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]], finished in 1863, was based on Titian’s Venus of Urbino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olympia was a popular play about a courtesan called Olympia. This subject was extremely controversial for an artist to portray a woman like this because of traditional vision of the Academy.  Manet was being very different from the accepted academic style by outlining and flattening space that created a distortion of classical elements. Olympia is provocative in her nudity that implies she is naked, not nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is looking out in a very confrontational way, and setting the viewer as a man coming to the prostitute, although Olympia’s hand suggests she is not ready to engage with the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The African servant calls on racism and slavery in France, because showing someone of color participating in French life was unheard of, furthering the work's exotic nature.

FONDART&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/fondos/fondart/ FONDART] http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/ Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes retrieved on April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or “Fondo Nacional para el Desarrollo Cultural y las Artes” (English: “National Fund for the Development of Culture and the Arts”), is a [[Chile]]an public program of the governmental agency [[National Council of Culture and the Arts (Chile)|Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes]] (English: National Council of Culture and Arts) which provides public funding for projects dedicated to the promotion of arts, culture, and heritage. The Council headquarters are located in [[Plaza Sotomayor]], [[Valparaíso]].

==Administration==

FONDART allocates funding through a public bidding system for projects that aim to educate, create, promote and preserve art in the areas of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/fondos/fondart/areas-artisticas/ Artistic areas sponsored] http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/ Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes retrieved on April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; visual arts, photography, new media, drama, dance, circus arts, craft, design and architecture. Two separate funds are awarded every year, a national fund and a regional fund. The application process, known as called “Ventanilla Abierta” (English: “Open Counter”), is open to any Chilean individual or organisation.

FONDART is managed by the board of Chile’s Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultura.gob.cl/ Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Arte] cultura.gob.cl retrieved on April 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; (English: [[National Council of Culture and the Arts|National Council for Culture and the Arts]]), or CNCA, which meets every year to agree the requirements of the competition. The CNCA has a department dedicated to the administration of the fund, the Secretaría de FONDART, which is part of the CNCA’s "Departamento de Fomento de las Artes e Industria Creativa"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldinamo.cl/blog/la-industria-creativa-en-chile-hoy-es-una-realidad-no-un-discurso] El Dínamo, el dinamo.cl retrieved on May 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; (Department of Promotion of the Arts and Creative Industries). The Secretaría de FONDART runs the bidding competition for the two funds and pulls together the national and regional results. Each of the artistic areas sponsored by the fund has its own manager overseeing it.

==Legal background==

FONDART was created in 1992, along with the [[National Council of Culture and the Arts|Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes]] under Law Nº 19,891&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/wp-content/files_mf/ley19891_23ago2003.pdf Full text of the 19.891 law of 1992] http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/ retrieved on April 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of promoting art and culture and conserving Chile’s cultural heritage.

Decree Nº144, of April 4, 2011, established how Law Nº 19,891 would operate and how the national fund for the development of culture and arts would be administered. It replaces the 2004 Decree Nº 65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/wp-content/files_mf/dto144_21sep2011.pdf Full text of the Decree 144 of April 04, 2011] http://www.fondosdecultura.gob.cl/ retrieved on April 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fountain of the Tritons''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Fontana dei Tritoni'') is a fountain in [[Rome]] ([[Italy]]), [[Piazza Bocca della Verità]], in front of the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]]. This fountain should be distinguished from the similarly named nearby [[Triton Fountain]] (''Fontana del Tritone'') by [[Bernini]], in the [[Piazza Barberini]], with only a single Triton.

[[File:Roma Rione Ripa fontana dei Tritoni.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Fountain of the Tritons]]
[[File:Roma Rione Ripa Fontana dei Tritoni Tempi di Ercole Vincitore e Portunus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The fountain and the Temples of Hercules Victor and Portunus in the background]]
The building, starting from 1610, of the last Roman aqueduct, the ''Acqua Paola'', didn't move to the background the two aqueducts built just a few years before (the ''[[Aqua Virgo]]'' in 1570 and the ''Acqua Felice'' in 1587), which gave the possibility to erect new fountains on the branches that guaranteed a more widespread distribution of water in the whole town. A secondary branch of the ''Acqua Felice'' reached the area south of the [[Tiber Island]]: here, between ancient and middle-age monuments (the [[Arcus Argentariorum]], the [[Arch of Janus]], the [[Temple of Hercules Victor]], the [[Temple of Portunus]] and the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]]) [[Pope Clement XI]] ordered the construction of a monument in his own memory. It is not so clear indeed why the pontiff chose to erect a fountain in an area that was scarcely inhabited, broken-grounded and subject to the floods of river [[Tiber]]. In fact, its fulfillment raised many criticisms for the location believed to be unhappy.

The fountain was completed in 1715 by architect Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri, during the works for the accommodation of the square in front of the basilica. The whole [[travertine]] structure is placed on a circular step (delimited by 16 little columns joined by a grating), within which the design of the main basin represents an octagon with concave sides, or rather the eight-tips star that was the [[Heraldry|heraldic]] symbol of the family of the Pope, the [[Albani family|Albanis]]). In the centre there is a group of rocks (an element that had become popular after the success of the [[fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]]) with bushes on which two [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]] (due to Francesco Moratti) are knelt with clinged tails and raised arms, sustaining on their shoulders a big oyster shell serving as upper basin. Between the two Tritons there is the coat of arms of the pontiff.

Four [[mascaron (architecture)|mascarons]] formerly dumped water into the main basin; they were removed in the 19th century, probably due to the scarcity of the incoming water, that could have left them dry. In fact the fountain has been without water for a long time, but the hydric provision, though quite scarce, has been restored.

The last restorations date back to 1994-1995 and 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2724">The '''Frasnes Hoard''' was accidentally unearthed in 1864 by foresters digging out the roots of a tree near [[Frasnes-lez-Buissenal]] in [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], Belgium.  The torcs and some other pieces are now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connaitrelawallonie.wallonie.be/fr/histoire/timeline/c-iie-siecle-av-j-c-torques-en-or-de-frasnes-lez-buissenal#.W_7RAzHfOM8 connaitre la wallonie], "c. IIe siècle av. J-C : torques en or de Frasnes-lez-Buissenal"&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with at least eighty uninscribed coins of types often found in Gaul and Britain and associated with the Belgic tribes of [[Morini]] and [[Nervii]], which were dated by John Evans to ca. 80 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Described and illustrated in accompanying engravings as with plain convex obverses with the schematic horse above a crescent and pellet by John Evans, "On some gold ornaments and Gaulish coins found together at Frasnes in Belgium", ''The Numismatic Chronicle and Journal of the Royal Numismatic Society'', new series '''4''' (1864:96-101); Evans noted a previous article by Renier Chalon in ''Revue de la Numismatique Belge''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hoard]] discovered at Frasnes also contained two characteristically Gallic Late [[La Tène style]] gold [[torc]]s, one plain with flattened-ball terminals, the other with repoussé decoration of a frontal bull's head among raised facetted scrolls&lt;ref&gt;The repoussé gold torc was in Alastair Bradley Martin's Guennol collection, illustrated by [[Thomas Hoving|Thomas P.F. Hoving]], "'Valuables and Ornamental Items': The Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Alastair Bradley Martin" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' new series, '''28'''.3 (November 1969:147-160) p. 152. It is now conserved at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt; some of which manifested a design repertory comparable to finds in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Comparison with the torc from the "[[Broighter Gold]]" hoard in Northern Ireland and the gold alloy ([[electrum]]) torc from one of the hoards on Ken Hill, near Snettisham, were instanced by [[N. K. Sandars]], ''Prehistoric Art in Europe'' "Insular La Tène and the problem of La Tène art", 1992:409.&lt;/ref&gt; The torc was constructed of sheet gold over an iron ring wrapped in a hard cement. There was also a ring "nearly 1⅝ inches in diameter",&lt;ref&gt;Evans 1864:97&lt;/ref&gt; too large in diameter to be a finger ring, yet too small to be a bracelet or armband; it had continuous granular ornament of globules of gold soldered together round into outer face.

'''Glasgow Women's Library''' is a [[public library]], registered company and charity based in the [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]] area of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. It provides information relevant to women's history, culture and achievements, and tries to operate on [[feminist]] principles. It supplies or encourages training and education, skill-sharing via volunteers and/or staff.

==History==
The Women's Library was established in 1991.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenslibrary.org.uk/about-us/our-history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Glasgow Women's Library |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved from the 'Women in Profile' project, whose aim was to ensure the visibility of women in the programming of Glasgow, [[European City of Culture]] year. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/19/glasgow-womens-library-feminism-museum-womens-history-uk-cookery-books-spare-rib-anti-suffragette|title=Glasgow Women’s Library: a treasure trove that shows how far feminism has come|last=Brooks|first=Libby|date=2016-09-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 the number of paid staff had reached 22, along with 100 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/19/glasgow-womens-library-feminism-museum-womens-history-uk-cookery-books-spare-rib-anti-suffragette|title=Glasgow Women’s Library: a treasure trove that shows how far feminism has come|last=Brooks|first=Libby|date=2016-09-19|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2010 the library moved to the [[Mitchell Library]] in the West End,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow Women’s Library is flitting {{!}} Glasgow Women's Library|url=http://womenslibrary.org.uk/2010/08/10/flitting/|website=womenslibrary.org.uk|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a decision taken in 2012 to move to more suitable premises in Landressy Street in Bridgeton.  This move was completed in November 2015, after two years of renovation work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creativescotland.com/explore/read/stories/features/2016/glasgow-womens-library-truly-a-national-treasure|title=Glasgow Women's Library: Truly a national treasure {{!}} Creative Scotland|website=www.creativescotland.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/09/collective-architecture-glasgow-womens-library-steel-lift-extension-renovation-scotland/|title=Collective Architecture completes Glasgow Women's Library|date=2016-04-09|work=Dezeen|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new library was officially opened on 7 November 2015 by [[Nicola Sturgeon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Co-founder [[Adele Patrick]] won the Scottish Woman of the Year award in 2015, and a Woman of the Year in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/15006350.Former_SWOTY_winner_reveals_importance_of_big_win_ahead_of_candidate_shortlist_announcement/|title=Former SWOTY winner reveals importance of big win ahead of candidate shortlist announcement|website=Evening Times|language=en|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/14658196.SWOTY_Adele_is_a_Woman_of_the_Year/|title=SWOTY Adele is a Woman of the Year|website=Evening Times|language=en|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection and projects ==
The library is the UK's only accredited museum concerned with women's history, and was awarded Recognised Collection of National Significance to Scotland status in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-42454412|title=Women making an exhibition of themselves|last=Sharpe|first=Gillian|date=2017-12-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/glasgow-women-s-library-celebrates-25-years-of-inspiration-1-4046010|title=Glasgow Women’s Library celebrates 25 years of inspiration|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;The collection includes Suffragette memorabilia, dress making patterns from the 1930s, and Scottish Women's Liberation newsletters from the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011, and in celebration of their 21st birthday in 2012, the library launched the ''21 Revolutions'' project, commissioning a group of 21 artists and 21 writers, including [[Janice Galloway]] and [[Denise Mina]], to make work inspired by their collection.  The work was published in a book of the same name. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015 the library nominated [[The Suffragette Oak]], a tree in Kelvingrove Park, for the Woodland Trust Scottish Tree of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2015/10/suffragette-oak/|title=Suffragette Oak is Scotland's Tree of the Year|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oak tree went on to win the award and was then a nominee in the 2016 European Tree of the Year awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenslibrary.org.uk/2016/02/01/vote-for-the-suffragette-oak-to-be-european-tree-of-the-year-2016/|title=Vote for the Suffragette Oak to be European Tree of the Year 2016 – Glasgow Women's Library|website=womenslibrary.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Big Rachel of Glasgow.jpg|thumb|"[[Rachel Hamilton|Big Rachel]]" was a special constable in 1875]]

{{for|the American rock band|Grateful Dead}}
'''Grateful dead'''  (or '''grateful ghost''') is a [[Folklore|folktale]] present in many cultures throughout the world. The most common story involves a traveler who encounters a corpse of someone who never received a proper [[burial]], typically stemming from an unpaid debt.&lt;ref name="encybrit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037771/grateful-dead#23476.hook|title=Grateful dead|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2007|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cscmu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/name.html|title=Dead FAQ: How did they get the name?|accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traveler then either pays off the dead person's debt or pays for burial. The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the [[donor (fairy tale)|donor]].

The "grateful dead" story is [[Aarne–Thompson]]–Uther type 505.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0505.html|title=The Grateful Dead:  folktales of Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 505|author=D.L. Ashliman|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient Egyptian text explains the [[Golden Rule|principle of reciprocity]] in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;"The Burden of Isis, Being the Laments of Isis and Nephthys", James Teackle Dennis, Dutton &amp; Co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One variant is the [[Book of Tobit]].&lt;ref name="hibbard74"&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p74. New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Amadas]]'' has the title knight pay his last coins for such a burial.&lt;ref name="hibbard74"/&gt;  It appears in various fairy tales, such as the Italian ''[[Fair Brow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 725 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''[[The Bird 'Grip']]'' and [[Hans Christian Andersen|H.

'''Jules Girardet''' (10 April 1856, [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] - 25 January 1938, [[Boulogne-Billancourt]]) was a French painter and illustrator of Swiss descent.

==Biography==
He came from a Swiss [[Huguenot]] family. His father was the engraver Paul Girardet (1821-1893).

He studied at the [[École des Beaux-arts]] and in the studios of [[Alexandre Cabanel]]. After several trips to North Africa with his brother [[Eugène Girardet|Eugène]], a noted [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painter, he chose instead to concentrate on [[Genre art|genre]] scenes and [[history painting]].&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F22410.php] Dictionnaire Historique de la Suisse&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paris Commune|Commune]] and [[Louise Michel]] were favorite topics.

He married in 1881 and built a house with a studio in Boulogne-Billancourt. That same year, he began to exhibit at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. He won a Silver Medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]].&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; In addition to his paintings, he illustrated several books, including ''Mademoiselle de Fierlys'' by Frédéric Dillaye (who died in the infamous fire at the [[Bazar de la Charité]]) and ''[[Tartarin de Tarascon]]'' by [[Alphonse Daudet]]. His brother {{ill|Léon Girardet|fr}} was also a painter.

The '''Lalibela Cross''' (or ''Afro Ayigeba'') is a large, elaborately decorated [[processional cross]], considered one of [[Ethiopia]]'s most precious religious and historical heirlooms.  It is held by the [[Bet Medhane Alem]], the House of the Redeemer of the World, a 12th-century [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] church in [[Lalibela]].  A priest may rub believers with the cross to bless them or heal them. The style of the cross was common in its time and those of this style are often simply referred to today as "Lalibela crosses".

The cross is thought to date to the 12th century.  It is around {{convert|60|cm|in}} long and weighs around {{convert|7|kg|lb}}.  It is made from one piece of metal, either [[gold]], or [[bronze]] and gold.  The central cross has an elongated descending arm and flared ends surrounded by an elaborately ornamented encircling band.  Like many Ethiopian processional crosses, the bottom of the cross is supported by "Adam's arms", a motif that realistically or abstractly portrays the arms of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;W. Korabiewicz. 1973 "The Ethiopian Cross" Holy Trinity Cathedral: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia&lt;/ref&gt;  On processional crosses they are draped with brightly colored pieces of cloth for festive occasions.      

The cross was stolen in March 1997, but located in [[Belgium]] in 1999, when a dealer in [[Addis Ababa]] sold it to a Belgian collector for US$25,000.  After the collector's money was returned and it was agreed that no further legal action would be taken, the cross was returned to Ethiopia in 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22779">The following is a list of stories written by [[Stuart McLean]] featuring his popular fictional characters "Dave and Morley" from the radio program ''[[The Vinyl Cafe]]''. First read on air in 1994, many of the stories were eventually compiled in book form, followed by audio recording compilations from the program.

Note that this list features only the stories that have been published in book form and on audio. Numerous other stories have been written and read out loud on the radio show, but are not currently listted. Several stories also have titles in the book different from those on the audio versions.

The first collection of stories in book form, ''Stories from the Vinyl Cafe,'' contains several stories that did not feature Dave and Morley or any other characters acquainted with them. Subsequent collections of stories featured Dave and Morley-related content exclusively.

==Characters==
The major characters in the stories are Dave, Morley, their family and assorted friends and neighbours. The family's last name is never mentioned, although in one story Dave's mother's name is given as Margaret McNeal.

===Dave, Morley, and Family===
* '''Dave''' is in his late forties to early fifties. He runs an [[Independent business|independent]] [[record store]], called "The Vinyl Cafe", whose slogan is "We may not be big, but we're small". Dave represents an alternative view on life that is not based on financial success and status but on human relationships and music. He grew up in Big Narrows, on [[Cape Breton Island]], where his mother Margaret still resides. Dave is frequently neurotic and prone to small accidents and mishaps that he usually inadvertently escalates into major ones and he is somewhat of a [[hypochondriac]]. He is painfully awkward and a terrible liar. These attributes motivate many of the stories, which range from an incident with the Christmas turkey, to accidentally destroying Mary Turlington's treasured candles, to filling the elementary school playground with frogs. It is his wife, Morley, who often has to resolve the mess Dave creates.
:Dave enjoys a good prank and has a tradition of pulling outrageous jokes on his friend, Kenny Wong (owner of "Wong's Scottish Meat Pies"), every [[April Fools' Day]]. Dave worked as a tour manager "for some of the best indie acts; certainly for some of the weirdest" before he met Morley. His enjoyment of pranks is seen in his younger days as a tour manager, as well. Dave's last name has never been revealed; although in "School Days", his mother's last name is McNeal, it's unclear whether she uses her married name or reverted to her maiden name after Dave's father died.
* '''Morley''' was a stay-at-home mom, until she re-entered the workforce. She is currently employed at a local theatre. She loves to [[figure skating|figure-skate]]. She and Dave first met at an ice-rink in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], when they were in their twenties. She is often more level-headed and practical than Dave and frequently long suffering when it comes to his adventures. Morley works hard at running the family and, more often than not, Dave is more like a third child to her. Dave will then go to great lengths to prove his love again. Morley was named for McLean's personal friend David Morley;&lt;ref name=morley&gt;"David Morley". ''[[Here and Now (Toronto)|Here and Now]]'' ([[CBLA-FM]]), February 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the story "Skunks", the first to introduce Morley, was inspired by a real incident that had happened to David Morley's family.&lt;ref name=morley/&gt; 
* '''Stephanie''' is a jaded and skeptical Toronto teenager who often fights with her brother Sam. In the first stories, she was fourteen or fifteen years old. She was frequently rebellious and sullen which led to many disagreements with her parents and Sam. In more recent stories, she attends university in another city and dates a young man named Tommy Nowlan. Since then, some episodes feature coming of age stories. She spent one summer planting trees north of [[Thunder Bay]]. Soon after her job ended, Stephanie visited her aged 'Aunt Dorothy' in England. She assumed that she would dislike the trip but discovered an interest in history and the past while away.
* '''Sam''' is about seven or eight years younger than Stephanie. In many stories, he was referred to as seven; although his age has recently made a jump to age eleven. Only a few stories have Sam placed at any age between seven and eleven. Despite his ineptitude at sports, he plays goalie on his [[hockey]] team and plays on the girls field hockey team, which was the subject of one story. He likes to [[knitting|knit]] and help his neighbours, Eugene and Maria. Sam is frequently portrayed as sensitive, slightly goofy and often naive. Several of his friends have been minor characters in several stories.  This includes a skateboarding girl whom he met on a school trip to [[Quebec City]], when he missed the bus to an [[IMAX]] theatre;  although they spoke different languages and he never got her contact information or even her name, it proved an exhilaratingly romantic experience for the boy. According to Stuart McLean's friends and colleagues, Sam is the character who most resembles McLean himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Canada's Storyteller: A Tribute to Stuart McLean''. [[CBC Radio]], February 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Arthur''' is the family dog. He likes soft ice-cream and  considers himself dominant to Dave (much to Dave's surprise) and steals socks and potatoes. He was once a sheep in a Christmas pageant. Arthur is considered a full family member. In a story at the end of the ''Revenge of the Vinyl Cafe'' collection (2015), Arthur dies of old age and is mourned by the family. After the story of his death was originally broadcast on the radio show, McLean named his "Arthur Awards", an annual episode in which he would present awards to people whose acts of kindness and generosity were nominated by listeners, after the dog.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/remembering-stuart-what-everyday-act-of-an-ordinary-person-in-your-community-do-you-think-should-be-honoured-1.3987950 "Remembering Stuart: What everyday act of an ordinary person in your community do you think should be honoured?"] ''[[Cross Country Checkup]]'', February 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Galway''' is the mysterious family cat, who came from Dave's sister Annie, and is named for American poet [[Galway Kinnell]]. Galway was intentionally brought on one family vacation and accidentally came on another, by stowing away in the trunk. The vacation was ruined partially due to her. She was briefly toilet-trained (until she almost flushed herself down the toilet) but still enjoys flushing the toilet when the bathroom door is left open.
*'''Margaret''' is Dave's mother. She still lives in Dave's childhood home in Big Narrows. Before retirement, Margaret taught elementary school in Big Narrows and was known for her ability to burp the alphabet. After the death of her husband and Dave's father, Charlie, she was a widow for many years. She recently remarried a local volunteer firefighter named Smith Gardener. 
*'''Charlie''' is Dave's father. He died before the stories began and in the story ''Fish Head'', Dave mentions that Charlie died just before Sam was born. Charlie was musically talented and introduced both his children to music. He would wake them up singing each morning and would often have local musicians over to the house for an informal jam session.  
*'''Annie''' is Dave's younger sister. The age gap is never clear but seems to be about five years. Annie is a concert violinist and has a daughter, Molly. When she is on tour one summer, she asks Dave and Morley to care for Molly, who is ten years old at the time. Galway was given to Dave and Morley by Annie as she could not keep a cat while touring. 
*'''Helen''' is Morley's mother. In the initial stories, Helen (sometimes called Nancy) is still married to Morley's father. However, in the later stories, it is mentioned that Morley's father has died. Helen briefly lives with the family when Morley is concerned about her ability to live alone. The arrangement ends after only a few months when Helen moves into a retirement community.
*'''Aunt Dorothy''' is a cousin of Margaret. She lives in London, England, and has never married or had children. She is known for her brusqueness and impulsiveness about travel, having invited herself to go camping with Dave and his family, and having sent Stephanie, unannounced, a prepaid air ticket to London so she could visit.

===Other recurring characters===
* '''Jim Scoffield''' is Dave's closest friend and neighbour, although he has a tendency to be present at Dave's most awkward moments, such as Dave's infamous incident with the Christmas turkey. Jim is originally from the [[Annapolis Valley]], Nova Scotia. He is described as a "confirmed bachelor" and owns a cat named Molly. He briefly dated one of Dave's cousins and a romantic relationship with his friend and cat sitter has been hinted at.  
* '''Bert and Mary Turlington''' live next door to Dave and Morley. They have three children, Adam, who is younger than Stephanie, and twins Chris and Christina, who are older than Sam. Bert is a talkative [[criminal law]]yer, while Mary is a [[chartered accountant]] and Dave's neighbourhood nemesis. Her meticulous perfectionism and fixed ideas of an ordered life make her Dave's opposite; her plans and projects are frequently upended by Dave's propensity for causing chaos. Mary resents that Dave loves his job, considering his happy-go-lucky lifestyle sanctimonious and phony, while Dave thinks that Mary is stiff and intimidating.'They have a teacup Pomeranian dog named Tissue. 
* '''Ted and Polly Anderson''' are an elegant upper-class couple who throw an annual Christmas house-party. Polly is the neighbourhood's "Martha Stewart" figure and "perfect home-maker". Morley often feels inadequate around Polly. Ted is an avid cyclist.
* '''Carl and Gerta Lowbeer''' are neighbours of Morley and Dave. They are somewhat older, Carl having recently retired from his job as an [[engineer]]. He keenly missed the company fishing trip and has since started to attend the fishing tourney with Dave and other neighbours as part of his team. Since retirement, Carl has begun to take philosophy courses. Carl once asked Dave to "babysit" his sourdough bread starter, while he and Gerta were on holiday. Gerta has been revealed to be a keen birdwatcher and is a close friend of Morley. 
* '''Morty and Irene Zuckerman''' live on Brock Avenue, a five-minute walk away. Not particularly close friends, Morty's surprise invitation to dinner one night is the subject of the story "Late Date".
*'''Emir and Rashida Chudary''' are new residents in Dave and Morley's neighbourhood. Emir considers Dave to be an imbecile &amp; their families do not socialize much. However, Emirs' attitude softens after Rashida recruits Dave to help their young daughter Fatima overcome her [[nightmares]], a problem Dave's daughter Stephanie also suffered from at a young age. Their lack of understanding of Canadian gift giving expectations at Christmas sparks a mass gift exchange in the neighbourhood on one occasion. Sam and his friend Murphy occasionally babysit Fatima one summer, which prompts the creation of the infamous water slide.  
* '''Eugene and Maria Conte''' are an elderly couple who live next-door. Eugene loves to garden. His famous fig tree is the focus of a story. Maria loves to dote on the children. They have a son, Anthony Thomas, who lives in London. They have always called Anthony Thomas "Tony" but he has been going by his middle name ever since moving to England. Eugene is originally from a village in Calabria called Rendi in Fiori. Sam and Eugene are friends, and Sam helps with the emails that Tony sends them. Eugene makes home-made wine, and has offered it to Sam on several occasions. He tends to smoke cigars. Dave is often concerned about their well being and their strange habit of only living in the basement of their house but realizes they will ask for help when they need it. Morely first meets Maria when brings over a basket of homegrown tomatoes after Stephanie is born. 
* '''Kenny Wong''' runs Wong's Scottish Meat Pies, a shop located near the Vinyl Cafe. It is largely referred to as a Chinese restaurant, but has once supplied meat pies and deep-fried Mars bars to Sam's birthday party. Kenny is from the town of Burnt Creek. While he was living there, he and his family were excluded by most of the town's citizens because they were the only Chinese family living there. Kenny is known for his austerity and his loyalty to his "regulars". He enjoys pranks just as much as Dave, who is frequently the victim in his jokes, and vice versa.
* '''Murphy Kruger''' is in Sam's class and his best friend. He and Sam cause some minor mischief in several stories and live in their own world. Murphy often motivates Sam to their adventures. Murphy is Jewish and has a Bar Mitzvah in one episode. 
* '''Peter Moore''' is another one of Sam's friends. On the grade 8 trip to Quebec City, Peter spent all of his money on plastic trolls.
* '''Emil''' is a homeless man who resides around the Vinyl Cafe and occasionally asks for money from various people around the neighbourhood. He has his own philosophy of life, and is a lovable misfit who for some time had his own library in a shopping cart and started gardening plants in public places. He once won ten thousand dollars in the lottery, which he quickly gave away to his regular donors.
*'''Dorothy Capper''' is a friend of Dave's, who owns "Woodsworth's Books". Her store is located down the street from the Vinyl Cafe, and Dave frequently stops by just to hang out and ask for advice on some neurotic problem. There have been two stories focused on her in the series. The first one is about her problems with her dog, Stanley, and the second is about her growing disinterest in owning a book store. At the end of the story, her zest for selling books is renewed and she continues to run her store.
*'''Marcus Portnoy''' is the bully at Sam's school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43081">The '''Governor General's Awards in Visual and Media Arts''' are Canadian awards given each year to recognize outstanding contribution to the fields of visual and media arts. The awards were created in 2000 by then [[Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]]. The awards are funded and administered by the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]].

An independent peer jury of senior visual and media arts professionals selects up to seven laureates to be recognized for artistic achievement and one award for outstanding contributions in a professional or volunteer role. Visual and media artists in fine arts (painting, drawing, photography, print-making and sculpture, including installation and other three-dimensional work), applied arts (architecture and fine crafts), independent film and video, or audio and new media are eligible for the annual award. Since 2007, the Saidye Bronfman Award for excellence in the fine crafts is also awarded by this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Awards|url=http://ggavma.canadacouncil.ca/the_awards-les_prix|website=Governor General’s Awards in Visual and Media Arts|publisher=Canada Council for the Arts|accessdate=25 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316093609/http://ggavma.canadacouncil.ca/the_awards-les_prix|archivedate=16 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, each laureate received $25,000 and recognition in the form of an exhibition at the [[National Gallery of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=James|title=Eight Canadian visual and media artists win Governor-General Awards|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/career-excellence-awards-announced/article23579655/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|Aspects}}
'''Marxist aesthetics''' is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of [[Marxism]] to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc.  Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. From one classic Marxist point of view, the role of art is not only to represent such conditions truthfully, but also to seek to improve them (social/socialist realism); however, this is a contentious interpretation of the limited but significant writing by Marx and Engels on art and especially on aesthetics. For instance, [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], who greatly influenced the art of the early [[Soviet Union]], followed the secular humanism of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] more than he followed Marx.

Marxist aesthetics overlaps with the Marxist theory of art. It is particularly concerned with art practice, with the prescribing of artistic standards that are deemed socially beneficial. This materialist and socialist orientation may be seen to invoke (however problematically) the traditional aims of scientific inquiry and the scientific method.

Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Terry Eagleton]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]]. [[Roland Barthes]] must also be mentioned here.

Not all of these figures are solely concerned with aesthetics: in many cases, Marxist aesthetics forms only an important branch of their work, depending on how one defines the term. For example, a Marxist aesthetic may be latent in Brecht's work, but he formulated his own distinct theory of art and its social purpose.

One of the chief concerns of Marxist aesthetics is to unite Marx and Engels’ social and economic theory, or theory of the social ''base'', to the domain of art and culture, the ''superstructure''. These two terms, base and superstructure, became an important dichotomy in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846), which however was not published during their lifetimes. Likewise Marx's early ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'', which, though widely regarded as important for treating the themes of sensuousness and alienation, first appeared only in 1932 (the slated 1846 publication was canceled) and in English only in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, Gary. (2004) "Marx's 1844 manuscripts as a work of art: A hypertextual reinterpretation." ''Rethinking Marxism'' 16.4: 427-441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fay, Margaret, "The Influence of Adam Smith on Marx's Theory of Alienation", ''Science &amp; Society'' Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 129-151, S&amp;S Quarterly, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were therefore unknown to art theorists during, for instance, the often antagonistic debates on art in the early Soviet Union between the [[constructivism (art)|constructivist]] avant garde and the proponents of [[socialist realism]]. The controversy over the unusual design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gary.tedman.pagesperso-orange.fr/index.htm |author=Gary Tedman |title=Economic &amp; Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (as hypertext) by Karl Marx |date=2007 |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the original documents adds another twist.&lt;ref&gt;See notes, Margaret Fay, Gary Tedman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theorists touch upon important themes of Marxist aesthetics without strictly being Marxist aestheticians, [[Joel Kovel]], for instance, has extended the concepts of Marxian ecology which deeply implicates aesthetics. He is also a part of the struggle to bridge the space between Marx and [[Freud]], which has Marxist aesthetics as a central concern.&lt;ref&gt;See the journal ''Capitalism, Nature, Socialism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Current themes within the field include research on the effect of [[mass production|mass-produced]] industrial materials on the sensed environment, such as paints and colors.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Iona. (2007) "Color, Facture, Art and Design." ''Capitalism Nature Socialism'' 18.1: 64-80.&lt;/ref&gt; A strong current within the field involves linguistics and semiotics, and arguments over structuralism and post-structuralism, modernism and post-modernism, as well as feminist theory.

Visual artists, as diverse as [[Isaak Brodsky]] or [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Kasimir Malevich]] or [[Lyubov Popova]], for example, for whom written theory is secondary, nevertheless may be said to be connected to Marxist aesthetics through their production of art, without necessarily declaring themselves aestheticians or Marxists in writing. Likewise, in this spirit [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Richard Paul Lohse]], for example. Such a view could apply to many visual and other artists in many fields, even those who have no apparent and/or voiced connection to Marxist politics or even those ostensibly opposed; in this respect consider [[Anton Webern]].

Probably it would be fair to say that two of the most influential writings in Marxist aesthetics in recent times, and apart from Marx himself and Lukacs, have been Walter Benjamin's essay ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'', and Herbert Marcuse's ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]''. Louis Althusser has also contributed some small but significant essays on art and his theory of ideology also impacts in this area ("[[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses]]").

The field remains polemical, with camps of modernists, post modernists, anti modernists, the avant garde, constructivists, social realists and socialist realists all referencing back to an ostensible Marxist aesthetic theory that would underpin their art practices by grounding an art theory.

[[File:Monumenta spectantia historiam Slavorum meridionalium (1868).jpg|thumb|right|Volume 14 of the ''Monumenta spectantia historiam Slavorum meridionalium'', 1868.]]
'''''Monumenta Slavorum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Monuments of Slavs'') were two series of [[primary source]]s for the history of [[South Slavs]], published by the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]]:
* ''Monumenta spectantia historiam Slavorum Meridionalium'' (MSHSM, "Monuments pertaining to history of the South Slavs")
* ''Monumenta historico-juridica Slavorum Meridionalium'' (MHJSM, "Historical and legal monuments of the South Slavs")
Although they were originally envisaged as a collection of sources for the Medieval history of the South Slavs, they were subsequently expanded to cover later centuries as well. The inspiration for their publication had been the ''[[Monumenta Historica Germaniae]]'', and encouragement for publishing of the series was given by [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]] and his collection of sources known as ''Iura regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae'' ("Rights of the kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia", 1861-1862).&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=41837 |contribution=Monumenta Slavorum |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=November 3, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MSHSM==
After the founding of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1866, the institution under the chairmanship of [[Franjo Rački]] took up the task of publishing historical sources, which would serve as primary sources for the historical interpretation of the Croatian statehood. Publishing of the monuments commenced the following year, primarily of those that confirm the Croatian state law, in the series ''Monumenta spectantia historiam Slavorum Meridionalium''. 
The laws of [[egdotics]] were used in publishing the sources, in accordance with the principles of contemporary European historiography. In the MSHSM series several sets of sources collected into thematic and temporal units by renowned experts such as:
* [[Šime Ljubić]]: ''Listine o odnošajih između južnoga Slavenstva i mletačke republike'', I–X, 1868–91
* [[Franjo Rački]]:''Documenta historiae Chroaticae periodum antiquam illustrantia'' 1877
* [[Radoslav Lopašić]]: ''Spomenici hrvatske Krajine'', I–III, 1884–89
* [[Ferdo Šišić]]: ''Acta comitialia regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae'', I–V, 1912–18
* [[Emilij Laszowski]]: ''Monumenta Habsburgica Regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae, Slavoniae'', I–III, 1914–1917
* [[Vjekoslav Klaić]]: ''Acta Keglevichiana annorum 1322–1527'', 1917
The particularly fertile period was until 1918, when 43 volumes were printed. After long delays, and only periodic publishing, the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts has revived the issuance of MSHSM after 1990, and the last volume was published in 2002. 53 volumes were published in total.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

==MHJSM==
''Monumenta historico-juridica Slavorum Meridionalium'' commenced publishing in 1877 with a series ''Statuta et leges''. The series was intended to cover a variety of sources of legal significance (primarily codes, statutes and [[:en:wikt:terrier|terriers]]), and the rationale for the methods of their publication was given by [[Baldo Bogišić]] in the book ''Pisani zakoni na slavenskom jugu'' (1872). Other editors of the series were:
* [[Radoslav Lopašić]]: ''Urbaria lingua Croatica conscripta'', 1894
* [[Konstantin Vojnović]]: ''Bratovštine i obrtne korporacije u Republici Dubrovačkoj'', I–II, 1899–1900
* [[Ivan Strohal]]: ''Statut i reformacije grada Trogira'', 1915
[[Šime Ljubić]] and other renowned historians. In this series sources collected by Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski and Radslav Lopašić were printed. Only 13 volumes were published in the series, the last one in 1979.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

Although some of the monuments (documents, statutes) have experienced modern editions in the past two decades, both of the series contain valuable and indispensable sources for the study of Croatian and South Slavic history.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

{{History of printing}}

'''Movable type''' (US English; '''moveable type''' in British English) is the system and [[technology]] of [[printing]] and [[typography]] that uses movable [[Sort (typesetting)|components]] to reproduce the elements of a document (usually individual [[alphanumeric characters]] or [[punctuation marks]]) usually on the medium of [[paper]].

The world's first movable type printing press technology for printing [[paper]] [[books]] was made of [[porcelain]] materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] by the inventor [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051).&lt;ref name="needhamb"&gt;{{cite book |last = Needham |first = Joseph |title = The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4 |year = 1994 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |page = 14 |isbn = 9780521329958 |quote = Bi Sheng... who first devised, about 1045, the art of printing with movable type}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, [[Jikji]], was printed in Korea during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty. 

Because of this, the diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily [[East Asia]], although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries, traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years; and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe. Some of these [[medieval European]] accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] and [[Bodleian Library|Oxford University]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = Zhou | year = 1994 | title = Diffusion of Movable Type in China and Europe: Why Were There Two Fates? | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–173 | doi = 10.1177/001654929405300301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the metal movable-type [[printing press]] in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a [[matrix (printing)|matrix]] and [[hand mould]]. The small number of [[alphabet|alphabetic]] characters needed for European languages was an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[antimony]]—and these materials remained standard for 550 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|477017|Printing (publishing)}} Retrieved &lt;/ref&gt;

For [[alphabetic script|alphabetic scripts]], movable-type [[page setting]] was quicker than [[woodblock printing]]. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type in Europe and the use of [[printing presses]] spread rapidly. The printing press may be regarded as one of the key factors fostering the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, Elizabeth L., ''The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and due to its effectiveness, its [[Global spread of the printing press|use spread around the globe]].

The 19th-century invention of [[hot metal typesetting]] and its successors caused movable type to decline in the 20th century.

== Precursors to movable type ==
=== Letter punch and coins ===
[[File:Tetradrachm 5th century BC athens detail.jpg|right|thumb|Movable type traces its origins to the punches used to make [[coin]]s: the reverse face of a [[Tetradrachm]] [[Ancient Greek coinage|Greek coin]] from [[Athens]], 5th century BC, featuring various letters and the owl symbol of [[Athena]].]]

The technique of imprinting multiple copies of [[symbol]]s or [[glyph]]s with a master ''type'' punch made of hard metal first developed around 3000 BC in [[Sumer|ancient Sumer]]. These metal punch types can be seen as precursors of the letter punches adapted in later millennia to printing with movable metal type. [[Cylinder seal]]s were used in [[Mesopotamia]] to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay.&lt;ref name="Clair"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clair|first1=Kate|last2=Busic-Snyder|first2=Cynthia |title=A Typographic Workbook: A Primer to History, Techniques, and Artistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf0iDYCr6w0C|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-39988-0|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used to "sign" documents and mark objects as the owner's property. Cylinder seals were a related form of early typography capable of printing small page designs in relief (''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'') on wax or clay—a miniature forerunner of [[rotogravure|rotogravure printing]] used by wealthy individuals to seal and certify documents. By 650 BC the ancient Greeks were using larger diameter punches to imprint small page images onto [[coin]]s and [[token coin|tokens]].

The [[graphic design|designs]] of the artists who made the first coin punches were stylized with a degree of skill that could not be mistaken for common handiwork—salient and very specific types designed to be reproduced ''ad infinitum''. Unlike the first typefaces used to print books in the 13th century, coin types were neither combined nor printed with [[ink]] on [[paper]], but "published" in metal—a more durable medium—and survived in substantial numbers. As the portable face of ruling authority, coins were a compact form of standardized knowledge issued in large editions, an early mass medium that stabilized trade and civilization throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] world of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].

=== Seals and stamps ===
{{Main|Mudbrick stamp|Cylinder seal|Phaistos Disc}}
[[File:Stamp Lasha Louvre AO27586.jpg|thumb|right|Brick "stamp mold" for the King of [[Larsa]], [[Sin-Iddinam]]. (for Sun God, Utu, [[foundation deposit]] of temple) ]]
[[File:PhaistosDiskLarge.jpg|thumb|right|A replica of the [[Phaistos Disc]]]]

Seals and stamps may have been precursors to movable type. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the [[Mesopotamia]]n cities of [[Uruk]] and [[Larsa]], dating from the [[2nd millennium BC]], has been conjectured by some archaeologists as evidence that the stamps were made using movable type.&lt;ref name="brickstamps"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sass|first=Benjamin|last2=Marzahn|first2=Joachim |title=Aramaic and Figural Stamp Impressions on Bricks of the Sixth Century B.C. from Babylon|year=2010|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-06184-1|pages=11, 20, 160|quote="the latter has cuneiform signs that look as if made with a movable type, and impressions from Assur display the same phenomenon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enigmatic [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Phaistos Disc of 1800–1600 BC has been considered by one scholar as an early example of a body of text being reproduced with reusable characters: it may have been produced by pressing pre-formed hieroglyphic "seals" into the soft clay. A few authors even view the disc as technically meeting all definitional criteria to represent an early incidence of movable-type printing.&lt;ref name="Herbert E. Brekle"&gt;Herbert E.

The [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]] is medieval example of movable type stamps being used.

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, an early woodblock-printed book, AD 868 ([[British Museum]])]]

Following the [[Cai Lun|invention of paper]] in the 2nd century AD during the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]], writing materials became more portable and economical than the bones, shells, bamboo slips, metal or stone tablets, silk, etc. previously used. Yet copying books by hand was still labour-consuming. Not until the Xiping Era (172–178 AD), towards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty did sealing print and [[monotype]] appear. It was soon used for printing designs on fabrics, and later for printing texts.

[[Woodblock printing]], invented by about the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]], worked as follows. First, the neat hand-copied script was stuck on a relatively thick and smooth board, with the front of the paper, which was so thin that it was nearly transparent, sticking to the board, and characters showing in reverse, but distinctly, so that every stroke could be easily recognized. Then carvers cut away the parts of the board that were not part of the character, so that the characters were cut in relief, completely differently from those cut intaglio. When printing, the bulging characters would have some ink spread on them and be covered by paper. With workers' hands moving on the back of paper gently, characters would be printed on the paper. By the [[Song Dynasty]], woodblock printing came to its heyday. Although woodblock printing played an influential role in spreading culture, there remained some apparent drawbacks. Firstly, carving the printing plate required considerable time, labour and materials; secondly, it was not convenient to store these plates; and finally, it was difficult to correct mistakes.

With woodblock printing, one printing plate could be used for tens of hundreds of books, playing a magnificent role in spreading culture. Yet carving the plate was time and labour consuming. Huge books cost years of effort. The plates needed a lot of storage space, and were often damaged by deformation, worms and corrosion. If books had a small print run, and were not reprinted, the printing plates would become nothing but waste; and worse, if a mistake was found, it was difficult to correct it without discarding the whole plate.

=== Ceramic movable type ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇/畢昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;{{cite book |last=Man |first=John |title=The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world |year=2002 |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-7472-4504-5}} A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

{{quote|When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.

If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="tsien"&gt;{{cite book |last = Tsien |first = Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |title = Paper and Printing |volume = vol. 5 part 1 |series = Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China'' |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1985 |ISBN = 0-521-08690-6 |pages = 201–217}}; also published in Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1193, [[Zhou Bida]], an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂雜記》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐憶農《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Bi Sheng's clay types were "fragile" and "not practical for large-scale printing" and "short lived"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sohn |first=Pow-Key |title=Early Korean Printing |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=79 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=96–103 |jstor=595851 |doi=10.2307/595851}}&lt;/ref&gt; was refuted by facts and experiments. Bao Shicheng (1775–1885) wrote that baked clay moveable type was "as hard and tough as horn"; experiments show that clay type, after being baked in an oven, becomes hard and difficult to break, such that it remains intact after being dropped from a height of two metres onto a marble floor. The length of clay movable types in China was 1 to 2 centimetres, not 2mm, thus hard as horn.

There has been an ongoing debate regarding the success of ceramic printing technology as there have been no printed materials found with ceramic movable types. However, it is historically recorded to have been used as late as 1844 in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jixing"&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}

=== Wooden movable type ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051) also pioneered the use of wooden movable type around 1040 AD, as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). However, this technology was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德縣志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (馬称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed the 43-volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大學衍義》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版叢書》) was printed with 253,500 wooden movable types on order of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the [[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]] that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Zhang Yuzhen (張玉珍) |title = 世界上現存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛經《吉祥遍至口和本讀》介紹 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal = Library and Information (《書與情报》) |year = 2003 |issue = 1 |url = http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn = 1003-6938 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate = 2012-04-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展國博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s (required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]) posed a particular difficulty. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one used movable type to produce multiple copies of the same document, the speed of printing would increase relatively.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|201}}

=== Metal movable type in China ===
At least 13 material finds in China indicate the invention of bronze movable type printing in China no later than the 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/|title=韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步|website=news.ifeng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the country producing large-scale bronze-plate-printed paper money and formal official documents issued by the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti-counterfeit markers. Such paper-money printing might date back to the 11th-century [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref name="Jixing" /&gt;{{rp|41–54}}

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of the Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable-type characters, each selected from 1,000 different characters, such that each printed paper note has a different combination of markers. A copper-block printed note dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters – one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' – for the purpose of preventing counterfeiting; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole – apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of the [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of the two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued on a large scale and remained in circulation for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p.&amp;nbsp;273.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] mentions [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|217}}

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages – strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]

During the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref name="tsien" /&gt;{{rp|212}} In 1574 the massive 1000-volume encyclopedia ''[[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]]'' (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) was printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725 the [[Qing Dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5,040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

=== Metal movable type in Korea ===

In 1234 the first books known to have been printed in metallic type set were published in [[Goryeo Dynasty]] [[Korea]]. They form a set of ritual books, ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'', compiled by [[Choe Yun-ui]].

Commenting on the invention of metallic types by Koreans, French scholar Henri-Jean Martin described this as "[extremely similar] to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref name="Briggs 2002 pp.15-23"&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) ''A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet'', Polity, Cambridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. The [[Joseon dynasty]] scholar Seong Hyeon (성현, 成俔, 1439–1504) records the following description of the Korean font-casting process:

{{quote|At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy [clay] of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters [moulds]. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative moulds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt;}}

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for 200 years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable-type invention in Europe—when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong the Great]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters ([[hangul]]) for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible. But Korea's cultural elite, "appalled at the idea of losing [[hanja]], the badge of their elitism", stifled the adoption of the new alphabet.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt;

A "[[Confucianism|Confucian]] prohibition on the commercialization of printing" also obstructed the proliferation of movable type, restricting the distribution of books produced using the new method to the government.&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt; The technique was restricted to use by the royal foundry for official state publications only, where the focus was on reprinting Chinese classics lost in 1126 when Korea's libraries and palaces had perished in a conflict between dynasties.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;Burke&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly debate and speculation has occurred as to whether Eastern movable type spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="christensen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;{{cite book | last = von Polenz | first = Peter | title = Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] of [[Mainz]], Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the [[printing press]]. Gutenberg was a [[goldsmith]] familiar with techniques of [[punchcutting|cutting punches]] for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] using a device called the [[hand mould]].&lt;ref name="meggs58-69" /&gt; Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.

Before Gutenberg, books were copied out by hand on scrolls and paper, or printed from hand-carved wooden blocks. It was extremely time-consuming; even a small book could take months to complete, and because the carved letters or blocks were flimsy and the wood susceptible to ink the blocks had a limited lifespan.

Gutenberg and his associates developed oil-based inks ideally suited to printing with a [[printing press|press]] on paper, and the first Latin [[typeface]]s. His method of casting type may have been different from the hand mould used in subsequent decades. Detailed analysis of the type used in his 42-line Bible has revealed irregularities in some of the characters that cannot be attributed to ink spread or type wear under the pressure of the press. Scholars conjecture that the type pieces may have been cast from a series of matrices made with a series of individual stroke punches, producing many different versions of the same glyph.[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Editing with movable metal – cca. 1920]]

&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the method used by Gutenberg involved using a single punch to make a mould, but the mould was such that the process of taking the type out disturbed the casting, creating variants and anomalies, and that the punch-matrix system came into use possibly around the 1470s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open2.net/home/view?entityID=15599&amp;jsp=themed_learning%2Fexpanding_viewer&amp;sessionID=-1161756493749&amp;entityName=object |title=What Did Gutenberg Invent?—Discovery |accessdate=2006-10-25 |year=2006 |publisher=BBC / [[Open University]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This raises the possibility that the development of movable type in the West may have been progressive rather than a single innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Gutenberg's movable-type printing system spread rapidly across Europe, from the single Mainz printing press in 1457 to 110 presses by 1480, of which 50 were in [[Italy]]. [[Venice]] quickly became the center of typographic and printing activity. Significant were the contributions of [[Nicolas Jenson]], [[Francesco Griffo]], [[Aldus Manutius]], and other printers of late 15th-century Europe.

== Type-founding ==
[[File:Long S-I Garamond sort 001.png|thumb|upright|A piece of cast metal type, [[Garamond]] style [[long s]] [[i]] [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]. See also: [[Sort (typesetting)|Sort]].]]

Type-founding as practiced in Europe and the west consists of three stages.

; [[Punchcutting]]: If the glyph design includes enclosed spaces ([[counter (typography)|counters]]) then a counterpunch is made. The counter shapes are transferred in relief ([[cameo (carving)|cameo]]) onto the end of a rectangular bar of [[mild steel]] using a specialized [[engraving]] tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|graver]]. The finished counterpunch is hardened by heating and quenching ([[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]), or exposure to a cyanide solution ([[case hardening]]). The counterpunch is then struck against the end of a similar rectangular steel bar—the letterpunch—to impress the counter shapes as recessed spaces ([[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]]). The outer profile of the glyph is completed by scraping away with a graver the material outside the counter spaces, leaving only the stroke or lines of the glyph. Progress toward the finished design is checked by successive ''smoke proofs''; temporary prints made from a thin coating of carbon deposited on the punch surface by a candle flame. The finished letter punch is finally hardened to withstand the rigors of reproduction by striking. One counterpunch and one letterpunch are produced for every letter or glyph making up a complete font.
; [[Matrix (printing)|Matrix]]: The letterpunch is used to strike a blank die of soft metal to make a negative letter mould, called a matrix.
; Casting: The matrix is inserted into the bottom of a device called a ''hand mould''. The mould is clamped shut and molten type metal alloy consisting mostly of [[lead]] and [[tin]], with a small amount of [[antimony]] for hardening, is poured into a cavity from the top. Antimony has the rare property of expanding as it cools, giving the casting sharp edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Answers.com page on antimony | work = McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | date = 2005-01-01 | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/antimony | accessdate = 2009-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the type metal has sufficiently cooled, the mould is unlocked and a rectangular block approximately 4 centimeters long, called a ''[[sort (typesetting)|sort]]'', is extracted. Excess casting on the end of the sort, called the ''tang'', is later removed to make the sort the precise height required for printing, known as "type height".

The type-height was quite different in different countries. The Monotype Corporation Limited in London UK produced moulds in various heights:

* {{convert|0.918|in|mm}} : United Kingdom, Canada, U.S.
* {{convert|0.928|in|mm}} : France, Germany, Switzerland and most other European countries
* {{convert|0.933|in|mm}} : Belgium height
* {{convert|0.9785|in|mm}} : Dutch height

A Dutch printers manual mentions a tiny difference between French and German Height:&lt;ref&gt;Blankenstein A.H.G., Wetser Ad: ''Zetten, uitgebreide leerstof, deel 1'', p.&amp;nbsp;26, Edecea, Hoorn, The Netherlands, 5th edition, (~1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

* 62.027 points Didot = {{convert|23.30|mm}} = English height
* 62.666 points Didot = {{convert|23.55|mm}} = French height
* 62.685 points Didot = {{convert|23.56|mm}} = German height
* 66.047 points Didot = {{convert|24.85|mm}} = Dutch Height
 
Tiny differences in type-height will cause quite bold images of characters.

At the end of the 19th century there were only two typefoundries left in the Netherlands: [[Joh. Enschedé|Johan Enschedé &amp; Zonen]], at [[Haarlem]], and [[Amsterdam Type foundry|Lettergieterij Amsterdam, voorheen Tetterode]]. They both had their own type-height: Enschedé: 65 23/24 points Didot, and Amsterdam: 66 1/24 points Didot. Enough difference to prevent a combined use of fonts of both typefoundries: Enschede would be to light, or otherwise the Amsterdam-font would print rather bold. A perfect way of binding clients.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.W.Oly, de grondslag van het bedrijf der lettergieterij Amsterdam, formerly N.Tetterode, edition: Stichting Lettergieten 1983, Westzaan, pag. 82-88&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 the Dutch governmental "Algemeene Landsdrukkerij", later: "State-printery" (Staatsdrukkerij) decided during a reorganisation to use a standard type-height of 63 points Didot. "Staatsdrukkerij-hoogte", actually Belgium-height, but this fact was not widely known.

== Typesetting ==
[[File:Metal movable type.jpg|right|thumb|A case of cast metal type pieces and typeset matter in a [[composing stick]]]]
{{Main|Typesetting|Type case}}

Modern, factory-produced movable type was available in the late 19th century. It was held in the printing shop in a ''job case'', a drawer about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high, a yard wide, and about two feet deep, with many small compartments for the various letters and ligatures. The most popular and accepted of the job case designs in America was the [[California Job Case]], which took its name from the Pacific coast location of the foundries that made the case popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amateurpress.org/bundle/camp194.htm National Amateur Press Association], Monthly Bundle Sample, Campane 194, ''The California Typecase'' by Lewis A. Pryor (Edited)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer or case that was located above the case that held the other letters; this is why capital letters are called "upper case" characters while the non-capitals are "lower case".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ewSglB2f7qYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=capital+uppercase+typesetting+term&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6tr9ttWJM7&amp;sig=XVBi9LMycbrSTaYzeK4fPI7r8ZI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result Glossary of Typesetting Terms], by Richard Eckersley, Charles Ellerston, Richard Hendel, Page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Compartments also held spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to separate words and fill out a line of type, such as ''em'' and ''en'' quads (''quadrats'', or spaces. A ''quadrat'' is a block of type whose face is lower than the printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter "M" – as wide as it was high – while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital "N").

Individual letters are assembled into words and lines of text with the aid of a [[composing stick]], and the whole assembly is tightly bound together to make up a page image called a ''forme'', where all letter faces are exactly the same height to form a flat surface of type. The forme is mounted on a [[printing press]], a thin coating of viscous ink is applied and impressions made on paper under great pressure in the press. "Sorts" is the term given to special characters not freely available in the typical type case, such as the "@" mark.

== Metal type combined with other methods ==
[[File:Ceramic type 02.jpg|thumb|Ceramic type from the collections of [[University of Reading]].]]

Sometimes it is erroneously stated that printing with metal type replaced the earlier methods. In the industrial era printing methods would be chosen to suit the purpose. For example, when printing large scale letters in posters etc. the metal type would have proved too heavy and economically unviable. Thus, large scale type was made as carved wood blocks as well as ceramics plates.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., Purvis, Alston W. "Graphic Design and the Industrial Revolution" ''History of Graphic Design''. Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in many cases where large scale text was required, it was simpler to hand the job to a [[Sign painting|sign painter]] than a printer.
Images could be printed together with movable type if they were made as [[woodcut]]s or [[wood engraving]]s as long as the blocks were made to the same type height. If [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] methods, such as copper plates, were used for the images, then images and the text would have required separate print runs on different machines.

The term '''percent for art''' refers to a program, often a [[city ordinance]], where a fee, usually some percentage of the project cost, is placed on large scale development projects in order to fund and install [[public art]].  The details of such programs vary from area to area. Percent for art programs are used to fund [[public art]] where private or specialized funding of public art is unavailable. Similar programs, such as "[[art in public places]]", attempt to achieve similar goals by requiring that public art be part of a project, yet they often allow developers to pay in-lieu fees to a public art fund as an alternative.

==History==

=== Europe ===
In [[Finland]] the percent for art principle was first introduced as an official government policy in connection with the construction of the Finnish Parliament building in the early 1930s, though it was not implemented until 1939. In 1956 the government extended the principle to all public buildings, and during the 1960s individual municipalities also drew up their own schemes. In 1981 the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities, an advocate for all Finnish municipalities and regions, recommended extending the principle to all aspects of the urban environment. In 1991 the City of Helsinki became the first city to adopt the policy for all building projects, which led to a vast growth in urban art, even within suburban areas. in 2015 the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture funded a handbook available to the sponsors of public art work under the title "The Handbook of the Percent For Art Principle in Finland", which is also published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prosenttiperiaate.fi/wp-content/uploads/The_Handbook_of_the_Percent_for_Art_Principle_in_Finland_For_Commissioners.pdf|title=The Handbook of the Percent For Art Principle in Finland|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland (country)|Ireland]], one percent of the cost of all public works can be allocated to commissioning a work of art. The scheme was introduced in 1978, and extended to all government departments in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicart.ie/main/commissioning/funding/per-cent-for-art/|title=Per Cent for Art Scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=publicart.ie|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicart.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF_Folder/Public_Art_Per_Cent_for_Art.pdf|title=PUBLIC ART: PER CENT FOR ART SCHEME GENERAL NATIONAL GUIDELINES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=publicart.ie|format=PDF|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
From 1934 to 1943, the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]] in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] followed a policy requiring one percent of the cost of federal buildings to be applied toward art and decoration.  In 1959, [[Philadelphia]] adopted the first such municipal ordinance in the United States.&lt;ref name="Abernethy1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd M.

Stein, [http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=10645 "Seattle's 1 Percent for Art Program"], ''[[HistoryLink]]'', October 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FinkelpearlAcconci2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Finkelpearl|author2=Vito Acconci|title=Dialogues in Public Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T51F3wYglToC&amp;pg=PT34|date=January 2001|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-56148-8|pages=20–21 &amp; passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger L.

More than half of the states now maintain percent-for-art programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaa-arts.org/Research/Key-Topics/Public-Art/State-Percent-for-Art-Programs.php "State Percent for Art Programs"], National Association of State Arts Agencies (accessed 2015-07-03).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the federal level, since 1963 the [[General Services Administration]] has maintained the Art in Architecture Program, which allocates one-half of one percent of construction cost for art projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104456 "Art in Architecture Program"], [[General Services Administration]] (accessed 2015-07-03).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki
 |accessdate=2018-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/classics/resources/poetics/poettran.htm
 |title=Aristotle's Poetics, adapted from the translation by S.H. Butcher
 |accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

'''''Primary Colors''''' is a 1998 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Mike Nichols]]. The screenplay by [[Elaine May]] was [[film adaptation|adapted]] from the novel [[Primary Colors (novel)|''Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics'']], a ''[[roman à clef]]'' about [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992]], which was originally published anonymously, but in 1996 was revealed to have been written by journalist [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]], who had been covering Clinton's campaign for ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref name="what the"&gt;{{cite news|title= What the Movie Gets —and What It Doesn't |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=David Lauter|date=March 15, 1998|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/15/entertainment/ca-28949|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="just what"&gt;{{cite news|title= Just What He Didn't Need Right Now; Movies: Will 'Primary Colors,' a thinly veiled slice of presidential life, hurt or help Bill Clinton? |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=Faye Fiore|date=March 2, 1998|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/02/entertainment/ca-24508|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E6DB1F39F93BA25754C0A960958260 Columnist's Mea Culpa: I'm Anonymous], Doreen Carvajal, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The film starred [[John Travolta]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Maura Tierney]], [[Larry Hagman]] and [[Adrian Lester]]. 

It was critically acclaimed but was a [[box office bomb]], earning $52 million from a $65 million budget. Bates was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance, and May was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].

==Plot==
Young political idealist and grandson of a civil rights leader Henry Burton ([[Adrian Lester]]) is recruited to join the campaign of Jack Stanton ([[John Travolta]]), a charismatic Southern governor who is trying to win the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for [[President of the United States]]. Henry is impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton ([[Emma Thompson]]); ruthless political strategist Richard Jemmons ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]); intelligent and attractive spokeswoman Daisy Green ([[Maura Tierney]]); and sly political operator Howard Ferguson ([[Paul Guilfoyle]]) as they journey to [[New Hampshire]], the first state to hold a [[New Hampshire primary|presidential primary]].  
  
After Stanton completes an impressive debate performance against his Democratic rivals, Henry’s ex-girlfriend shows up to question Stanton about his arrest for an anti-war protest during the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in Chicago. In addition it's revealed that Stanton called a U.S. senator to help him get released then Stanton persuaded the mayor of Chicago to have his police record expunged. The team becomes worried that Stanton’s past indiscretions may be used against him by the press and his political opponents. They hire Jack and Susan's old friend, tough but unbalanced Libby Holden ([[Kathy Bates]]), to investigate allegations that could be used by Stanton's political opponents to undermine his candidacy such as Stanton's notorious womanizing. One of Stanton's mistresses and Susan's hairdresser, Cashmere McLeod ([[Gia Carides]]), produces secret taped conversations between them to prove they had an affair. Henry discovers that the tapes have been doctored, so Libby tracks down the man responsible for the tapes and forces him at gunpoint to confess his guilt in a signed letter to the American public.

The campaign is then rocked by a fresh allegation when Stanton's old friend, "Big Willie" McCollister ([[Tommy Hollis]]) approaches Henry to tell him that his 17-year-old daughter Loretta (who worked for the Stantons as a babysitter) is pregnant and that Stanton is the father. Henry and Howard tell Willie he must allow his daughter to undergo an [[amniocentesis]] to determine paternity. Although they convince Willie to remain silent on the issue, Henry is nonetheless sickened and disillusioned with the experience.

Realizing the campaign is falling behind in the polls, Stanton's team adopt a new strategy. Stanton begins going on the offensive by attacking his nearest rival, Senator Lawrence Harris ([[Kevin Cooney]]) for casting anti-[[Israel]] votes and favoring cuts in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Harris confronts Stanton during a radio talk show in Florida but suffers two heart attacks after the encounter. He suffers a medical setback, subsequently withdraws from the race, and is replaced by his friend, former Florida governor Fred Picker ([[Larry Hagman]]). Picker's wholesome, straight-talking image proves an immediate threat to the Stanton campaign.  
 
Jack and Susan send Henry and Libby on an [[opposition research]] mission on Picker's past. They discover from his ex-brother-in-law, Eduardo Reyes ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), that Picker had a [[cocaine]] addiction as governor, which led to the disintegration of his first marriage. They also meet with Picker's cocaine supplier Lorenzo Delgado ([[John Vargas]]), with whom Picker had a [[homosexual]] affair. Not expecting the information to ever be used, Libby and Henry share their findings with Jack and Susan, but are dismayed when they both decide to leak the information to the press. Libby says that if Jack does so, she will reveal that he tampered with the results of the paternity test, proving that he slept with Willie's daughter. Libby commits suicide after she realizes she spent her life idealizing Jack and Susan only to learn how flawed they truly are. Racked with guilt over Libby's death, Stanton takes the incriminating information to Picker, and apologizes for seeking it out. Picker admits to his past indiscretions, and agrees to withdraw from the race and to endorse Stanton. Henry intends to quit the campaign, admitting he has become deeply disillusioned with the whole political process. Stanton begs Henry to reconsider, persuading him that the two of them can make history.

Months later, President Stanton is dancing at the Inaugural Ball with [[First Lady]], Susan. He shakes the hands of all his campaign staff, the last of whom is Henry.

==Production==

Following the publication of the book in 1996, director Mike Nichols paid more than $1 million for the screen rights.&lt;ref name="contemporary"/&gt; The film was scripted by Elaine May, who had collaborated with Nichols in a [[Nichols and May|comedy double-act]] in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref name="Nichols &amp; May"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kashner|first1=Sam|title=Who’s Afraid Of Nichols &amp; May?|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/nichols-and-may-reunion-exclusive|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Cannes Festival]], Thompson said she did not base her performance on [[Hillary Clinton]], while Travolta said he based his on several presidents, but mostly on [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="travolta reveals"/&gt;

Nichols was criticized for cutting an interracial love scene from the final version of the film. He responded that he had removed the scene because of unfavorable reactions from a preview audience.&lt;ref name="travolta reveals"/&gt;

The film also generated controversy for its depiction of a Clinton-like character as it was also released close to the [[Lewinsky scandal]].&lt;ref name="what the"/&gt;&lt;ref name="american themes"&gt;{{cite news|title= With Its American Themes, Can 'Primary Colors' Cash In Abroad? |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 16, 1998|author=Mark Saylor|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/16/entertainment/ca-50153|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="they all"&gt;{{cite news|title= They All Have a Secret |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 15, 1998|author=Patrick Goldstein|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/15/entertainment/ca-28947|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cinema"&gt;{{cite news|title= Cinema: True Colors|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Richard Corliss and Jeffrey Ressner|date=March 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tale of"&gt;{{cite news|title= Cinema: Tale Of Two Bills|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Eric Pooley|date=March 16, 1998|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987986,00.html|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received a positive reception from critics. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety']]''s reviewer called it a "[[film à clef]]" and said that the American public was likely to accept it as a factual account because it so closely mirrored real life characters and events.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave high marks to the movie, noting Travolta's close mirroring of [[Bill Clinton]], but describing Thompson's character as actually not based on [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name= "inspired insinuation"/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called Travolta "Clintonian".&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' gave accolades to the character portrayals of Bill and Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name="landslide"/&gt; Syndicated reviewer [[Roger Ebert]] said the movie was "insightful and very wise about the realities of political life"&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; and ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' said the film was a "nuanced dissection of how real American politics work".&lt;ref name="landslide"/&gt;

In a negative review, Jeff Vice of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' wrote that the last half of the movie dragged, Travolta's performance seemed more like an impersonation than actual acting, the movie lacked subtlety or depth, and it was loaded with cheap and obvious jokes. Nevertheless, Vice wrote that "solid support is provided by Maura Tierney, Larry Hagman, and Stacy Edwards".&lt;ref name="deseret"/&gt;

''Primary Colors'' currently holds an 80% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 75 reviews.

===Box office===
The film earned a disappointing box office gross,&lt;ref name="grease beats"&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Grease' Beats 'Primary' but Doesn't Rock the Boat; Box office: Revived musical enjoys a $13-million opening, but Oscar-winner 'Titanic' is No. 1 for the 15th straight weekend. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 30, 1998|author=Robin Rauzi|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/30/entertainment/ca-34154|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tail titanic"&gt;{{cite news|title= Travolta Films Tail 'Titanic' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 31, 1998|author=Robert W.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack album, featuring music by and produced by [[Ry Cooder]], was released in March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard - 28 Mar 1998 - Page 55 "VARIOUS ARTISTS Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack Primary Colors; Music By Ry Cooder"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holger Petersen - Talking Music - 2011 -Page 296 "Movie soundtracks, however, kept him creative, at home, and paying the bills. ... That led to Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas; Buena Vista Social Club), Louis Malle (Alamo Bay), and Mike Nichols (Primary Colors) asking him to soundtrack their films"&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulsens's drum has a typical northern Sami pattern, with several separate levels representing the different layers of spiritual worlds. The Bindal drum has a typical southern Sami decoration: a [[rhombus]] shaped sun symbol in the center, with other symbols around the sun, representing people, animals, landscape and deities.}}

A '''Sami drum''' is a shamanic [[ceremonial drum]] in the culture of the [[Sami people]] of Northern Europe. Sami ceremonial drums have two types: a bowl drum in which the [[drumhead]] is strapped over a [[burl]], and a [[frame drum]] in which the drumhead stretches over a thin ring of [[bentwood]]. Both variations are oval-shaped. The drumhead is fashioned from reindeer [[hide (skin)|hide]].

In [[Sami shamanism]], the [[noaidi]] – the Sami [[shaman]] – used the drum to get into a trance, or to obtain information from the future or about other places. The drum was held in one hand, and operated with the other hand. While the noaidi was in trance, his ''free spirit'' left his body to visit the spiritual world or other places. When used for [[divination]] purposes, the drum was used together with a drum hammer and an [[vuorbi]] (index or pointer) made of brass or horn. Answers could be interpreted from where the vuorbi stopped on the membrane, and at which symbols.

The patterns on the drum membrane reflect the world view of the owner and his family, both in religious and worldly matters, such as reindeer herding, hunting, householding and relations to their neighbours and to the non-Sami community.

Many drums were taken out of their use and Sami ownership during the 18th century. A large number of drums were confiscated by Sami missionaries and other officials as a part of an intensified Christian mission towards the Sami. Other drums were bought by collectors. Between 70 and 80 drums are preserved; the largest collection of drums is at the [[Nordic Museum]], Stockholm.

== Terminology ==
[[File:Lapponia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johannes Schefferus|Schefferus]]' ''Lapponia'' (1673) is an early source to Sami culture and religion]]
[[File:Sami drum from lule lappmark bottom.jpg|thumb|upright|Bowl drum]]
[[File:Freavnantjahke gievrie Koch 2005 04.TIF|thumb|upright|Frame drum ([[Freavnantjahke gievrie]]) with cords]]
The [[northern Sami]] terms are ''goavddis'', ''gobdis'' or ''meavrresgárri'', [[Lule Sami language|lule Sami]] term is ''goabdes'' and the [[Southern Sami language|southern Sami]] term is ''gievrie''. {{lang-no|runebomme}}, {{lang-sv|nåjdtrumma}};&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous 1723/1903&lt;/ref&gt; in English it is also known as "rune drum" and "Sami shamanic drum".

The northern Sami name ''goavddis'' describes a bowl drum, while the southern Sami name ''gievrie'' describes a frame drum, coherent to the distribution of these types of drums.&lt;ref name="RKHR"&gt;Kjellström &amp; Rydving 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another northern Sami name, ''meavrresgárri'', is a compound word: ''meavrres'' from ''meavrit'' and Finnish ''möyriä'' ("kick, roar, mess"), and ''gárri'' from Norwegian ''kar'' ("cup, bowl").&lt;ref name="AS12"&gt;Solbakk 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The common Norwegian name for the drum, ''runebomme'', is based on the earlier misunderstanding that the symbols on the drum were [[runes]].&lt;ref name="LIHBO"&gt;Lars Ivar Hansen and Bjørnar Olsen. ''Samenes historie, fram til 1750''. Cappelen, 2004. {{ISBN|978-82-02-19672-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested new names in Norwegian are ''sjamantromme'' ("shaman drum")&lt;ref name="LP10"&gt;Pareli 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or ''sametromme'' ("Sami drum").&lt;ref name="VSM"&gt;[http://www.saivu.com/web/index.php?sladja=77&amp;vuolitsladja=85&amp;giella1=eng The drum] in the web exhibition «Sami faith and mythology»; from  [[Várjjat Sámi Musea]]&lt;/ref&gt; The early Swedish name ''trolltrumma'' is now considered derogatory, and was based on an understanding of Sami religion as [[witchcraft]] ("trolldom"). In his ''[[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]]'' (ca 1840) [[Lars Levi Laestadius|Læstadius]] used the term ''divination drum'' ("spåtrumma"). In Swedish today, one uses terms as ''the Sami drum'' ("den samiska trumman")&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SAMERSE"/&gt; or simply ''the drum'' ("trumman"),&lt;ref name="SAMERSE"&gt;[http://www.samer.se/1209 Trumman]; samer.se&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the context.

== Sources to the history of the drums ==
There are three categories of sources to the history of the drums. First the drums themselves, and what might be interpreted from them. Secondly the reports and treatises on Sami topics during the 17th and 18th centuries, written by Swedish and Dano-Norwegian priests, missionaries and other civil servants. The third category are the sporadic references to drums and Sami shamanism in other sources.

The oldest mentioning of a Sami drum and shamanism is in the anonymous ''[[Historia Norvegiæ]]'' (late 12th century). Here is mentioned a drum with symbols of marine animals, a boat, reindeer and snowshoes. There is also a description of a shaman healing an apparently dead woman by moving his spirit into a whale.&lt;ref name="histno"&gt;[http://www.love.is/roald/histnorvegia.htm "Finnene", from ''Historia Norvegiæ'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peder Claussøn Friis]] describes a noaidi spirit leaving the body in his ''Norriges oc omliggende Øers sandfærdige Bescriffuelse'' (1632). The oldest desriction by a Sami was made by the Pite Sami Anders Huitlok in 1642 [[:File:Sámi mythology shaman drum Samisk mytologi schamantrumma 005.png|about this drum that he owned.]] Anders also made a drawing; his story was written down by the German-Swedish bergmeister Hans P. Lybecker. Huitlok's drum represents a world view where deities, animals and living and dead people are working together within a given landscape.&lt;ref name="BP02"&gt;Brita Pollan 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The court protocols from the trials against [[Anders Paulsen]] in Vadsø in 1692 and against [[Lars Nilsson (shaman)|Lars Nilsson]] in [[Arjeplog]] in 1691 are also sources.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Granqvist. «Till vem ger du din själ, berättelsen om Lars Nilsson på liv och död». In: ''Fordom då alla djur kunde tala… – samisk tro i förändring''. Åsa Virdi Kroik (ed). Rosima förlag, 2001. {{ISBN|91-973517-1-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, the Swedish government commissioned a work to gain more knowledge of the Sami and their culture. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48) rumours were spread that the swedes won their battles with the help of Sami witchcraft.&lt;ref name="AWJEU"&gt;Westman and Utsi 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Such rumours were part of the background for the research that lead to [[Johannes Schefferus]]' book ''[[Lapponia (book)|Lapponia]]'', published in Latin in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uit.no/northernlights/eng/schefferus.htm Johannes Schefferus (1621 - 1679) in the web exhibit «The Northern Lights Route»] Tromsø University Library, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; As preparations to Schefferus' a number of "clergy correspondences" ("prästrelationer") was written by vicars within the Sami districts in Sweden. Treatises by [[Samuel Rheen]], [[Olaus Graan]], [[Johannes Tornæus]] and [[Nicolai Lundius]] were the sources used by Schefferus.&lt;ref name="HM07"&gt;Mebius 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KK14"&gt;Kuoljok and Kuhmunen 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, the main source are writings from the mission of [[Thomas von Westen]] and his colleagues from 1715 until 1735. Authors were [[Hans Skanke]], [[Jens Kildal]], [[Isaac Olsen]], and Johan Randulf (the ''[[Nærøy manuscript]]''). These books were part instructions for the missionaries and their co-workers, and part a documentation intended for the government in Copenhagen. Late books within this tradition are [[Pehr Högström]]'s ''Beskrifning Öfwer de til Sweriges Krona lydande Lapmarker'' (1747)&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/lapmarker/ Beskrifning öfwer de til Sweriges Krona lydande Lapmarker]; fulltext at Runeberg.org&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden and [[Knud Leem]]'s ''Beskrivelse over Finmarkens Lapper'' (1767) in Denmark-Norway. And especially [[Lars Levi Læstadius|Læstadius]]' ''[[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]]'' (1839–45), which both discusses earlier treatises with an critical approach, and builds upon Læstadius' own experience.

== The shape of the drums ==

=== Wood ===
The drums are always oval; the exact shape of the oval would vary with the wood. The remaining drums are of four different types, within two main groups: bowl drums and frame drums.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt;  
# Bowl drums, where the wood consists of a [[burl]] shaped into a bowl. The burl usually comes from [[pine]], but sometimes from [[Picea abies|spruce]]. The membrane is attached to the wood with a sinew. 
# Frame drums are shaped by [[Heat bending of wood|wet or heat bending]]; the wood is usually pine, and the membrane is sewed to holes in the frame with a sinew. 
# Ring drums are made from a naturally grown piece of pine wood. There is only one known drum of this type. 
# Angular cut frame drums are made from one piece of wood cut from a three. To bend the wood into an oval, angular cuts are made both in the bottom and the side of the frame. Only two such drums are preserved, both from [[Kemi Sami language|Kemi Sami]] districts in Finland. The partly preserved [[:File:Runebomme fra Bjørsvik Nordfold Steigen.jpg|drum from Bjørsvik]] in Nordland is also an angular cut frame drum.

In his major work on Sami drums, ''Die lappische Zaubertrommel'',&lt;ref name="M38"&gt;Manker 1938&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Manker]] lists 41 frame drums, 1 ring drum, 2 angular cut frame drums and 27 bowl drums. Given this numbers, many tend to divide the drums into the two main groups bowl drums and frame drums, seeing the others as variations. Judged by these remaining drums and their known provenance, frame drums seem to be common in the southern Sami areas, and bowl drums seem to be common in the northern Sami areas. The bowl drum is sometimes regarded as a local adjustment of the basic drum type, this being the frame drum.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; The frame drum type has most resemblance to other [[ceremonial drum]]s used by [[indigenous peoples of Siberia]].&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt;

=== The membrane and its symbols ===
[[File:Sami drum distribution of types geography.svg|thumb|350px|A regional typhology of drum patterns, this typhology is with some variations used by [[K.B. Wiklund]] (1930), [[Ernst Manker]]&lt;ref name="M38"/&gt; and Kjellström &amp; Rydving.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt;]]
[[File:Excerpt of sami drum with some typical motives.png|thumb|Excerpt of a southern Sami drum with three typical motives emphasized: the storage house (1), the [[Animal pound|pound]] (2) and the [[Akka (spirit)|goddesses]] ''Sáráhkká'', ''Juoksáhkká'' and ''Uksáhkká'' (3-5).]]
[[File:Sámi mythology shaman drum Samisk mytologi schamantrumma 071.png|thumb|This drum from the lule Sami area has a unique mix of motives: fishes, [[fur]] animals and [[Game (hunting)|game birds]]; thus representing a drum owner who was more of a hunter than a reindeer herder.]]
The membrane is made of untanned reindeer hide. Lars Olsen, who described his uncle's drum, the [[Bindal drum]], in 1885, said that the hide usually was taken from the neck of a calf because of its proper thickness; the sex of the calfe was probably not important, according to Olsen.&lt;ref name="LP10"&gt;Pareli 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols were painted with a creme made from [[alder]]bark.&lt;ref name="AS12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M38"/&gt;

The motives on a drum reflects the world and world view of the owner and his family, both in question of religious beliefs and in modes of subsistence.&lt;ref name="AW01"&gt;Westman 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the drum depicts one's world; showing images of reindeer both domesticated and wild, and the carnivores that threatens the flock. Modes of subsistence are also shown: game animals, boats with fishing nets, and reindeer herding. We see mountains, lakes, people, deities, and the camp site with tents and storages houses. Symbols also represent the threats from the surrounding and expanding non-Sami community: churches and houses.&lt;ref name="AWJEU"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original swedish quote: «Trummans figurer visar den värld man rörde sig i. Här finns de viktigaste djuren avbildade; vild- och tamrenen, rovdjuren som hotar dem. Här blir näringarnas tydliga; jakten, fisket med båt och nät och renskötseln. Fjäll och sjöar syns. Människor, gudar och gudinnor, liksom vistet [leirplassen] med kåtor och förrådsbodar. Figurerna visar och den främmande religionen och samhället som börjat tränga på. Kyrkor och hus vittnar om den til av omvälvning som många levde i.»&lt;/ref&gt; Each owner chose his set of symbols,&lt;ref&gt;[[Louise Bäckman]] said that they «tecknade utifrån sin egen föreställingsvärld», quoted by Kroik 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and there are no known drums with identical sets of symbols.&lt;ref name="HM07"&gt;Mebius 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The drum mentioned in ''[[Historia Norvegiæ]]'', with motives such as whales, reindeer, skies and a boat would have belonged to a sea Sami / coast Sami. The lule Sami drum showed right reflects an owner who found his mode of subsistence more as a hunter than as a reindeer herder.

A typhology based on the structure of the patterns can be divided into three main categories:&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt;
# Southern Sami, characterized by the rhombus shaped sun cross in the center
# Central Sami, where the membrane is divided in two by a horizontal line, often with a sun symbol in the lower section
# Northern Sami, where the membrane is divived by horizontal lines into three or five separate levels representing the different layers of spiritual worlds: heavens, the world of the living and an underworld.

In Manker's oversight over 71 known drums, there are 42 southern Sami drums, 22 Central Sami drums and 7 northern Sami drums.&lt;ref name="M38"/&gt;

The [[Bindal drum]] is a typical southern Sami drum, with the sun symbol in center. Its last owner also explained that the symbols on the membrane were organized in four directions, according to the [[cardinal direction]]s around the sun. South is described as the summer side or the direction of life, and contains symbols for the Sami's life in the fell during summer: the [[goahti]], the storehouse ''njalla'', the flock of reindeer and the pastures. North is described as the side of death, and contains symbols for sickness, death and evil.&lt;ref name="LP10"&gt;Pareli 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Kjellström and Rydving have summed up the symbols of the drums in these categories: nature, reindeer, bears, moose, other mammals (wolf, beaver, small fur animals), birds, fishes, hunting, fishing, reindeer herding, the camp site – with goahti, njalla and other storehouses, the non-Sami village – often represented by the church, people, communications (skiing, reindeer with [[pulk]], boats), and deities and their world. Sometimes even the use of the drum itself is depicted.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The private website thuleia.com has an overview over [http://www.thuleia.com/shamandrum.html Shaman´s drum symbols in Scandinavia], slightly different from Kjellström and Rydving categories.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reindeer herding is mainly depicted with a circular symbol for the [[Animal pound|pound]] that was used to gather, mark and milk the flock. This symbol is found on 75% of the southern Sami drums, but not on any northern or eastern drums.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; The symbol for the pound is always placed in the lower half of the drum. Reindeer are represented as singular line figures, as fully modeled figures or by their antlers.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; The camp site is usually shown as a triangle symbolizing the tent/goahti.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; The Sami storehouse ''njalla'' is depicted on many drums from different areas. The njalla is a small house in [[bear cache]] style, built on top of a cut tree. It is usually depicted with its ladder in front.

Sami deities are shown on several drum membranes. These are the high god ''Ráðði'', the [[demiurge]] and [[God the Sustainer|sustainer]] ''[[Waralden Olmai|Varaldi olmmai]]'', the thunder and fertility god ''[[Horagalles|Horagallis]]'', the weather god ''[[Bieggolmai|Bieggolmmái]]'', the hunting god ''[[Lieaibolmmai|Leaibolmmái]]'', the sun god ''[[Beaivi]]'' / ''Biejjie'', the  [[Akka (spirit)|mother goddesses]] ''Máttaráhkká'', ''Sáráhkká'', ''Juoksáhkká'' og ''Uksáhkká'', the riding ''[[Ruohtta|Ruto]]'' who brought sickness and death, and ''Jábmeáhkká'' – the empress of the death realms.

Some matters from the non-Sami world also appears on several drums. These are interpreted as attempts to understand and master the new impulses brought into the Sami society.&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt; Churches, houses and horses appear on several drums, and drums from [[Torneträsk|Torne]] and [[Kemi]] districts show both the city, the church and the ''lapp commissary''.&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt;

Interpretation of the drum symbols might be difficult, and there are given different explanations to some of the symbols. There has often been assumed that the Sami deliberately gave wrong explanations when they presented their drums to missionaries and other Christian audiences, in order to reduce the impression of heathenry and underline the Christian impact of Sami culture.&lt;ref&gt;Liv Helene Willumsen. ''Dømt til ild og bål, trolldomsprosessene i Skottland og Finnmark''. Orkana forlag, 2013. 978-82-8104-203-2. Chapter on [[Anders Paulsen]], pages 336-353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M50"&gt;Manker 1950&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an opposite assumption that some of the symbols has been overinterpreted as religious motives while they actually represented matters from timely, everyday life.

Håkan Rydving have evaluated the drum symbols from a perspective of source criticism, and divides them into four categories:&lt;ref name="R07"/&gt;
# Preserved drums that were explained by their owners. These are only two drums: [[Anders Paulsen]]'s drum and the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]].
# Preserved drums that were explained by other people, contemporary to the owners. These are five drums, four southern Sami and one ume Sami. 
# Lost drums that were explained by contemporary, either the owner or other people. These are four drums.
# Preserved drums without a contemporary explanation. These are the majority of the 70 known drums.

Rydving and Kjellström have demonstrated that both [[:File:Sámi mythology shaman drum Samisk mytologi schamantrumma 008.png|Olov Graan's drum]] fra Lycksele&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; and the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]]&lt;ref name="R07"&gt;Rydving 2007&lt;/ref&gt; have been ''spiritualized'' through [[Ernst Manker|Manker]]'s interpretations: When the explanations are compared, it appears as if Graan relates the symbols to householding and modes of subsistence, where Manker sees deities and spirits. This underlines the problems of interpretation.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; Symbols that Graan explains as snowy weather, a ship, rain and squrrels in the trees, are interpreted by Manker as the wind god Bieggolmai/Biegkålmaj, a boat sacrifice, a weather god and – among other suggestions – as a forest spirit.&lt;ref name="R07"/&gt; At the Freavnantjahke gievrie there is a symbol explained by the owner as "a Sami riding in his pulk behind his reindeer", while Manker suggests that "this might be an ordinary sleigh ride, but we might as well assume that this is the noaidi, the drum owner, going on an important errand into the spiritual world". On the other hand, one might suggest that the owner of the Freavnantjahke gievrie, Bendik Andersen, is under-communicating the spiritual content of the drum when the symbols usually recognized as the three mother goddesses are explained as "men guarding the reindeer".

Accessories are mainly the drum hammer and one or two vuorbi to each drum. The drums also had different kinds of cords as well as "bear nails".

The drum hammer (nordsamisk ''bállin'') was usually made of horn, and was T- or Y-shaped, with two symmetric drum heads, and with geometrical decorations. Some hammer has tails made of leather straps, or have leather or tin wires wrapped around the shaft.&lt;ref name="M38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaltmuseum.se/search?query=trumhammare Trumhammare]; digitaltmuseum.se&lt;/ref&gt; Manker (1938) knew and described 38 drum hammers.&lt;ref name="M38"/&gt; The drum hammer was used both when the noaidi went into trance, and together with the vuorbi for divination.

The [[vuorbi]] (''index'' or ''pointer''; northern sami ''vuorbi, bajá'' or ''árpa''; southern sami ''viejhkie'') was made of brass, horn or bone, some times even by wood. The vuorbi was used for divination.

The cords are leather straps nailed or tied to the frame or to the bottom of the drum. They had pieces of bone or metal tied to them. The owner of the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]], Bendix Andersen Frøyningsfjell, explained to [[Thomas von Westen]] in 1723 that the leather straps and their decorations of tin, bone and brass were offers of gratitude to the drum, given by the owner as a response to luck gained from the drum's instructions.&lt;ref name="Q1903"&gt;Anonymous in Qvigstad 1903&lt;/ref&gt; The frame of the Freavnantjahke gievrie also had 11 tin nails in it, in a cross shape. Bendix explained them as an indicator of the number of bears killed with aid from the drum's instructions.&lt;ref name="Q1903"/&gt; Manker found similar bear nails in 13 drums.&lt;ref name="M38"/&gt; Other drums had [[baculum]] from a bear or a fox among the cords.&lt;ref name="M38"/&gt;

== Using the drum ==

[[File:Mari Boine2 Warszawa Sep2007b.jpg|thumb|[[Mari Boine]] with a modern drum. Drums are now used both as a musical instrument and as a symbol of Sami identity.]]
Ernst Manker summarized the use of the drum, regarding both trance and divination:&lt;ref&gt;Manker 1938/1950; as quoted by Kjellström &amp; Rydving 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* before use, the membrane was tightened by holding the drum close to the fire 
* the user stood on his knees, or sat with his legs crossed, holding the drum in his left hand
* the [[vuorbi]] was placed on the membrane, either on a fixed place or randomly
* the hammer was held in the right hand; the membrane was hit either with one of the hammer heads, or with the flat side of the hammer
* the drumming started at slow pace, and grew wilder
* if the drummer fell into trance, his drum was placed upon him, with the painted membrane facing downwards
* the way of the vuorbi across the membrane, and the places where it stopped, was interpreted as significant

[[Samuel Rheen]], who was a priest in [[Kvikkjokk]] 1664–1671, was one of the first to write about Sami religion. His impression was that many Sami, but not all, used the drum for divination. Rheen mentioned four matters in which the drum could give answers:
# to seek knowledge about how things were at other places
# to seek knowledge about luck, misfortune, health and unhealth
# to cure diseases
# to learn what deity one should sacrifice unto
Of these four ways of use mentioned by Rheen, one knows from other sources that the first of them was only performed by the noaidi.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; Based on the sources, one might get the impression that the use of the drum was gradually "democratized", so that there in some regions there was a drum in each household, that the father of the household could seek to for advice.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; Yet, the most original use of the drum – getting into trance, seem to have been a speciality for the noaidi.&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt;

Sources seem to agree that in southern Sami districts in the 18th century, each household had its own drum. These were mostly used for divination purposes.&lt;ref name="RK12"&gt;Kristensen 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The types and structure of motives on the southern Sami drums confirm a use for divination. On the other hand, the structure of the northern Sami drum motives, with its hierarchical structure of spiritual worlds, represent a mythological universe it which it was the noaidi's privilege to wander.&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RK12"/&gt;

The drum was usually brought along during nomadic wanderings. There are also known some cases where the drum was hidden close to one of the regulars' campsites. Inside the [[lavvu]] and the [[goahti]], the drum was always placed in the ''boaššu'', the space behind the fireplace that was considered the "holy room" within the goahti.&lt;ref name="AS12"/&gt;

Several of the contemporary sources describe a duality in the view of the drums: They were seen both as an occult device, and as a divination tool for practical purposes.&lt;ref name="ÅVK07"/&gt; Drums were inherited. Among those who owned drums in the 18th century, not all of them described themselves as active users of their drum. At least that was what they said when the drums were confiscated.&lt;ref name="ÅVK07"/&gt;

There is no known evidence that the drum or the noaidi had any role in child birth or funeral rituals.&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt;

Some sources suggest that the drum was manufactured with the aid of secret rituals. However, Manker&lt;ref name="M38"/&gt; made a photo documentary describing the process of manufacturing the physical drum. Selection of motives for the membrane, or the philosophy behind it, are not described in any sources. It is known that the inauguration of the drum where done by rituals that involved the whole household.

=== In trance ===
The noaidi used the drum to achieve trance. He hit the drum with an intense rhythm until he came into a sort of trance or sleep. While in this sleep, his free spirit could travel into the spiritual worlds, or to other places in the material world. The episode mentioned in ''[[Historia Norvegiæ]]'' tells about a noaidi who traveled to the spiritual world and fought against enemy spirits in order to heal the sick.&lt;ref name="histno"/&gt; In the writings of [[Peder Claussøn Friis]] (1545–1614) there is described a Sami in Bergen who could travel in the material world while he was in trance: A Sami named Jakob made his  spiritual journey to Germany to learn about the health of a [[Hanseatic League|German merchant's]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.love.is/roald/friis.htm Excerpt from ''Norriges oc omliggende Øers sandfærdige Bescriffuelse''] (1632) at Roald E. Kristiansen's website ''Samisk religion''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Nicolai Lundius]] (ca 1670), [[Isaac Olsen]] (1717) and [[Jens Kildal]] (ca. 1730) describe noaidis traveling to the spiritual worlds where they negotiated with the death spirits, especially ''Jábmeáhkka'' – the ruler of the death realms, about the health and life of people.&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt; This journey involved a risk for the noaidis own life and health.&lt;ref name="AWJEU"/&gt;

=== Divination and fortune ===
In the writings of both [[Samuel Rheen]] and Isaac Olsen the drum is mentioned as a part of the preparations for bear hunt.&lt;ref name="HM07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt; Rheen says that the noaidi could give information about hunting fortune, while Olsen suggests that the noaidi was able to manipulate the bear to move into hunting range. The noaidi – or drum owner – was a member of the group of hunters, following close to the spear bearer. The noaidi also sat at a prominent place during the feast after the hunting.&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ragnhild Myrstad (1996). ''[http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2008081100031 Bjørnegraver i Nord-Norge: spor etter den samiske bjørnekulten]''. Tromsø University, section of  archeology. (''Stensilserie B''; 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]]'' (1840–45), [[Lars Levi Læstadius]] writes that the Sami used his drum as an Oracle, and consulted it when something important came up. "Just like any other kind of [[fortune-telling]] with cards or [[dowsing]]. One should not consider every drum owner a magician."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by Mebius 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A common practice was to let the [[vuorbi]] move across the membrane, visiting the different symbols. The noaidi would interpret the will of the Gods by the way of the vuorbi.&lt;ref&gt;Aage Solbakk. «Samisk mytologi og folkemedisin = Noaidevuohta ja álbmotmedisiidna = Sámi mythology and folk medicine». In: ''Árbevirolaš máhttu ja dahkkivuoigatvuohta = Tradisjonell kunnskap og opphavsrett''. Published by Sámikopiija, Karasjok, 2007. ([http://www.samikopiija.org/govat/doc/art_aas.pdf pdf])&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices are described for the [[Bindal drum]], the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]] and the [[Velfjord drum]].

=== Women ===
Whether women were allowed to use the drum, have been discussed, and sources are not unanimous. On the one hand, some sources say that women were not even allowed to touch the drum,&lt;ref name="LP10"/&gt; and during migration, women should follow another route than the sleigh that carried the drum.&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt; On the other hand, the whole family was involved in the initiation of the drum.&lt;ref name="LP10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt; Also, the participation of [[joik]]ing women was of importance for a successful soul journey.&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt; May-Lisbeth Myrhaug has reinterpreted the sources from the 17th and 18th century, and suggests that there are evidence of female noaidi, even soul traveling female noaidi.&lt;ref name="HM07"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May-Lisbeth Myrhaug (1997). ''[http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010061108053 I modergudinnens fotspor: samisk religion med vekt på kvinnelige kultutøvere og gudinnekult]'' [In the footprints of the mother goddess, Sami religion with an emphasis on female agents and goddesses]. Pax forlag. {{ISBN|82-530-1866-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drums after the drum time ==
In the 17th and 18th century, several actions were made to confiscate drums, both in Sweden and in Denmark-Norway. [[Thomas von Westen]] and his colleagues considered the drums to be "the Bible of the Sami", and wanted to eradicate their idolatry by the roots by destroying or removing the drums.&lt;ref name="BP02"/&gt; An uncontrolled, idol worshipping Sami were considered a threat to the government.&lt;ref name="AWJEU"/&gt; The increased missionary efforts towards the Sami in the early 18th century might be explained as a consequence of the desire to controle the citizens under the [[Sovereignty Act|absolute monarchy]] in Denmark-Norway, and also as a consequence of the increased emphasis on an individual Christian faith suggested in [[pietism]].

In [[Åsele]], Sweden, collected 2 drums were collected in 1686, 8 drums in 1689 and 26 drums in 1725, mainly of the southern Sami type.&lt;ref name="AW01"&gt;Westman 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas von Westen collected ca 100 drums from the southern Sami district,&lt;ref name="AWJEU"/&gt; 8 of them were collected at [[Snåsa]] in 1723. 70 of von Westen's drums were lost in the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728]].&lt;ref name="RKHR"/&gt; von Westen found few drums during his journeys in the northern Sami districts between 1715 and 1730. This might be explained with the advanced christening of the Sami in north, so that the drums were already destroyed. It might alternatively be explained with diffent use on the drums in northern and southern Sami culture. While the drum was a common household item in southern Sami culture, it might have been a rare object, reserved for the few, educated noaidi in northern Sami culture.&lt;ref name="AWJEU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AW01"/&gt;

Probably the best-known is the ''Linné drum'' – a drum that was given to [[Carl Linnaeus]] during his visits in the northern [[Sweden]]. He later gave it to a museum in [[France]], and recently it was brought back to the [[Swedish National Museum]].&lt;ref name="AhlbäckBergman1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahlbäck|first1=Tore|last2=Bergman|first2=Jan|title=The Saami Shaman Drum: based on papers read at the Symposium on the Saami Shaman Drum held at Åbo, Finland, on the 19th-20th of August 1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PPVXhqa2HoC|accessdate=16 August 2012|year=1991|publisher=Donner Institute for Research in Religious and Cultural History|isbn=9789516498594|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Sami drums are in the collections of the [[British Museum]], including one bequeathed by Sir [[Hans Sloane]], founder of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=sami+drum+wood British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The '''Stationers’ Register''' was a record book maintained by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] of London.  The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including  printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in [[England]].  The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of [[copyright]] law.  The Company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books.

For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries&amp;mdash;for the [[Elizabethan era]], the [[Jacobean era]], the [[Caroline era]], and especially for [[English Renaissance theatre]]&amp;mdash;the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Elizabethan Stage,'' Vol. 3, pp. 164-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work.  One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and [[Nathaniel Butter]] claimed the right to print "A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde." (They paid sixpence.)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' pp. 265 and 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the [[playing company|companies of actors]] appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Much Ado About Nothing]],'' ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]],'' ''[[As You Like It]],'' and ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' were registered, apparently for such a purpose ("to be stayed"), on 4 August 1600. Yet if this interpretation is correct, the strategy to forestall publication had limited success; the first two plays were published later in 1600, and the last in 1601. Only ''As You Like It'' remained out of print at the time. Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 359; Halliday, pp. 216, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1710, the Copyright Act or [[Statute of Anne]] entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register.  The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000.

It made use of highly stylized designs including the [[oculus]] motif.
Another example of these stylized designs are in Morbihan, France. They are commonly known as the Carnac megalith stones. [[Carnac Stones]]

'''''The Painter's Studio: A real allegory summing up seven years of my artistic and moral life''''' (''L'Atelier du peintre'') is an 1855 oil on canvas painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]. It is located in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, France.

Courbet painted ''The Painter's Studio'' in [[Ornans]], France in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Riat|2008|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The world comes to be painted at my studio," said Courbet of the [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] work. The figures in the painting are [[allegory|allegorical]] representations of various influences on Courbet's artistic life. On the left are human figures from all levels of society. In the center, Courbet works on a [[landscape]], while turned away from a nude model who is a symbol of [[Academic art]]. On the right are friends and associates of Courbet, mainly elite Parisian society figures, including [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Champfleury]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], and Courbet's most prominent [[Patronage#Arts|patron]], [[Alfred Bruyas]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 Paris World Fair]]'s jury accepted eleven of Courbet's works for the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]], but ''The Painter's Studio'' was not among them. In an act of [[Promotion (marketing)|self promotion]] and defiance, Courbet, with the help of [[Alfred Bruyas]], opened his own exhibition (The Pavilion of Realism) close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various [[Salon des Refusés]]. Very little praise was forthcoming, and [[Eugène Delacroix]] was one of the few painters who supported the work. Of the painting, Courbet stated that ''The Painter's Studio'' "represents society at its best, its worst, and its average."&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=60"/&gt;

==Description==
The painting was produced during Courbet's involvement with [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] in art in the mid-1800s. Due to the short amount of time Courbet had to paint it, many original plans for the work had to be discarded. The most noticeable example of this is in the background of the painting. On the back wall of the studio in the painting, Courbet planned to paint replications of other works of his. He ran out of time to paint these in their entirety, so he then covered them up with a reddish-brown preparation color, leaving the partially-finished paintings still relatively visible.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gust/hd_gust.htm Gustave Courbet (1819–1877)]", The Metropolitan Museum of Art, accessed September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left side===
The left side of the painting depicts people of everyday life in France.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/latelier-du-peintre-7091.html?no_cache=1 Gustave Courbet, The Artist's Studio]", Musée d'Orsay, accessed September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish man and the Irishwoman were seen on a trip Courbet took to London in 1848, according to a letter Courbet wrote to Champfleury detailing what the painting would look like.&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"/&gt; There is also a "[[Mannequin|lay figure]]"/"crucified figure" directly to the left of Courbet's easel. This figure appears contorted and potentially mangled. Art historians Benedict Nicolson and Georges Riat both interpret this figure as a symbol of the "death" of the art of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts|Royal Academy of Art]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=23, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Riat|2008|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center===
The center of the painting depicts Courbet painting a landscape, a nude female figure, a young boy, and a white cat. On his canvas, Courbet paints the [[Loue|Loue River valley]]. This valley in the [[Franche-Comté]] region of France is a tribute to Courbet's homeland of [[Ornans]], France.&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female figure is based on an 1854 photograph by J.&amp;nbsp;V. de Villeneuve and has been interpreted as a representation of the [[Academic art|art of the Academy]] or as Courbet's Muse for Realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right side===
The right side of the painting depicts a large number of Paris [[elite]]s, including friends of the artist. These are figures who played a role in the development of Courbet's career as an artist, or who inspired him in some way. Portrayals included on this side of the painting include [[Alfred Bruyas]] (a patron of Courbet), [[Champfleury]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], and a wealthy pair of art collectors, among other prominent society figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=52–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of these portraits were copied from previous portraits or from photographs, since the painting was entirely made in [[Ornans]] but the subjects on this side of the painting resided in Paris. For example, the portrait of Charles Baudelaire was directly copied from Courbet's 1847 portrait of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courbet was in written correspondence with Champfleury in regards to this painting (from which much of the interpretation of ''The Painter's Studio'' is derived) and requested a photograph of Proudhon, the philosopher and anarchist, so that he could be included in the painting. It is the photograph Courbet received from Champfleury on which Proudhon's portrait is based.

==Interpretations==
* The meaning of the oxymoron "real allegory" in the subtitle of the painting, as well as Courbet's intent in conjuring this phrase, is debated.
* Courbet chose to paint the Loué River Valley on his canvas-within-a-canvas as an act of defiant [[Parochialism|provincialism]]. He sought to bring a symbol of his home in the [[Doubs]] department of the [[Franche-Comté]] region of France straight into the heart of [[Paris]] and the eyes of Paris' [[socialite]] art viewers and collectors.&lt;ref name="harvp|Nicolson|1973|p=20"/&gt;
* The skull that rests on a copy of the ''[[Journal des débats]]'' is a symbol of the death of the [[Academic art|art of the Academy]].&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"&gt;{{harvp|Nicolson|1973|pp=23–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The cluster of items at the foot of the hunter (on the left), including a guitar, a dagger, a plumed hat, and a buckled shoe, is a symbol of the death of the [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|Romantic art movement]]. It could be a symbol of the death of [[Romanticism#Romantic visual arts|Romanticism]] due to the rising popularity of Realism, or a symbol of the death of Romanticism in Courbet's own oeuvre.&lt;ref name="Nicolson_23_33"/&gt;

'''''The Phantom Carriage''''' ({{lang-sv|Körkarlen}}, literally "The Wagoner") is a 1921 Swedish [[film]] generally considered to be one of the central works in the history of [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish cinema]]. Released on [[New Year's Day]] 1921, it was directed by and starred [[Victor Sjöström]], alongside [[Hilda Borgström]], [[Tore Svennberg]] and [[Astrid Holm]].&lt;ref name="silentera"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/K/Korkarlen1920.html |title=Progressive Silent Film List: The Phantom Carriage |accessdate=2009-04-25|work=Silent Era}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the novel ''[[Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness!]]''  (''Körkarlen''; 1912), by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel prize]]-winning Swedish author [[Selma Lagerlöf]].

The film is notable for its special effects, its advanced (for the time) narrative structure with [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s within flashbacks, and for having been a major influence on the works of [[Ingmar Bergman]].&lt;ref&gt;Bo Florin (2010), "Victor Sjöström and the Golden Age", Mariah Larsson and Anders Marklund (eds), "Swedish Film: An Introduction and Reader", Lund: Nordic Academic Press, pp. 76-85, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as ''The Phantom Chariot'', ''Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness!'' and ''The Stroke of Midnight''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-film/Filmdatabasen/?itemid=3504&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Titles&amp;ref=/templates/SwedishFilmSearchResult.aspx?id%3d1225%26epslanguage%3dsv%26searchword%3dk%C3%B6rkarlen%26type%3dMovieTitle%26match%3dBegin%26page%3d1 Körkarlen—titlar] (in Swedish) at the [[Swedish Film Institute]]  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110614061243/http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-film/Filmdatabasen/?itemid=3504&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Titles&amp;ref=/templates/SwedishFilmSearchResult.aspx%3Fid%3D1225%26epslanguage%3Dsv%26searchword%3Dk%C3%B6rkarlen%26type%3DMovieTitle%26match%3DBegin%26page%3D1 |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On [[New Year's Eve]], dying [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] Sister Edit has one last wish: to speak with David Holm. David, a drunkard, is sitting in a graveyard, telling his two drinking buddies about his old friend Georges, who told him about the legend that the last person to die each year has to drive Death's carriage and collect the souls of everybody who dies the following year. Georges himself died on New Year's Eve the previous year.

Gustafsson, a colleague of Edit, finds David, but is unable to convince him to go see her. When his friends try to drag him there, a fight breaks out, and David is struck on the head with a bottle just before the clock strikes twelve. David's soul emerges from his body as the carriage appears. The driver is Georges.

Georges reminds David of how the latter once lived a happy life with his wife Anna, their two children and his brother, until Georges led him astray. As shown in a flashback that follows, David was jailed for drunkenness. Before being released from prison, he was shown his brother, who had been sentenced to a long term for killing a man while drunk. When David went home, he found the apartment empty. Furious, he became determined to track Anna down and have his revenge.

During his search throughout Sweden, David arrives at a new Salvation Army Mission on New Year's Eve. Maria does not want to answer the bell, as it is very late, but Edit lets him in. Despite his rudeness to her, she mends his coat while he sleeps. The next day, she asks him to return in one year; she had prayed that the first visitor would have good fortune for that period and wants to know the outcome of her prayer. He agrees, but before he leaves, he tears out her patches.

Georges informs David that the promise has to be fulfilled and takes him against his will in the carriage to Edit. In another flashback it is shown how Edit once found David in a bar with Gustafsson and another man. Edit persuaded the other man to go home with his wife and gave Gustafsson an advertisement for a Salvation Army meeting. At the meeting, Gustafsson submitted himself to God, but David remained completely unrepentant. Anna was at the meeting, but David did not recognize her. Later, Anna told Edit who she was, and Edit tried to effect a reconciliation. At first, the couple were optimistic, but soon David's behavior drove Anna to despair once again. One night, Anna pleaded with him not to expose their children to his [[tuberculosis|consumption]] (the same fatal disease Edit caught from him). When he refused, Anna locked him in the kitchen and tried to flee again with their children, but fainted. He broke through the door with an axe, but did not physically hurt her.

When Georges arrives in Edit's room, she begs him to let her live until she sees David again. She thinks she is the one to blame for his magnified sins, as she brought the couple together again. When David hears this, he is deeply moved. He kisses her hands, and when Edit sees his regret, she can die in peace. Georges does not take her, saying others will come for her. He then shows David that Anna, afraid of leaving her children alone after she herself dies of consumption, is planning to poison them and herself. David begs Georges to do something, but Georges has no power over the living. In desperation David prays to god to be given another chance. Then David regains consciousness in the graveyard. He rushes to Anna before she can act. With great difficulty, he convinces her that he sincerely wishes to reform.

==Production==

===Development===
Since 1917, there was a deal between Selma Lagerlöf and [[AB Svensk Filmindustri|A-B Svenska Biografteatern]] to adapt at least one Lagerlöf novel for film every year. Prior to ''The Phantom Carriage'', Sjöström had made three of these adaptions which had all been well received by critics, the audience and Lagerlöf herself. Since all of them had taken place in a rural setting, Sjöström felt that he wanted a change for the fourth and suggested the urban, gritty [[Körkarlen]]. Lagerlöf was initially sceptical about the possibility to adapt the novel's elements of [[occult]]ism and [[mysticism]], and Sjöström was well aware of the difficulties. The script took eight days to finish and in April 1920 Sjöström travelled to Lagerlöf's mansion Mårbacka in [[Värmland]] to present it. After two hours of Sjöström reading loud and performing the whole script by himself, Lagerlöf responded by offering him dinner, which Sjöström took as an approval.&lt;ref name=lagerlof&gt;Grönkvist, Lars "[http://www.selmalagerlof.nu/_filmguld.html Selma Lagerlöf försökte stoppa Stillers filmversion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201064402/http://selmalagerlof.nu/_filmguld.html |date=2009-02-01 }}" (in Swedish) Selma Lagerlöf 150 år&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Korkarlen-screen.png|thumb|left|Double exposures on a gritty [[Landskrona]]-inspired street.]]

===Filming===
Shooting took place from May to July 1920 in the newly started [[Filmstaden]] studios in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]]. The set design was inspired by the southern Swedish town [[Landskrona]], which corresponded to what Lagerlöf had in mind when writing the novel. Lagerlöf's original wish was to film it on location in Landskrona, but Sjöström chose to do it in studio for the technical benefits.&lt;ref name="sfi" /&gt;

===Post-production===
Post-production was famously long and intense due to the extensive use of special effects, developed by cinematographer [[Julius Jaenzon]] and lab executive Eugén Hellman. Double exposures made in the camera (optical printing wasn't available until the early 1930s), had been used before by Jaenzon, already in ''[[Sir Arne's Treasure]]'' from 1919, but were here developed to be far more advanced with several layers. This allowed the ghost characters to walk around in three dimensions, being able to first be covered by an object in the foreground, but when in the same take walking up in front of the object, it would be seen through the ghost's semi-transparent body.&lt;ref name=sfi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-film/Filmdatabasen/?itemid=3504&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Comments&amp;ref=/templates/SwedishFilmSearchResult.aspx?id=1225&amp;epslanguage=sv&amp;searchword=k%C3%B6rkarlen&amp;type=MovieTitle&amp;match=Begin&amp;page=1|title=Den svenska biohösten|website=Svenska Filminstitutet}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty was that the cameras were hand-cranked, meaning that the camera had to be cranked at exactly the same speed in the different exposures for the end result to appear natural.&lt;ref name="lagerlof" /&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 100%, based on {{nowrap|11 reviews}}, with a [[rating average]] of 9/10.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Phantom Carriage (1921) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_phantom_carriage/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] from ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' praised the film, calling it a masterpiece.&lt;ref name="chicagoreader"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=The Phantom Carriage|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-phantom-carriage/Film?oid=1065842|website=Chicago Reader|publisher=Jonathan Rosenbaum|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The film was a powerful influence on the later Swedish film director [[Ingmar Bergman]] who also utilised the figure of Death in ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', where the referring to him as a "strict master" is a reference to ''The Phantom Carriage''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomkvist, Mårten (14 December 2007) "[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/stumma-parlor-lyser-upp-1.706371 Stumma pärlor lyser upp]" (in Swedish) ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''. Retrieved on 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman also cast Sjöström in the leading role for ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', which also features references to the film. Bergman has said that he first saw it at 15 and watched it at least once every year.&lt;ref&gt;Bergdahl, Gunnar (31 July 2007). "[http://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/article558995.ab Ingmar Bergmans utlåtanden om svenska filmer—Körkarlen]" (in Swedish) ''[[Aftonbladet]]''. Retrieved on 14 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The television play ''[[The Image Makers]]'' (2000), directed by Bergman, is a historical drama depicting the making of ''The Phantom Carriage''.

[[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1980 horror film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' features several thematic similarities, as well as the famous sequence where [[Jack Nicholson]] uses an axe to break through a wooden door.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thorellifilm.com/sidaMedia/filmartiklar2_guldalder.htm Den svenska filmens Guldålder]" (in Swedish) Thorellifilm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtracks and home media==
The original screenings didn't have an original soundtrack, instead various pieces by [[Ture Rangström]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelsohn]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]] and [[Max Reger]] were performed by the orchestras.&lt;ref name="sfi" /&gt; For a long time several different soundtracks, generally of low quality, were used for television screenings and video releases. However, in 1998, on demand from the [[Swedish Film Institute]], a new soundtrack was composed by renowned Swedish silent film composer and live pianist [[Matti Bye]], which was highly praised and has been featured on all following VHS and DVD releases.&lt;ref&gt;Pauli, Calle (13 December 2007) "[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/det-varas-for-stumfilmsmusiken-1.539819 Det våras för stumfilmsmusiken]." (in Swedish) ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''. Retrieved on 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], a new soundtrack was composed and performed live by pop icon [[Jonathan Richman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=83 THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE WITH JONATHAN RICHMAN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222121255/http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=83 |date=2007-12-22 }} ''[[San Francisco International Film Festival]]''&lt;/ref&gt; No Region-1 DVD release with this version has been announced.

In 2008, the now defunct Tartan Films (now [[Palisades Tartan]]), under license from the [[Swedish Film Institute]], released a region 2 DVD version of the film, with a newly commissioned soundtrack by the electronic music group [[KTL (band)|KTL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/66977/the-phantom-carriage-ktl-edition.html|title=The Phantom Carriage (KTL Edition) Review|date=5 February 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Criterion Collection]] released a restored version of the film on Blu-ray and DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/films/27630-the-phantom-carriage|title=The Phantom Carriage|website=The Criterion Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial is in the churchyard Burial Ground of the [[Old Presbyterian Meeting House]], a congregation of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] that dates from 1772. The Meeting House is located at 323 South Fairfax Street, in [[Alexandria Historic District|Alexandria's Old Town National Historic Landmark District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legion.org/magazine/64818/unknown-revolutionary|publisher=[[American Legion]]|title=The Unknown Revolutionary|date=October 28, 2011|author=Christopher Lancette|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2012/11/13/less-known-unknown|publisher=[[WETA-TV]]|title=The Less-Known Unknown|author=Will Hughes|date=November 13, 2012|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the memorial==

In 1826, during construction of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, which is located immediately next to the churchyard of the Old Presbyterian Meeting House, the body of an unidentified man, clothed in a Revolutionary War uniform, was unearthed. The body was then reinterred within the current bounds of the Meeting House Burial Ground. The memory that the remains of an unidentified soldier had been reburied at this site was carried into the twentieth century by Mary Gregory Powell (1847-1928), a member of the Meeting House congregation and long-time historian of the Mount Vernon chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. Her father, William Gregory (1789-1875), had come to Alexandria from Scotland in 1807 and had served the Presbyterian Meeting House congregation for many years as an Elder and member of the Church Committee. Mary Gregory had placed flowers on the unmarked grave of the unidentified soldier as a child.

Several events during the 1920s influenced the creation of this memorial to an Unknown of the American Revolution. One was the memorialization of soldiers who had died in [[World War I]] and remained unidentified. On the second anniversary of the signing of the treaty that ended World War I, [[Armistice Day]] 1920, memorials to unknown soldiers were dedicated in [[Great Britain]] and [[France]]. The [[United States]] dedicated its memorial to an unknown soldier of that war at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on November 11, 1921. The sarcophagus-style monument that now sits atop the burial vault of the [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] was added in 1932.

The 1920s also witnessed a surge of interest in honoring and preserving the nation's colonial heritage. Alexandria's earliest Colonial revival preservation effort was the restoration of the Presbyterian Meeting House, which began in 1925. As that project drew to its completion, Mary Gregory Powell contacted John B. Gordon, chair of the Meeting House restoration committee, about honoring the Unknown Soldier. The decision was made to formally mark the gravesite. Leadership in that task was provided by Alexandria's [[American Legion]] Post No. 24.

On February 22, 1928, a temporary marker was placed at the gravesite in conjunction with Alexandria's annual celebration of [[Washington's Birthday|George Washington's birthday]]. Dedication services held that day followed traditions in Alexandria that date from its colonial period – participants initially gathered at [[Gadsby's Tavern]] and then joined in a processional walk through the city's streets to the Meeting House, where the service was conducted. Mary Gregory Powell dedicated the initial wooden temporary marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alexandria Services by C.A.R.

==Dedication of the memorial==

The current memorial was created by the National Society of the [[Children of the American Revolution]] under the leadership of Mrs. Josiah A. Van Orsdel, the Society's president. The memorial was dedicated on Lexington-Concord Day, April 19, 1929, with services in the Presbyterian Meeting House and at the site of the memorial in the churchyard Burial Ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=51968|publisher=[[Alexandria, Virginia]]|title=Historic Cemeteries of Alexandria|date=November 2, 2016|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service in the Meeting House was led by Mrs. Van Orsdel and included two addresses – "Story of the Discovery of the Grave," by John B. Gordon, chair of the Meeting House restoration committee, and "157,000 American Unknown War Dead Here and Abroad," by James W. Good, U.S. Secretary of War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good, James W.

Music was provided by the U.S. Army Band, which joined with the church's historic 1849 Erben organ to lead the singing of the Star Spangled Banner. Following the service inside the Meeting House, the assemblage moved to the gravesite, accompanied by the solemn tolling of the church bell, where numerous wreaths were placed at the foot of the memorial by patriotic and military organizations. The 90-minute program was broadcast live national audience by Washington's local radio station, [[WTEM#WRC Radio|WRC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honors for Soldier of Revolution|newspaper=Alexandria Gazette|date=April 16, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stone Unveiled to an Unknown Soldier|newspaper=Alexandria Gazette|date=April 20, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dedication of Unknown Tomb Today|newspaper=Washington Post|location=Washington, D.C.|date=April 19, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E6DF1530E33ABC4851DFB2668382639EDE&amp;legacy=true|title=Good Dedicates Shaft to Soldier of 1776|newspaper=New York Times|location=New York, NY|date=April 20, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Epitaph==

{{blockquote|Here lies a soldier of the Revolution whose identity is known but to God.  His was an idealism that recognized a Supreme Being, that planted religious liberty on our shores, that overthrew despotism, that established a people's government, that wrote a Constitution setting metes and bounds of delegated authority, that fixed a standard of value upon men above gold and lifted high the torch of civil liberty along the pathway of mankind. In ourselves his soul exists as part of ours, his memory's mansion.}}

'''Tragedy''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | [[Middle English]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Middle French]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Latin]] ''tragoedia'' &lt; {{lang-grc|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tragedy | page = 1637 | first = E | last = Klein | title = A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language | volume = II L–Z | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;}})  is a form of [[drama]] based on human [[suffering]] that invokes an accompanying [[catharsis]] or pleasure in audiences.{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1999 | p = 21 | loc = §2 | ps =: ‘two-fold mood[…] the strange mixture and duality in the affects of the [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[Cult of Dionysus|enthusiasts]], that phenomenon whereby pain awakens pleasure while rejoicing wrings cries of agony from the breast.  From highest joy there comes a cry of horror or a yearning lament at some irredeemable loss.  In those Greek festivals there erupts what one might call a [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] tendency in nature, as if it had cause to sigh over its [[Sparagmos|dismemberment]] into [[Individuation|individuals]]’.}}  While many [[culture]]s have developed forms that provoke this [[paradox]]ical response, the term ''tragedy'' often refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 14–16}}  That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | p = 16}}

From its origins in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]] to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg]]; [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering; [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon; and [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]'s incorporation of tragic pathos in his nonfiction film, ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' (2012), tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 13–84}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}  A long line of [[philosophers]]—which includes [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]],{{Sfn | Benjamin | 1998}} [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]{{Sfn | Deleuze | Guattari | 1972}}—have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.{{Sfn | Felski | 2008 | p = 1}}{{Sfn | Dukore | 1974 | ps =: primary material.}}{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}

In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}{{Sfn | Pfister | 1977}}{{Sfn | Elam | 1980}}  [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization|deterritorialisation]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}

== Origin ==
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]
The word "tragedy" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang |grc|τραγῳδία}}, [[sandhi|contracted]] from ''trag(o)-aoidiā'' = "[[goat]] [[Ode|song]]", which comes from ''tragos'' = "he-goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing" (''[[cf.]]'' "ode"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize&lt;ref&gt;See [[Horace]], ''Epistulae'', II, 3, 220: "Carmino qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum".&lt;/ref&gt; in a competition of [[Greek dances|choral dancing]] or was that around which a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] danced prior to the animal's [[ritual]] [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}  In another view on the etymology, [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] (2nd–3rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was ''trygodia'' from ''trygos'' (grape harvest) and ''ode'' (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0071&amp;id=Literature.AthV1&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide%20 | first = Athenaeus | last = of Naucratis | title = The deipnosophists | publisher = Wisc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 335 BCE (long after the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of [[Classical Greece|5th-century]] [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] tragedy), [[Aristotle]] provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the [[drama]]tic [[The arts|art form]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', in which he argues that tragedy developed from the [[improvisation]]s of the leader of [[Greek chorus|choral]] [[dithyramb]]s ([[hymn]]s sung and danced in praise of [[Dionysos]], the god of wine and fertility):{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}
{{Quote |Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature. | Poetics IV, 1449a 10–15{{Sfn | Janko | 1987 | p = 6}}}}

In the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:
{{Quote |Tragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief ([[catharsis]]) to such [and similar] emotions. | Poetics, VI 1449b 2–3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Aristotle, Poetics, section 1449b | publisher = Tufts | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} A common descent from pre-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] fertility and burial rites has been suggested.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like [[satyr]]s in the original [[dithyramb]]s from which the tragic genre developed.

Scott Scullion writes:  {{quote|There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as "song for the prize goat". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 ("he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: "Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: "They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat"...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Scullion: "Tragedy and Religion: The Problem of Origins", in Gregory (ed.), A Companion to Greek Tragedy, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdTuNrx6z4oC&amp;q=%22There+is+abundant+ancient+evidence%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22There%20is%20abundant%20ancient%20evidence%22&amp;f=false p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 441}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pages = 3–5}}{{Sfn | Goldhill | 1997 | p = 54}}{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 206}}{{Sfn | Styan | 2000 | p = 140}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | p = 104 | ps =: “most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct”.}}  Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 32–3}}{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 444}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pp = 3–5, 33 | ps =: [although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honored their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]].

Athenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a [[satyr play]].{{sfn|Lucas|1954|p=7}} The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the ''[[Oresteia]]'' of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 33–34}}

All of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]'') and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A [[Greek chorus]] danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe ("turning, circling"), antistrophe ("counter-turning, counter-circling") and epode ("after-song").

Many ancient Greek tragedians employed the ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'' as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ''ekkyklêma'' is after the murder of [[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]] in the first play of Aeschylus' ''Oresteia'', when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ''ekkyklêma'' are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the [[mechane]], which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase "[[deus ex machina]]" ("god out of a machine"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BCE, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek tragedy]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}  From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached England.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 36, 47}}  While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].}}  [[Livius Andronicus]] began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies).{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 49}}

From the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}  Nine of [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca's tragedies]] survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 49–50}}  Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}

Seneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at [[elite]] gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective [[soliloquies]]. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of [[Revenge tragedy|revenge]], the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.

Classical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. [[Medieval theatre]] was dominated by [[mystery play]]s, [[morality play]]s, [[farce]]s and [[miracle play]]s. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the [[Padua]]n [[Lovato Lovati|Lovato de' Lovati]] (1241–1309).&lt;ref name=lovati&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lovato-de-lovati/ "Lovati, Lovato de'"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil [[Albertino Mussato]] (1261–1329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the [[Latin verse]] tragedy ''Eccerinis'', which uses the story of the tyrant [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] to highlight the danger to Padua posed by [[Cangrande della Scala]] of [[Verona]].&lt;ref name=muss&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/albertino-mussato// "Mussato, Albertino"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the ''Achilles'' written before 1390 by [[Antonio Loschi]] of [[Vicenza]] (c.1365–1441) and the ''Progne'' of the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Gregorio Correr]] (1409–1464) which dates from 1428–29.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Drama", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', eleventh edition, Vol. '''VIII''', p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515 [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] (1478–1550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy ''Sophonisba'' in the [[vernacular]] that would later be called [[Italian language|Italian]]. Drawn from [[Livy]]'s account of [[Sophonisba]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the ''Oreste'' and ''Rosmunda'' of Trissino's friend, the Florentine [[Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai]] (1475–1525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, ''Rosmunda'' on the ''[[Hecuba]]'' of [[Euripides]],  and ''Oreste'' on the ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' of the same author; like ''Sophonisba'', they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) [[hendecasyllable]]s. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is ''A Castro'', by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet and playwright [[António Ferreira]], written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of [[Inês de Castro]], one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history.   Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: ''Pamfila'' or ''Filostrato e Panfila'' written in 1498 or 1508 by [[Antonio Cammelli]] (Antonio da Pistoia); and a ''Sophonisba'' by [[Galeotto del Carretto]] of 1502.&lt;ref name=hallam&gt;Henry Hallam (1837) [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8JMAAAAcAAJ ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'']. Paris: Baudry's European Library, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gal&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/del-carretto-galeotto-dei-marchesi-di-savona/ "Del Carretto, Galeotto, dei marchesi di Savona"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of [[Sophocles]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Euripides]], as well as comedic writers such as [[Aristophanes]], [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], were available in Europe and the next forty years saw [[Humanism|humanists]] and poets translating and adapting their tragedies.  In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.

The most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the precepts of [[Horace]] and [[Aristotle]] (and contemporary commentaries by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]), although plots were taken from classical authors such as [[Plutarch]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors ([[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the [[Spanish Golden Age]] playwrights [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Tirso de Molina]] and [[Lope de Vega]], many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.

{{see also|English Renaissance theatre|Shakespearean tragedy|Revenge play|Domestic tragedy}}

The common forms are the:
* ''Tragedy of circumstance'': people  are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs
* ''Tragedy of miscalculation'': the [[protagonist]]'s error of judgement has tragic consequences
* ''[[Revenge play]]''

In English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of [[William Shakespeare]] and his [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:
* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''
* ''[[Coriolanus]]''
* ''[[Hamlet]]''
* ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''
* ''[[King Lear]]''
* ''[[Macbeth]]''
* ''[[Othello]]''
* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''
* ''[[Timon of Athens]]''
* ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''
* ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''

A contemporary of Shakespeare, [[Christopher Marlowe]], also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:
* ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]''
* ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''

[[John Webster]] (1580?–1635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:
* ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''
* ''[[The White Devil]]''

===Opera===
Contemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy.  [[Jacopo Peri]], in the preface to his ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' refers to "the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage)."{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 22}}  The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of [[opera]]. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] to about that of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] were not called opera, but ''tragédie en musique'' ("tragedy in music") or some similar name; the ''tragédie en musique'' is regarded as a distinct musical genre.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Graham Sadler, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/44040 "Tragédie en musique"], Grove Music Online (subscription required). Accessed March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some later operatic [[composer]]s have also shared Peri's aims: [[Richard Wagner]]'s concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' ("integrated work of art"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama.{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 178}} [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.

==Neo-classical==
[[File:Talma as Nero in Britannicus by Racine - Delacroix - zeno.jpg|thumb|190px|French actor [[François-Joseph Talma|Talma]] as Nero in Racine's ''[[Britannicus (play)|Britannicus]].]]
For much of the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like ''Medée'' (1635) and ''Le Cid'' (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of ''Le Cid'' was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:
* The stage—in both comedy and tragedy—should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).
* Tragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.
* Although [[Aristotle]] says that [[catharsis]] (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.

Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called "heroic comedies") and many continued to be successes, although the "irregularities" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.

[[Jean Racine]]'s tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of [[pathos]] and amorous passion (like [[Phèdre]]'s love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays ("Esther" and "Athalie") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, ''[[Bérénice]]'', was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.

==Bourgeois==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy|Augustan drama}}

Bourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, [[George Lillo]]'s ''The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell'', which was first performed in 1731. Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''Miss Sara Sampson'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany.

==Modern development==
In [[modernist literature]], the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. [[Arthur Miller]]'s essay "Tragedy and the Common Man" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings.{{sfn|Miller|1949|p=894}} British playwright [[Howard Barker]] has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume ''[[Arguments for a Theatre]]''. "You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool," he insists.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} Critics such as [[George Steiner]] have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In ''The Death of Tragedy'' (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that ‘the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and “realistic” criteria.’ In part, this feature of Shakespeare’s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was ‘so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.’ When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare’s forms are ‘richer but hybrid'.&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, ''The Death of Tragedy'' [1961] (Oxford University Press, 1980; Yale University Press, 1996), p. xiii. See also George Steiner, ‘ “Tragedy.” Reconsidered.’ ''New Literary History'' 35:1 (Winter 2004), pp. 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
===Aristotle===
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his work [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] that
tragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great [[person]] who experiences a reversal of [[luck|fortune]] (''[[Peripeteia]]''). Aristotle's [[definition]] can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but he says that the change from good to bad as in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is preferable because this induces [[pity]] and [[fear]] within the spectators. Tragedy results in a [[catharsis]] (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.

According to [[Aristotle]], "the [[structure]] of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing [[fear]] and [[pity]]—for that is peculiar to this form of art."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Trans. W.H. Fyfe. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1932. Section 1452b&lt;/ref&gt;  This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's ''[[hamartia]]'', which is often translated as either a [[character flaw]], or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to ''hamartanein'', a sporting term that refers to an [[archery|archer]] or [[spear]]-thrower missing his target).&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Amelie Oksenberg. ''[[Literary criticism|Essays on Aristotle’s Poetics]]''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1992. Page 178&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], "The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty."&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt;  The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the [[law]], the [[god]]s, [[destiny|fate]], or [[society]]), but if a character’s downfall is brought about by an external cause, [[Aristotle]] describes this as a [[misadventure]] and not a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics''. Section 1135b&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition ([[anagnorisis]]--"knowing again" or "knowing back" or "knowing throughout") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition "a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate."

In ''Poetics'', Aristotle gave the following definition in [[ancient Greek]] of the word "tragedy" (τραγῳδία):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1449b&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν."

which means ''Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.''

Common usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tragedy the [[narrative|story]] must fit the set of requirements as laid out by ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.  By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions — psychological or religious — which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death.&lt;ref&gt;Chiari, J. ''Landmarks of Contemporary Drama''. [[London]]: [[Jenkins (publisher)|Jenkins]], 1965. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what constitutes a "tragedy", however, is a frequently debated matter.

According to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:

1. Complex, which involves [[Peripety]] and [[Discovery (fiction)|Discovery]]

2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions

3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and [[Peleus]]

4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are [[Graeae|Phorcides]] and [[Prometheus]]

===Hegel===
[[G.W.F. Hegel]], the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to [[epistemology]] and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay "Hegel's Theory of Tragedy," [[A.C. Bradley]] first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the "[[tragic collision]]", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the "[[tragic hero]]" and his or her "hamartia" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone.{{Sfn | Bradley | 2007 | pp = 114–56}} Hegel himself, however, in his seminal "[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:
{{Quote |The heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [''gleichberechtigt''] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity  decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | pp = 567–8}}}}

Hegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: "Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside."{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | p = 572}}

==Similar dramatic forms in world theatre==
===Ancient Indian drama===
The writer [[Bharata Muni]], in his work on [[dramatic theory]] ''[[Natya Shastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Nātyaśāstra'', नाट्य शास्त्र, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE),{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 517}} identified several ''[[Rasa (art)|rasas]]'' (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the [[Sanskrit drama]] of [[History of India|ancient India]]. The text also suggests the notion of [[musical mode]]s or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as [[raga]]s. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes [[gandhara]] or [[rishabha]] are said to provoke "sadness" or "pathos" (''karuna rasa'') whereas [[rishabha]] evokes heroism (''vira rasa''). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text ''[[Dattilam]]'', composed around the same time as the ''Treatise''.

The celebrated ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]], ''[[Mahabharata]]'', can also be related to tragedy in some ways.  According to [[Hermann Oldenberg]], the original epic once carried an immense "tragic force".&lt;ref name = Oldenberg&gt;{{Citation | first = Hermann | last = Oldenberg | author-link = Hermann Oldenberg | year = 1922 | title = Das Mahabharata | place = Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the ''Mahabharata'' into dramatic form.

==Connotations==
The word ''xicalcoliuhqui'' ({{IPA-nah|ʃikaɬkoˈliʍki}}) means "twisted gourd" (''xical''- "gourdbowl" and ''coliuhqui'' "twisted") in  [[Nahuatl]].&lt;ref name=name1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=name2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=name3 /&gt; The motif is associated with many ideas, and is variously thought to depict water, waves, clouds, lightning, a serpent or serpent-deity like the mythological fire or [[Feathered Serpent|feathered serpents]], as well as more philosophical ideas like cyclical movement, or the life-giving connection between the light of the sun and the earth, and it may have been a protection against death, but no single meaning is universally accepted.&lt;ref name=name2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=name11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=name5 /&gt;  It is also possible that the motif represents the cut conch shell which is an emblem of [[Ehecatl]], the wind god, an aspect of [[Quetzalcoatl]].&lt;ref name=name11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=name7 /&gt; It seems likely that the multivalent nature of the symbol gave rise to its potency and longevity.&lt;ref name=name11 /&gt;
