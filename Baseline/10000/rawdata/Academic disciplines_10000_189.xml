'''Agnostic theism''', '''agnostotheism''' or '''agnostitheism''' is the [[philosophical]] view that encompasses both [[theism]] and [[agnosticism]]. An agnostic theist believes in the existence of a god or gods, but regards the basis of this proposition as ''unknown or inherently unknowable''. The agnostic theist may also or alternatively be agnostic regarding the properties of the god or gods that they believe in.

==Views of agnostic theism==
[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|right|Agnostic theism is belief but without knowledge, as shown in purple and blue (see [[Epistemology]]).]]
There are numerous [[belief]]s that can be included in agnostic theism, such as [[fideism]], the doctrine that knowledge depends on faith or revelation; not all agnostic theists are fideists. Since agnosticism is in the philosophical rather than religious sense a position on knowledge and does not forbid belief in a deity, it is compatible with most theistic positions.

The classical [[Epistemology|philosophical understanding of knowledge]] is that [[knowledge]] is [[justified true belief]]. The founder of [[logotherapy]], [[Viktor Frankl]], may have well exemplified this definition. Seidner expands upon this example and stresses Frankl's characterization of ''unconscious''.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}. ''Mater Dei Institute''.&lt;/ref&gt; Agnostic theism could be interpreted as an admission that it is not possible to justify one's belief in a god sufficiently for it to be considered known. This may be because they consider [[faith]] a requirement of their religion, or because of the influence of plausible-seeming scientific or philosophical criticism.

[[Christian agnosticism|Christian Agnostics]] practice a distinct form of agnosticism that applies only to the ''properties'' of God. They hold that it is difficult or impossible to be sure of anything beyond the basic tenets of the [[Christian faith]]. They believe that God exists, that [[Jesus]] has a special relationship with him and is in some way divine, and that God should be worshipped. This belief system has deep roots in Judaism and the early days of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weatherhead |first=Leslie |title=The Christian Agnostic |date=1972 |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]] |isbn=978-0-687-06977-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arctic [[ecology]]''' is the scientific study of the relationships between [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] factors in the [[arctic]], the region north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (66 33’). This is a region characterized by stressful conditions as a result of extreme cold, low precipitation, a limited growing season (50–90 days) and virtually no sunlight throughout the winter. The Arctic consists of [[taiga]] (or [[boreal forest]]) and [[tundra]] [[biomes]], which also dominate very high elevations, even in the tropics. Sensitive [[ecosystems]] exist throughout the Arctic region, which are being impacted dramatically by [[global warming]]. The earliest inhabitants of the Arctic were the Neanderthals. Since then, many indigenous populations have inhabited the region, which continues to this day. Since the early 1900s, when Vilhjalmur Stefansson led the first major Canadian Arctic Expedition, the Arctic has been a valued area for ecological research.  In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established in Point Barrow, Alaska under the contract of the Office of Naval Research. This launched an interest in exploring the Arctic examining animal cycles, permafrost and the interactions between indigenous peoples and the Arctic ecology. During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, Fikret and Dyanna Jolly. “Adapting to Climate Change: Social- Ecological Resilience in a Canadian Western Arctic Community.” Conservation Ecology 5 (2001).

==Arctic environment==
To understand Arctic ecology, it is important to consider both the terrestrial and oceanic aspects of the region. A few important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost.

[[Sea ice]] is frozen seawater that moves with oceanic currents; it provides important habitat and a resting place for animals, particularly during the winter months. Over time, small pockets of salty seawater get trapped in the ice, and the salt is squeezed out. This causes the ice to become progressively less salty. Sea ice persists throughout the year, but there is less ice available during summer months.

Large portions of the land are also frozen during the year. [[Permafrost]] is substrate that has been frozen for a minimum of 2 years. There are two types of permafrost: discontinuous and continuous. Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas where the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below freezing ({{convert|0|°C|°F|0|disp=or}}); this forms in sheltered locations. In areas where the mean annual soil surface temperature is below {{convert|-5|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, continuous permafrost forms. This is not limited to sheltered areas and ranges from a few inches below the surface to over {{convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} deep. The top layer is called the [[active layer]]. It thaws in the summer and is critical to plant life.

==Biomes==
Moisture and temperature are major physical drivers of natural ecosystems. The more arid and colder conditions found at higher northern latitudes (and high elevations elsewhere) support [[tundra]] and [[boreal forests]]. The water in this region is generally frozen and [[evaporation]] rates are very low. Species diversity, [[nutrient]] availability, precipitation, and average temperatures increase as you move from the tundra to boreal forests and then to [[deciduous]] [[temperate]] ecosystems, which are found south of these Arctic biomes.

===Tundra===
Tundra is found from 55 ° to 80° N latitude in North America, Eurasia and Greenland. It can be found at lower latitudes at high elevations as well. The average temperature is {{convert|-34|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}; during the summer it is less than {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Average precipitation ranges from {{convert|10|to|50|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, and the permafrost is {{convert|400|-|600|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} thick. Plant species supported by tundra have small leaves, are short (74&amp;nbsp;mm to &lt;5 m), tend to be deciduous, have a high ratio of roots to shoots, and are composed mainly of perennial forbs, dwarf shrubs, grasses, lichens, and mosses.

===Boreal===
In comparison to tundra, [[boreal forest]] has a longer and warmer [[growing season]] and supports larger [[species diversity]], an increase in canopy height, vegetation density, and [[biomass]]. Boreal conditions can be found across northern North America and Eurasia. The boreal forests in the interior of the continents grow on top of permafrost due to very cold winters (see [[drunken trees]]), while much of the boreal forest has patchy permafrost or lack permafrost completely. The short (3–4 month) growing season in boreal forests is sustained by greater levels of rainfall (between {{convert|30|and|85|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year) than the tundra receives; This biome is dominated by closed canopy forests of evergreen conifers, especially spruces, fir, pine and tamarack with some diffuse-porous hardwoods. Shrubs, herbs, ferns, mosses, and lichens are also important species. Stand-replacing crown fires are very important to this biome, occurring as frequently as every 50–100 years in some parts.

==Adaptations to conditions==

===Humans===
Humans living in the Arctic region generally rely on warm clothing and buildings to protect them from the elements. [[Acclimatization]], or the adjustment to new conditions, appears to be the most common form of adaptation to cold environments. No genetic advantage has been found when different people groups or races are compared. There is no evidence that fat is grown in response to cold, although its presence is advantageous. Amazingly, most people living in the Arctic region live a lifestyle very connected to the environment, spending significant time outside and depending heavily on hunting and fishing.

===Other animals===
Animals that are active in the winter have [[adaptations]] for surviving the intense cold. A common example is the presence of strikingly large feet in proportion to body weight. These act like snowshoes, and can be found on animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] and caribou. Many of the animals in the Arctic are larger than their temperate counterparts ([[Bergmann’s rule]]), taking advantage of the smaller ratio of surface area to volume that comes with increasing size. This increases the ability to conserve heat. Layers of fat, plumage, and fur are also very effective [[Thermal insulation|insulators]] to help retain warmth and are common in Arctic animals including polar bears and marine mammals. Some animals also have digestive adaptations to improve their ability to digest woody plants either with or without the aid of microbial organisms. This is highly advantageous during the winter months when most soft vegetation is beneath the [[snow pack]].

Not all Arctic animals directly face the rigors of winter. Many migrate to warmer climates at lower latitudes, while others avoid the difficulties of winter by [[hibernation|hibernating]] until spring. Although these options might seem to be easy solutions to the difficulties of surviving an extreme environment, both are very expensive in terms of energy and risk of predation.

===Plants===
One of the most serious problems that plants face is ice crystal formation in the cells, which results in tissue death. Plants have two ways to resist freezing: avoid it or tolerate it. If a plant has taken the avoidance route, it has several different ways to evade freezing. It can build up insulation, have its stem close to the ground, use the insulation from snow cover, and supercool. When [[supercooling]], water is able to remain in its liquid state down to {{convert|-38|°C|°F|disp=or}} (compared to its usual {{convert|0|°C|°F|disp=or}} freezing point). After water reaches {{convert|-38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, it spontaneously freezes and plant tissue is destroyed. This is called the [[nucleation point]]. The nucleation point can be lowered if dissolved [[solution|solute]]s are present.

If a plant has taken the tolerance route, it has several different ways to tolerate freezing. Some plants allow freezing by allowing [[extracellular]], but not [[intracellular]] freezing. Plants let water freeze in extracellular spaces, which creates a high vapor deficit that pulls water vapor out of the cell. This process dehydrates the cell and allows it to survive temperatures well below {{convert|-38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}.

Another problem associated with extreme cold is cavitation. Ring-porous wood is susceptible to [[cavitation]] because the large pores that are used for water transport easily freeze. [[Cavitation]] is much less of problem in trees with [[ring-diffuse]] wood. In ring-diffuse wood, there is a reduced risk of cavitation, as transport pores are smaller. The trade-off is that these species are not able to transport water as efficiently.

==History of Arctic ecology==

===Early history===
Many different peoples had inhabited present-day [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] by AD 1000. Most of these people lived by hunting, gathering and fishing and never; [[agriculture]] was never done often in the region. Most of these peoples were [[nomad]]ic and their activity was largely seasonal. Early [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic Culture]] influenced the [[Plano cultures|Plano Culture]] by about 8000 BC. The Plano peoples and other cultural groups stemming from the Archaic Culture were notable for their use of spear-throwing technology, which likely made them able to maintain larger populations and expand their access to different foods. By AD 1000, the indigenous Arctic inhabitants have also developed other tools that improved their [[standard of living]], such as [[fire]], which was set to the woodlands to be used to drive [[deer]] to be hunted.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007.  pgs. 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English scientist [[William Scoresby]] explored the [[Arctic]] and wrote reports on its [[meteorology]], [[zoology]] and [[geophysics]]. Around this time, the Arctic region was becoming a major subject of imperial science. Though permanent observatories were not yet established, traveling scientists began to gather magnetic data in the Arctic in the early nineteenth century. In June 1831, [[James Clark Ross|Sir James Ross]] and a group of [[Eskimo]]s explored the Booth Peninsula in order to determine the exact location of the [[North Magnetic Pole|Magnetic North Pole]]. In the European Arctic, however, Scandinavian powers collected most of the scientific data as a result of early colonies established by Norsemen in Iceland and Greenland. Scientific expeditions to the Arctic started to happen more frequently by the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1338-1840, French La Recherche went on an expedition to the North Atlantic with a team of French, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Between 1856 and 1914, the Swedes made about twenty-five expeditions to the Arctic island of [[Spitsbergen]] in [[Norway]]. As the Swedes expanded their influence in Spitsbergen, they used the area for economic as well as scientific motives through mining and resource extraction. During this time, the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Great Britain]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], and [[Germany]] also started to become more active in Spitsbergen.&lt;ref&gt;Sörlin, Sverker(2006)'Science, Empire, and Enlightenment: Geographies of Northern Field Science', European Review of History: Revue europeenne d'histoire,13:3,455 — 472&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established under the contract of the Office of Naval Research in Point Barrow, Alaska for the purpose of investigating the physical and biological phenomena unique to the Arctic. In 1948, Dr. Laurence Irving was appointed as the Scientific Director of the Arctic Research Laboratory and put in charge of coordinating various projects. Scientists performed fieldwork to collect data that linked new observations to prior widely accepted knowledge. Through the processes of soil sampling, surveying and photographing landscapes and distributing salmon tags, scientists demonstrated the significance of historical case studies in the study of environmental science. The ability to compare past and present data allowed scientists to understand the causes and effects of ecological changes. Around this time, geographers from McGill University were developing new methods of studying geography in the North. As laboratory research was beginning to trump field research, McGill geographers implemented use of aviation in research, helping knowledge production to occur in the laboratory instead of in the field. Aviation allowed researchers to remould the way they studied the Northern landscape and  indigenous people. Quick and easy travel using aircraft also promoted an integration of the Northern science with Southern community-based science, while changing the scale of ecology being studied. The ability to photograph, and observe the Arctic from an aircraft, provided researchers with a larger scope that allowed them to see a massive amount of space at one time, while also asserting objectivity. A photograph produces evidence, similar to laboratory data, yet it can be understood, circulated and accepted by the common people due to its aesthetic value.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. "A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960." Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the Canadian government began taking initiatives to secure the continent, and to assert territorial authority over northern Canada, including the Arctic, which at the time had a dominant American presence. The Canadian government demonstrated their desire for national dominance and security by requiring permission from other nations to utilize their land for military initiatives. They also supported and implemented civilian initiatives including resource development, wildlife conservation and the social and economic development of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. "A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960." Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950’s, ecologist Charles Elton was drawn to the Arctic to study the existence, causes and effects of cycles in animal populations, while ecologists Frank Banfield and John Kelsal studied the factors, especially human impacts, influencing hunting and game populations on animals such as caribou.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. “Science and Spaces in the Northern Environment.” Environmental History 12 (2007): 867-94. Accessed on February 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s and 1970s brought a decrease in the desire to protect the Arctic as it was seen to lack a significant amount of biodiversity. This allowed for scientists to extend further research in the area. In June 1960, the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) was constructed, headed by General Duncan Hallock and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The two predecessor organizations that made up the CRREL were the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory (ACFEL), and the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE). The goal of the CREEL laboratory was to bring together the ACFEL and SIPRE to expand the size and scientific reputation of these organizations, solve problems in cold regions and explore the basic environmental characteristics of cold regions.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmund. CRREL's First 25 Years 1961-1986. Arctic: Technical Publications Writer- Editor, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, study and management of the Arctic was taken over by consulting firms hired and controlled by the government.

===Indigenous peoples and research===
As research in the Arctic region of northern [[North America]] became more frequent, conflicts between researchers and the indigenous peoples started to occur. Recently, the indigenous communities of the North American Arctic have played a direct role in setting ethical standards for research in the region. Scientists have combined the use of laboratory research and field research in the [[Polar region|Polar Regions]] to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its characteristics. Because of scientific research in the north, living in and traveling to the Arctic has become much safer. However, the indigenous peoples viewed the effects of the research and development in the area differently than the scientists did. Since the 1960s, indigenous peoples have been more politically active and began pursuing the recognition of their rights regarding land-claims and self-government institutions. Indigenous communities voiced their concern that this research could lead to undesirable changes to the region’s landscape and economy. Canadian officials responded to their concerns by addressing the responsibility of scientists to consult with indigenous communities before conducting research. In 1977, the Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies (ACUNS) was founded at Churchill, Manitoba to improve scientific activity in the region. ACUNS published a document aimed at promoting cooperation between the northern indigenous people and researchers called ''Ethical Principles for the Conduct of Research in the North (1982)''. The document was published in English, French, and Inuktitut so it could be clearly understood among different groups. Relationships between science and society in the Arctic continue to change and adapt based on the politics of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Korsmo, Fae L. and Amanda Graham. "Research in the North American North: Action and Reaction." Arctic 55.4 (2002): 319-328. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human ecology in the Arctic==
Evidence has been found of early humans in the early Würm-Weichsel period hunting large Arctic mammals in the [[Ice Age]] steppes of northern Europe. However, it is still unclear whether these humans were just temporary migrants or inhabitants of Arctic colonies at the time.

[[File:Inupiat Family from Noatak, Alaska, 1929, Edward S. Curtis (restored).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.|Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.]]

The earliest inhabitants of the polar regions were the [[Neanderthals]], or ''Homo neanderthalensis'', who are considered to be an intermediate stage between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''. The Neandertalers made advances in the basic production of stone, bone antler and flint tools, which archaeologists call a [[Mousterian|Mousterian industry]]. About 40,000 years ago, the Neandertalers quickly disappeared and were replaced by modern humans, ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. Just a few thousand years after the sudden disappearance of the Neandertalers, modern humans occupied all the land that their predecessors had occupied. Some scientists believe that the Neandertalers were overcome by the incoming modern race, commonly called [[Cro-Magnon]] people, while others believe the race disappeared by integrating itself within the new population.

The [[Aurignacian|Aurignacoid]] (upper Paleolithic tool-making) tradition of the modern people is most associated with a feature called [[blade]]-and-core technology. According to Quaternary scientist C.V. Haynes, Arctic [[Cave painting|cave art]] also dates back to the Aurignacoid phase and climaxes during the end of the [[Pleistocene]], which encompasses subjects such as hunting and spirituality. People stemming from the [[Clovis culture]] populated northern regions of Canada and formed what led to the Northern Archaic and Maritime Archaic traditions at the end of the [[Late Glacial Maximum|Late Glacial]] period. Recently, small flint tools and artifacts from about 5,000 years ago were discovered that belonged to a culture now generally called the [[Arctic Small Tool tradition]]. The ASTt people are believed to be the physical and cultural ancestors of modern arctic [[Inuit]].&lt;ref&gt;*Young, Steven B. To the Arctic: An Introduction to the Far Northern World. New York: Wiley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, as European trade interests among the Northwest Company and the Hudson's Bay Company expanded into northern Canada, arctic indigenous peoples began to become more involved in the trade process. Increasingly more European goods, including kettles, iron tools, tobacco, alcohol, and guns, were bought and traded by the indigenous peoples within their communities. European imports in exchange for more primitive, native resources and tools made life for the indigenous more efficient and comfortable. Native societies in the early eighteenth century also began to buy guns from European traders, and these guns made hunting easier. They were also occasionally used in native etiquette, medicinal, and religious practices. Because of the natives' increased hunting efficiency, scarcity of resources became an issue in the region, a version of what American human ecologist Garrett Hardin called "the tragedy of the commons."&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007. pgs. 64-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic peoples value spiritual connections with their environment, which leads to a spiritual understanding along with their scientific understanding. Their lifestyles, therefore, reflect not only activity that is economically efficient but also that which is in line with their spiritual beliefs and values. The Alaskan Athabascan people, for example, spiritually value the [[moose]]. State law acknowledges this spiritual belief and allows people to take moose for [[potlatch]]es outside of the usual hunting season. The indigenous peoples of the Arctic drawn from scientific, emotional and spiritual sources of information, which often does not agree with non-indigenous scientific observations.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

==Conservation and environmental issues==
Suspected worldwide anthropogenic climate change has been particularly evident in the Arctic. This is evident by warmer temperatures, melting glaciers, shorter durations of sea ice and changing weather and storm patterns. Scientists are especially concerned about four aspects of the continued projected warming of the Arctic.

First, [[thermohaline circulation]] is a series of underwater oceanic currents fueled by the salinity and temperature of seawater. Melting ice sheets would introduce vast amounts of fresh water into the North Atlantic, causing a change in density which could disrupt the currents. If this circulation slowed or stopped, the climates of northern Europe and North America would be strongly impacted.

Second, the melting of glaciers and sea ice is disrupting the lifestyles of a wide range of species. [[Polar bear]]s live on the sea ice for much of the year and find their food in the surrounding ocean waters. Recent projections suggest that global warming will lead to the disappearance of most summer sea ice within 40 years.

A third practical concern is the melting of permafrost due to climate change. Degradation of this permafrost is leading to major ground surface subsidence and pounding. The ground is literally melting away in many regions of the Arctic. The locations of towns and communities that have been inhabited for centuries are now in jeopardy. A condition known as drunken tree syndrome is being caused by this melting. Ground water and river runoffs are being negatively impacted as well. Although warming conditions might increase {{chem|CO|2}} uptake for photosynthetic organisms in some places, scientists are concerned that melting permafrost will also release large amounts of carbon locked in permafrost. Higher temperatures increase soil decomposition and if soil decomposition becomes higher than net primary production, global atmospheric carbon dioxide will in turn increase. Atmospheric sinks in the water table are also being reduced as the permafrost melts and decreases the height of the water table in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter_C._Oechel|Oechel, Walter]] and George Vourlitis. “The Effects of Climate Charge on Land—Atmosphere Feedbacks in Arctic Tundra Regions.” Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 9 (1994): 324-329. Accessed on February 23, 2014. Doi: 10.1016/0169-5347(94)90152-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the impacts of the release of carbon from the permafrost could be amplified by high levels of [[deforestation]] in the Boreal forests in Eurasia and Canada. This biome currently serves as a large [[carbon sink]], [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, over half of the original forest has been or in danger of harvesting, largely for export. Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which facilitates increased warming of the earth.

==Further exploration==
In a [[meta analysis]] of the published work in aquatic ecosystems since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to be still unexplored. In addition, the North Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and Pacific Northwest), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world’s aquatic biodiversity. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in terrestrial ecosystems, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially marine ecosystems where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases (Moustakas &amp; Karakassis 2005). Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Arctic Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world’s aquatic biodiversity.

Matthews adjusted many of the entries to reflect LDS modifications of traditional Christian beliefs and also added a number of entries to address doctrines taught exclusively by the LDS Church. However, the majority of the content of the ''Bible Dictionary'' is identical to the Cambridge publication. The secretary of the committee was [[William James Mortimer]].

The LDS ''Bible Dictionary'' is published in all English-language versions of the Bible printed by the church except for of the barebones KJV Bible distributed free of charge by [[Mormon missionaries]]. In other LDS-printed Bibles, it is found on pages 599 to 793 of the appendix materials, immediately following the Topical Guide and immediately preceding excerpts from the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]]. The LDS Church provides the complete contents of the [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/ Bible Dictionary online].

Despite being packaged with the LDS publication of the Bible, the ''Bible Dictionary'' is not part of the LDS Church's [[Standard Works|open canon of scripture]].

[[Bioconcentration]] is a related but more specific term, referring to uptake and accumulation of a substance from water alone. By contrast, bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=|date=|title=Bioaccumulation, bioconcentration, biomagnification|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F1-4020-4494-1_31|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

An example of poisoning in the workplace can be seen from the phrase "[[mad as a hatter]]" (18th and 19th century England). The process for stiffening the felt used in making hats more than a hundred years ago involved [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which forms organic species such as [[methylmercury]], which is lipid-soluble, and tends to accumulate in the brain, resulting in [[mercury poisoning]]. Other lipid-[[soluble]] (fat-soluble) poisons include [[tetraethyllead]] compounds (the [[lead]] in leaded [[petrol]]), and [[DDT]]. These compounds are stored in the body's [[fat]], and when the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning.

[[Strontium-90]], part of the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[atomic bomb]]s, is chemically similar enough to calcium that it is utilized in [[osteogenesis]], where its radiation can cause damage for a long time.

Naturally produced toxins can also bioaccumulate. The marine [[algal bloom]]s known as "[[red tide]]s" can result in local filter-feeding organisms such as [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s becoming toxic; coral fish can be responsible for the poisoning known as [[ciguatera]] when they accumulate a toxin called [[ciguatoxin]] from reef algae.

Some animal species exhibit bioaccumulation as a mode of defense; by consuming toxic plants or animal prey, a species may accumulate the toxin, which then presents a deterrent to a potential predator. One example is the [[Manduca sexta|tobacco hornworm]], which concentrates [[nicotine]] to a toxic level in its body as it consumes [[tobacco]] plants.
Poisoning of small consumers can be passed along the food chain to affect the consumers later on.
Other compounds that are not normally considered toxic can be accumulated to toxic levels in organisms. The classic example is of [[Vitamin A]], which becomes concentrated in [[carnivore]] [[liver]]s of e.g. [[polar bear]]s: as a pure carnivore that feeds on other carnivores (seals), they accumulate extremely large amounts of Vitamin A in their livers. It was known by the native peoples of the Arctic that the livers of carnivores should not be eaten, but Arctic [[explorer]]s have suffered [[Hypervitaminosis A]] from eating the bear livers (and there has been at least one example of similar poisoning of [[Xavier Mertz|Antarctic explorers]] eating [[husky]] [[dog]] livers).  One notable example of this is the expedition of [[Mawson|Sir Douglas Mawson]], where his exploration companion died from eating the liver of one of their dogs.

[[Coastal fish]] (such as the [[smooth toadfish]]) and [[seabird]]s (such as the [[Atlantic puffin]]) are often monitored for [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] bioaccumulation.

In some eutrophic aquatic systems, [[biodilution]] can occur. This trend is a decrease in a contaminant with an increase in trophic level and is due to higher concentrations of algae and bacteria to "dilute" the concentration of the pollutant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13003">'''Bold hypothesis''' (or "bold conjecture") is a concept in the philosophy of science of [[Karl Popper]], first explained in his debut ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''  (1935) and subsequently elaborated in writings such as ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (1963). The concept is nowadays widely used in the [[philosophy of science]] and in the [[philosophy of knowledge]]. It is also used in the social and behavioural sciences.

==Brief explanation==
Popper's argument is that the growth of scientific knowledge progresses by means of formulating ''bold'' hypotheses, and trying to refute (disprove or falsify) them.  Popper believed that:

{{Quotation|"Bold ideas, unjustified anticipations, and speculative thought, are our only means for interpreting nature: our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''. London: Routledge, 1992, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He makes this point more specific in a 1953 lecture, where he argues that, if we aim to explain the world, then:

{{Quotation|"... there is no more rational procedure than the method of trial and error – of conjecture and refutation: of boldly proposing theories; of trying our best to show that these are erroneous; and of accepting them tentatively if our critical efforts are unsuccessful. From the point of view here developed, all laws, all theories, remain essentially tentative, or conjectural, or hypothetical, even when we feel unable to doubt them any longer."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, British Council lecture given at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in Summer 1953. Published under the title "Philosophy of Science: a Personal Report" in C. A. Mace (ed.), British Philosophy in Mid-Century: a Cambridge Symposium. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1966.[https://webfiles.uci.edu/rsmead/PHIL330/Readings/Popper%20-%20Science%20-%20Conjectures%20and%20Refutations.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

A "bold" hypothesis is a new scientific idea which, if it was true, would be able to predict and/or explain a lot, or a lot more, about the subject  being theorized about.  The "boldness" of a hypothesis depends mainly on:
 
*Its scope – the number and variety of phenomena which it could explain, if it is true (its "explanatory power").
*its novelty or originality – the extent to which the hypothesis is a genuinely ''new'' departure from the received scientific ideas.
*whether it enables new and novel predictions ("predictive power"").
*whether it stimulates new, innovative research ("heuristic power").
*Its degree of applicability or usefulness for scientific research ("utility").
*The effect or impact it has on existing scientific thinking, if it is true. 
 
Once a bold hypothesis has been mooted, Popper argues, scientists try to investigate and test how well the bold hypothesis can stand up to the known evidence, with the aim of finding counter-arguments which would refute or falsify the bold hypothesis.  In this process of testing and criticism, new scientific knowledge is generated. Even if the bold hypothesis turns out to have been wrong, testing it generates new knowledge about what can and cannot be the case. Often it stimulates new research.

Inversely, if a hypothesis lacks the quality of boldness, then it would make very little difference to what scientists already know. It is not "a big deal", i.e. it is not very significant for the theory which exists already. It can contribute rather little to advancing scientific progress, because it does not expand or add to scientific understanding very much.

According to Popper,
{{Quotation|"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock. The bold structure of its theories rises, as it were, above a swamp. It is like a building erected on piles. The piles are driven down from above into the swamp, but not down to any natural or ‘given’ base; and if we stop driving the piles deeper, it is not because we have reached firm ground. We simply stop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the structure, at least for the time being." "&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], The Logic of Scientific Discovery . London: Routledge, 1992, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In Popper's philosophy of science, scientific statements are always provisional, they have limits of application, and they could always be wrong. If a statement cannot even in principle be proved wrong, it cannot be a scientific statement. Thus, in Popper's eyes, the [[falsifiability]] criterion clearly demarcates "science" from "[[non-science]]". This Popperian idea has been very controversial, however. The reason is that it can be quite difficult to test scientifically how true a particular idea is. Even if scientists do ''want'' to test an idea, they may not know yet ''how'' exactly to test it conclusively. Yet, scientists also don't want to abandon a hunch that seems useful, simply because they don't know how to verify it yet. This point is especially important for "bold" new hypotheses, because the very "boldness" of the new hypothesis could mean that it would take a lot of work before adequate tests could be designed.

Some philosophers have argued that, in the real world, scientists operate routinely with at least some metaphysical beliefs for which they have no proof or verification whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Amsterdamski, ''Between Experience and Metaphysics''. Dordrecht: Reidel, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Paul Feyerabend]], the creative processes that lead to a scientific discovery are usually quite reasonable and non-arbitrary. However, the creative processes are by no means fully "rational", and they can be quite unique. Thus, the idea that there is one standard model which can define the rationality of all scientific methods should be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Feyerabend]], ''Against Method'', 3rd edition. London: Verso, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his later writings, ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972), Popper argued that:

{{Quotation|"A theory is the bolder the greater its content. It is also the riskier: it is the more probable to start with that it will be false. We try to find its weak points, to refute it. If we fail to refute it, or if the refutations we find are at the same time also refutations of the weaker theory which was its predecessor, then we have reason to suspect, or to conjecture, that the stronger theory has no greater falsity content than its weaker predecessor, and, therefore, that it has the greater degree of [[verisimilitude]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Objective Knowledge: an evolutionary approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This interpretation was criticized by Adolf Grünbaum.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Grünbaum, "Is the Method of Bold Conjectures and Attempted Refutations Justifiably the Method of Science?". ''The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 27, No. 2 (Jun., 1976), pp. 105–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main criticisms==
Popper’s idea of the role of bold hypotheses in scientific progress has attracted three main kinds of criticisms.
*The idea of a bold hypothesis is itself somewhat vague, because exactly "how bold is bold"?&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Cleveland and Paul T. Sagal, "Bold hypotheses: the bolder the better?", in: ''Ratio'', Vol. 2, No. 2, December 1989, pp. 109–121, at p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; It might just depend on how you look at it. Some new ideas, although they are rather modest in themselves, can make a very large difference to the advancement of scientific research. The "boldness" could refer to the ''content'' of the hypothesis (considered relative to other possible hypotheses), or to the manner or context in which the hypothesis is ''presented'', to its importance for research, or to the ''attitude'' involved. It remains somewhat unclear what kinds of criteria we might use, to credit new hypotheses as "bold" or not. A fashionable scientist might be presented as doing new and bold things, while in reality it was more hype than substance.
*[[Imre Lakatos]] argued, that scientists do not aim to test bold hypotheses mainly in order to ''falsify'' them.&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes".  In: Imre Lakatos &amp; Alan Musgrave (eds.), ''Criticism and the growth of knowledge''. Cambridge University Press, 1970. pp. 91-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they aim mainly to ''confirm'' hypotheses.  A falsified conjecture shows the scientist only "what he does not know", whereas the scientist is more interested in what s/he does know, and what s/he ''can'' know. The scientist is interested in gaining ''positive'' new knowledge, which can be used for practical purposes. The scientist is not primarily interested in “knowing that he doesn’t know things” or in "what is not the case" (other than to rule out possibilities). The scientist wants to know what really ''is'' the case. Scientific statements according to this Lakatosian point of view are not ''falsifiable'' statements, but ''fallible'' statements. Fallible statements are simply statements which could be wrong. Fallible statements include ''both'' testable statements ''and'' statements of which it is known that they could be wrong, although currently we do not know how to test them yet for their truth or falsity (or, the possible tests are technically not yet feasible). Thus, scientific statements are fallible statements which scientists ''intend'' or ''aim'' to test for their truth-content. Lakatos did not regard scientific progress simply as a "trial and error" process, but as a process involving definite "do's and don'ts", which he calls "positive heuristics" and "negative heuristics". He believed Popper's philosophy was inconsistent, because Popper claimed definitive falsification was possible, while denying that absolute positive proof of a hypothesis was possible. In Lakatos's view of science, neither is true. There exist no "crucial experiments" which can either prove or disprove a hypothesis definitively.&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, "The role of crucial experiments in science". In: ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'', Part A 4 (4), pp. 309-325, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; All that really happens, is that scientists decide to accept the results of a test as definitive "for all intents and purposes", even though in principle that methodological decision could later on still be proved wrong. 
*Scientific researchers have argued that Popper’s interpretation does not provide a very realistic picture of what most scientists actually do. They argue that Popper focused on the “glamorous” side of scientific work.  In much, if not most, scientific work in the real world, scientists are not mooting bold hypotheses. Instead, they are working patiently on systematic and detailed tests of a small facet of a much larger theory (or a larger research programme). [[Thomas Kuhn]] called this "[[normal science]]". Thus, progress may come about not so much because somebody has a grandiose new idea, but instead because the careful testing of the details of a theory eventually provides definitive scientific conclusions.

Despite these important criticisms, Popper's concept of bold hypotheses continues to be widely used in the academic world. One reason is that, at some level, the concept does make sense, even if (arguably) Popper himself failed to define its role in scientific research very well. Another reason is that academic progress always requires that a scholar does something genuinely new and "breaks new ground". If a scholar only concerns himself with tiny, uncontroversial and fairly trivial claims, he is unlikely to be rewarded very much for his effort. Plausible and credible bold hypotheses are highly valued in the academic world, so long as they are reasonably consistent with well-established scientific findings, and do not seriously challenge scientific authority. 

In the business community, too, [[innovation]] is very important, to find new ways to reduce costs, increase sales, and increase profits.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Freeman &amp; Luc Soete, ''The economics of industrial innovation'', 3rd ed. London: Pinter 1999; Chris Freeman &amp; Francisco Louçã, ''As time goes by''. Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A bold new idea can be worth a lot of money, and therefore, business people are often sympathetic to bold attempts to reframe what is known already and to create new ideas; without such innovations, they would eventually be defeated by competitors who have a better idea. So the idea of a bold hypothesis also continues to have a place in economics, management theory and business administration.

In [[geometry]] and [[linear algebra]], a '''Cartesian tensor''' uses an [[orthonormal basis]] to [[Representation (mathematics)|represent]] a [[tensor]] in a [[Euclidean space]] in the form of components. Converting a tensor's components from one such basis to another is through an [[orthogonal transformation]].

The most familiar coordinate systems are the [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Cartesian coordinate]] systems. Cartesian tensors may be used with any Euclidean space, or more technically, any finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s that has an [[inner product]].

Use of Cartesian tensors occurs in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], such as with the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] and the [[moment of inertia]] tensor in [[rigid body dynamics]]. Sometimes general [[curvilinear coordinates]] are convenient, as in high-deformation [[continuum mechanics]], or even necessary, as in [[general relativity]]. While orthonormal bases may be found for some such coordinate systems (e.g. [[tangent]] to [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]), Cartesian tensors may provide considerable simplification for applications in which rotations of rectilinear coordinate axes suffice. The transformation is a [[passive transformation]], since the coordinates are changed and not the physical system.

==Cartesian basis and related terminology==

===Vectors in three dimensions===

In [[three-dimensional space|3d]] [[Euclidean space]], ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[standard basis]] is '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. Each basis vector points along the x-, y-, and z-axes, and the vectors are all [[unit vector]]s (or normalized), so the basis is [[orthonormal]].

Throughout, when referring to [[Cartesian coordinates]] in [[three dimensions]], a right-handed system is assumed and this is much more common than a left-handed system in practice, see [[orientation (vector space)]] for details.
simi
For Cartesian tensors of order 1, a Cartesian vector '''a''' can be written algebraically as a [[linear combination]] of the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[coordinate vector|coordinate]]s of the vector with respect to the Cartesian basis are denoted ''a''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. It is common and helpful to display the basis vectors as [[column vector]]s

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_\text{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{y} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

when we have a [[coordinate vector]] in a column vector representation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_\text{x} \\ a_\text{y} \\ a_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

A [[row vector]] representation is also legitimate, although in the context of general curvilinear coordinate systems the row and column vector representations are used separately for specific reasons – see [[Einstein notation]] and [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]] for why.

The term "component" of a vector is ambiguous: it could refer to:

*a specific coordinate of the vector such as ''a''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; (a scalar), and similarly for ''x'' and ''y'', or
*the coordinate scalar-multiplying the corresponding basis vector, in which case the "y-component" of '''a''' is ''a''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (a vector), and similarly for ''x'' and ''z''.

A more general notation is [[tensor index notation]], which has the flexibility of numerical values rather than fixed coordinate labels. {{anchor|indices replace labels}}&lt;!---PLEASE DON'T DELETE THIS ANCHOR, IT'S USED LATER---&gt;The Cartesian labels are replaced by tensor indices in the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and coordinates ''A''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, the notation '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; refers to ''any'' basis, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the corresponding coordinate system; although here they are restricted to the Cartesian system. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_1\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\mathbf{e}_2 + a_3\mathbf{e}_3 = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;

It is standard to use the [[Einstein notation]]—the summation sign for summation over an index that is present exactly twice within a term may be suppressed for notational conciseness:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i\mathbf{e}_i \equiv a_i\mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;

An advantage of the index notation over coordinate-specific notations is the independence of the dimension of the underlying vector space, i.e. the same expression on the right hand side takes the same form in higher dimensions (see below). Previously, the Cartesian labels x, y, z were just labels and ''not'' indices. (It is informal to say "''i'' = x, y, z").

===Second order tensors in three dimensions===

A [[dyadic tensor]] '''T''' is an order 2 tensor formed by the [[tensor product]] &amp;otimes; of two Cartesian vectors '''a''' and '''b''', written '''T''' = '''a''' &amp;otimes; '''b'''. Analogous to vectors, it can be written as a linear combination of the tensor basis {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the right hand side of each identity is only an abbreviation, nothing more):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccl}
\mathbf{T} &amp; = &amp; \left(a_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\right)\otimes\left(b_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\right) \\
&amp;  &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{x} \mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{x} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{x} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + a_\text{y} b_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{y} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + a_\text{z} b_\text{x} \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{z} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z}  \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Representing each basis tensor as a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; 
{\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{xx} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad
{\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{xy} = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\,,\cdots \quad {\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{zz} = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

then '''T''' can be represented more systematically as a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_\text{x} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{z} \\ 
a_\text{y} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{y} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{y} b_\text{z} \\
a_\text{z} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{z} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{z} b_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

See [[matrix multiplication#The inner and outer products|matrix multiplication]] for the notational correspondence between matrices and the dot and tensor products.

More generally, whether or not '''T''' is a tensor product of two vectors, it is always a linear combination of the basis tensors with coordinates ''T''&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''T''&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccl}
\mathbf{T}&amp; = &amp; T_\text{xx}\mathbf{e}_\text{xx} + T_\text{xy}\mathbf{e}_\text{xy} + T_\text{xz}\mathbf{e}_\text{xz} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + T_\text{yx}\mathbf{e}_\text{yx} + T_\text{yy}\mathbf{e}_\text{yy} + T_\text{yz}\mathbf{e}_\text{yz} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + T_\text{zx}\mathbf{e}_\text{zx} + T_\text{zy}\mathbf{e}_\text{zy} + T_\text{zz}\mathbf{e}_\text{zz}  
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

while in terms of tensor indices:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and in matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Second order tensors occur naturally in physics and engineering when physical quantities have directional dependence in the system, often in a "stimulus-response" way. This can be mathematically seen through one aspect of tensors - they are [[multilinear function]]s. A second order tensor '''T''' which takes in a vector '''u''' of some magnitude and direction will return a vector '''v'''; of a different magnitude and in a different direction to '''u''', in general. The notation used for [[function (mathematics)|function]]s in [[mathematical analysis]] leads us to write {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''T'''('''u''')}},&lt;ref name="MTW notation"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Charles W. Misner|C.W. Misner]], [[Kip S. Thorne|K.S. Thorne]], [[John A. Wheeler|J.A. Wheeler]]|title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]|page=|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}, used throughout&lt;/ref&gt; while the same idea can be expressed in matrix and index notations&lt;ref name="Kibble notation"&gt;{{cite book|title=classical mechanics|year=1973|publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|series=European physics series|author=T. W. B. Kibble|isbn=978-0-07-084018-8}}, see Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; (including the summation convention), respectively:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} 
v_\text{x} \\ 
v_\text{y} \\
v_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
u_\text{x} \\ 
u_\text{y} \\
u_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad v_i = T_{ij}u_j &lt;/math&gt;

By "linear", if {{nowrap|'''u''' {{=}} ''ρ'''''r''' + ''σ'''''s'''}} for two scalars ''ρ'' and ''σ'' and vectors '''r''' and '''s''', then in function and index notations:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{T}(\rho\mathbf{r} + \sigma\mathbf{s}) = \rho\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{r}) + \sigma\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{s}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_i = T_{ij}(\rho r_j + \sigma s_j) = \rho T_{ij} r_j + \sigma T_{ij} s_j &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the matrix notation. The function, matrix, and index notations all mean the same thing. The matrix forms provide a clear display of the components, while the index form allows easier tensor-algebraic manipulation of the formulae in a compact manner. Both provide the physical interpretation of ''directions''; vectors have one direction, while second order tensors connect two directions together. One can associate a tensor index or coordinate label with a basis vector direction.

The use of second order tensors are the minimum to describe changes in magnitudes and directions of vectors, as the [[dot product]] of two vectors is always a scalar, while the [[cross product]] of two vectors is always a pseudovector perpendicular to the plane defined by the vectors, so these products of vectors alone cannot obtain a new vector of any magnitude in any direction. (See also below for more on the dot and cross products). The tensor product of two vectors is a second order tensor, although this has no obvious directional interpretation by itself.

The previous idea can be continued: if '''T''' takes in two vectors '''p''' and '''q''', it will return a scalar ''r''. In function notation we write ''r'' = '''T'''('''p''', '''q'''), while in matrix and index notations (including the summation convention) respectively:

:&lt;math&gt; r = \begin{pmatrix} 
p_\text{x} &amp; 
p_\text{y} &amp;
p_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
q_\text{x} \\ 
q_\text{y} \\
q_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad r = p_i T_{ij} q_j &lt;/math&gt;

The tensor '''T''' is linear in both input vectors. When vectors and tensors are written without reference to components, and indices are not used, sometimes a dot · is placed where summations over indices (known as [[tensor contraction]]s) are taken. For the above cases:&lt;ref name="MTW notation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kibble notation"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r = \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;

motivated by the dot product notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_i b_i&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, a tensor of order ''m'' which takes in ''n'' vectors (where ''n'' is between 0 and ''m'' inclusive) will return a tensor of order {{nowrap|''m'' − ''n''}}, see [[tensor#As multilinear maps|Tensor: As multilinear maps]] for further generalizations and details. The concepts above also apply to pseudovectors in the same way as for vectors. The vectors and tensors themselves can vary within throughout space, in which case we have [[vector field]]s and [[tensor field]]s, and can also depend on time.

For the electrical conduction example, the index and matrix notations would be:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i = \sigma_{ij}E_j \equiv \sum_{j} \sigma_{ij}E_j &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} J_\text{x} \\ J_\text{y} \\ J_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}

\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} E_\text{x} \\ E_\text{y} \\ E_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

while for the rotational kinetic energy ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2} \omega_i I_{ij} \omega_j \equiv \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \omega_i I_{ij} \omega_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

===Vectors and tensors in ''n'' dimensions===

In ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space over the real numbers, ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the standard basis is denoted '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each basis vector '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; points along the positive ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, with the basis being orthonormal. Component ''j'' of '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the [[Kronecker delta]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e}_i)_j = \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

A vector in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_i\mathbf{e}_i \equiv \sum_i a_i\mathbf{e}_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for the order 2 tensor above, for each vector '''a''' and '''b''' in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = a_i b_j \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} a_i b_j \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or more generally:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Transformations of Cartesian vectors (any number of dimensions)==

[[File:Rectangular coordinate system position vector index lowered.svg|thumb|The same [[position vector]] '''x''' represented in two 3d rectangular coordinate systems each with an [[orthonormal basis]], the cuboids illustrate the [[parallelogram law]] for adding vector components.]]

===Meaning of "invariance" under coordinate transformations===

The [[position vector]] '''x''' in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a simple and common example of a vector, and can be represented in ''any'' [[coordinate system]]. Consider the case of [[rectangular coordinate system]]s with orthonormal bases only. It is possible to have a coordinate system with rectangular geometry if the basis vectors are all mutually perpendicular and not normalized, in which case the basis is ortho''gonal'' but not ortho''normal''. However, orthonormal bases are easier to manipulate and are often used in practice. The following results are true for orthonormal bases, not orthogonal ones.

In one rectangular coordinate system, '''x''' as a contravector has coordinates ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, while as a covector it has coordinates ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and basis covectors '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, and we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=x^i\mathbf{e}_i\,,\quad \mathbf{x}=x_i\mathbf{e}^i&lt;/math&gt;

In another rectangular coordinate system, '''x''' as a contravector has coordinates ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and bases {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, while as a covector it has coordinates ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and bases {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, and we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\bar{x}^i\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\,,\quad \mathbf{x}=\bar{x}_i\bar{\mathbf{e}}^i&lt;/math&gt;

Each new coordinate is a function of all the old ones, and vice versa for the [[inverse function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}{}^i=\bar{x}{}^i\left(x^1,x^2,\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad x{}^i = x{}^i\left(\bar{x}^1,\bar{x}^2,\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}{}_i=\bar{x}{}_i\left(x_1,x_2,\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad x{}_i = x{}_i\left(\bar{x}_1,\bar{x}_2,\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly each new basis vector is a function of all the old ones, and vice versa for the inverse function:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}{}_j = \bar{\mathbf{e}}{}_j\left(\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{e}{}_j = \mathbf{e}{}_j \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}_1,\bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}{}^j = \bar{\mathbf{e}}{}^j\left(\mathbf{e}^1,\mathbf{e}^2\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{e}{}^j = \mathbf{e}{}^j \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}^1,\bar{\mathbf{e}}^2\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''i'', ''j''.

A vector is invariant under any change of basis, so if coordinates transform according to a [[transformation matrix]] '''L''', the bases transform according to the [[matrix inverse]] '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and conversely if the coordinates transform according to inverse '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the bases transform according to the matrix '''L'''. The difference between each of these transformations is shown conventionally through the indices as superscripts for contravariance and subscripts for covariance, and the coordinates and bases are [[linear transformation|linearly transformed]] according to the following rules:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Vector elements
! Contravariant transformation law
! Covariant transformation law

| &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^j = x^i (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}})_i{}^j = x^i \mathsf{L}_i{}^j&lt;/math&gt;

|-

|-

| &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_j \bar{\mathbf{e}}^j = x_i (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_j{}^i \mathsf{L}_k{}^j \mathbf{e}^k = x_i \delta^i{}_k \mathbf{e}^k = x_i \mathbf{e}^i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

where L&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; represents the entries of the [[transformation matrix]] (row number is ''i'' and column number is ''j'') and ('''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the entries of the [[inverse matrix]] of the matrix L&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

If '''L''' is an [[orthogonal transformation]] ([[orthogonal matrix]]), the objects transforming by it are defined as '''Cartesian tensors'''. This geometrically has the interpretation that a rectangular coordinate system is mapped to another rectangular coordinate system, in which the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the vector '''x''' is preserved (and distances are preserved).

The [[determinant]] of '''L''' is det('''L''') = ±1, which corresponds to two types of orthogonal transformation: (+1) for [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] and (−1) for [[improper rotation]]s (including [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s).

There are considerable algebraic simplifications, the [[matrix transpose]] is the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] from the definition of an orthogonal transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\Rightarrow(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_i{}^j=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}})_i{}^j=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}})^j{}_i=\mathsf{L}^j{}_i&lt;/math&gt;

From the previous table, orthogonal transformations of covectors and contravectors are identical. There is no need to differ between [[raising and lowering indices]], and in this context and applications to physics and engineering the indices are usually all subscripted to remove confusion for [[exponent]]s. All indices will be lowered in the remainder of this article. One can determine the actual raised and lowered indices by considering which quantities are covectors or contravectors, and the relevant transformation rules.

Exactly the same transformation rules apply to any vector '''a''', not only the position vector. If its components ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; do not transform according to the rules, '''a''' is not a vector.

Despite the similarity between the expressions above, for the change of coordinates such as {{nowrap|''{{overline|x}}&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, and the action of a tensor on a vector like {{nowrap|''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, '''L''' is not a tensor, but '''T''' is. In the change of coordinates, '''L''' is a ''matrix'', used to relate two rectangular coordinate systems with orthonormal bases together. For the tensor relating a vector to a vector, the vectors and tensors throughout the equation all belong to the same coordinate system and basis.

===Derivatives and Jacobian matrix elements===

The entries of '''L''' are [[partial derivative]]s of the new or old coordinates with respect to the old or new coordinates, respectively.

Differentiating ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{x}_i}{\partial x_k}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}(x_j \mathsf{L}_{ji})=\mathsf{L}_{ji}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial x_k}= \delta_{kj}\mathsf{L}_{ji} = \mathsf{L}_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L}_i{}^j \equiv \mathsf{L}_{ij} = \frac{\partial\bar{x}_j}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

is an element of the [[Jacobian matrix]]. There is a (partially mnemonical) correspondence between index positions attached to '''L''' and in the partial derivative: ''i'' at the top and ''j'' at the bottom, in each case, although for Cartesian tensors the indices can be lowered.

Conversely, differentiating ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial\bar{x}_k}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{x}_k}(\bar{x}_i(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij})=\frac{\partial\bar{x}_i}{\partial\bar{x}_k}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=\delta_{ki} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;
 
so

:&lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_i{}^j \equiv (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial\bar{x}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

is an element of the inverse Jacobian matrix, with a similar index correspondence.
 
Many sources state transformations in terms of the partial derivatives:

{{Equation box 1

\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the explicit matrix equations in 3d are:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}\bar{x}_1\\
\bar{x}_2\\
\bar{x}_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_3}\\
\frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_3}\\
\frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_3}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

similarly for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}\bar{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Projections along coordinate axes===

[[File:Rectangular coordinate systems angles index lowered.svg|500px|thumb|'''Top:''' Angles from the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes to the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes. '''Bottom:''' Vice versa.]]

As with all linear transformations, '''L''' depends on the basis chosen. For two orthonormal bases

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j=\delta_{ij}\,,\quad\left|\mathbf{e}_i\right|=\left|\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\right|=1\,,&lt;/math&gt;
 
* projecting '''x''' to the ''{{overline|x}}'' axes: &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_i=\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{x}=\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot x_j\mathbf{e}_j=x_i \mathsf{L}_{ij} \,, &lt;/math&gt;
* projecting '''x''' to the ''x'' axes: &lt;math&gt;x_i=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{x}_j\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\bar{x}_j(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ji} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the components reduce to [[direction cosine]]s between the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L}_{ij} = \bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j=\cos\theta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\cos\theta_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the angles between the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes. In general, ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not equal to ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'', because for example ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; are two different angles.

The transformation of coordinates can be written:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
\bar{x}_j = x_i \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j \right) = x_i\cos\theta_{ij}\\
\upharpoonleft\downharpoonright\\
x_j = \bar{x}_i \left( \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j \right) = \bar{x}_i\cos\theta_{ji}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour=white}}

and the explicit matrix equations in 3d are:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\bar{x}_1\\
\bar{x}_2\\
\bar{x}_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_3\\
\bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_3\\
\bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_3
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_{11} &amp; \cos\theta_{12} &amp; \cos\theta_{13}\\
\cos\theta_{21} &amp; \cos\theta_{22} &amp; \cos\theta_{23}\\
\cos\theta_{31} &amp; \cos\theta_{32} &amp; \cos\theta_{33}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

similarly for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}\bar{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric interpretation is the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' components equal to the sum of projecting the ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' components onto the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes.

The numbers '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; arranged into a matrix would form a [[symmetric matrix]] (a matrix equal to its own transpose) due to the symmetry in the dot products, in fact it is the [[metric tensor]] '''g'''. By contrast '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;{{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; or {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; do ''not'' form symmetric matrices in general, as displayed above. Therefore, while the '''L''' matrices are still orthogonal, they are not symmetric.

Apart from a rotation about any one axis, in which the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for some ''i'' coincide, the angles are not the same as [[Euler angle]]s, and so the '''L''' matrices are not the same as the [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].

==Transformation of the dot and cross products (three dimensions only)==

The [[dot product]] and [[cross product]] occur very frequently, in applications of vector analysis to physics and engineering, examples include:

*[[power (physics)|power]] transferred ''P'' by an object exerting a force '''F''' with velocity '''v''' along a straight-line path: 
::&lt;math&gt;P = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;
*tangential [[velocity]] '''v''' at a point '''x''' of a rotating [[rigid body]] with [[angular velocity]] '''ω''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[potential energy]] ''U'' of a [[magnetic dipole]] of [[magnetic moment]] '''m''' in a uniform external [[magnetic field]] '''B''': 
::&lt;math&gt;U=-\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[angular momentum]] '''J''' for a particle with [[position vector]] '''r''' and [[momentum]] '''p''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[torque]] '''τ''' acting on an [[electric dipole]] of [[electric dipole moment]] '''p''' in a uniform external [[electric field]] '''E''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;
*induced surface [[current density]] '''j'''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; in a magnetic material of [[magnetization]] '''M''' on a surface with [[unit normal]] '''n''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}_\mathrm{S} = \mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;

How these products transform under orthogonal transformations is illustrated below.

===Dot product, Kronecker delta, and metric tensor===

The [[dot product]] &amp;sdot; of each possible pairing of the basis vectors follows from the basis being orthonormal. For perpendicular pairs we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; = \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\\
\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &amp; =0
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

while for parallel pairs we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x}=\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y}=\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z}=1 .&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing Cartesian labels by index notation as shown [[#indices replace labels|above]], these results can be summarized by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j = \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the components of the [[Kronecker delta]]. The Cartesian basis can be used to represent ''δ'' in this way.

In addition, each [[metric tensor]] component ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to any basis is the dot product of a pairing of basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j .&lt;/math&gt;

For the Cartesian basis the components arranged into a matrix are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = \begin{pmatrix} 
g_\text{xx} &amp; g_\text{xy} &amp; g_\text{xz} \\
g_\text{yx} &amp; g_\text{yy} &amp; g_\text{zz} \\
g_\text{zx} &amp; g_\text{zy} &amp; g_\text{zz} \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so are the simplest possible for the metric tensor, namely the [[identity matrix|''δ'']]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

This is ''not'' true for general bases: [[orthogonal coordinates]] have [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] metrics containing various scale factors (i.e. not necessarily 1), while general [[curvilinear coordinates]] could also have nonzero entries for off-diagonal components.

The dot product of two vectors '''a''' and '''b''' transforms according to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = \bar{a}_j \bar{b}_j = a_i \mathsf{L}_{ij} b_k(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jk} = a_i \delta_i{}_k b_k = a_i b_i &lt;/math&gt;

which is intuitive, since the dot product of two vectors is a single scalar independent of any coordinates. This also applies more generally to any coordinate systems, not just rectangular ones; the dot product in one coordinate system is the same in any other.

===Cross and product, Levi-Civita symbol, and pseudovectors===

For the [[cross product]] × of two vectors, the results are (almost) the other way round. Again, assuming a right-handed 3d Cartesian coordinate system, [[cyclic permutation]]s in perpendicular directions yield the next vector in the cyclic collection of vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y} = \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x} = \mathbf{e}_\text{y}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x} = - \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y} = -\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = -\mathbf{e}_\text{y}&lt;/math&gt;

while parallel vectors clearly vanish:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x}=\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y}=\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

and replacing Cartesian labels by index notation as [[#indices replace labels|above]], these can be summarized by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\times\mathbf{e}_j=\left [ \begin{array}{cc}
+\mathbf{e}_k &amp; \text{cyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2) \\
-\mathbf{e}_k &amp; \text{anticyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (2,1,3), (3,2,1), (1,3,2) \\
\boldsymbol{0} &amp; i=j
\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are indices which take values 1, 2, 3. It follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{e}_k\cdot\mathbf{e}_i\times\mathbf{e}_j}=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
+1 &amp; \text{cyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2) \\
-1 &amp; \text{anticyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (2,1,3), (3,2,1), (1,3,2) \\
0 &amp; i=j\text{ or }j=k\text{ or }k=i
\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

These permutation relations and their corresponding values are important, and there is an object coinciding with this property: the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], denoted by ''ε''. The Levi-Civita symbol entries can be represented by the Cartesian basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot \mathbf{e}_j\times\mathbf{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;

which geometrically corresponds to the [[volume]] of a [[cube]] spanned by the orthonormal basis vectors, with sign indicating [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]] (and ''not'' a "positive or negative volume"). Here, the orientation is fixed by ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; = +1, for a right-handed system. A left-handed system would fix ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; = −1 or equivalently ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;321&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.

The [[scalar triple product]] can now be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = c_i\mathbf{e}_i \cdot a_j\mathbf{e}_j \times b_k\mathbf{e}_k = \varepsilon_{ijk} c_i a_j b_k  &lt;/math&gt;

with the geometric interpretation of volume (of the [[parallelepiped]] spanned by '''a''', '''b''', '''c''') and algebraically is a [[determinant]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|edition=2nd|author1=M. R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipcshutz |author3=D. Spellman | title=Vector analysis| series=Schaum’s Outlines|publisher=McGraw Hill |page=23|year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} c_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{x} &amp; b_\text{x} \\ c_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{y} &amp; b_\text{y} \\ c_\text{z} &amp; a_\text{z} &amp; b_\text{z} \end{vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This in turn can be used to rewrite the [[cross product]] of two vectors as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ll}
&amp; (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})_i = {\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}} = \varepsilon_{\ell jk} {(\mathbf{e}_i)}_\ell a_j b_k = \varepsilon_{\ell jk} \delta_{i \ell} a_j b_k = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k \\
\Rightarrow &amp; {\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}} = (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})_i \mathbf{e}_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k \mathbf{e}_i 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Contrary to its appearance, the Levi-Civita symbol is ''not a tensor'', but a [[pseudotensor]], the components transform according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\varepsilon}_{pqr} = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \varepsilon_{ijk} \mathsf{L}_{ip}\mathsf{L}_{jq}\mathsf{L}_{kr} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the transformation of the cross product of '''a''' and '''b''' is:
&lt;!---PLEASE LEAVE THE SPACES \;\; FOR CLARITY, AND LEAVE IN ALL THE STEPS - CLARITY IS NOT "TEXTBOOKY" - THANKS---&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(\bar{\mathbf{a}} \times \bar{\mathbf{b}})_i &amp; = \bar{\varepsilon}_{ijk} \bar{a}_j \bar{b}_k \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \mathsf{L}_{pi}\mathsf{L}_{qj} \mathsf{L}_{rk} \;\; a_m \mathsf{L}_{mj} \;\; b_n \mathsf{L}_{nk} \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{qj} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jm} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{rk} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{kn} \;\; a_m \;\; b_n \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi}  \;\;  \delta_{qm} \;\; \delta_{rn} \;\; a_m \;\; b_n \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi}  \;\;  \varepsilon_{pqr} a_q b_r \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; (\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b})_p  \mathsf{L}_{pi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so '''a''' × '''b''' transforms as a [[pseudovector]], because of the determinant factor.

The [[tensor index notation]] applies to any object which has entities that form [[multidimensional array]]s – not everything with indices is a tensor by default. Instead, tensors are defined by how their coordinates and basis elements change under a transformation from one coordinate system to another.

Note the cross product of two vectors is a pseudovector, while the cross product of a pseudovector with a vector is another vector.

===Applications of the ''δ'' tensor and ''ε'' pseudotensor===

Other identities can be formed from the ''δ'' tensor and ''ε'' pseudotensor, a notable and very useful identity is one that converts two Levi-Civita symbols adjacently contracted over two indices into an antisymmetrized combination of Kronecker deltas:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon_{pqk} = \delta_{ip}\delta_{jq} - \delta_{iq}\delta_{jp} &lt;/math&gt;

The index forms of the dot and cross products, together with this identity, greatly facilitate the manipulation and derivation of other [[vector calculus identities|identities in vector calculus]] and algebra, which in turn are used extensively in physics and engineering. For instance, it is clear the dot and cross products are distributive over vector addition:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} ) =  a_i ( b_i + c_i ) =  a_i b_i + a_i c_i = \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{c} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{e}_i\varepsilon_{ijk} a_j ( b_k + c_k ) = \mathbf{e}_i \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k + \mathbf{e}_i \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j c_k = \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;

without resort to any geometric constructions - the derivation in each case is a quick line of algebra. Although the procedure is less obvious, the vector triple product can also be derived. Rewriting in index notation:

:&lt;math&gt; \left[ \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c})\right]_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j ( \varepsilon_{k \ell m} b_\ell c_m ) = (\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon_{k \ell m} ) a_j b_\ell c_m &lt;/math&gt;

and because cyclic permutations of indices in the ''ε'' symbol does not change its value, cyclically permuting indices in ''ε&lt;sub&gt;k{{ell}}m&lt;/sub&gt;'' to obtain ''ε&lt;sub&gt;{{ell}}mk&lt;/sub&gt;'' allows us to use the above ''δ''-''ε'' identity to convert the ''ε'' symbols into ''δ'' tensors:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\left[ \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c})\right]_i &amp; = ( \delta_{i\ell} \delta_{jm} - \delta_{im} \delta_{j\ell} ) a_j b_\ell c_m \\
&amp; = \delta_{i\ell} \delta_{jm} a_j b_\ell c_m - \delta_{im} \delta_{j\ell} a_j b_\ell c_m \\ 
&amp; = a_j b_i c_j -  a_j b_j c_i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

thusly:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{c})\mathbf{b} -  (\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Note this is antisymmetric in '''b''' and '''c''', as expected from the left hand side. Similarly, via index notation or even just cyclically relabelling '''a''', '''b''', and '''c''' in the previous result and taking the negative:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\times\mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{a})\mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{b})\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

and the difference in results show that the cross product is not associative. More complex identities, like quadruple products;

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\cdot(\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{d}), \quad (\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\times(\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{d}) ,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

and so on, can be derived in a similar manner.

==Transformations of Cartesian tensors (any number of dimensions)==

Tensors are defined as quantities which transform in a certain way under linear transformations of coordinates.

===Second order===
Text below contradics introduced above contravariant and covariant vectors (tensors)

Let '''a''' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''b''' = ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be two vectors, so that they transform according to ''{{overline|a}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''{{overline|b}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Taking the tensor product gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}=a_i\mathbf{e}_i\otimes b_j\mathbf{e}_j=a_i b_j\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

then applying the transformation to the components

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a}_p\bar{b}_q= a_i \mathsf{L}_i{}_p b_j \mathsf{L}_j{}_q = \mathsf{L}_i{}_p\mathsf{L}_j{}_q a_i b_j &lt;/math&gt;

and to the bases

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj}\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j = \mathsf{L}_{ip} \mathsf{L}_{jq} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j&lt;/math&gt;

gives the transformation law of an order-2 tensor. The tensor '''a'''&amp;otimes;'''b''' is invariant under this transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{cl}
\bar{a}_p\bar{b}_q\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q &amp; = \mathsf{L}_{kp} \mathsf{L}_{\ell q} a_k b_{\ell} \, (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = \mathsf{L}_{kp} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi} \mathsf{L}_{\ell q} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{q j} \, a_k b_{\ell} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = \delta_k{}_i \delta_{\ell j}  \, a_k b_{\ell} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = a_ib_j\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for any order-2 tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=R_{ij}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{R}_{pq}=\mathsf{L}_i{}_p\mathsf{L}_j{}_q R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;,

and the basis transforms by:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ip}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jq}\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

If '''R''' does not transform according to this rule - whatever quantity '''R''' may be, it's not an order 2 tensor.

===Any order===

More generally, for any order ''p'' tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_p} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}_{j_p}&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{T}_{j_1j_2\cdots j_p} = \mathsf{L}_{i_1 j_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2 j_2}\cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p j_p} T_{i_1 i_2\cdots i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

and the basis transforms by:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_1}\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_2}\cdots\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_p}=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_1 i_1}\mathbf{e}_{i_1}\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_2 i_2}\mathbf{e}_{i_2}\cdots\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_p i_p}\mathbf{e}_{i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[pseudotensor]] '''S''' of order ''p'', the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{S}_{j_1j_2\cdots j_p} = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \mathsf{L}_{i_1 j_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2 j_2}\cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p j_p} S_{i_1 i_2\cdots i_p}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Pseudovectors as antisymmetric second order tensors==

The antisymmetric nature of the cross product can be recast into a tensorial form as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=classical mechanics|year=1973|publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|series=European physics series|pages=234–235|author=T. W. B. Kibble|isbn=978-0-07-084018-8}}, see Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; Let '''c''' be a vector, '''a''' be a pseudovector, '''b''' be another vector, and '''T''' be a second order tensor such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{b} &lt;/math&gt;

As the cross product is linear in '''a''' and '''b''', the components of '''T''' can be found by inspection, and they are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - a_\text{z} &amp; a_\text{y} \\
a_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - a_\text{x} \\
- a_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so the pseudovector '''a''' can be written as an antisymmetric tensor. This transforms as a tensor, not a pseudotensor. For the mechanical example above for the tangential velocity of a rigid body, given by {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''ω''' × '''x'''}}, this can be rewritten as {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''Ω''' · '''x'''}} where '''Ω''' is the tensor corresponding to the pseudovector '''ω''':

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - \omega_\text{z} &amp; \omega_\text{y} \\
\omega_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - \omega_\text{x} \\
- \omega_\text{y} &amp; \omega_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

For an example in [[electromagnetism]], while the [[electric field]] '''E''' is a [[vector field]], the [[magnetic field]] '''B''' is a pseudovector field. These fields are defined from the [[Lorentz force]] for a particle of [[electric charge]] ''q'' traveling at velocity '''v''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) = q(\mathbf{E} - \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;

and considering the second term containing the cross product of a pseudovector '''B''' and velocity vector '''v''', it can be written in matrix form, with '''F''', '''E''', and '''v''' as column vectors and '''B''' as an antisymmetric matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}
F_\text{x} \\
F_\text{y} \\
F_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} = q\begin{pmatrix}
E_\text{x} \\
E_\text{y} \\
E_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} - q \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - B_\text{z} &amp; B_\text{y} \\
B_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - B_\text{x} \\
- B_\text{y} &amp; B_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
v_\text{x} \\
v_\text{y} \\
v_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If a pseudovector is explicitly given by a cross product of two vectors (as opposed to entering the cross product with another vector), then such pseudovectors can also be written as antisymmetric tensors of second order, with each entry a component of the cross product. The angular momentum of a classical pointlike particle orbiting about an axis, defined by {{nowrap|'''J''' {{=}} '''x''' × '''p'''}}, is another example of a pseudovector, with corresponding antisymmetric tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - J_\text{z} &amp; J_\text{y} \\
J_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - J_\text{x} \\
- J_\text{y} &amp; J_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - (x p_\text{y} - y p_\text{x}) &amp; (z p_\text{x} - x p_\text{z}) \\
(x p_\text{y} - y p_\text{x}) &amp; 0 &amp; - (y p_\text{z} - z p_\text{y}) \\
- (z p_\text{x} - x p_\text{z}) &amp; (y p_\text{z} - z p_\text{y}) &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Although Cartesian tensors do not occur in the theory of relativity; the tensor form of orbital angular momentum '''J''' enters the spacelike part of the [[relativistic angular momentum]] tensor, and the above tensor form of the magnetic field '''B''' enters the spacelike part of the [[electromagnetic tensor]].

==Vector and tensor calculus==

It should be emphasized the following formulae are only so simple in Cartesian coordinates - in general curvilinear coordinates there are factors of the metric and its determinant - see [[tensors in curvilinear coordinates]] for more general analysis.

===Vector calculus===

Following are the differential operators of [[vector calculus]]. Throughout, left Φ('''r''', ''t'') be a [[scalar field]], and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t) = A_\text{x}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + A_\text{y}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + A_\text{z}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t) = B_\text{x}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + B_\text{y}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + B_\text{z}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{z}&lt;/math&gt;

be [[vector field]]s, in which all scalar and vector fields are functions of the [[position vector]] '''r''' and time ''t''.

The [[gradient]] operator in Cartesian coordinates is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} +  \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} &lt;/math&gt;

and in index notation, this is usually abbreviated in various ways:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \equiv \partial_i \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

This operator acts on a scalar field Φ to obtain the vector field directed in the maximum rate of increase of Φ:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\Phi\right)_i = \nabla_i \Phi &lt;/math&gt;

The index notation for the dot and cross products carries over to the differential operators of vector calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|edition=2nd|author1=M. R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipcshutz |author3=D. Spellman | title=Vector analysis| series=Schaum’s Outlines|publisher=McGraw Hill |page=197| year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[directional derivative]] of a scalar field Φ is the rate of change of Φ along some direction vector '''a''' (not necessarily a [[unit vector]]), formed out of the components of '''a''' and the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot(\nabla\Phi) = a_j (\nabla\Phi)_j &lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a vector field '''A''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A} = \nabla_i A_i &lt;/math&gt;

Note the interchange of the components of the gradient and vector field yields a different differential operator

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\cdot\nabla =  A_i \nabla_i &lt;/math&gt;

which could act on scalar or vector fields. In fact, if '''A''' is replaced by the [[velocity field]] '''u'''('''r''', ''t'') of a fluid, this is a term in the [[material derivative]] (with many other names) of [[continuum mechanics]], with another term being the partial time derivative:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D}{D t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt;

which usually acts on the velocity field leading to the non-linearity in the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].

As for the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field '''A''', this can be defined as a pseudovector field by means of the ''ε'' symbol:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\right)_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} \nabla_j A_k &lt;/math&gt;

which is only valid in three dimensions, or an antisymmetric tensor field of second order via antisymmetrization of indices, indicated by delimiting the antisymmetrized indices by square brackets (see [[Ricci calculus]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\right)_{ij} = \nabla_i A_j - \nabla_j A_i = 2\nabla_{[i} A_{j]}&lt;/math&gt;

which is valid in any number of dimensions. In each case, the order of the gradient and vector field components should not be interchanged as this would result in a different differential operator:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ijk} A_j \nabla_k &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_i \nabla_j - A_j \nabla_i = 2 A_{[i} \nabla_{j]} &lt;/math&gt;

which could act on scalar or vector fields.

Finally, the [[Laplacian operator]] is defined in two ways, the divergence of the gradient of a scalar field Φ:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot(\nabla \Phi) = \nabla_i (\nabla_i \Phi) &lt;/math&gt;

or the square of the gradient operator, which acts on a scalar field Φ or a vector field '''A''':

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot\nabla) \Phi = (\nabla_i \nabla_i) \Phi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot\nabla) \mathbf{A} = (\nabla_i \nabla_i) \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

In physics and engineering, the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian operator arise inevitably in [[fluid mechanics]], [[Newtonian gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[heat conduction]], and even [[quantum mechanics]].

Vector calculus identities can be derived in a similar way to those of vector dot and cross products and combinations. For example, in three dimensions, the curl of a cross product of two vector fields '''A''' and '''B''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[\nabla\times(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B})\right]_i &amp; = \varepsilon_{ijk} \nabla_j (\varepsilon_{k\ell m} A_\ell B_m) \\
&amp; = (\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon_{\ell m k} ) \nabla_j (A_\ell B_m) \\
&amp; = (\delta_{i\ell}\delta_{jm} - \delta_{im}\delta_{j\ell}) (B_m \nabla_j A_\ell + A_\ell \nabla_j B_m ) \\
&amp; = (B_j \nabla_j A_i  + A_i \nabla_j B_j ) - (B_i \nabla_j A_j + A_j \nabla_j B_i ) \\
&amp; = (B_j \nabla_j)A_i  + A_i(\nabla_j B_j ) - B_i (\nabla_j A_j ) - (A_j \nabla_j) B_i \\
&amp; = \left[(\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{A}  + \mathbf{A}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}) - \mathbf{B}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A} ) - (\mathbf{A}\cdot \nabla) \mathbf{B} \right]_i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[product rule]] was used, and throughout the differential operator was not interchanged with '''A''' or '''B'''. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}) = (\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{A}  + \mathbf{A}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}) - \mathbf{B}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A} ) - (\mathbf{A}\cdot \nabla) \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

===Tensor calculus===

One can continue the operations on tensors of higher order. Let '''T''' = '''T'''('''r''', ''t'') denote a second order tensor field, again dependent on the position vector '''r''' and time ''t''.

For instance, the gradient of a vector field in two equivalent notations ("dyadic" and "tensor", respectively) is:

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \mathbf{A})_{ij} \equiv (\nabla \otimes \mathbf{A})_{ij} = \nabla_i A_j &lt;/math&gt;

which is a tensor field of second order.

The divergence of a tensor is:

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{T})_j = \nabla_i T_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

which is a vector field. This arises in continuum mechanics in [[Continuum mechanics#Governing equations|Cauchy's laws of motion]] - the divergence of the Cauchy stress tensor '''σ''' is a vector field, related to [[body force]]s acting on the fluid.

==Difference from the standard tensor calculus==

Cartesian tensors are as in [[tensor algebra]], but [[Euclidean space#Euclidean structure|Euclidean structure]] of and restriction of the basis brings some simplifications compared to the general theory.

The general tensor algebra consists of general [[mixed tensor]]s of type (''p'', ''q''):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}^{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p} \mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q} &lt;/math&gt;

with basis elements:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q} = \mathbf{e}_{i_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}_{i_p}\otimes\mathbf{e}^{j_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}^{j_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}^{j_q}&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{T}_{\ell_1 \ell_2 \cdots \ell_q}^{k_1 k_2 \cdots k_p} = \mathsf{L}_{i_1}{}^{k_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2}{}^{k_2} \cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p}{}^{k_p} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_1}{}^{j_1}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_2}{}^{j_2} \cdots (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_q}{}^{j_q} T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}^{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

as for the bases:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{k_1 k_2 \cdots k_p}^{\ell_1 \ell_2 \cdots \ell_q} = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_1}{}^{i_1} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_2}{}^{i_2} \cdots (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_p}{}^{i_p} \mathsf{L}_{j_1}{}^{\ell_1} \mathsf{L}_{j_2}{}^{\ell_2} \cdots \mathsf{L}_{j_q}{}^{\ell_q} \mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}&lt;/math&gt;

For Cartesian tensors, only the order {{nowrap|''p'' + ''q''}} of the tensor matters in a Euclidean space with an orthonormal basis, and all {{nowrap|''p'' + ''q''}} indices can be lowered.  A Cartesian basis does not exist unless the vector space has a positive-definite metric, and thus cannot be used in [[special relativity|relativistic]] contexts.

==History==

[[Dyadic tensor]]s were historically the first approach to formulating second-order tensors, similarly triadic tensors for third-order tensors, and so on. Cartesian tensors use [[tensor index notation]], in which the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|variance]] may be glossed over and is often ignored, since the components remain unchanged by [[raising and lowering indices]].

The word '''character sketch''' means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.

The first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style.   As Pat Rogers notes, [[Henry Fielding]], in book I, chapter 14 of ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'', invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: "Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture." Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.

In later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical.  Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of "Big John" or "the country rube" or "the wise Squire").  Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.

Today, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.

==Building==

The Copernicus Science Centre building has been erected on the bank of the [[Vistula River]] in the very heart of [[Warsaw]] (the corner of Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie and Zajęcza streets, above the Wisłostrada tunnel). The building design was developed by young Polish architects from the firm RAr-2 in Ruda Śląska, who won an architectural competition for the Copernicus Science Centre facility in December 2005, with engineers [[Buro Happold]].

The Centre complex comprises: 
* a two-storey building with total floor-space of 15,000 square metres housing permanent and temporary exhibitions, laboratories and workshops, a conference centre, cafes and restaurants, plus office space and a distinctive rooftop garden
* a garage and a workshop on a subterranean level
* a multimedia planetarium housed within an intriguing boulder-shaped building, including an observation deck
* a surrounding Discovery Park, including open-air experimentation stations, an outdoor art gallery, and an amphitheatre.

==Permanent Exhibition==

Permanent Exhibition in the Copernicus Science Centre consists of over 400 interactive exhibits. The exhibition is divided into six sections concerning various fields of knowledge:

* On the Move
* Humans and the Environment
* Buzzz! - gallery for preschool children
* Lightzone
* Roots of Civilization
* RE: generation - gallery for young adults

==Planetarium The Heavens of Copernicus==

The Heavens of Copernicus is a modern planetarium where you can see more than just images of the starry sky and related films. The shows concern a variety of popular science issues, including from the field of astronomy, natural science and ethnography.

The shows are displayed on a spherical screen surrounding the audience on all sides. Thanks to this solution, the audience experiences a feeling of immersion in the displayed world, which is strengthened by the high quality sound system deployed around the dome.

==The ''Experiment!'' Exhibition and other activities of the Centre==
''Experiment!'' is the first exhibition to be organized by the Copernicus Science Centre. It made its premiere appearance at the [[Warsaw]] [[Science Picnic]] in June 2006, where more than 10,000 individuals visited it in a single day. Since September 2006, it has been traveling around large cities and small towns to give their residents an opportunity to try out the hands-on experiments on their own.

The Copernicus Science Centre also organizes ''Family Workshops'', where children (5–8 years old) together with their parents or carers can carry out experiments to help them better understand everyday phenomena (e.g. ''where does the current in electrical outlets come from, how does a TV set work or why does yeast make dough rise''). The children can easily repeat the experiments themselves at home.

The Centre takes part in various events popularizing science: the ''Summer'' and ''Winter in the City'' events, ''Science Festivals'' and the ''Summer with Radio'' event. For teachers, the Copernicus Science Centre organizes trainings and competitions.

==Form of organization==
The Copernicus Science Centre is a cultural institution established and financed by the [[City of Warsaw]], the [[Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Poland)|Minister of Science and Higher Education]], and the [[Ministry of National Education (Poland)|Minister of National Education]].

A '''dominant culture''' is a cultural practice that is [[Dominance hierarchy|dominant]]  within a particular political, social or economic entity, in which multiple cultures are present. It may refer to a [[language]], [[religion]]/[[ritual]], [[value (ethics)|social value]]  and/or [[social custom]]. These features are often a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] for an entire [[society]]. It achieves dominance by being perceived as pertaining to a majority of the population and having a significant presence in institutions relating to communication, education, artistic expression, law, government and business. The concept of "dominant culture" is generally used in academic discourse in fields such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and [[cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-dominantculture.html|title= A Dictionary of Sociology | year=1998|author=Gordon Marshall|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture that is dominant within a particular [[geopolitical entity]] can change over time in response to internal or external factors, but one is usually very resilient and able to reproduce itself effectively from generation to generation.  In a [[multicultural]] society, various cultures are celebrated and respected equally. A dominant culture can be promoted deliberately and by the suppression of [[minority culture]]s or [[subculture]]s.

==Examples and applications==

===Native American studies===
In the [[United States]], a distinction is often made between the [[indigenous culture]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and a dominant culture that may be described as "Anglo", "white", "middle class", and so on.  Some Native Americans are seen as being part of the culture of their own [[Native American tribe|tribe]], community, or family, while simultaneously participating in the dominant culture of America as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= |date=May 1974 |title=The Native American in Juvenile Fiction: Teacher Perception  of Stereotypes |url=http://jaie.asu.edu/v13/V13S2tea.html |journal=Journal of American Indian Education |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages= |author=Maria Falkenhagen and Inga K.

[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|UN Flag|The Earth Summit was a [[United Nations|UN]] event]] 

The '''United Nations Conference on Environment and Development''' ('''UNCED'''), also known as the '''Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit''', the '''Rio Summit''', the '''Rio Conference''', and the '''Earth Summit''' (Portuguese: ECO92), was a major [[United Nations]] [[diplomatic conference|conference]] held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] from 3 to 14 June 1992.

More than 100 heads of states met in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil...Earth Summit was created as a response for [[Member States]] to cooperate together internationally on development issues after the [[Cold War]]. Due to conflict relating to [[sustainability]] being too big for individual member states to handle, Earth Summit was held as a platform for other Member States to collaborate. Since the creation, many others in the field of sustainability show a similar development to the issues discussed in these conferences, including [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/intro.html|title=World Conferences Introduction|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310135935/http://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/intro.html|archivedate=10 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 2012, the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] was also held in Rio, and is also commonly called Rio+20 or Rio Earth Summit 2012. It was held from 13 to 22 June.



The issues addressed included:   
* systematic scrutiny of patterns of production — particularly the production of toxic components, such as [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] in [[gasoline]], or poisonous waste including radioactive chemicals 
* alternative sources of energy to replace the use of [[fossil fuel]]s which delegates linked to global [[climate change]]
* new reliance on [[public transportation]] systems in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the health problems caused by polluted air and smoke
* the growing usage and limited supply of [[water]]

An important achievement of the summit was an agreement on the [[Climate Change Convention]] which in turn led to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the [[Paris Agreement]]. Another agreement was to "not to carry out any activities on the lands of [[indigenous peoples]] that would cause [[environmental degradation]] or that would be culturally inappropriate".

The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] was opened for signature at the Earth Summit, and made a start towards redefinition of measures that did not inherently encourage destruction of natural [[ecoregion]]s and so-called [[uneconomic growth]].

Although President [[George H.W. Bush]] signed the Earth Summit’s Convention on Climate, his EPA Administrator William K. Reilly acknowledges that U.S. goals at the conference were difficult to negotiate and the agency’s international results were mixed, including the U.S. failure to sign the proposed Convention on Biological Diversity. &lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William K. Reilly discusses his efforts at the Rio conference, including successes and failures. Reflections on US Environmental Policy: An Interview with William K. Reilly [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=37 Video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006045952/http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=37 |date=6 October 2016 }}, [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/3E0FC143699CD31B.pdf#page=6 Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006042006/http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/3E0FC143699CD31B.pdf |date=6 October 2016 }} (see pages 6,7).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Twelve cities were also honoured by the Local Government Honours Award for innovative local environmental programs. These included [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] in [[Canada]] for its ambitious program to rehabilitate environmental damage from the local [[mining]] industry, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in the [[United States]] for its [[green building]] strategy, and [[Kitakyūshū]] in [[Japan]] for incorporating an international education and training component into its municipal [[pollution control]] program.

The Earth Summit resulted in the following documents:

* ''[[Forest Principles]]''

Moreover, important legally binding agreements ([[Rio Convention]]) were opened for signature:
* ''[[Convention on Biological Diversity]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbd.int |title=CBD Home |publisher=Cbd.int |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223150753/http://www.cbd.int |archivedate=23 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC)''
* ''[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]]''

In order to ensure compliance to the agreements at Rio (particularly the ''[[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]]'' and ''[[Agenda 21]]''), delegates to the Earth Summit established the ''[[Commission on Sustainable Development]]'' (CSD). In 2013, the CSD was replaced by the ''[[High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development]]'' that meets every year as part of the ECOSOC meetings, and every fourth year as part of the General Assembly meetings.

Critics point out that many of the agreements made in Rio have not been realized regarding such fundamental issues as fighting [[poverty]] and cleaning up the [[Natural environment|environment]].

[[Green Cross International]] was founded to build upon the work of the Summit.

The first edition of Water Quality Assessments, published by WHO/[[Chapman &amp; Hall]], was launched at the Rio Global Forum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">{{Linguistics}}
'''Ecolinguistics''', or '''ecological linguistics''', emerged in the 1990s as a new [[paradigm|frame of study]] of linguistic research, widening [[sociolinguistics]] to take into account not only the social context in which language is embedded, but also the [[ecology|ecological]] context.

[[Michael Halliday]]'s 1990 paper ''New ways of Meaning: the challenge to applied linguistics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.|first=Halliday, M. A.|date=April 1990|title=New Ways of Meaning: A Challenge to Applied Linguistics.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED324960}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often credited as a seminal work which provided the stimulus for linguists to consider the ecological context and consequences of language. Among other things, the challenge that Halliday put forward was to make linguistics relevant to overarching contemporary issues, particularly the widespread destruction of the [[ecosystem]]s that life depends on. The main example Halliday gave was that of 'economic growth', describing how 'countless texts repeated daily all around the world contain a simple message: growth is good. Many is better than few, more is better than less, big is better than small, grow is better than shrink', which leads to ecologically destructive consequences. 

==Overview==
Since Halliday's initial comments, the field of ecolinguistics has developed in several directions, employing a wide range of linguistic frameworks and tools to investigate language in an ecological context. The [http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ International Ecolinguistics Association], characterizes ecolinguistics in these terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ecolinguistics explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org|title=The International Ecolinguistics Association|website=ecolinguistics-association.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, the 'eco' of ecolinguistics corresponds to ecology in its literal sense of the relationship of organisms (including humans) with other organisms and the physical environment. This is a sense shared with other ecological humanities disciplines such as ecocriticism and ecopsychology.

The term 'ecolinguistics' has also been used with a metaphorical sense of 'ecology', for example in '[[Linguistic ecology]]', 'communication ecology' and 'learning ecology' in ways which do not include consideration of other species or the physical environment. This is becoming less prevalent now as ecolingusitics becomes increasingly understood as a form of ecological humanities/social science.

Another aspect of ecolinguistics is the influence of the natural world on language. In 1996, [[David Abram]]'s book, ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World,'' described how the wider ecology (or 'the more than human world') shapes language in oral cultures (Abram, 1996), helping people attune to their environment. On the other hand, writing has gradually alienated people in literate cultures from the natural world, to the extent that 'our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs' (1996:267).

Overall there are three main areas of interest for ecolinguistics. The first can be described as 'The Ecological Analysis of Language', the second 'Language Diversity', and the third 'The Influence of Ecology on Language'.

==Ecological analysis of language==

The ecological analysis of language draws on a wide range of linguistic tools including critical discourse analysis, framing theory, cognitive linguistics, identity theory, rhetoric and systemic functional grammar to reveal underlying worldviews or the 'stories we live by'. The stories we live by are cognitive structures in the minds of individuals or across a society (social cognition) which influence how people treat each other, other animals, plants, forests, rivers and the physical environment. The stories are questioned from an ecological perspective with reference to an ecological framework (or ecosophy), and judged to be beneficial in encouraging people to protect the ecosystems that life depends on, or destructive in encouraging behavior which damages those ecosystems. Ecolinguistics attempts to make a practical difference in the world through resisting destructive stories and contributing to the search for new stories to live by (Stibbe 2015). Stories which have been exposed and resisted by ecolinguistics include consumerist stories, stories of unlimited economic growth, advertising stories, stories of intensive farming, and stories which represent nature as a machine or a resource. Using Positive Discourse Analysis, ecolinguistics has also searched for new stories to live by through exploring nature writing, poetry, environmental writing and traditional and indigenous forms of language around the world.

This form of analysis started with the application of critical discourse analysis to texts about the environment and environmentalism, in order to reveal hidden assumptions and messages and comment on the effectiveness of these in achieving environmental aims (e.g. Harré et al. 1999). It then developed to include analysis of any discourse which has potential consequences for the future of ecosystems, such as neoliberal economic discourse or discursive constructions of consumerism, gender, politics, agriculture and nature (e.g. Goatly 2000). The cognitive approach and the term 'stories we live by' was introduced in Stibbe (2015), which describes eight kinds of story: ideology, framing, metaphor, evaluation, identity, conviction, salience and erasure. Approaches such as [[environmental communication]] and [[ecocriticism]] have broadly similar aims and techniques to this form of ecolinguistics.

==Language diversity==

Language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the relationship between diversity of local languages and biodiversity. This relationship arises because of the ecological wisdom (or cultural adaptation to the environment) that is encoded in local languages. The forces of globalisation and linguistic imperialism are allowing dominant language to spread, and replace these local languages (Nettle and Romaine 2000). This leads to a loss of both sustainable local cultures and the important [[Traditional ecological knowledge|ecological knowledge]] contained within their languages. One of the goals of ecolinguistic research is to protect both cultural diversity and the linguistic diversity that supports it (Terralingua 2016, Nettle and Romaine 2000, Harmond 1996, Mühlhaüsler 1995). This research is in line with the United Nations Environment Program's position that:

"Biodiversity also incorporates human cultural diversity, which can be affected by the same drivers as biodiversity, and which has impacts on the diversity of genes, other species, and ecosystems. (UNEP 2007)"

Nettle and Romaine (2000:166) write that 'Delicate tropical environments in particular must be managed with care and skill. It is indigenous peoples who have the relevant practical knowledge, since they have been successfully making a living in them for hundreds of generations. Much of this detailed knowledge about local ecosystems is encoded in indigenous language and rapidly being lost'. Mühlhaüsler (2003:60) describes how 'The rapid decline in the world's linguistic diversity thus must be regarded with apprehension by those who perceive the interconnection between linguistic and biological diversity'.

Overall, language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the correlation between the diversity of language and biological diversity, with the ecological wisdom embedded in local cultures being the link between the two.

==Influence of ecology on language==

Abram's early chapter on "The Flesh of Language"  examined the contribution of the sensate body—and of the body's ongoing interaction with the earthly terrain—in the emergence of meaningful speech. A longer chapter on "Animism and the Alphabet" contrasted the discourse of indigenous, oral cultures with the discourse of literate cultures. For oral cultures, the coherence of spoken language is inseparable from the coherence of the surrounding ecology, from the expressive vitality of the more-than-human terrain. For these peoples "it is the animate earth that speaks; human speech is but a part of that vaster discourse." (p.&amp;nbsp;179) A subsequent chapter, entitled "In the Landscape of Language," drew examples from a range of divergent oral cultures to show some of the diverse ways that the local, more-than-human terrain informs and influences the discursive speech of oral cultures. Overall, Abram argues that ecology plays a key role in shaping human language in oral cultures, but with writing this role becomes less and less significant. This results in a situation where ‘our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs’ (1996:267). He therefore argues for using language in ways which bring ecology (or the 'more-than-human-world') back into language:

"there can be no question of simply abandoning literacy, of turning away from all writing. Our task, rather, is that of taking up the written word, with all of its potency, and patiently, carefully, writing language back into the land. Our craft is that of releasing the budded, earthy intelligence of our words, freeing them to respond to the speech of the things themselves - to the green uttering-forth of leaves from the spring branches." (Abram 1996:273)

'''Edwards Air Force Base''' ('''AFB''') {{airport codes|EDW|KEDW|EDW}} is a [[United States Air Force installation]] located in [[Kern County]] in [[Southern California|southern]] [[California]], about {{convert|22|mi}} northeast of [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] and {{convert|15|mi}} east of [[Rosamond, California|Rosamond]].

It is the home of the [[Air Force Test Center]], [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|Air Force Test Pilot School]], and [[NASA]]'s [[Armstrong Flight Research Center]]. It is the [[Air Force Materiel Command]] center for conducting and supporting research and development of flight, as well as testing and evaluating aerospace systems from concept to combat. It also hosts many test activities conducted by America's commercial aerospace industry.

==Overview==
[[File:Glen edwards.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Capt. [[Glen Edwards (pilot)|Glen Edwards]]]]
Previously known as [[Muroc, California|Muroc]] Air Force Base, Edwards AFB is named in honor of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Glen Edwards (pilot)|Glen Edwards]] (1918–1948). During [[World War II]], he flew [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20 Havoc]] light attack bombers in the [[North African Campaign|North African campaign]] on 50 hazardous, low-level missions against German tanks, convoys, troops, bridges, airfields, and other tactical targets. Edwards became a [[test pilot]] in 1943 and spent much of his time at Muroc Army Air Field, on California's high desert, testing wide varieties of experimental prototype aircraft. He died in the crash of a [[Northrop YB-49]] [[flying wing]] near Muroc AFB on 5 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Daniel: Glen Edwards: The Diary of a Bomber Pilot (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998) {{ISBN|1-56098-571-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base is next to [[Rogers Dry Lake]], an [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] desert [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pan]] whose hard [[dry lake]] surface provides a natural extension to Edwards' [[runway]]s. This large landing area, combined with excellent year-round weather, makes the base good for flight testing.  The lake is a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceID=1933&amp;resourceType=Site NHL Summary for Rogers Dry Lake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204115836/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceID=1933&amp;resourceType=Site |date=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base has helped develop virtually every aircraft purchased by the Air Force since World War II. Almost every [[United States Armed Forces|United States]] [[military aviation|military aircraft]] since the 1950s has been at least partially tested at Edwards, and it has been the site of many aviation breakthroughs.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Notable occurrences at Edwards include [[Chuck Yeager]]'s flight that broke the [[sound barrier]] in the [[Bell X-1]],{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=5}} test flights of the [[North American X-15]],{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=5}} the first landings of the [[Space Shuttle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flying Machine|page=9|date=April 15, 1982|newspaper=Star-Gazette|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17465918/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1986 around-the-world flight of the [[Rutan Voyager]].

====412th Test Wing====
The [[412th Test Wing]] plans, conducts, analyzes, and reports on all flight and ground testing of aircraft, weapons, software and components as well as modeling and simulation for the U.S. Air Force. The Wing also oversees the base's day-to-day operations and provides support for military, federal civilian, and contract personnel assigned to Edwards AFB. Planes assigned to the 412th carry the tail code: ED.
*'''U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School''': Part of the 412th Test Wing, USAF TPS is where the Air Force's top pilots, navigators and engineers learn how to conduct flight tests and generate the data needed to carry out test missions. The comprehensive curriculum of Test Pilot School is fundamental to the success of flight test and evaluation.
*'''412th Operations Group''': The 412th OG flies an average of 90 aircraft with upwards of 30 aircraft designs. It performs an annual average of more than 7,400 missions, including more than 1,900 test missions. Its squadrons include: 
**[[411th Flight Test Squadron]]: (F-22)
**[[416th Flight Test Squadron]]: (F-16)
**[[419th Flight Test Squadron]]: (B-52H, B-1, B-2)
**[[445th Flight Test Squadron]]: (Initial Flight Test Operations, T-38)

*'''412th Maintenance Group'''
*'''412th Medical Group'''
*'''412th Mission Support Group'''

===Associate units===
There are a vast array of organizations at Edwards that do not fall under the 412th Test Wing. They are known as Associate Units. These units do everything from providing an on-base grocery store to testing state-of-the-art rockets.
[[File:31st Test and Evaluation Squadron Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II 09-5007.jpg|thumb|31st Test and Evaluation Squadron Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II 09-5007]]

==== [[31st Test and Evaluation Squadron]] (Tail Code: OT)====
: The 31st Test and Evaluation Squadron provides [[Air Combat Command]] personnel to support combined test and evaluation on Air Force weapons systems.  Established in 1917, it is one of the oldest units of the United States Air Force.   The "Desert Pirates" are part of the [[53d Test and Evaluation Group]], [[Nellis AFB]], [[Nevada]] and the [[53d Wing]], [[Eglin AFB]], [[Florida]].   It also provides the [[Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center]], [[Kirtland AFB]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Air Force Materiel Command]], [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], [[Ohio]], with test team members who have an operational perspective to perform test and evaluation on Combat Air Force systems.

: The 31st is staffed with a mixture of operations, maintenance and engineering experts who plan and conduct tests, evaluate effectiveness and suitability, and influence system design. The squadron's personnel are integrated into the B-1, B-2, B-52, Global Hawk, MQ-9 and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programs. Their results and conclusions support Department of Defense acquisition, deployment and employment decisions.
[[File:Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Detachment 5 with RQ-4 Global Hawk.jpg|thumb|AFOTEC Detachment 5 personnel stand in front of a RQ-4 Global Hawk.]]

==== [[Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center]], Detachment 1.====
: An Air Force Materiel Command named unit assigned to Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, AFOTEC Detachment 1 is responsible for accomplishing Block 2 and 3 Initial Operational Test and Evaluation of the F-35 Lightning II for the US Air Force, [[United States Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps]], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom Ministry of Defense]], and the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]].

==== Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Detachment 5.** ====
: AFOTEC Detachment 5 is responsible for conducting the operational test and evaluation of USAF aircraft and avionics systems.  Certification by Detachment 5 is required in advance prior to new aircraft prior to AFMC full rate production and combat fielding decisions.  Detachment 5 personnel are integrated into the Flight Test Center's combined test squadrons and provide a critical operating perspective during developmental flight testing to help prepare systems for their final operational test and evaluation.
: {{small|** Note: An AFOTEC Detachment 3 is an unconfirmed geographically separated unit, which may be assigned to a remote facility of Edwards AFB at [[Groom Lake]], Nevada, that may perform similar testing as Detachment 5 on weapons systems not publicly identified. During 1978 and 1979, an AFFTC test pilot and a pair of flight test engineers were engaged in proof-of-concept testing with Lockheed's "low-observable" technology demonstrator, dubbed "Have Blue".  The successful conduct of these tests led immediately to the development of the [[F-117A Nighthawk]], the world's first operational stealth fighter.}}
[[File:B-2 Sprirt Rollout - 22 November 1988.jpg|thumb|Northrop B-2A roll-out ceremony on Nov. 22, 1988 at USAF Plant 42, Palmdale, California.]]

==== [[Air Force Plant 42]] Production Flight Test Installation ====
: A remote facility of Edwards AFB, located at Palmdale, California, Plant 42 is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility with proximity to both the concentration of aerospace industry in Los Angeles, and the high-speed corridors and resources of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards.  Plant 42 is one of four Air Force plants located throughout the United States, and is uniquely situated to fully support the Air Force's newest and most advanced aerospace systems. It provides industrial facilities for production, modification, depot maintenance and flight testing of aerospace systems. It is staffed by a mixture of civilian defense contractors, as well as USAF personnel.

==== NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center ====
{{Main|Armstrong Flight Research Center}}
[[File:Collection of military aircraft.jpg|thumb|Armstrong Flight Research Center fleet in 1997]]
: Contained inside Edwards Air Force Base is NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) where modern aircraft research is still active (e.g. the [[Boeing X-45]]). The AFRC is home to many of the world's most advanced aircraft. Notable recent research projects include the [[Controlled Impact Demonstration]] and the [[LASRE|Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment]].  It is chartered to research and test advanced aeronautics, space and related technologies for atmospheric flight operations, and to transfer those technologies to industry and other government agencies. Armstrong supports NASA's Earth science research with a fleet of specialized manned and unmanned environmental science aircraft. Armstrong is also involved in NASA's space science mission by managing and flying the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]]. The center is named for [[Neil Armstrong|Neil A. Armstrong]], an American astronaut and the first person to walk on the Moon. Armstrong's history dates back to late 1946, when 13 engineers arrived at what is now Edwards from the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]] in [[Virginia]] to support the last supersonic research flights by the X-1 rocket plane in a joint NACA, Army Air Forces and Bell Aircraft program.

==== Air Force Rocket Research Laboratory ====
[[File:Air Force Rocket Research Laboratory - Edwards AFB.jpg|right|thumb|Air Force Rocket Research Laboratory Edwards AFRL site]]
: The [[Air Force Research Laboratory#Propulsion Directorate|Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Propulsion Directorate]] maintains a [[rocket engine test facility]] on and around Leuhman Ridge, just east of Rogers Dry Lake. This facility traces its roots to early Army Air Corps activities. The Edwards Research Site is part of the AFRL Propulsion Directorate, which is headquartered at the Wright Research Site, [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], [[Ohio]].

==== Other units and further details ====
Edwards is also home to several other units from [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[FAA]], [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] and many companies that support the primary mission or the personnel stationed there.&lt;ref name="EBG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070103-051.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219124227/http://www.edwards.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070103-051.pdf |archivedate=19 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }} "Edwards Base Guide"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Main Base is also the home of the [[Benefield Anechoic Facility]] (BAF), an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] and [[radio frequency]] testing building. It is also home to the [[Air Force Test Center#Air Force Flight Test Museum|Air Force Flight Test Center Museum]], which has over 15 aircraft on display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123228846 Air Force Flight Test Center Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502015827/http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123228846 |date=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123055011 Edwards AFB: ''USAF Flight Test Center Museum''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829233004/http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123055011 |date=29 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Base is located at the North-West corner of Rogers Lake and is the site of the Air Force's most secret test programs at Edwards. {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The site has one {{convert|6000|x|150|ft}} paved runway, 06/24, and is accessed from the lakebed or via a single controlled road.

As a military airbase, civilian access is severely restricted. There are three lighted, paved runways:
* 04R/22L is {{convert|15024|x|300|ft|abbr=on}}, and an extra {{convert|9588|ft|abbr=on}} of lakebed runway is available at its northerly end. It is equipped with arresting systems approximately {{convert|1500|ft|abbr=on}} from each end.
* 04L/22R is {{convert|12000|x|200|ft|abbr=on}} and was constructed to temporarily replace 04R/22L while it was being renovated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Edwards website - First flight marks temporary runway operational use |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123099491 |accessdate=19 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528085226/http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123099491 |archivedate=28 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 06/24 is {{convert|8000|x|50|ft|abbr=on}} (this runway is technically part of the South Base) and an extra {{convert|10158|x|210|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of lakebed runway is available at its easterly end.

There are 13 other official runways on the [[Rogers Dry Lake|Rogers lakebed]]:
* 17/35 is {{convert|39097|x|900|ft|abbr=on}}. Imagery from the 1990s show an extension another {{convert|7500|ft|abbr=on}} to the north, including a visual cue and centerline markings that extend about {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}} down the currently declared portion of the runway. In 2017 Google Maps imagery, the runway is all but faded away except for the southern end where the Runway 35 indicator is still visible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* 05L/23R is {{convert|22175|x|300|ft|abbr=on}}
* 05R/23L is {{convert|14999|x|300|ft|abbr=on}} and is next to 05L/23R at the 23L (easterly) end.
* 06/24 is {{convert|7050|x|300|ft|abbr=on}}. Not to be confused with the south base 06/24 paved runway (which also extends onto the lakebed), or the north base 06/24 paved runway.
* 07/25 is {{convert|23100|x|300|ft|abbr=on}}
* 09/27 is {{convert|9991|x|300|ft|abbr=on}}
* 12/30 is {{convert|9235|x|600|ft|abbr=on}}. It is actually marked as two adjacent {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}}-wide runways (L and R). Runway 30 rolls out onto the compass rose, so its corresponding, unmarked, runway 12 is never used.
* 15/33 is {{convert|29487|x|300|ft|abbr=on}}
* 18/36 is {{convert|23086|x|900|ft|abbr=on}}. It is actually marked as three adjacent {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}}-wide runways (L, C, and R).

The [[Rosamond Lake|Rosamond lakebed]] has two runways painted on it:
* 02/20 is 20,998 feet long
* 11/29 is 20,998 feet long

==History==

=== Origins ===
A [[water stop]] on the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] since 1882, the site was largely unsettled until the early 20th century. In 1910, Ralph, Clifford and Effie Corum built a homestead on the edge of Rogers Lake. The Corums proved instrumental in attracting other settlers and building infrastructure in the area, and when a [[post office]] was commissioned for the area, they named it Muroc, a reversal of the Corum name, due to the presence of a town named Coram.&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;[http://www.mybaseguide.com/article/air-force/edwards-afb/1834/History Edwards AFB office of history via My Base Guide to Edwards AFB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coram was a smelter town established on the [[Sacramento River]] in 1906 about 1.6 km below what is today [[Shasta Dam]], in northern California.  It was abandoned around 1911 when the Balaklala Mine was closed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscious that [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]] was located in an area of increasing growth in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], and with the need for bombing and gunnery ranges for his units, base and [[1st Bombardment Wing|1st Wing]] commander [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry H. "Hap" Arnold]] began the process of acquiring land next to [[Rogers Dry Lake|Muroc Dry Lake]] for a new bombing range away from populated areas in August 1932; the last tract was not acquired until 1939. The facility established to support the range, initially called "Mohave Field" for the nearby community of [[Mojave, California|Mohave]], was Muroc Field.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt; In October 1935, five men under a Sergeant Folgleman were sent to the area from March Field.  They put out circular bombing targets in the desert.  For the next two years aircraft shuttled back and forth between Muroc Dry Lake and March Field for Crew Bombing Practice.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"&gt;[http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/afhistory/AFFTC1961Opt.pdf K286.69-37, Volume 1, January through June 1961  History of the Air Force Flight Test Center,  IRIS  Number 489391]&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, another colorful character in Edwards' history, [[Pancho Barnes]], built her renowned [[Happy Bottom Riding Club|Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch]] that would be the scene of many parties and celebrations to come. The dry lake was a hive of hot rodding, with racing on the playa. The runway on which the Space Shuttle landed follows the route that hosted racing in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

The first major aerial activity occurred at Muroc in 1937 when the entire [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] participated in a large-scale maneuver. From then on, the bombing range grew in size.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;  When Arnold became Chief of the Air Corps in 1938, the service was given a renewed focus on [[research and development]]. Muroc Field drew attention, because the nearby dry lake was so flat (Arnold described it as "level as a billiard table") that it could serve as a giant runway, ideal for flight testing.  Over [[United States dollar|US$]]120 million was spent to develop the base in the 1940s and expand it to {{convert|301000|acre|sqmi km2}}. The base's main {{convert|15000|ft|adj=on}} runway was completed in a single pour of concrete.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

===World War II===
{{kml}}
On the afternoon of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|7 December 1941]], the [[41st Bombardment Group]] and the 6th Reconnaissance Squadron moved to Muroc from [[Davis-Monthan Army Airfield]], [[Arizona]], with a collection of [[B-18 Bolo]]s, [[B-25 Mitchell]]s, and an [[A-29 Hudson]].  On Christmas Eve, the 30th Bombardment Group and the 2d Reconnaissance Squadron  arrived from [[New Orleans Army Airbase]], [[Louisiana]], for crew training. On 23 July 1942, the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range, Muroc Lake, California, was designated as a separate post (Exempted Status).&lt;ref&gt;Hq Fourth AF G0 No. 83, 23 July 1942&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of the facility at the time was "Army Air Base, Muroc Lake".&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

In July 1942, '''Muroc Army Airfield''' became a separate airfield from March Field and was placed under the jurisdiction of [[Fourth Air Force]]. Throughout the war years, the primary mission at Muroc was providing final combat training for bomber and fighter aircrews just before overseas deployment. Among its sub-bases and auxiliaries were:
* [[Bishop Army Airfield]] {{Coord|37|22|23|N|118|21|49|W}}
* [[Blythe Army Airfield]]  {{Coord|33|37|09|N|114|43|00|W}}
* [[Palmdale Army Airfield]]  {{Coord|33|37|46|N|118|05|04|W}}
* [[Desert Center Army Airfield]]   {{Coord|33|44|52|N|115|19|31|W}}
* [[Gary Army Airfield]] {{Coord|33|40|45|N|114|38|36|W}}

Muroc was initially used for [[IV Bomber Command]] Operational Unit training. The [[B-25 Mitchell]] 41st and 30th Bombardment Groups and the [[A-20 Havoc]] 47th Bombardment Groups trained at the station in early 1942. The training provided newly graduated pilots eight to 12 weeks of training as a team using the same aircraft they would use in combat. In 1942, the training mission was transferred to [[IV Fighter Command]], with [[P-38 Lightning]] OTU training for the 78th and 81st Fighter Groups. In 1943, the 360th Fighter Group and 382d Bombardment Groups were assigned permanently to Muroc for P-38 Lightning and [[B-24 Liberator]] Replacement Training (RTU) of personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, Maurer (1983).

[[File:Bell P-59 Airacomet 060913-F-1234P-013.jpg|thumb|Bell P-59A (AAF Ser. No. 44-22609, the first United States jet fighter) and a [[P-63 Kingcobra]] (AAF Ser. No. 42-69417) in flight, 1944.]]
In spring 1942, the Mojave Desert station was chosen as a secluded site for testing America's first jet, the super-secret [[Bell Aircraft]] [[P-59 Airacomet]] jet fighter. The immense volume of flight test being conducted at Wright Field, in Ohio, helped drive a search for a new, isolated site where a "Top Secret" airplane could undergo tests "away from prying eyes." The urgent need to complete the P-59 program without delay dictated a location with good, year-round flying weather, and the risks inherent in the radical new technology to be demonstrated on the aircraft dictated a spacious landing field. After examining a number of locations around the country, they selected a site along the north shore of the enormous, flat surface of Rogers Dry Lake about six miles away from the training base at Muroc.&lt;ref name="HIST" /&gt;[[File:XP-80A Gray Ghost af.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed XP-80A "Gray Ghost", 1945]]
Ground tests began five days after the first XP-59 arrived on 21 September 1942. First flight took place on 30 September when the XP-59 rose to {{Convert|10|feet|}} altitude for {{Convert|0.5|mile|}} during taxi testing.  However, the first official flight was 1 October 1942 with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, [[Royal Air Force]], Army, Bell and [[General Electric]] personnel on hand.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daso"&gt;{{cite book|title=Architects of American Air Supremacy: General [[Hap Arnold]] and Dr [[Theodore von Kármán]]|last=Daso|first=Dik A. (Major, USAF)|date=September 1997|publisher=[[Air University Press]]|pages=75,77,420}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|77}}

As with virtually all of the test programs conducted during the war years, most of the actual flight test work on the P-59 was conducted by the contractor. Although Army Air Forces (AAF) pilots flew the aircraft from time to time, and flight test engineers from Wright Field reviewed the data, the formal preliminary military test and evaluation program did not commence until the Fall of 1943, a year after the first flight. Designed to validate the contractor's reports, this preliminary evaluation consisted of a very limited number of flights and was essentially completed within a month. Formal operational suitability and accelerated service tests did not get underway until 1944, well after the AAF had decided that the airplane would not be suitable for combat operations and would, instead, be relegated to a training role.&lt;ref name="HIST" /&gt;

The P-59s were tested at Muroc from October 1942 through February 1944 without a single accident and, though the aircraft did not prove to be combat worthy, the successful conduct of its test program, combined with the success of the Lockheed XP-80 program which followed it in early 1944, sealed the future destiny of the remote high desert installation. Muroc would thenceforth become synonymous with the cutting edge of the turbojet revolution in America.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

Aircraft testing continued at this desert "Army Air Base", then on 8 November 1943, the base title was changed to "Muroc Army Air Field, Muroc".&lt;ref&gt;Hq Fourth AF G0 No. 188, 26 Nov 1943&lt;/ref&gt;   In the fall of 1944, [[Eighth Air Force]] ran tests to determine how well conventional fighters stood up against jets. Also, in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at the base for experimental work in rocket firing and achieved such success that they remained through most of 1945.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

Other World War II test flights included the [[Northrop JB-1 Bat]].

In 1943, a replica of a Japanese cruiser, nicknamed "[[Muroc Maru]]", was constructed in Rogers Dry Lake where it was used for bombing training until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/rogers-dry-lake.htm|title=Rogers Dry Lake|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
[[File:Chuck Yeager.jpg|thumb|Chuck Yeager next to experimental aircraft Bell X-1 #1, ''Glamorous Glennis'', 1947]]
With the end of the war, Fourth Air Force relinquished command of Muroc Army Airfield on 16 October 1945 and jurisdiction was transferred to [[Air Technical Service Command]], becoming [[Air Materiel Command]] in 1946.  Test work on the Lockheed [[P-80 Shooting Star]] was the primary mission of the base for the greater part of the fall of 1945.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;  The [[Consolidated Vultee XP-81]] single seat, long range escort fighter and Republic [[XP-84 Thunderjet]] fighter arrived at the base in early 1946 for flight testing.  It was obvious even at this embryonic stage of base development that the Army Air Force desert station was destined to become a proving ground for aircraft and a testing site for experimental airplanes.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

The success of these programs attracted a new type of research activity to the base in late 1946. The rocket-powered [[Bell X-1]] was the first in a long series of experimental airplanes designed to prove or disprove aeronautical concepts—to probe the most challenging unknowns of flight and solve its mysteries.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;  Further evidence of things to come was experienced on 14 October 1947 when Captain. [[Chuck Yeager|Charles "Chuck" Yeager]] flew the small bullet-shaped airplane to become the first human to exceed the speed of sound.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;
[[File:YB49-6 300.jpg|thumb|left| Northrop YB-49 taking off for the first time on 21 October 1947]]
Four months later, on 10 February 1948, Muroc AAF was re-designated Muroc Air Force Base with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate military service. Units attached or assigned to the base at the time were the 4144th Army Air Force Base Unit, the 3208th Strategic Bomb Test Squadron along with communications and weather detachments.   On 20 August 1948, the 4144th Air Force Base Unit was re-designated as the 2759th AF Base Unit and with the adoption of the [[Hobson Plan]], as the 2759th Experimental Wing.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

With the X-1, flight testing at Muroc began to assume two distinct identities. Highly experimental research programs—such as the X-3, X-4, X-5 and XF-92A—were typically flown in conjunction with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, and were conducted in a methodical fashion to answer largely theoretical questions. Then, as now, the great bulk of flight testing at Muroc focused on evaluations of the capabilities of aircraft and systems proposed for the operational inventory.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

In December 1949, Muroc was renamed '''Edwards Air Force Base''' in honor of Captain [[Glen Edwards (pilot)|Glen Edwards]], who was killed a year earlier in the crash of the [[Northrop YB-49]] Flying Wing.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt; From the time Edwards Air Force Base was named, speed and altitude records began to pile up as new aircraft were developed and the base started to build and branch out significantly.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

A major reason for the growth of Edwards AFB was the nearness of West Coast aircraft manufacturers.  However, another major reason was the decision in 1947 to build a missile test facility on the base.   The need for a static missile faculty to test high-thrust missile rocket engines was first envisioned in 1946 by the Power Plant Laboratory at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].  It was that decision that such a facility should be government-owned to prevent a single contractor exclusive advantages on Air Force contracts for high-thrust missile rocket power plants, and it would eliminate duplication of like facilities by different manufacturers.  The choice of location in 1947 was the Leuhman Ridge east of Rogers Dry Lake on Edwards AFB.   Construction began in November 1949 on what was to become the Experimental Rocket Engine Test Station.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

===Cold War===

====Flight testing====
[[File:North American X-15A 56-6671.jpg|thumb|left|North American X-15A (AF Ser. No. ''56-6671'') with test pilots, Edwards AFB, California. Number 6671 was extensively damaged during emergency landing at Edwards AFB on 9 November 1962 with John McKay at the controls. Later modified as X-15A-2; now on display at the [[National Museum of the U.S. Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], OH.]]
Jurisdiction of Edwards AFB was transferred from Air Materiel Command on 2 April 1951 to the newly created [[Air Research and Development Command]]. Activation of the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] (AFFTC) followed on 25 June 1951. Units designated and assigned to the Center at the time of activation were the 6510th Air Base Wing for station support units.  The test flying units at Edwards were assigned directly to the AFFTC .&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

That same year, the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School moved to Edwards from Wright Field, Ohio.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"&gt;Air Force Systems Command, Delivering The Future (1989). Compiled by Lt. Col. Beverly S. Follis, USAFR HQ AFSC/Office of History&lt;/ref&gt;

Its curriculum focused on the traditional field of performance testing and the relatively new field of stability and control, which had suddenly assumed critical importance with the dramatic increases in speed offered by the new turbojets. As the decade opened, the first-generation X-1 reached {{Convert|1.45|Mach|}} and a {{Convert|71902|feet|mi km}} altitude, representing the edge of the envelope. The D-558-II Douglas Skyrocket soon surpassed these marks. In 1951, Douglas test pilot Bill Bridgeman flew the Skyrocket to a top speed of {{Convert|1.88|Mach|}} and a peak altitude of {{Convert|74,494|feet|mi km}}. Then, in 1953, Marine Corps test pilot, Lieutenant Colonel [[Marion Carl]], flew the same plane to an altitude of {{Convert|83235|feet|mi km}}.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

On 20 November 1951, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics' [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]] became the first man to reach Mach 2 as he piloted the Skyrocket to a speed of {{Convert|2.005|Mach|}}. Less than a month later, Major [[Chuck Yeager]] topped this record as he piloted the second-generation Bell X-1A to a top speed of {{Convert|2.44|Mach|}} and, just nine months later, Major Arthur "Kit" Murray flew the same airplane to a new altitude record of {{Convert|90440|feet|mi km}}.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

These records stood for less than three years. In September 1956, Captain Iven Kincheloe became the first man to soar above {{Convert|100000|feet|mi km}}, as he piloted the [[Bell X-2]] to a then-remarkable altitude of {{Convert|126200|feet|mi km}}. Flying the same airplane just weeks later on 27 September, Captain Mel Apt became the first to exceed {{Convert|3|Mach|}}, accelerating to a speed of {{Convert|3.2|Mach|}}. His moment of glory was tragically brief, however. Just seconds after attaining top speed, the X-2 tumbled violently out of control and Apt was never able to recover.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

With the loss of the X-2, the search for many of the answers to the riddles of high-Mach flight had to be postponed until the arrival of the most ambitious of the rocket planes—the [[North American X-15]].&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

[[File:McDonnell Douglas F-15A-1-MC Eagle 71-0250.jpg|thumb|McDonnell Douglas F-15A-1-MC Eagle (AF Ser. No. ''71-0280'') (also known as YF-15A, first F-15 manufactured) preparing to make its historic first flight on 27 July 1972 at Edwards AFB, CA with the 6512th Test Squadron. This a/c was later used for exploring the F-15's flight envelope, handling qualities and external stores carriage capabilities.]]

Meanwhile, the turbojet revolution had reached a high plateau at Edwards.  By the time the base was officially designated the U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center in June 1951, more than 40 different types of aircraft had first taken flight at the base and the nation's first generation of jet-powered combat airplanes had already completed development.  One of them, the North American [[F-86 Sabre]], was dominating the skies over Korea.&lt;ref name="EDHIST"&gt;[http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-028.pdf   The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center Forging Aerospace Power for America Air Force Flight Test Center History Office] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012075524/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-028.pdf |date=12 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The promise of the turbojet revolution and the  supersonic breakthrough were realized in the 1950s, as the Center tested and developed the first generation of true supersonic fighters—the famed "Century Series" [[F-100 Super Sabre]], [[F-101 Voodoo]], [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], [[F-104 Starfighter]], [[F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[F-106 Delta Dart]], and, in the process, defined the basic speed and altitude envelopes for fighter aircraft that still prevail to this day.  The Center also played a pivotal role in the development of systems that would provide the United States with true intercontinental power projection capabilities as it tested aircraft such as the [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[C-133 Cargomaster]] and [[KC-135 Stratotanker]], as well as the [[YC-130 Hercules]] which served as the basis for a classic series of tactical transports that would continue in frontline service until well into the 21st century. It also supported the development of the extremely high-altitude and long-range [[Lockheed U-2]] and the dazzling ultra-performance capabilities of the [[B-58 Hustler]], the world's first Mach 2 bomber.&lt;ref name="EDHIST"/&gt;

Throughout the 1950s, American airplanes regularly broke absolute speed and altitude records at Edwards, but nothing compared to the arrival of the [[North American X-15]] in 1961. The program got underway in earnest in 1961 when Maj. Robert M. "Bob" White became the first man to exceed Mach 4, as he accelerated to {{Convert|4.43|Mach|}} on 7 March. He claimed Mach 5 just three months later when he pegged a speed of {{Convert|5.27|Mach|}} on 23 June and then, during the X-15's first full-powered flight on 9 November, he exceeded Mach 6, as he flew to a speed of {{Convert|6.04|Mach|}}. Major White also became the first man to fly an airplane in space when he climbed to {{Convert|314750|feet|mi km}} on 17 July 1962. NASA's Joe Walker flew the airplane to its peak altitude of {{Convert|354200|feet|mi km}} on 22 August 1963 and Maj William J. "Pete" Knight reached {{Convert|6.72|Mach|}} in the modified X-15A-2 on 3 October 1967, a speed that remains the highest ever attained in an airplane.&lt;ref name="EDHIST"/&gt;

In addition to the X-15 Program, AFFTC and NASA also teamed up to explore a new concept called "lifting reentry" with a series of wingless lifting body aircraft.  These rocket powered-vehicles — the M2-F2, M2-F3, HL-10, X-24A and X-24B — paved the way for the Space Shuttle and future spaceplane designs when they demonstrated that they could make precision landings after high-speed gliding descents from high altitude.&lt;ref name="EDHIST"/&gt;

The major aircraft systems that were tested and developed during the 1960s, the [[T-38 Talon]], [[B-52H Stratofortress]], [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 and RF-4 Phantom II]], the [[F-111]] and FB-111, [[C-141 Starlifter]] and [[C-5 Galaxy]], all became mainstays in the USAF operational inventory. Another aircraft gained world fame in the late 1960s at Edwards: the [[Lockheed YF-12A]], a precursor to the [[SR-71 Blackbird]], shattered nine records in one day of testing at Edwards. The SR-71's full capabilities remain classified, but the records set on 1 May 1965 included a sustained speed of {{convert|2070|mph}} and an altitude of {{convert|80257|ft|mi km|0}}.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight 2.jpg|thumb|left|YF-16 and YF-17 in flight during their competitive fly-off, 1974. Over 4,000 production F-16s were built after the competition. The YF-17 was the basis for the highly successful United States Navy F/A-18 Hornet.]]

New aircraft types arrived in the 1970s: the F-15 Eagle with its advanced engine and fire-control system; the single-engine F-16 Fighting Falcon with its revolutionary "fly-by-wire" flight control system; and the B-1 Lancer with its multitude of highly sophisticated offensive and defensive systems. These planes more than bore out the prophecy concerning the ever-increasing importance of systems testing and integration. Moreover, another major new element of complexity was soon introduced into the flight test process.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

At a remote location in 1978 and 1979, an AFFTC test pilot and a pair of flight test engineers were engaged in proof-of-concept testing with Lockheed's "low-observable" technology demonstrator, dubbed "Have Blue." The successful conduct of these tests led immediately to the development of a new subsonic attack aircraft that was designated the F-117A Nighthawk.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

The capabilities of existing aircraft such as the F-15 and F-16 have been continually refined and expanded, even as totally new aircraft and systems incorporating radical new technologies are developed for future operational use. The dual-role F-15E, for example, was developed in the 1980s and went on to demonstrate truly remarkable combat effectiveness in the Persian Gulf conflict of the early 90s. The Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night, or LANTIRN, system revolutionized air-to-ground combat operations during the same conflict by denying opposing forces the once comforting sanctuary of night.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

The late 1980s also witnessed the arrival of the first giant flying wing to soar over the base in nearly 40 years. The thin silhouette, compound curves and other low-observable characteristics of the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] bomber represented third-generation stealth technology, following the SR-71 and F-117.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

The 1980s also saw Edwards host a demonstration of America's space warfare capabilities when a highly modified [[F-15 Eagle]] launched an [[ASM-135 ASAT|ASM-135]] anti-satellite missile at the dead [[P78-1]] (or Solwind) satellite and destroyed it. In 1986, [[Dick Rutan]] and [[Jeana Yeager]] launched from Edwards to set a new aviation record by piloting the first non-stop, around-the-world flight on a single tank of fuel in the [[Rutan Voyager]].&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

====Ground research====
[[File:Rocket sled track.jpg|thumb|left|Lt. Col. [[John Stapp]] rides the [[rocket sled]] ''Gee Whiz''.]]
Extensive aviation research was also conducted on the ground at Edwards. Two rocket sled tracks pioneered important developments and research for the Air Force. The first {{convert|2000|ft|adj=on}} track was built by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] in 1944 near what is currently the North Base. Originally intended to help develop a [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] flying-bomb-style weapon that never left the drawing board, the track found use after the war as a test area for [[V-2 rocket]]s captured from [[Nazi Germany]] in [[Operation Paperclip]]. Later, Lt. Col. [[John Stapp]] appropriated the track for his [[MX981]] project and installed what was believed to be one of the most powerful mechanical braking systems ever constructed. His deceleration tests led the press to nickname him the "fastest man on earth" and the "bravest man in the Air Force".&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

The results from the first track prompted the Air Force to build a second in 1948. Located just south of Rogers Lake, the {{convert|10000|ft|mi km|adj=on}} track was capable of supersonic speeds. Its first project was the development of the [[SM-62 Snark]] [[cruise missile]]. This track was so successful that an extension was constructed, and on 13 May 1959, the full {{convert|20000|ft|mi km|adj=on}} track was opened. After the [[United States Navy|Navy]] had conducted research on the [[UGM-27 Polaris]] [[ballistic missile]], the track was used to develop [[ejection seat]]s that could be used at supersonic speeds. Though this program was a success, a budgetary review concluded that the track was too expensive to maintain and the track was decommissioned on 24 May 1963. Before it was closed, a trial run set a world speed record of {{Convert|3.3|Mach|}} before the test car broke up. After it closed, the rails were pulled up to help straighten Lancaster Boulevard.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

====Space Shuttle support====

After President [[Richard M. Nixon]] announced the [[Space Shuttle program]] on January 5, 1972, Edwards was chosen for [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] testing. The prototype {{OV|101}} was carried to altitude by the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (SCA) and released. In all, 13 test flights were conducted with the Enterprise and the SCA to determine their flight characteristics and handling.

After Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] became the first shuttle launched into orbit on April 12, 1981, it returned to Edwards for landing. The airbase's immense lakebeds and its proximity to [[Plant 42]], where the shuttle was serviced before relaunch, were important factors in its selection and it continued to serve as the primary landing area for the space shuttle until 1991. After that time, [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in [[Florida]] was favored. This saved the considerable cost of transporting the shuttle from California back to Florida, but Edwards AFB and [[White Sands Space Harbor]] continued to serve as backups for the duration of the shuttle program. Shuttles landed at Edwards as recently as August 9, 2005 ([[STS-114]]), June 22, 2007 ([[STS-117]]), November 30, 2008 ([[STS-126]]),  May 24, 2009 ([[STS-125]]), and September 11, 2009 ([[STS-128]]) due to rain and ceiling events at the KSC [[Shuttle Landing Facility]].

===Into the 1990s===
[[File:YF-22 and YF-23.jpg|thumb|left|Prototype YF-22 and YF-23 fighters, 1991]]
The end of the Cold War was marked by the arrival of the YF-22A and the YF-23A. The two prototype fighters were the first airplanes to blend stealth with agility and high-speed, supersonic cruise capability. The YF-22A was selected to become the Air Force's new advanced tactical fighter after a brief demonstration and validation risk reduction flight test program. Now named the Raptor, the F-22A continues to undergo test and evaluation at Edwards.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

A new group of research projects came to Edwards in the 1990s. [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk|Global Hawk]], an unmanned aerial vehicle that has been used extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq, made its first flight at Edwards in February 1998. The X-24, X-33, X-34, X-36 and X-38, a series of new lifting bodies, technology demonstrators and half-scale models were tested here by NASA during the decade.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

The new millennium brought new projects with worldwide impact. The X-35A and X-32A, competing models for the Joint Strike Fighter program, made their first flights in September and October 2000. The X-35A won the competition in 2001 and will eventually be built in various versions for America's flying armed services and for foreign air forces as well. Also new are the [[RQ-4 Global Hawk]], [[Boeing YAL-1|YAL-1 Airborne Laser]], [[B-52 Stratofortress#Fuel research platform|the B-52 synthetic fuel program]], the [[C-17 Globemaster III]], and many prototype [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs).&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;
[[File:Northrop Grumman Block 20 RQ-4B Global Hawk 05-2023.jpg|thumb|452d Flight Test Squadron Northrop Grumman Block 20 RQ-4B Global Hawk (''05-2023'') being serviced at Edwards AFB.]]                                                                                                        
Edwards is among the few U.S. military bases to have gained jobs since the Cold War.  Under the DoD's [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process, several smaller bases have been decommissioned, and their facilities and responsibilities have been sent to Edwards, [[China Lake]], and other large bases.

During 2012, the 95th Air Base Wing, the former base support unit at Edwards was inactivated and consolidated into the 412th Test Wing as part of the Air Force Flight Test Center transitioning into the Air Force Test Center. The five-Center consolidation not only better integrates the workforce, but saves taxpayers approximately $109 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123308673 Col.

==Geography==
{{original research section|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Rogers Dry Lake.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Rogers Dry Lake|Rogers Lake]] is not always dry. During the brief rainy season in the [[Mojave Desert]], water fills the lake bed. The [[compass rose]] can be seen on the left.]]

The largest features of the {{convert|470|sqmi}} that make up Edwards AFB are the [[Rogers Dry Lake|Rogers Lake]] and [[Rosamond Lake]] dry lakes. These have served as emergency and scheduled landing sites for many aerospace projects including the [[Bell X-1]], [[Lockheed U-2]], [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]], and the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]]. The lakebeds have black lines painted on them to mark seven official "runways". Also painted on the dry lake beds near Dryden is the world's largest [[compass rose]]: {{convert|2000|ft|m|adj=on}} radius, {{Convert|4000|feet|mi km|2}} in diameter. The Edwards AFB compass rose's [[magnetic declination]] to true north is measured by Google Earth's distance/direction measurement tool as inclined to [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] with a 15.3 degrees east variance of [[true north]], as opposed to the current variance of 12.4 degrees east (2014.) This is consistent with a calculated magnetic variance at this location in the early 1960s. The larger lake bed, Rogers, encompasses {{convert|44|sqmi}} of desert. Because of Rogers' history in the space program, it was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].
[[File:Jfader dryden.jpg|thumb|The world's largest compass rose is painted on the lake bed beside NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center.]]

The Rosamond dry lake bed encompasses {{convert|21|sqmi}} and is also used for emergency landings and other flight research roles. By August, the lake bed is dry and rough from the weather and from high performance aircraft performing landings. Both lake beds are some of the lowest points in the [[Antelope Valley]] and they can collect large amounts of [[precipitation]]. Desert winds whip this seasonal water around on the lake beds and the process polishes them, yielding a new, extremely flat surface;{{sfn|Collins|2009|pp=4-5}} the Rosamond lake bed was measured to have an altitude deviation of {{convert|18|in}} over a {{convert|30000|ft|adj=on}} length; that's about {{convert|1|mm}} altitude deviation over every {{convert|20|m}} of length.

The census-designated place encompasses an area of {{convert|44.38|sqkm|sqmi|1}} of which {{convert|0.173|ha|acre}} is water.

===Environmental concerns===
There are several protected and threatened species living in Edwards, the most notable being the [[desert tortoise]] (''Gopherus agassizii''). It is illegal to touch, harass or otherwise harm a desert tortoise. Another notable species is ''[[Yucca brevifolia]]'': the taller members of this species are called Joshua trees.

The '''environmental effect of pharmaceuticals and personal care products''' ('''PPCPs''') is currently being widely investigated. PPCPs include substances used by individuals for personal health or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] reasons and the products used by [[agribusiness]] to boost growth or health of livestock. More than twenty million tons of PPCPs are produced every year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jianlong|last2=Wang|first2=Shizong|title=Removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater: A review|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=182|pages=620–640|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.07.049|pmid=27552641|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. The effects of these [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] on humans and the environment are not yet known, but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-epa-1|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Further research is needed to evaluate the risks of [[toxicity]], persistence, and [[bioaccumulation]]. PPCPs encompass [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s (EPPPs) and are one type of [[Persistent organic pollutant|persistent organic pollutants]]. They are not removed from wastewater by conventional methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[European Union]] has declared [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] residues with the potential of contamination of water and soil to be "priority substances".[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-WFD2013-2|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Overview==
Since the 1990s, [[water contamination]] by pharmaceuticals has been an [[list of environmental issues|environmental issue]] of concern.&lt;ref name=Doerr-MacEwen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doerr-MacEwen NA, Haight ME |title=Expert stakeholders' views on the management of human pharmaceuticals in the environment |journal=Environ Manage |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=853–66 |date=November 2006 |pmid=16955232 |doi=10.1007/s00267-005-0306-z |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is important to note that many public health professionals in the United States began writing reports of pharmaceutical contamination in waterways in the 1970s.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Pharmaceuticals in drinking-water |date=2012 |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=9789241502085 |location=Geneva, Switzerland |oclc=806494582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pharmaceuticals are deposited in the environment through human consumption and excretion, and are often filtered ineffectively by municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants which are not designed to manage them. Once in the water, they can have diverse, subtle effects on organisms, although research is still limited. Pharmaceuticals may also be deposited in the environment through improper disposal, runoff from [[sludge]] fertilizer and reclaimed wastewater irrigation, and leaky sewer pipes.&lt;ref name=Doerr-MacEwen/&gt; In 2009, an investigative report by [[Associated Press]] concluded that U.S. manufacturers had legally released 271 million pounds of compounds used as drugs into the environment, 92% of which was the industrial chemicals [[phenol]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], which are also used as antiseptics. It could not distinguish between drugs released by manufacturers as opposed to the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. It also found that an estimated 250 million pounds of pharmaceuticals and contaminated packaging were discarded by hospitals and long-term care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Donn J. (2009). [https://www.usnews.com/articles/science/2009/04/19/tons-of-released-drugs-taint-us-water.html?PageNr=1 Tons of Released Drugs Taint U.S. Water]. AP.&lt;/ref&gt; The series of articles led to a hearing{{when|date=November 2018}} conducted by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Transportation Safety, Infrastructure Security, and Water Quality. This hearing was designed to address the levels of pharmaceutical contaminants in U.S. drinking water. This was the first time that pharmaceutical companies were questioned about their waste disposal methods. "No federal regulations or laws were created as a result of the hearing."{{cn|date=November 2018}} "Between the years of 1970-2018 more than 3000 pharmaceutical chemicals were manufactured, but only 17 are screened or tested for in waterways."{{cn|date=November 2018}} Alternately, "There are no studies designed to examine the effects of pharmaceutical contaminated drinking water on human health.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In parallel, the [[European Union]] is the second biggest consumer in the world (24% of the world total) after the USA and in the majority of EU Member States, around 50% of unused human medicinal products is not collected to be disposed of properly. In the EU, between 30 and 90% of the orally administered doses are estimated to be excreted as the active substances in the urine.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/environment/study_environment.pdf  BIO Intelligence Service (2013), Study on the environmental risks of medicinal products, Final Report prepared for Executive Agency for Health and Consumers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s (EPPP) was suggested in the 2010 nomination of pharmaceuticals and environment as an emerging issue to [[Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management]] ([[SAICM]]) by the [[International Society of Doctors for the Environment]] (ISDE).

=== Safe disposal ===
Depending on the sources and ingredients, there are various ways in which the public can dispose of pharmaceutical and personal care products in acceptable ways. The most environmentally safe disposal method is to take advantage of a community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal.  Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated these programs. In addition, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs, as well as the [[National Take Back Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Prescription Drug Take Back Day |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback/index.html |website=Office of Diversion Control |publisher=United States Drug Enforcement Administration |location=Springfield, Virginia |accessdate=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, take-back programs are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products “from the cradle to the grave,” has been gaining traction.  This philosophy suggests that the manufacturers should fund the proper disposal of pharmaceutical products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Long Battle for State Drug Take-Back Program Must Continue|url=http://www.theolympian.com/2011/03/13/1577405/long-battle-for-state-drug-take.html|accessdate=04/05/2011|newspaper=The Olympian|date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take-back programs should exist in every community, and, if further information is required on this, city officials should be contacted.&lt;ref&gt;

# take the prescription drugs out of their original containers
# mix drugs with [[Litter box|cat litter]] or [[used coffee grounds]]
# place the mixture into a disposable container with a lid, such as a sealable bag
# cover up any personal identification with a black marker that is on the original pill containers
# place these containers in the bag with the mixture, seal them, and place them in the trash.

This will hopefully keep these chemicals separated from the open environment and especially water bodies long enough for them to naturally break down.

When these substances find their way into water, it is much more difficult to deal with them. Water treatment facilities use different processes in order to minimize or fully eliminate these pollutants. This is done by using [[sorption]] where suspended solids are removed by [[sedimentation]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, H., Ternes, T.A., Joss, A., (2004) Scrutinizing Pharmaceuticals and Personal 	Care 	Products in Wastewater Treatment Journal of Environmental Science &amp; Technology,38 392A-399A&lt;/ref&gt;  Another method used is [[biodegradation]], and through this method microorganisms, such as [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], feed on or break down these pollutants thus eliminating them from the contaminated media.

]]
[[Pharmaceutical drug|Pharmaceuticals]], or prescription and over-the-counter medications made for human use or veterinary or agribusiness purposes, are common PPCPs found in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are nine classes of pharmaceuticals included in PPCPs: [[hormone]]s, [[antibiotics]], [[Clofibrate|lipid regulators]], [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[antidepressant]]s, [[anticonvulsant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[antineoplastics]], and diagnostic contrast media.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Personal care|Personal care products]] have four classes: [[fragrances]], [[preservative]]s, [[disinfectant]]s, and [[Octocrylene|sunscreen agents]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These products may be found in cosmetics, perfumes, menstrual care products, lotions, shampoos, soaps, toothpastes, and sunscreen. These products typically enter the environment when passed through or washed off the body and into the ground or sewer lines, or when disposed of in the trash, septic tank, or sewage system.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-epa-1|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Traces of illicit drugs can be found in waterways and may even be carried by money.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-11|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

== Routes into the environment ==

More attention has been devoted of late to PPCPs in the environment. Two causes may contribute to this: PPCPs are actually increasing in the environment due to widespread use and/or analytical technology is better able to detect PPCPs in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These substances enter the environment directly or indirectly. Direct methods include contamination of surface water by hospitals, households, industries, or wastewater treatment plants. Direct contamination can also affect the sediment and soil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is generally assumed (albeit hardly verified) that the production of pharmaceuticals in industrialised countries is well controlled and unharmful to the environment, due to the local legal restrictions usually required to permit production. However, a substantial fraction of the global production of pharmaceuticals takes place in low-cost production countries like India and China. Recent reports from India demonstrate that such production sites may emit very large quantities of e.g. antibiotics, yielding levels of the drugs in local surface waters higher than those found in the blood of patients under treatment.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

The major route for pharmaceutical residues to reach the aquatic environment is most probably by excretion from patients undergoing pharma treatment. Since many pharmaceutical substances are not metabolized in the body they may be excreted in biologically active form, usually via the urine. Furthermore, many pharmaceutical substances are not fully taken up from the intestine (following oral administration in patients) into their blood stream. The fraction not taken up into the blood stream will remain in the gut and eventually be excreted via the faeces. Hence, both urine and faeces from treated patients contain pharmaceutical residues. Between 30 and 90% of the orally administered dose is generally excreted as active substance in the urine.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

An additional source to environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries take-back systems for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives on a local basis exist. Though most of the waste goes to incineration and people are asked to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least “rarely” via the toilet or sink.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu" /&gt;

Proper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. Incineration at a high temperature (&gt;1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfill the requirements, but even following such incineration residual ashes from the incineration should be properly taken care of.

Pharmaceuticals used in veterinary medicine, or as additives to animal food, pose a different problem, since they are excreted into soil or possibly open surface waters. It is well known that such excretions may affect terrestrial organisms directly, leading to extinction of exposed species (e.g. dung-beetles). Lipid-soluble pharma residues from veterinary use may bind strongly to soil particles, with little tendency to leak out to ground water or to local surface waters. More water-soluble residues may be washed out with rain or melting snow and reach both ground water and surface water streams.

{{details|topic=how pollutants enter the environment through the manufacturing of PPCPs|Industrial ecology}}
The use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is on the rise with an estimated increase from 2&amp;nbsp;billion to 3.9&amp;nbsp;billion annual prescriptions between 1999 and 2009 in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tong|first=A.Y.|author2=Peake, B. |author3=Braund, R. |title=Disposal practices for unused medications around the world|journal=Environment International|year=2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=292–298|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2010.10.002|pmid=20970194}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPCPs enter into the environment through individual human activity and as residues from manufacturing, agribusiness, [[veterinary]] use, and [[hospital]] and community use. In Europe, the input of pharmaceutical residues via domestic waste water is estimated to be around 80% whereas 20% is coming from hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pills-project.eu/PILLS_summary_english.pdf EU project report summary "Pharmaceutical Input and Elimination from Local Sources", 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may add PPCPs to the environment through waste excretion and bathing as well as by directly disposing of unused medications to [[septic tanks]], [[Sewerage|sewers]], or trash.  Because PPCPs tend to dissolve relatively easily and do not evaporate at normal temperatures, they often end up in soil and water bodies.

Some PPCPs are broken down or processed easily by a human or animal body and/or degrade quickly in the environment . However, others do not break down or degrade easily. The likelihood or ease with which an individual substance will break down depends on its chemical makeup and the metabolic pathway of the compound.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.gov/ppcp |title=Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website= |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location= Washington, D.C. |access-date=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] found detectable quantities of one or more chemicals in 80 percent of a sampling of 139 susceptible streams in 30 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-027-02/ |title=Pharmaceuticals, Hormones, and Other Organic Wastewater Contaminants in U.S. Streams |last1=Buxton |first1=H.T. |last2=Kolpin |first2=D.W. |date=June 2002 |website= |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |series=USGS Fact Sheet FS-027-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common pharmaceuticals detected were  nonprescription drugs; [[detergents]], [[fire retardant]]s, [[pesticides]], natural and synthetic [[hormones]], and an assortment of [[antibiotics]] and [[prescription medication]]s were also found.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.groundwater.org/gi/ppcp_about.html Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products in Drinking Water Supplies.]"  The Groundwater Foundation.

A 2006 study found detectable concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface water, and sediment. The therapeutic classes included [[antibiotics]], [[analgesics]] and anti-inflammatories, [[lipid]] regulators, [[beta-blockers]], [[anti-convulsant]], and [[steroid hormones]]. Although most chemical concentrations were detected at low levels (nano-grams/Liter (ng/L)), there are uncertainties that remain regarding the levels at which toxicity occurs and the risks of [[bioaccumulation]] of these pharmaceutical compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernando|first=M.D.|author2=Mezcua, M. |author3=Fernandez-Alba, A.R. |author4=Barcelo, D. |title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceutical Residues in Wastewater Effluents, Surface Waters and Sediments|journal=Talanta|year=2006|volume=69|issue=2|pages=334–342|doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2005.09.037|pmid=18970571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Human===
The scope of human exposure to pharmaceuticals and personal care products from the environment is a complex function of many factors. These factors include the concentrations, types, and distribution of pharmaceuticals in the environment; the pharmacokinetics of each drug; the structural transformation of the chemical compounds either through metabolism or natural degradation processes; and the potential bioaccumulation of the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daughton |first=C.G. |title=Pharmaceuticals as Environmental Pollutants: the Ramifications for Human Exposure |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=66–122 |doi=10.1016/b978-012373960-5.00403-2 |isbn=9780123739605}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed to determine the effects on humans of long-term exposure to low levels of PPCPs.  The full effects of mixtures of low concentrations of different PPCPs is also unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.drinktap.org/consumerdnn/Default.aspx?tabid=73 Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in drinking water]."  American Water Works Association. Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The U.S. EPA risk assessment states that the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of pharmaceuticals is around 0.0027 mg/kg‐day."{{cn|date=November 2018}} Due to the lack of research of toxicity guidelines and their effects on human health it is difficult to determine a healthy dosage for water contaminated by pharmaceuticals. "The pharmaceutical sample size tested does not give a full representation of human exposure. Only 17 out of 3000 prescriptions are screened for in drinking water."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In addition, “The EPA and FDA regulations state that a drug or chemical is not considered harmful until clear evidence shows that  a substance causes harm".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=Shane |date=November 201 0|title=Pharmaceuticals in the Water Environment |url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/policy/acsonthehill/briefings/pharmaceuticalsinwater/nacwa-paper.pdf |journal=Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies |volume=|pages=38|via=American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that we are not testing or screening for thousands of contaminants in our drinking water. Health risk assessments have not been conducted to provide concrete evidence to link pharmaceutical contamination and adverse human health effects.

"However adverse health outcomes are displayed in aquatic organisms. Fish living near water treatment plants have been reported to be feminized."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; "Some male fish started to develop ovaries and other feminized characteristic due to pharmaceutical pollution some species have decreased in population due to exposure of EE2 and other hormonal ECD substances."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Although research has shown that PPCPs are present in water bodies throughout the world, no studies have shown a direct effect on human health. However, the absence of empirical data cannot rule out the possibility of adverse outcomes due to interactions or long-term exposures to these substances. Because the amounts of these chemicals in the water supply may be in the parts per trillion or parts per billion, it is difficult to chemically determine the exact amounts present. Many studies&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daughton |first=C.G. |title=Pharmaceuticals as Environmental Pollutants: the Ramifications for Human Exposure |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=66–102 |doi=10.1016/b978-012373960-5.00403-2 |isbn=9780123739605}}&lt;/ref&gt; have therefore been focused to determining if the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals exist at or above the accepted daily intake (ADI) at which the designed biological outcomes can occur.&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102"/&gt;

In addition to the growing concerns about human health risks from pharmaceutical drugs via environmental exposures, many researchers have speculated about the potential for inducing an antibiotic resistance. One study found 10 different antibiotics in sewage treatment effluents, surface water, and sediments.&lt;ref name="Hernando 2006 334–342"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hernando |first=M.D. |author2=Mezcua, M. |author3=Fernández-Alba, AR. |author4=Barceló, D. |title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceutical Residues in Wastewater Effluents, Surface Waters and Sediments |journal=Talanta |year=2006 |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=334–342 |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2005.09.037|pmid=18970571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some microbiologists believe that if antibiotic concentrations are higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a species of pathogenic bacteria, a selective pressure would be exerted and, as a result, antibiotic resistance would be selectively promoted. It has also been proven that at even sub-inhibitory concentrations (e.g., one-fourth of the MIC), several antibiotics are able to have an effect on gene expression (e.g., as shown for the modulation of expression of toxin-encoding genes in Staphylococcus aureus).&lt;ref name="Segura 2005 675–684"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Segura |first=P.A. |author2=Francois, M. |author3=Gagnon, C. |author4=Sauve, S. |title=Review of the Occurrence of Anti-infectives in Contaminated Wastewaters and Natural and Drinking Waters |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=May 2005 |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=675–684 |doi=10.1289/ehp.11776 |pmid=19479007 |pmc=2685827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For reference the MIC of erythromycin that is effective against 90 percent of lab grown Campylobacter bacteria, the most common food-borne pathogen in the United States, is 60&amp;nbsp;ng/mL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Modolo |first1=J.R. |last2=Giuffrida |first2=R. |last3=de M. Lopes |first3=C.R. |title=Antimicrobial Susceptibility of 51 Campylobacter Strains Isolated From Diarrheic and Diarrhea-Free Dogs |journal=Arquivos do Instituto Biológic. |date=July 2003 |volume=70 |issue=3|pages=283–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the average concentration of erythromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, was 0.09&amp;nbsp;ng/mL in water treatment plant effluents,.&lt;ref name="Hernando 2006 334–342"/&gt; Additionally, transfer of genetic elements among bacteria has been observed under natural conditions in wastewater treatment plants, and selection of resistant bacteria has been documented in sewers receiving wastewaters from pharmaceutical plants.&lt;ref name="Segura 2005 675–684"/&gt; Moreover, antibiotic resistant bacteria may also remain in sewage sludge and enter the food chain if the sludge is not incinerated but used as fertilizer on agricultural land.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu"/&gt;

The relationship between risk perception and behavior is multifaceted.  Risk management is most effective once the motivation behind the behavior of disposing unused pharmaceuticals is understood.  There was little correlation found between the perception of risk and knowledge regarding pharmaceutical waste according to a study conducted by Cook and Bellis in 2001.&lt;ref name="Cook 2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Bellis|title=Knowing the risk: relationships between behaviour and health knowledge.  Public Health 115, 54-61|publisher=Public Health|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study cautioned against the effectiveness of attempting to change the public’s behavior on these health issues by warning them of the risks associated with their actions.&lt;ref name="Cook 2001"/&gt;

It is advised to take careful measures to inform the public in a way that does not impart guilt but rather public awareness.  For example, a study carried out by Norlund and Garvill in Sweden (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordlund|first=A.M.|title=Effects of values, problem awareness, and personal norm on willingness to reduce personal car use|publisher=J. Environment Psychol.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that found that some people may make a personal sacrifice in terms of comfort because they feel that it would be helpful to reduce further environmental damage caused by the use of cars.  Awareness of air pollution problems was a factor in their decision to take action on a more environmentally favorable choice of transportation.  Thus, the goal of Bound’s project encapsulates whether the perception of risk associated with pharmaceuticals has an effect on the way in which medication is commonly disposed.

In order to conduct this study, the pharmaceuticals were grouped by their therapeutic action in order to help participants identify them.  The eight therapeutic groups are listed below: [[antibacterials]], [[antidepressants]], [[antihistamines]], [[antiepileptics]], [[hormone]] treatments, and [[lipid]] regulators.  Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and their perception of the existing risk or threat against the environment.  Respondents were asked the following questions in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2. How they perceive the risk to the environment posed by pharmaceuticals. 3. To differentiate between the risks associated with different classed of pharmaceuticals.  Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants.  The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male.  Results showed that when a medication must be discarded, 63.2 percent of participants throw them in a bin, 21.8 percent return them to a pharmacist, and 11.5 percent dispose of them via the toilet/sink, while the remaining 3.5 percent keep them.  Only half of the respondents felt like pharmaceuticals could potentially be harmful to the environment.  Upon examination of factors relevant to risk perception, there was no definite link found between perception and education or income.

Dr. Bound noted that participation in altruistic activities such as Environmental Conservation groups may provide members with the ability to better grasp the effects of their actions in the environment.  In regards to the aquatic environment, it is hard for one to perceive the favorable effects of properly disposing medication.  There also exists the plausibility that a person’s behavior will only be affected if there is a severe risk to themselves or humans as opposed to an environmental threat.  Even though there are serious threats of pharmaceutical pollution resulting in the feminization of certain fish, they have a lower priority because they are not easily understood or experienced by the general public.  In Jonathan P. Bound’s opinion, the provision of information about exactly how to go about disposing unused medication properly in conjunction with risk education may have a more positive and forceful effect.

=== Recommendations ===
Several recommendations and initiatives have been made to prevent pharmaceutical pollution in the environment.  Important practices include educating patients on the importance of proper unused drug disposal, educating physicians and patients of proper drug disposal, encouraging pharmaceutical industries to implement strategies for proper disposal of drugs or recycling strategies, and enforcing hospitals to implement better management practices for disposing pharmaceutical waste.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhati|first=Itishri|date=Dec 2013|title=Greener Route to Prevent Pharmaceutical Pollution|url=http://ijpcsonline.com/files/23-674.pdf|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences|volume= 2 |issue= 4|pages=7|via=IJPCS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, it is imperative that patients become educated on pharmaceutical pollution and its hazardous effects on humans, animals, and the overall environment.  By educating patients on proper disposal of unused drugs, steps are being taken to further prevent pharmaceutical waste in the environment.  Consumers should take precautions before tossing out drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Bhavana|date=2014-05-25|title=Drug disposal and environmental concern|url=http://jddt.in/index.php/jddt/article/view/192|journal=Journal of Drug Discovery and Therapeutics|language=en|volume=2|issue=17|issn=2320-4230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community take back programs have been set up for consumers to bring back unused drugs for proper disposal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Another initiative is for pharmacies to serve as a take back site for proper drug disposal such as implementing recycling bins for customers to bring back unused or expired medicines while they’re shopping.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition, educating physicians and patients on the importance of proper drug disposal and the environmental concern will help further reduce pharmaceutical waste.

Also, implementing initiatives for hospitals to focus on better practices for hazardous waste disposal may prove to be beneficial.  The US EPA incentives hospitals to develop efficient pharmaceutical disposal practices by giving them grants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This incentive may be very beneficial to other hospitals worldwide.

Additionally, “It is critical for us to develop an analytical method of identifying, testing, and regulating the amount of pharmaceuticals in the water systems”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Data must be collected in order to accurately measure the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. “Multiple Health risk assessments should be conducted to understand the effects of prolonged exposure to pharmaceuticals in drinking water”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Community based programs should be developed to monitor exposure and health outcomes.  We should encourage the pharmaceutical industry to develop technology that extracts pharmaceutical contains form waterways. “Extensive research must be conducted to determine the amount of pharmaceutical contamination in the environment and its effects on  animals and marine life”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Environmental===
While the full effects of most PPCPs on the environment are not understood, there is concern about the potential they have for harm because they may act unpredictably when mixed with other chemicals from the environment or concentrate in the food chain. Additionally, some PPCPs are active at very low concentrations, and are often released continuously in large or widespread quantities.

Because of the high solubility of most PPCPs, aquatic organisms are especially vulnerable to their effects.  Researchers have found that a class of antidepressants may be found in frogs and can significantly slow their development.{{mcn|date=September 2015}}  The increased presence of estrogen and other synthetic hormones in waste water due to birth control and hormonal therapies has been linked to increased feminization of exposed fish and other aquatic organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campusecology.wsu.edu/page_055.htm Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Environment]."

In addition to being found only in waterways, the ingredients of some PPCPs can also be found in the soil. Since some of these substances take a long time or cannot be degraded biologically, they make their way up the food chain.{{mcn|date=September 2015}} Information pertaining to the transport and fate of these hormones and their metabolites in dairy waste disposal is still being investigated, yet research suggest that the land application of solid wastes is likely linked with more hormone contamination problems.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, W., Yates, S.R., Bradford, S.A.

There are various concerns about the effects of pharmaceuticals found in surface waters and specifically the threats against rainbow trout exposed to treated sewage effluents.  Analysis of these pharmaceuticals in the blood plasma of fish compared to human therapeutic plasma levels have yielded vital information providing a means of assessing risk associated with medication waste in water.

Sci. Technol |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; rainbow trout were exposed to undiluted, treated sewage water at three different sits in Sweden.  They were exposed for a total of 14 days while 25 pharmaceuticals were measured in the blood plasma at different levels for analysis.  The [[progestin]] Levonorgestrel was detected in fish blood plasma at concentrations between 8.5 and 12&amp;nbsp;ng mL-1 which exceed the human therapeutic plasma level.  Studies show that the measured effluent level of Levonorgestrel in the three areas was shown to reduce the fertility of the rainbow trout.{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

The three sites chosen for field exposures were in located in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Umeå.  They were chosen according to their varying degrees of treatment technologies, geographic locations, and size.  The effluent treatment includes active sludge treatment, nitrogen and phosphorus removal (except in Umeå), primary clarification, and secondary clarification.  Juvenile rainbow trout were procured from Antens fiskodling AB, Sweden and Umlax AB, Sweden.  The fish were exposed to aerated, undiluted, treated effluent.  Since all of the sites underwent sludge treatment, it can be inferred that they are not representative of the low end of treatment efficacy. Of the 21 pharmaceuticals that were detected in the water samples, 18 were identified in the effluent, 17 in the plasma portion, and 14 pharmaceuticals were found in both effluent and plasma.{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

There are traces pharmaceuticals in waterways that have an adverse effect on the environment. 
]]
Starting in the mid-1960s, ecologists and toxicologists began to express concern about the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the water supply, but it wasn’t until a decade later that the presence of pharmaceuticals in water was well documented. Studies in 1975 and 1977 found [[clofibric]] acids and [[salicylic acid]]s at trace concentrations in treated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=S. |last2=Westerhoff |first2=P.|last3=Yoon|first3=Y.|last4=Sedlak|first4=D.|title=Pharmaceuticals, Personal Care Products, and Endocrine Disruptors in Water: Implications for the Water Industry |journal=Environmental Engineering Science |year=2003 |volume=20 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread concern about and research into the effect of [[PPCP]]s largely started in the early 1990s.  Until this time, PPCPs were largely ignored because of their relative solubility and containment in waterways compared to more familiar pollutants like [[agrochemicals]], industrial chemicals, and [[industrial waste]] and byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Ce-Cr/Chemicals-from-Pharmaceuticals-and-Personal-Care-Products.html Chemicals from Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products]."  Water Encyclopedia.  Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a great deal of attention has been directed to the ecological and physiological risk associated with pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites in water and the environment. In the last decade, most research in this area has focused on [[steroid hormones]] and antibiotics. There is concern that steroid hormones may act as [[endocrine disruptor]]s. Some research suggests that concentrations of [[ethinylestradiol]], an estrogen used in oral contraceptive medications and one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals, can cause endocrine disruption in aquatic and amphibian wildlife in concentrations as low as 1&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102" /&gt;

Current research on PPCPs aims to answer these questions:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.groundwater.org/gi/docs_pack/fa13.pdf Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products: An Emerging Issue]."  The Groudwater Foundation.  Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacoenvironmentology===
Pharmacoenvironmentology is an extension of pharmacovigilance as it deals specifically with the environmental and ecological effects of drugs given at therapeutic doses.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Syed Ziaur|last2=Khan|first2=Rahat Ali|last3=Gupta|first3=Varun|last4=Uddin|first4=Misbah|date=2007-07-24|title=Pharmacoenvironmentology – a component of pharmacovigilance|journal=Environmental Health|volume=6|pages=20|doi=10.1186/1476-069x-6-20|pmid=17650313|pmc=1947975|issn=1476-069X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacologists with this particular expertise (known as a pharmacoenvironmentologist) become a necessary component of any team assessing different aspects of drug safety in the environment.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20" /&gt; We must look at the effects of drugs not only in medical practice, but also at its environmental effects. Any good clinical trial should look at the impact of particular drugs on the environment. Things we need to address in pharmacoenvironmentology are drugs and their exact concentration in different parts of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medhi|first=Bikash|last2=Sewal|first2=RakeshK|date=2012-09-01|title=Ecopharmacovigilance: An issue urgently to be addressed|url=http://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2012/44/5/547/100363|journal=Indian Journal of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=547–9|doi=10.4103/0253-7613.100363|pmid=23112410|pmc=3480781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacoenvironmentology is a specific domain of pharmacology and not of environmental studies.This is because it deals with drugs entering through living organisms through elimination.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20" /&gt;

===Ecopharmacovigilance===
Pharmacovigilance is a new branch of science, which was born in 1960 after the incidence of the thalidomide disaster. Thalidomide is a teratogen and caused horrific birth abnormalities. The thalidomide disaster lead to the present day approach to drug safety and adverse event reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dally|first=Ann|title=Thalidomide: was the tragedy preventable?|journal=The Lancet|volume=351|issue=9110|pages=1197–1199|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(97)09038-7|pmid=9643709|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA, pharamacovigilance is science aiming to capture any adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in humans after use. However, ecopharmacovigilance is  the science, and activities concerning detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment which affect humans and other animal species.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There has been a growing focus among scientists about the impact of drugs on the environment.  In recent years, we have been able to see human pharmaceuticals that are being detected in the environment which most are typically found on surface water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The importance of ecopharmacovigilance is to monitor adverse effects of pharmaceuticals on humans through environmental exposure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Due to this relatively new field of science, researchers are continuously developing and understanding the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment and its risk on human and animal exposure. Environmental risk assessment is a regulatory requirement in the launch of any new drug.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This precaution has become a necessary step towards the understanding and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceutical residue in the environment.  It is important to note that pharmaceuticals enter the environment from the excretion of drugs after human use, hospitals, and improper disposal of unused drugs from patients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Ecopharmacology===
Ecopharmacology concerns the entry of chemicals or drugs into the environment through any route and at any concentration disturbing the balance of ecology (ecosystem), as a consequence. Ecopharmacology is a broad term that includes studies of “PPCPs” irrespective of doses and route of entry into environment.&lt;ref name="Ilene Sue Ruhoy 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue Ruhoy|first1=Ilene|last2=Daughton|first2=Christian G.|year=2008|title=Beyond the medicine cabinet: An analysis of where and why medications accumulate|url=|journal=Environment International|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1157–1169|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2008.05.002|pmid=18571238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Hashemi| first= Zahra | authorlink = | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to Environmental Pharmacology | chapter = Addendum: Terminologies related to Drug Safety | editor = Rahman SZ, Shahid M &amp; Gupta A | others = | edition = 1st | pages = 257–259| publisher = [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences]]| location = Aligarh | isbn = 978-81-906070-4-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.ehjournal.net/content/6/1/20| doi= 10.1186/1476-069X-6-20| last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2= Khan | first2=RA| last3=Gupta| first3=V| last4= Uddin | first4=Misbah| title= Pharmacoenvironmentology–A Component of Pharmacovigilance | journal= Environmental Health |date=July 2007| volume= 6 | issue=20| page= 20| pmid= 17650313  | pmc=1947975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geology of a karst aquifer area assists with the movement of PPCPs from the surface to the ground water. Relatively soluble bedrock creates sinkholes, caves and sinking streams into which surface water easily flows, with minimal filtering.  Since 25% of the population get their drinking water from karst aquifers, this affects a large number of people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodgen|first=L.K.|last2=Kelly|first2=W.R.|last3=Panno|first3=S.V.|last4=Taylor|first4=S.J.|last5=Armstrong|first5=D.L.|last6=Wiles|first6=K.N.|last7=Zhang|first7=Y.|last8=Zheng|first8=W.|title=Characterizing pharmaceutical, personal care product, and hormone contamination in a karst aquifer of southwestern Illinois, USA, using water quality and stream flow parameters|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=578|pages=281–289|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.103|pmid=27836351|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 study of karst aquifers in southwest Illinois found that 89% of water samples had one or more PPCP measured. Triclocarban (an antimicrobial) was the most frequently detected PPCP, with gemfibrozil (a cardiovascular drug) the second most frequently detected.  Other PPCPs detected were trimethoprim, naproxen, carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and fluoxetine. The data suggests that septic tank effluent is a probable source of PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Fate of pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants ===

[[File:Pipes of the Minsk sewage treatment plant - 3.jpg|thumb|316x316px|
[[Sewage treatment plants]] use physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove [[nutrients]] and contaminants from waste water.]]
[[Sewage treatment plants]] (STP) work with physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove [[nutrients]] and contaminants from waste water. Usually the STP is equipped with an initial mechanical separation of solid particles (cotton buds, cloth, hygiene articles etc.) appearing in the incoming water. Following this there may be filters separating finer particles either occurring in the incoming water or developing as a consequence of chemical treatment of the water with flocculating agents.

Many STPs also include one or several steps of biological treatment. By stimulating the activity of various strains of microorganisms physically their activity may be promoted to degrade the organic content of the sewage by up to 90% or more. In certain cases more advanced techniques are used as well. The today most commonly used advanced treatment steps especially in terms of micropollutants are

*[[Membrane technology|membrane]]s (which may be used instead of the biological treatment),
*[[ozone|ozonation]],
*[[activated carbon]] (powdered or granulated),
*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|UV treatment]],
* treatment with [[Ferrate(VI)|ferrate]] and
*[[Slow sand filter|sand filtration]] (which is sometimes added as a last step after the aforementioned).

PPCPs are difficult to remove from wastewater with conventional methods. Some research shows the concentration of such substances is even higher in water leaving the plant than water entering the plant. Many factors including environmental pH, seasonal variation, and biological properties affect the ability of a STP to remove PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2013 study of a drinking water treatment plant, found that of 30 PPCPs measured at both the source water and the drinking water locations, 76% of PPCPs were removed, on average, in the water treatment plant. Ozonation was found to be an efficient treatment process for the removal of many PPCPs.  However, there are some PPCPs that were not removed, such as DEET used as mosquito spray, nonylphenol which is a surfactant used in detergents, the antibiotic erythromycin, and the herbicide atrazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padhye|first=Lokesh P.|last2=Yao|first2=Hong|last3=Kung'u|first3=Francis T.|last4=Huang|first4=Ching-Hua|title=Year-long evaluation on the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine disrupting chemicals in an urban drinking water treatment plant|journal=Water Research|volume=51|pages=266–276|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2013.10.070|pmid=24262763|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several research projects are running to optimize the use of advanced sewage treatment techniques under different conditions. The advanced techniques will increase the costs for the sewage treatment substantially.
In a European cooperation project between 2008 and 2012 in comparison 4 hospital waste water treatment facilities were developed in [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] to investigate the elimination rates of concentrated waste water with pharmaceutical “cocktails” by using different and combined advanced treatment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-project.eu/ |title=The PILLS Project |website=www.pills-project.eu |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the German STP at Marienhospital [[Gelsenkirchen]] showed the effects of a combination of membranes, ozone, powdered activated carbon and sand filtration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GeQyqO9KEI |title=noPILLS Emschergenossenschaft Gelsenkirchen (Marienhospital)|last=EGLV Emschergenossenschaft/ Lippeverband|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2017 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even a maximum of installed technologies could not eliminate 100% of all substances and especially [[radiocontrast agent]]s are nearly impossible to eliminate. The investigations showed that depending on the installed technologies the treatment costs for such a hospital treatment facility may be up to 5.50 € per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-project.eu/PILLS_summary_english.pdf|title=EU project PILLS summary |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies and comparisons expect the treatment costs to increase up to 10%, mainly due to energy demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/organische_mikroverunreinigungen_in_gewassern_vierte_reinigungsstufe.pdf |title=Report of the German Federal Environment Agency |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore important to define best available technique before extensive infrastructure investments are introduced on a wide basis.

The fate of incoming pharmaceutical residues in the STP is unpredictable. Some substances seem to be more or less completely eliminated, while others pass the different steps in the STP unaffected. There is no systematic knowledge at hand to predict how and why this happens.

Pharmaceutical residues that have been conjugated (bound to a bile acid) before being excreted from the patients may undergo de-conjugation in the STP, yielding higher levels of free pharmaceutical substance in the outlet from the STP than in its incoming water. Some pharmaceuticals with large sales volumes have not been detected in the incoming water to the STP, indicating that complete metabolism and degradation must have occurred already in the patient or during the transport of sewage from the household to the STP.

=== Regulation ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}
In the United States, “There are no federal regulations limiting the levels of pharmaceuticals in wastewater or drinking water”, according to EPA.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Three birth controls substances and one antibiotic were added to the pharmaceuticals contaminant candidate list (CCL 3). EPA states that they are 8 pharmaceuticals that are classified as hazardous waste.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Out of 3000 pharmaceuticals EPA has only evaluated 100 of them leaving numerous of unscreened compounds in the water.” In 2008, EPA proposed an amendment to the Universal Waste Rule to address pharmaceutical wastes.” However, no action on the Rule has occurred since the hearing in the U.S. senate in 2009”.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA), [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA), and the Universal Waste Regulations under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) do little to protect the American population from pharmaceutical contamination in waterways.{{POV check inline|date=November 2018}} The EPA has the ability to implement governmental regulations to insure that the public has access to water that is free of pharmaceutical pollution however, no laws have been enacted even though “ the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that some research has demonstrated potential impact on human health from exposure to pharmaceuticals found in drinking water, such as antibiotics and EE2 substances that interfere with human hormone development”.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The EPA and other governmental agencies are not focused on this issue. They are not demanding any changes or regulations for Pharmaceutical pollution. They did not review the 3000 Pharmaceutical substances to determine their effect on human health.  There are no long term studies or health assessments created to examine how this affects us or the environment.

== Treatment methods ==
PPCPs are emerging pollutants, which pose potential risks on the environment and health. They are the result of many sectors, such as household consumption, industrial, farming, medicine, and aquaculture. However, because of the toxic and intractable characteristics, these pollutants cannot be removed by a traditional wastewater treatment plant in an effective way. Hence, they are becoming more and more universal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The fact that conventional wastewater treatment processes could not eradicate PPCPs completely has been highlighted. In final effluents, high concentrations of PPCPs can be detected, and these contaminants can accumulate in rivers, sludge, soil, and biosolids.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolpin|first=Dana W.|last2=Furlong|first2=Edward T.|last3=Meyer|first3=Michael T.|last4=Thurman|first4=E.

As such, environmental pollution caused by PPCPs are becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the removal of PPCPs is an urgent topic in the treatment of wastewater. Up to now, the methods used for the removal of PPCPs can be roughly divided into three categories, including physical, chemical, and biological methods.

=== Physical adsorption processes ===
The most common physical process is adsorption. It is usually used to remove traceable organic pollutants in water. Generally, carbon-based materials, which include [[biochar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/biochar-takes-the-pharmaceuticals-out-of-urine/2500487.article|title=Biochar takes the pharmaceuticals out of urine|work=Chemistry World|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  activated carbon, graphene and graphene oxide, and carbon nanotubes, are applied to absorb PPCPs from aqueous solution. Different materials have a different adsorption capacity for PPCPs. As for these materials, carbon nanotubes have the highest adsorption capacity, while the adsorption capacity adjusted with the surface chemistry and properties of carbon nanotubes. By comparison, activated carbon as a traditional adsorbent has a wide application in adsorption of PPCPs from wastewater. Although physical adsorption processes are regarded as an advanced technology, and developing fast in the field of treatment methods, there are still some problems that should be addressed in future research, like the production of carbon nanotubes, the high cost of graphene, and the absorption of macromolecular substances. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Biological degradation processes ===
Microbial degradation is regarded as an essential method for the removal of organic pollutants. The processes have numerous advantages, like economical input costs, and mild operational conditions. In these processes, microorganisms can make use of their metabolic functions to degrade the contaminants and in some cases several microbes cooperate with each other to achieve this goal. Pure cultures, mixed cultures, and activated sludge processes can be used in these processes, while an activated sludge process is widely used as a biological treatment in the conventional wastewater treatment plants. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Constructed wetlands show great promise and are discussed below.

=== Chemical advanced oxidation processes ===
Advanced chemical [[Redox|oxidation]] processes are effective in removing PPCPs from wastewater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These include [[Ozone|ozonation]], [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton oxidation]], [[ionizing radiation]], and [[Ultraviolet|UV treatment]], are efficient in the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WANG|first=JIAN LONG|last2=XU|first2=LE JIN|date=2012-02|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes for Wastewater Treatment: Formation of Hydroxyl Radical and Application|journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=251–325|doi=10.1080/10643389.2010.507698|issn=1064-3389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, ozonation is the most widely used oxidation method for the removal of PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Combined chemical and biological methods ===
Because some PPCPs are highly resistant and toxic to microorganisms, it can be difficult for biological methods to eliminate them on their own. On the other hand, advanced chemical oxidation processes behave well in removing persistent pollutants, but the intermediates produced during the treatment process are sometimes more resistant to oxidation. Thus, if using one of these two methods to treat pollutants, the process requires long times and high energy inputs, resulting in a high cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to overcome the shortfalls of using a single method, combinations of biological and chemical processes have increasingly been applied in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-12-01|title=Removal of diclofenac from surface water by electron beam irradiation combined with a biological aerated filter|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969806X14001947|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|language=en|volume=105|pages=104–108|doi=10.1016/j.radphyschem.2014.05.019|issn=0969-806X|last1=He|first1=Shijun|last2=Wang|first2=Jianlong|last3=Ye|first3=Longfei|last4=Zhang|first4=Youxue|last5=Yu|first5=Jiang}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, advanced chemical oxidation processes are used for pre-treatment to transform persistent pollutants into the biodegradable intermediates. Then, biological methods are applied to degrade them. Combined systems are being shown to be efficient and cost effective. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Examples==
===Blister packs===
80% of pills in the world are packed with [[Blister pack|blister packaging,]] which is the most convenient type for several reasons.&lt;ref name=":0al"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pharmaceutical Blister Packaging, Part I: Rationale and Materials|last = Pilchik|first = Ron|date = November 2000|journal = Pharmaceutical Technology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 68–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blister packs have two main components, the “lid” and the “blister” (cavity). Lid is mainly manufactured with [[Aluminium|aluminum]] (Al) and [[paper]]. The Cavity consists of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polypropylene]] (PP), [[polyester]] (PET) or aluminum (Al).&lt;ref name=":0al" /&gt; If users employ proper disposal methods, all these materials can be [[Recycling|recycled]] and the harmful effects to the [[Natural environment|environment]] can be minimized. However, a problem arises with the improper disposal either by burning or disposing as normal household waste.

Burning of blister packs directly causes [[air pollution]] by the [[combustion]] products of polypropylene ([C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), polyester ([C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), and polyvinyl chloride ([CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCl]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). The combustion reactions and products of these chemicals are mentioned below.

===Nail polish remover===
[[Nail polish remover]] has the ability to enter bodies of water and soil after entering landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to [[acetone]]'s high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the acetone molecules will evaporate again, and so, when acetone remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. Nail polish remover evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An acetone molecule can't attract other acetone molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds acetone molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/Chem%20and%20Society/IMF_Solutions/olIMF_solutions.htm|title=Intermolecular Forces and Solutions|website=employees.csbsju.edu|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nail polish remover.jpg|thumb|310x310px|
Nail polish remover contains acetone. 
]]
Since nail polish remover is a solvent, it will dissolve in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish remover that enters the hydrosphere will increase the concentration of acetone and then increase the concentration of the solution created when acetone and water bonds. If enough nail polish remover is disposed, it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.

Nail polish remover can also enter the lithosphere by landfills and by precipitation. However, it will not bind to the soil. Microorganisms in the soil will decompose acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp21.pdf|title=Toxilogical Profile for Acetone|last=|first=|date=May 1994|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of microorganisms decomposing acetone is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water. The more acetone readily available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.

When nail polish remover evaporates, acetone enters the atmosphere in the gaseous phase. In the gaseous phase, acetone can undergo photolysis and breakdown into carbon monoxide, methane, and ethane.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2415445|title=The Mechanism of the Gas Phase Photolysis of Acetone|first1=R.

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO + hv → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ CO

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO → CH4 + CH2COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → C2H6

A second pathway that nail polish remover can enter in the atmosphere is reacting with hydroxyl radicals. When acetone reacts with hydroxyl radicals, its main product is methylglyoxal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp21-c5.pdf|title=Toxicological Profile for Acetone - Potential for Human Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methylglyoxal]] is an organic compound that is a by-product of many metabolic pathways. It is an intermediate precursor for many [[advanced glycation end-product]]s, that are formed for diseases such as diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. The following reaction occurs:

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO + ·OH → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)OH + ·CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)OH + ·CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;→  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)COH + 3H+

=== Case study ===
[[File:Pearl River Delta Area.png|thumb|466x466px|The Location of the Pearl River Delta]]

==== Pearl River, South China ====
It is well known that releasing antibiotics into the water can lead to antibiotic resistance. In the recent decade, the Pearl River has been altered by antibiotics. A study found that concentrations of antibiotics were lower than those in the estuary, and decreased from the east side to the west side. A series of phenomena showed that the primary sources of antibiotics came from river tributaries and terrigenous sources and there were frequent human activities and hydraulic conditions along the west banks of the river. Seasonal variations happened in most of the detected antibiotics in water as well. Additionally, the TOC content of sediments, and the pH of water affected the performance of antibiotics. The highest concentrations of antibiotics were found downstream of Guangdong Province, which was affected severely by nearby densely populated megacities, like Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Macau. These have an adverse impact on people there. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=The distribution and partitioning of common antibiotics in water and sediment of the Pearl River Estuary, South China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513004748|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=92|issue=11|pages=1410–1416|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.03.044|pmid=23628172|issn=0045-6535|last1=Liang|first1=Ximei|last2=Chen|first2=Baowei|last3=Nie|first3=Xiangping|last4=Shi|first4=Zhen|last5=Huang|first5=Xiaoping|last6=Li|first6=Xiangdong|hdl=10397/23573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The coast of Guangdong, South China ====
The coast of Guangdong is a place polluted by another representative contaminant, plastic debris. After an extended period of observation, scientists found that the beach was a place that would help the fragmentation of plastic debrisinto highly fragmented plastic particles that can attach to small organisms. Through the process of washback, the plastic debris may be transported into the water, and make an adverse impact on a wide range of marine life at different trophic levels. It is noticeable that polystyrene (PS) foams and fragments, and microplastics account for a great percentage of plastic debris on the beach. Most of the polystyrenes degrade within a year on average, and could not be observed in deep beach sediment. Thus, coastal beaches store highly fragmented and degraded micro-plastics. However, they may be active and return to the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=Size distribution of stranded small plastic debris on the coast of Guangdong, South China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116314828|journal=Environmental Pollution|language=en|volume=220|issue=Pt A|pages=407–412|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.079|pmid=27717531|issn=0269-7491|last1=Fok|first1=Lincoln|last2=Cheung|first2=Pui Kwan|last3=Tang|first3=Guangda|last4=Li|first4=Wai Chin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== An alternative best management practice for PPCPs treatment – the application of constructed wetlands ==
[[File:Structures of constructed wetlands.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Structures of constructed wetlands: (a) surface flow (SF-CW); (b) horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF-CW); and (c) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF-CW). ]]
In recent years, scientists have been trying to find a way to handle PPCPs, but most of the advanced treatment processes are too expensive to apply in large scale. As such, a low-cost alternative approach for PPCPs treatment is of great significance for the environment. Based on this purpose, increasing concerns have been raised on constructed wetlands, which are cheaper in construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring. Actually, constructed wetlands have been proved to be effective for removal of conventional contaminants in wastewater treatment. However, applying constructed wetlands to deal with these issues is a totally new application in the field. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781420012514|title=Treatment Wetlands, Second Edition|last=Kadlec|first=Robert|last2=Wallace|first2=Scott|date=2008-07-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566705264|language=en|doi=10.1201/9781420012514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GARCÍA|first=JOAN|last2=ROUSSEAU|first2=DIEDERIK P.

=== Important components of constructed wetlands ===

==== Substrate ====
Based on several researches and further analysis for various constructed wetlands, scientists found that gravel is the most common substrate materials for the removal of PPCPs in constructed wetlands. The gravel substrate is efficient for some certain PPCPs which are difficult to be biodegraded but with relatively high hydrophobicity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; On the other hand, according to a set of experiments &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-07-15|title=Selection of a support matrix for the removal of some phenoxyacetic compounds in constructed wetlands systems|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969707002148|journal=Science of the Total Environment|language=en|volume=380|issue=1–3|pages=237–246|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.02.015|pmid=17379272|issn=0048-9697|last1=Dordio|first1=Ana V.|last2=Teimão|first2=José|last3=Ramalho|first3=Idália|last4=Carvalho|first4=A.

==== Vegetation ====
Vegetation plays an important part in directly taking up several organic pollutants from wastewater in constructed wetlands. With the function of diffusion, the organic pollutants like PPCPs can be transported within plants. That means, theses pollutants cannot move into the plant tissues through the plant roots and some specific transporters. Generally, the physico-chemical characteristics of PPCPs, such as hydrophobicity, water solubility, and concentration, affect the diffusion of the compounds.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-05-15|title=Organic xenobiotics removal in constructed wetlands, with emphasis on the importance of the support matrix|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389413001842|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|language=en|volume=252-253|pages=272–292|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.03.008|pmid=23542322|issn=0304-3894|last1=Dordio|first1=A.V.|last2=Carvalho|first2=A.J.P.|hdl=10174/9895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-12-01|title=Effects of plants and microorganisms in wwconstructed wetlands for wastewater treatment|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975003001319|journal=Biotechnology Advances|language=en|volume=22|issue=1–2|pages=93–117|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2003.08.010|pmid=14623046|issn=0734-9750|last1=Stottmeister|first1=U.|last2=Wießner|first2=A.|last3=Kuschk|first3=P.|last4=Kappelmeyer|first4=U.|last5=Kästner|first5=M.|last6=Bederski|first6=O.|last7=Müller|first7=R.A.|last8=Moormann|first8=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being soaked up by plants, the degradation may happen in metabolism processes.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-08-01|title=Assessment of plant-driven removal of emerging organic pollutants by duckweed|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653510006363|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=80|issue=7|pages=687–692|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.05.045|pmid=20580410|issn=0045-6535|last1=Reinhold|first1=Dawn|last2=Vishwanathan|first2=Saritha|last3=Park|first3=Jung Jae|last4=Oh|first4=David|last5=Michael Saunders|first5=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the activities of microbial populations, there are numerous biological processes occurring in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-06-01|title=Comprehensive assessment of the design configuration of constructed wetlands for the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products from urban wastewaters|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135410002757|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=12|pages=3669–3678|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2010.04.022|pmid=20494393|issn=0043-1354|last1=Hijosa-Valsero|first1=María|last2=Matamoros|first2=Víctor|last3=Sidrach-Cardona|first3=Ricardo|last4=Martín-Villacorta|first4=Javier|last5=Bécares|first5=Eloy|last6=Bayona|first6=Josep M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-03-01|title=Assessment of full-scale natural systems for the removal of PPCPs from wastewater in small communities|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135409007052|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1429–1439|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2009.10.032|pmid=19913872|issn=0043-1354|last1=Hijosa-Valsero|first1=María|last2=Matamoros|first2=Víctor|last3=Martín-Villacorta|first3=Javier|last4=Bécares|first4=Eloy|last5=Bayona|first5=Josep M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-12-01|title=Removal of nutrients and veterinary antibiotics from swine wastewater by a constructed macrophyte floating bed system|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147971000232X|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|language=en|volume=91|issue=12|pages=2657–2661|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.036|pmid=20696518|issn=0301-4797|last1=Xian|first1=Qiming|last2=Hu|first2=Lixia|last3=Chen|first3=Hancheng|last4=Chang|first4=Zhizhou|last5=Zou|first5=Huixian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, the toxicity of PPCPs to plants is a nonnegligible issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dordio|first=Ana|last2=Ferro|first2=Raquel|last3=Teixeira|first3=Dora|last4=Palace|first4=Alfredo J.|last5=Pinto|first5=Ana P.|last6=Dias|first6=Cristina M.B.|date=2011-06-15|title=Study on the use ofTyphaspp. for the phytotreatment of water contaminated with ibuprofen|journal=International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=91|issue=7–8|pages=654–667|doi=10.1080/03067311003782708|issn=0306-7319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-05-01|title=Elimination of veterinary antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes from swine wastewater in the vertical flow constructed wetlands|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513000544|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=91|issue=8|pages=1088–1093|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.007|pmid=23380031|issn=0045-6535|last1=Liu|first1=Lin|last2=Liu|first2=Chaoxiang|last3=Zheng|first3=Jiayu|last4=Huang|first4=Xu|last5=Wang|first5=Zhen|last6=Liu|first6=Yuhong|last7=Zhu|first7=Gefu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microbes ====
The processes of transformation and mineralization of nutrients and organic pollutants are primarily dependent on microbes in constructed wetlands, and the microbial degradation processes can occur in both the aerobic and the anaerobic environments with the participation of diverse microorganisms, like fungi, specific protozoa, heterotrophic bacteria, and autotrophic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781420012514|title=Treatment Wetlands, Second Edition|last=Kadlec|first=Robert|last2=Wallace|first2=Scott|date=2008-07-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566705264|language=en|doi=10.1201/9781420012514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Guibing|last2=Jetten|first2=Mike S.

However, for PPCPs, which are xenobiotic organic pollutants with totally different compounds, they are degraded relatively slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203491454|title=Biogeochemistry of Wetlands|last=Ramesh Reddy|first=K|last2=DeLaune|first2=Ronald|date=2008-07-28|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566706780|language=en|doi=10.1201/9780203491454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Even though there are non-specific enzymes, the rate of degradation is still slower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seffernick|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Wackett|first2=Lawrence P.|date=2001-10|title=Rapid Evolution of Bacterial Catabolic Enzymes:  A Case Study with Atrazine Chlorohydrolase†|journal=Biochemistry|language=en|volume=40|issue=43|pages=12747–12753|doi=10.1021/bi011293r|issn=0006-2960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pending questions ==

* Is there a temperature at which PPCPs are burned and destroyed? Would they thus be eliminated when materials are made into [[biochar]]?
* Are there [[Food coloring|artificial colorings]] that degrade under similar conditions to PPCPs and could be used as [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]] in [[Low technology|low-tech]] experiments of how to eliminate PPCPs?
* [[Ultraviolet|Ultraviolet light]] is known to degrade PPCPs. How long would urine need to lay in the sun in transparent bottles to destroy the PPCPs before its use as fertilizer? 
* Do [[Microorganism|soil microbes]] develop or [[Evolution|evolve]] the ability to break down PPCPs over time? If a person who consumes a pharmaceutical uses a [[Urine-diverting dry toilet|Urine-diverting Dry Toilet]], in which the urine is dispersed into fertile soil among plants, would the microbes eventually decompose this chemical entirely? After how much time? Which types of pharmaceuticals would break down faster and which slower?
* Are there types of PPCPs that cannot enter into the roots of plants because their molecules are simply too large?
* When [[Essential oil|essential oils]] are extracted from plants, would PPCPs pass into them, stay in the cauldron, or be destroyed by the heat?

==In phonology==
{{main|distinctive feature}}
In [[phonology]], [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s are categorized into [[natural class]]es on the basis of their [[distinctive feature]]s. Each feature is a quality or characteristic of the natural class, such as [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] or [[manner of articulation|manner]]. A unique combination of features defines a [[phoneme]].

Examples of [[phonemic]] or distinctive features are: [+/- [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] ], [+/- [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] ] (binary features) and [ [[coronal consonant|CORONAL]] ] (a unary feature; also a [[place of articulation|place]] feature).

Surface representations can be expressed as the result of rules acting on the features of the [[underlying representation]]. These rules are formulated in terms of transformations on features.

==In morphology==
In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], words are often organized into '''[[lexical category|lexical categories]]''' or '''word classes''', such as "noun", "verb", "adjective", and so on. These word classes have '''[[grammatical category|grammatical feature]]s''' (also called ''categories'' or ''inflectional categories''), which can have one of a set of potential '''values''' (also called the ''property'', ''meaning'', or ''feature'' of the category).&lt;ref&gt;Kibort, Anna &amp; Corbett, Greville G. [http://www.grammaticalfeatures.net/inventory.html Grammatical Features - Feature Inventory]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the [[pronoun]] in English. Pronouns are a ''lexical category''. Pronouns have the [[grammatical person|person]] ''feature'', which can have a ''value'' of "first", "second", or "third". English pronouns also have the [[grammatical number|number]] ''feature'', which can have a value of either "singular" or "plural". As a result, we can describe the English pronoun "they" as a pronoun with [person:3] and [number:plural].

==In semantics==
{{main|semantic feature}}
In [[semantics]], words are categorized into [[semantic class]]es. Intersecting semantic classes share the same [[semantic feature]]s.

'''''Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art from Egypt to Star Wars''''' is a 2012 book by American cultural critic [[Camille Paglia]], in which the author discusses notable works of [[Applied arts|applied]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]] from ancient to modern times. Paglia wrote that she intended it to be a personalized "journey" through [[art history]], focusing on [[Western world|Western]] works. Paglia writes that she felt inspired to write given that she worries 21st century Americans are overexposed to visual stimulation by the "all-pervasive mass media" and must fight to keep their capacity for [[contemplation]].&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

The book features twenty-nine sections, with glossy full-color illustrations, each focused on a specific piece.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Artists detailed include [[Titian]], [[Manet]], [[Picasso]], and [[Jackson Pollock]] among others. After its October 16, 2012 release, the book received positive reviews from publications such as ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Derakhshani|first=Tirdad|title=Camille Paglia hopes to reignite regular folks' interest in the arts|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-10-17/entertainment/34500629_1_camille-paglia-sexual-personae-western-art|date=October 17, 2012|publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it also picked up more critical, negative reviews from publications such as ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Charioteer of Delphi-2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia discusses the [[Charioteer of Delphi]], a notable [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] work.&lt;ref name=delphi/&gt;]]

While touching on the themes of Paglia's previous work, ''Glittering Images'' focuses on modern cultural [[ignorance]].&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Paglia wrote what she intended as a personalized "journey" through art history since she believes people today have become visually overexposed by the mass-media and disconnected from the past.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; In it, she argues, "the eye is assaulted, coerced, desensitized."&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

Paglia discusses twenty-nine examples of visual artwork. Paglia begins by describing the [[ancient Egypt]]ian funerary images of [[Nefertari (18th dynasty)|Queen Nefertari]],&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; a royal whose name means "the most beautiful of them all". Paglia refers to how the civilization "dreamed of conquering the terrors of death", and she notes how "Egyptian painted figures float in an abstract space that is neither here nor there", describing the visual power of this "eternal present" depicted.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.3-5&lt;/ref&gt; She then turns to the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] statuettes carved by [[Bronze Age]] residents of several [[Aegean Sea]] islands, which feature "coolly geometric" designs unlike that of the voluptuous figures carved by earlier, [[Stone Age]] people (such as the '[[Venus of Willendorf]]') while still displaying [[vulva]]e markings and prominent breasts that convey femininity. These pieces of [[Cycladic art]] are cited as "daring explorations of form and structure" foreshadowing the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The author then describes the '[[Charioteer of Delphi]]', a work from the fifth century BC that she writes embodies well the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ideals of "young male beauty" and the building of character through personal striving. She states how she finds the chariot racing athlete "grave and dignified" with his meditative expression, giving a "look that would become canonical for gods and heroes in the classic tradition".&lt;ref name=delphi&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.15-18&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write about the '[[Erechtheion#The Porch of the Caryatids|Porch of the Maidens]]' in the [[Erechtheion]] in [[Athens, Greece]], with columns carved into feminine shapes that she labels as "a remarkable display of female power" as "muscular strength" co-exists with womanly curves,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.21&lt;/ref&gt; and then the piece '[[Laocoön and His Sons]]', a violent scene carved in marble in which [[sea serpent]]s attempt to slay a man and his three sons that stridently addresses the problem of [[theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KellsFol007vMadonnaChild V2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia praises the intricacy of the [[Book of Kells]], the section devoted to [[Virgin Mary]] pictured here.&lt;ref name=kells/&gt;]]

The book goes on next to the famous [[mosaic]] of [[Saint John Chrysostom]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]], a piece that Paglia writes as having an "implacable intensity of gaze" making it a great piece of [[Byzantine art]],&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally to the late eighth century Ireland's [[Book of Kells]], an "intricately decorated manuscript of the Gospels that is one of the most beautiful objects surviving from medieval Europe."&lt;ref name=kells&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.39&lt;/ref&gt; The eight piece included is [[Donatello]]'s '[[Mary Magdalene (Donatello)|Mary Magdalene]]', a work of the [[Italian Renaissance]] created in 1453 that showed the artist's ability to be "harsh and imposing".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.43&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia then discusses [[Titian]]'s '[[Venus with a Mirror]]'; she writes about the artistic changes it symbolizes as the strong brushwork and liberal use of paint allow for warm flesh tones, Titian creating "opulent nudes that thrust sexual display and fantasy" onto the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia next discusses [[Bronzino]]'s 'Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune', writing that as a work of the [[Mannerism]] movement it shows a "polished theatricality" arresting to the viewer,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s '[[Chair of Saint Peter]]' in the [[Vatican City]], a 17th-century work showing how [[Baroque art]] often "overwhelms the senses with flamboyant grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;

She takes a nuanced view of the lasting influence of [[pop art]], writing that, generally, the artistic movement "projects an innocent child’s view of the world."&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; She also argues that works by artists such as [[Andy Warhol]], whom she praises, conveyed powerful subtleties with their pieces. The book details '[[Marilyn Diptych]]', a 1962 silkscreen that replicates a photo of [[Marilyn Monroe]] over and over with image variations, and the work is lauded for strongly showing the "multiplicity of meanings" in the actress' life and legacy.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

The book additionally cites [[Eleanor Antin]]'s [[conceptual art]] project '100 Boots'. Paglia praises the work, writing that "boots, like their creator, are outsiders, eternal migrants questing for knowledge and experience."&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;

==Reception==
Writer John Adams of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' published a critical review of the book, viewing it as being "so agenda driven and so riddled with polemic asides that its potential to persuade is forever being compromised." Adams noted that the book avoided discussions of [[Giotto]], [[Michelangelo]], [[El Greco]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], and [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], which he criticized. He supported how Paglia "encourages us to read more closely and to look more imaginatively" at the world of [[art history]], though concluded that her praise of [[George Lucas]] was assessing art "by its reach rather than its depth", and thus Paglia "has journeyed to the wrong continent, and what she has found glittering there is fool's gold."&lt;ref name="on-art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=John|title=Paglia on Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/glittering-images-by-camille-paglia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|date=November 30, 2012|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Gary Rosen of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', however, praised the book's "impressive range" and accessibility for a general audience. He argued that "[f]or the most part, Ms. Paglia chooses well, from works both celebrated and obscure", and he stated that the author "is especially good at the difficult trick of providing context for the newcomer to art history without being tedious for a more experienced reader."&lt;ref name=WSJ1&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Gary|title=The Pagan Aesthetic|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443675404578058504002593338|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=July 17, 2014|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' ran a supportive article that labeled the book a "magisterial, poetically composed, and masterly study".&lt;ref name=inquirer/&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a supportive review by [[Michael S. Roth]], an author and the president of [[Wesleyan University]]. He wrote, "Artists, questing outsiders, are still with us, still finding their way, making their way. Perhaps some of them will be inspired by the glittering images Camille Paglia offers here."&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Michael S. Roth]]|title=Art appreciation 101: 'Glittering Images' by Camille Paglia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/28/entertainment/la-ca-jc-camille-paglia-20121230|date=December 28, 2012|publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The film was produced between 1966-1967 by Rinco-Film in Munich for the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|West German Federal Ministry of Health]] under health minister Käte Ströbel through the German Health Museum.&lt;ref name="MeierHäussler2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Meier|author2=Thomas Häussler|title=Zwischen Masse, Markt und Macht: das Medienunternehmen Ringier im Wandel 1833-2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A11IAQAAIAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Chronos|isbn=978-3-0340-0952-2|volume=1|page=493|quote=Im Auftrag der deutschen Gesundheitsministerin Käte Ströbel produzierte sie den überaus erfolgreichen Aufklärungsfilm «Helga - Vom Werden des menschlichen Lebens»..}}&lt;/ref&gt; It documents the pregnancy of a young woman from the first visit to the doctor all the way to childbirth.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MierschBroder2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Miersch|author2=Henryk M.

==Impact==
The film has been studied due to its impact on German society  involving the sociopolitical implications of the intervention by the West German federal government in matters of sexual education involving the [[mass media]] as well as the curriculum they approved regarding sexual matters. The West German federal government used the film as an educational tool but also as a means to gain influence in areas such as public health and education which were traditionally under regional jurisdiction,  possibly even bypassing constitutional issues governing the distribution of powers between the Federal government and the regions. Up to that time, regional authorities could veto Federal policies which were seen by  them as encroaching on their cultural policies.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; 

The success of the film when viewed by an audience of a wide and diverse demographic was analysed in terms of its influence on social thinking. [[Gender issues]] related to the film have been considered due to the fact that matters  traditionally concerning privacy, intimacy and femininity, up to that point in time, were made public to a wide demographic through film and the mass media. The commercial success of the film has also been examined since it was a sex-education film without any famous actors or an elaborate plot.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; The film was successful in countries such as France, Italy and England which were considered "prudish" at the time.&lt;ref name="Jogschies1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rainer Jogschies|title=Wer zweimal mit derselben pennt--: die befreiten Sechziger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XthGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Helga+%E2%80%93+Vom+Werden+des+menschlichen+Lebens%22&amp;dq=%22Helga+%E2%80%93+Vom+Werden+des+menschlichen+Lebens%22|year=1991|publisher=Ullstein|page=75|quote=So sah denn Helga - vom Werden des menschlichen Lebens (1967) auch aus - und wurde dadurch im noch prüderen Frankreich, England und Italien ein überraschender Kassenerfolg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris, 1,500 catholic priests and nuns attended a private screening of the film arranged by ''centrale catholique''. The film was also extensively covered by print media such as ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[Paris Match]]''.&lt;ref name="Julian2011"/&gt;

The film was a product of a political decision by the West German Federal government to educate the people regarding matters related to procreation and [[family planning]] at a time of advances in the fields of human genetics and contraception. The film gained acceptance in the young adult demographic due to their desire to be informed about issues related to family planning and childbirth as part of a consumer society in which women had to work. Educators, although worried about the impact of the violence of the scenes during childbirth upon the young, also accepted that the film could aid the understanding of husbands concerning the great pains experienced by their wives during childbirth. The film also  presented a new model of informed motherhood based on knowledge and social awareness.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews, with the conservative press leading the way. ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' described the film as "enlightening in a comprehensive and rational manner, without hypocrisy and false shame".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; The critic added: {{blockquote|The cell proliferation is an aesthetic pleasure, an opal-like miracle of colour with effects of light and  backlight, a piece of art from the era of [[Tachisme]]. The colours are so nice, the fast changes so wonderful that one nearly forgets the subject. Other processes [e.g. the representation of the different stages of the embryo] were still difficult to represent, some shots succeeded here for the first time; experts will rack their brains over how this was achieved}}

The conservative ''Mindener Tageblatt'' commented that "the really scientific information had been conveyed in a flawlessly proper manner without prudery and without arousing inappropriate sexual feelings".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The left-liberal press was more critical of the film. The ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' critic remarked that:&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; {{blockquote|we are at the point of wasting one of our basic rights: the right to keep silent and to privacy [verschlossene Türen] about certain aspects of life which should not be revealed to the public eye as they belong to the private sphere of human nature.}}

The press which was present at the [[sneak preview]] also criticised the film's "ridiculous frame action", "heavy didactic tone" and "lack of contraceptive information". Women correspondents also complained that Helga in "her perfect makeup" during childbirth "did not adequately depict the pain of the anonymous woman in labour".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

Other audience reactions included those of some teenage girls which were shocked by the [[placenta]] removal scenes and the subsequent revelations that the placenta was used for the production of cosmetics. The perspective and appearance of medical instruments was also criticised as reminiscent of a horror film.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The ''Protestant Film Observer'' criticised the presentation  aspects of the film and the absence of information on family planning, [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

{{For|how-to guides on Wikipedia processes and practices|:Category:Wikipedia how-to{{!}}Category:Wikipedia how-to}}
{{For|the YouTube channel|HowToBasic}}
A '''how-to''' is an informal, often short, description of how to accomplish a specific task. A how-to is usually meant to help non-experts, may leave out details that are only important to experts, and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic.

One of the earliest how-to books was published in 1569 and entitled, ''A booke of the arte and maner, how to plant set Up intro an divers other new practise, by one of the Abbey of Saint Vincent in Fraunce'' by [[Leonard Mascall]].'' 

Perhaps the best known full-length book in the genre is ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'', written by [[Dale Carnegie]] in 1936.

A similar concept can be seen in many of the ''[topic] For Dummies'' series of tutorials and also in many other introductory surveys entitled with the suffix "[[101 (number)|101]]" (based on academic numberings of entry-level courses).

==Usage in the world of computers==
It is common practice to write the phrase as "HOWTO" in the open-source community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/howtos.html List of Linux HowTos], tldp.org&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the traditional naming scheme for technical documentation, such as [[FAQ]] and [[README]]. Another possible reason is that this makes it easier to find a how-to in search engines like [[Google]] as searching with the words "to" and "how" does not necessarily deliver relevant search results.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2009 A Google search for "How To" results in a comprehensive list of HowTo sites. It seems this has changed throughout the years. In the 1990s and early years of 2000, it was common for search engines to ignore these words, and even to notify the user that these words are too common for giving a comprehensive result. Currently, [https://www.google.com/help/features.html the Google features web page] says: Google ignores common words and characters such as where, the, how, and other digits and letters that slow down your search without improving the results. If a common word is essential to getting the results you want, you can make sure we pay attention to it by putting a "+" sign in front of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

How-tos have a long history as a way of sharing knowledge on the [[Internet]], but are less successful than [[FAQ]]s, manuals, [[recipe]]s and [[guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A search on [[Google]] for "howto faq" or for "faq howto" results in FAQs with HowTo instructions in them, but never to a single HowTo page. This is probably because FAQ pages are usually broader in scope, and therefore more commonly used.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, most how-tos on the Internet were the result of a complex process in which an author wrote a how-to for potential readers. After 2001, [[user added content]] played a more and more important role on the internet in a trend that is widely referred to{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} as [[Web 2.0]]. This had a profound impact on the way in which how-tos are generated on the internet, as the readers and users were able to add to and improve the on-line content.

The '''Industrial Revolution''' was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from [[craft production|hand production methods]] to [[machine]]s, new [[chemical manufacturing]] and [[Puddling (metallurgy)|iron production]] processes, the increasing use of [[steam power]], the development of [[machine tool]]s and the rise of the [[factory system]].

The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth.  Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the [[standard of living]] for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"/&gt;

Although the [[structural change]] from agriculture to industry is widely associated with Industrial Revolution, in United Kingdom it was already almost complete by 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Keibek |first=Sebastiaan A.J. |date=2016 |title=The male occupational structure of England and Wales, 1600-1850 |publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Textile industry|Mechanized textile production]] spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging [[#Belgium|in Belgium]] and the United States and later textiles in France.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;

An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, [[Hot blast|hot blast iron smelting]] and new technologies, such as the [[electrical telegraph]], widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth.  Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].  These new innovations included new steel making processes, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.&lt;ref  name="David S.

==Etymology==
The earliest recorded use of the term "Industrial Revolution" seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy [[Louis-Guillaume Otto]], announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise.&lt;ref name="The industrial revolution in national context: Europe and the USA"/&gt; In his 1976 book ''[[Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society]]'', [[Raymond Williams]] states in the entry for "Industry": "The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in [[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[Robert Owen|Owen]], between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as [[William Blake|Blake]] in the early 1790s and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] at the turn of the [19th] century." The term ''Industrial Revolution'' applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in [[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui]]'s description in 1837 of ''la révolution industrielle''.&lt;ref&gt;BLANQUI Jérôme-Adolphe, ''Histoire de l'économie politique en Europe depuis les anciens jusqu'à nos jours'', 1837, {{ISBN|978-0-543-94762-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 spoke of "an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society".  However, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to [[Arnold Toynbee]], whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution13"/&gt;

Some historians, such as [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]] and [[Nicholas Crafts]], have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term ''revolution'' is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among some historians.

==Important technological developments==
The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations,&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Innovations"/&gt; beginning in the second half of the 18th century.  By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies:
* '''Textiles''' – mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500. The [[power loom]] increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[cotton gin]] increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;  Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen, but they were not as great as in cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;!--[[File:Watt James von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[James Watt]] improved on [[Thomas Newcomen|Newcomen]]'s 1712 steam engine with his [[Watt steam engine]] in 1781]]--&gt;
* '''Steam power''' – the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s increased so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel.  The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|82}}  The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio, making it suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|year-1985|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800.
* '''Iron making''' – the substitution of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost of [[pig iron]] and [[wrought iron]] production.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|89–93}}  Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1= Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Pres|isbn= 978-0-226-72634-2 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[economies of scale]].  The steam engine began being used to pump water to power blast air in the mid 1750s, enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760.  It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher [[blast furnace]] temperatures.  The [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the [[finery forge]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969 91"&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. [[Hot blast]] (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.
* '''Invention of machine tools''' – The first [[machine tools]] were invented.  These included the [[screw cutting lathe]], cylinder boring machine and the [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]].   Machine tools made the economical manufacture of [[Interchangeable parts|precision metal parts]] possible, although it took several decades to develop effective techniques.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Textile manufacture===
{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

====British textile industry statistics====
In 1750 Britain imported 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton, most of which was spun and woven by cottage industry in Lancashire. The work was done by hand in workers' homes or occasionally in shops of master weavers. In 1787 raw cotton consumption was 22 million pounds, most of which was cleaned, carded and spun on machines.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|41–42}} The British textile industry used 52 million pounds of cotton in 1800, which increased to 588 million pounds in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialization and Society|last=Hopkins|first=Eric|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|location=London|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 2.6% in 1760, 17% in 1801 and 22.4% in 1831.  Value added by the British woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801.  Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797.  In 1760 approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800.  In 1781 cotton spun amounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800.  In 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in Britain.  In 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to 7 million over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

Wages in [[Lancashire]], a core region for cottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving, were about six times those in India in 1770, when overall [[productivity]] in Britain was about three times higher than in India.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Cotton====
Parts of India, China, Central America, South America and the Middle-East have a long history of hand manufacturing [[cotton]] textiles, which became a major industry sometime after 1000 AD. In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.  In the 15th century China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. By the 17th century almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing.  Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a [[medium of exchange]].  In India a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers.  Some merchants also owned small weaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  The early Spanish explorers found Native Americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton: sea island cotton (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'') and upland green seeded cotton ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]''.  Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South Carolina, but did poorly inland.  Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650s. Upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern U.S., but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem solved by the [[cotton gin]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|157}} A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi, USA in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced [[Cotton Boll|boll]]s that were three to four times faster to pick.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Trade and textiles====
[[File:Colonisation 1754.png|thumb|upright=1.25|European colonial empires at the start of the Industrial Revolution, imposed upon modern political boundaries.]]

The [[Age of Discovery]] was followed by a period of [[colonialism]] beginning around the 16th century. Following the discovery of a trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese, the Dutch established the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (abbr. VOC) or [[Dutch East India Company]] and the British founded the [[East India Company]], along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region and between the Indian Ocean region and North Atlantic Europe.  One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles, which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia and Europe.  By the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India Company's exports.  Indian textiles were in demand in North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the amount of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Pre-mechanized European textile production====
By 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established; however, they were left alone by the [[guild]]s who did not consider cotton a threat.  Earlier European attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12th century Italy and 15th century southern Germany, but these industries eventually ended when the supply of cotton was cut off.  The [[Moors]] in Spain grew, spun and wove cotton beginning around the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014" /&gt;

British cloth could not compete with Indian cloth because India's labor cost was approximately one-fifth to one-sixth that of Britain's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Bishnupriya|title=Cotton Textiles and the  Great Divergence: Lancashire, India and Shifting Competitive  Advantage, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1700 and 1721 the British government passed [[Calico Acts]] in order to [[Protectionism|protect]] the domestic woollen and linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"/&gt;

The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around [[Lancashire]] that produced [[fustian]], a cloth with flax [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and cotton [[weft]].  Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew.&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"&gt;{{Cite journal

On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the [[putting-out system]].  Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials.  In the off season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving.  Using the [[spinning wheel]], it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|823}}

====Invention of textile machinery====
The [[flying shuttle]], patented in 1733 by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]], with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving.  It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, [[Robert Kay (inventor)|Robert]], invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|821–22}}

[[Lewis Paul]] patented the roller [[spinning frame]] and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of [[Birmingham]].  Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in [[Northampton]] with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by [[Daniel Bourn]] in [[Leominster]], but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented [[carding]] machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first [[cotton mill|cotton spinning mill]]. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] in his [[water frame]] and [[Samuel Crompton]] in his [[spinning mule]].
[[File:Spinning jenny.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Model of the [[spinning jenny]] in a museum in [[Wuppertal]]. Invented by [[James Hargreaves]] in 1764,  the spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution.]]
In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, [[James Hargreaves]] invented the [[spinning jenny]], which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ray Gehani (1998). "Management of Technology and Operations". p. 63. John Wiley and Sons, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for [[weft]], not [[warp (weaving)|warp]].&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|825–27}}

The [[spinning frame]] or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|827–30}}  For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain.  A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.

[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The only surviving example of a [[spinning mule]] built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].  The mule produced high-quality thread with minimal labour.]]

[[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule|Spinning Mule]] was introduced in 1779.  Mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}  Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|Interior of Marshall's [[Temple Works]]]]

Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical [[power loom]] which he patented in 1785.  In 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|834}}  Cartwright built two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers. Cartwright's loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813.  Horock's loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts, Hill &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. [[Eli Whitney]] responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive [[cotton gin]].  A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously, working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day, have taken a woman two months to process.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

These advances were capitalised on by [[entrepreneur]]s, of whom the best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as [[Thomas Highs]] and [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]]; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the [[cotton mill]] which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power – first horse power and then [[Hydropower|water power]]{{mdash}}which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of [[yarn]] increased greatly. Before long [[Watt steam engine|steam power]] was applied to drive textile machinery. [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname [[Cottonopolis]] during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Mingay (1986). "The Transformation of Britain, 1830–1939". p. 25. Routledge, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand-woven Indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India, which allowed high thread counts.  However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the industry.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Wool====
The earliest European attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton.  Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant but was far less than that of cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name=David_Landes_1999/&gt;

====Silk====
[[File:Silkmill1.jpg|thumb|Lombe's Mill site today, rebuilt as [[Derby Silk Mill]]]]
Arguably the first highly mechanised factory was [[John Lombe]]'s [[Derby Industrial Museum|water-powered silk mill]] at [[Derby]], operational by 1721. Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time is unknown. Although Lombe's factory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition.  In order to promote manufacturing the Crown paid for models of Lombe's machinery which were exhibited in the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=75296|first=Richard L.|last=Hills|title=Cotchett, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=47971|first=K.

===Iron industry===
[[File:Reverberatory furnace diagram.png|thumb|right|The [[reverberatory furnace]] could produce [[cast iron]] using mined coal.

====UK iron production statistics====
Bar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails, wire, hinges, horse shoes, wagon tires, chains, etc. and for structural shapes. A small amount of bar iron was converted into steel.  [[Cast iron]] was used for pots, stoves and other items where its brittleness was tolerable.  Most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron, with substantial losses.  Bar iron was also made by the [[bloomery]] process, which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century.

In  the UK in 1720 there were 20,500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke. In 1750 charcoal iron production was 24,500 and coke iron was 2,500 tons.  In 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14,000 tons while coke iron production was 54,000 tons.  In 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7,800 tons and coke cast iron was 250,000 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

In 1750 the UK imported 31,200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18,800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using  coke.  In 1796 the UK was making 125,000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6,400 tons with charcoal; imports were 38,000 tons and exports were 24,600 tons. In 1806 the UK did not import bar iron but exported 31,500 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

====Iron process innovations====
A major change in the iron industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of [[wood]] and other bio-fuels with coal. For a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title= American Iron 1607–1900|last=Gordon|first= Robert B|year=1996 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London|isbn= 978-0-8018-6816-0 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coal was much more abundant than wood, supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F.|year= 1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}}  By 1750 [[coke (fuel)|coke]] had generally replaced charcoal in smelting of copper and lead and was in widespread use in making glass.  In the smelting and refining of iron, coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coal's sulfur content.  Low sulfur coals were known, but they still contained harmful amounts.  Conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|122–125}} A minority of coals are coking.

Another factor limiting the iron industry before the Industrial Revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows.  This limitation was overcome by the steam engine.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;

Use of coal in iron [[smelting]] started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir [[Clement Clerke]] and others from 1678, using coal [[reverberatory furnace]]s known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the [[ore]] and charcoal or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] mixture, [[Redox|reducing]] the [[oxide]] to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to [[lead]] from 1678 and to [[copper]] from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The [[Cupola furnace|foundry cupola]] is a different, and later, innovation.)

By 1709 [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] made progress using coke to fuel his [[blast furnace]]s at [[Coalbrookdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the coke [[pig iron]] he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of [[cast iron]] goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs.

Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce [[wrought iron]] until 1755-56, when Darby's son [[Abraham Darby II]] built furnaces at [[Horsehay]] and [[Ketley]] where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from Coalbrookdale).  These new furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engines]].  The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast.  Abraham Darby III installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768.  The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}

Steam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. In 1757, iron master [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] patented a hydraulic powered [[blowing engine]] for blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;

[[James Watt]] had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine.  In 1774 John Wilkinson, who built a cast iron blowing cylinder for his iron works, invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author Simon Winchester dates the start of the Industrial Revolution to 4th May, 1776, the day that John Wilkinson presented James Watt with his precision-made cylinder.

CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;  After Watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782, they were widely applied to blowing, hammering, rolling and slitting.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

The solutions to the sulfur problem were the addition of sufficient limestone to the furnace to force sulfur into the slag and the use of low sulfur coal.  Use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a free-flowing slag. The increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}  In addition to lower cost and greater availability, coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials (iron ore, fuel, slag) flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first= Nathan |authorlink= |year=1982 |publisher =Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, New York |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David.

As cast iron became cheaper and widely available, it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings.  A famous early example was the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] built in 1778 with cast iron produced by [[Abraham Darby III]].&lt;ref name="Iron bridge"/&gt;  However, most cast iron was converted to [[wrought iron]].

Europe relied on the [[bloomery]] for most of its wrought iron until the large scale production of cast iron.  Conversion of cast iron was done in a [[finery forge]], as it long had been.  An improved refining process known as [[potting and stamping]] was developed, but this was superseded by [[Henry Cort]]'s [[Puddling furnace|puddling]] process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] in 1783 and [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] in 1784.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|91}}  Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost.

[[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  When the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it.  Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  Few puddlers lived to be 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel.  The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a [[trip hammer]].  A different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles and rails.
 
The puddling process was improved in 1818 by Baldwyn Rogers, who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute|url={{Google books|_tijGo0WWHMC|page=PA20|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1879|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1838 [[Joseph Hall (metallurgist)|John Hall]] patented the use of roasted tap cinder (iron silicate) for the furnace bottom, greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom. The tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus, but this was not understood at the time.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|166}}  Hall's process also used iron scale or rust, which reacted with carbon in the molten iron. Hall's process, called ''wet puddling'', reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50% to around 8%.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

Puddling became widely used after 1800. Up to that time British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from Sweden and Russia to supplement domestic supplies.  Because of the increased British production, imports began to decline in 1785 and by the 1790s Britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron.

[[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  By using preheated combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  This meant that lower quality coal or [[anthracite]] could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics

| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, by the end of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably.

Shortly before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the production of [[steel]], which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. [[Benjamin Huntsman]] developed his [[crucible steel]] technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the [[cementation process]].

The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. The development of [[machine tool]]s allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries.

===Steam power===
{{Main|Steam power during the Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[Watt steam engine]]. [[James Watt]] transformed the [[steam engine]] from a  [[reciprocating motion]] that was used for pumping to a [[Rotation|rotating motion]] suited to industrial applications.  Watt and others significantly improved the efficiency of the steam engine.]]

The development of the [[stationary steam engine]] was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, most industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam.  By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. He constructed and patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one [[horsepower]] (hp) and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its "brand name", ''The Miner's Friend''). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes.  Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century.

The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by [[Thomas Newcomen]] before 1712. A number of Newcomen engines were installed in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a significant amount of capital to build, and produced upwards of {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. They were also used to power municipal water supply pumps.  They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread (first) to Hungary in 1722, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s the engineer [[John Smeaton]] built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;

[[File:Newcomens Dampfmaschine aus Meyers 1890.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen's steam-powered atmospheric engine]] was the first practical piston steam engine. Subsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution.]]

A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] [[James Watt]]. With financial support from his business partner [[English people|Englishman]] [[Matthew Boulton]], he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]], which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber.  The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam.  Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency.  These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton &amp; Watts engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the [[Soho Foundry]] for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.

By 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a [[Single- and double-acting cylinders|double-acting]] rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton &amp; Watt]] had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving [[blast furnace]]s, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from {{convert|5|to|10|hp|abbr=on}}.

Until about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the [[beam engine]], built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the [[table engine]]. Around the start of the 19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish engineer [[Richard Trevithick]] and the American [[Oliver Evans]] began to construct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail [[locomotive]]s and [[steamboat|steam boats]].

The development of [[machine tool]]s, such as the engine [[lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|planing]], milling and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.

Small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread [[electrification]] in the early 20th century. These included [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]-powered, [[treadle]]-powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine tools===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
{{See also|Interchangeable parts}}
[[File:Maudslay screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.png|thumb|[[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s famous early [[screw-cutting lathe]]s of circa 1797 and 1800]]
[[File:Middletown milling machine 1818--001.png|thumb|The Middletown [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson and Simeon North]]

Pre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen – [[millwright]]s built water and windmills, [[carpenter]]s made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time.  As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.  Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts.  Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.

The demand for metal parts led to the development of several [[machine tool]]s. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.

Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Consequently, the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum.  Hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The first large precision machine tool was the cylinder [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring machine]] invented by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] in 1774. It used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. Wilkinson's boring machine differed from earlier [[cantilever]]ed machines used for boring cannon in that the cutting tool was mounted on a beam that ran through the cylinder being bored and was supported outside on both ends.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The [[Planer (metalworking)|planing machine]], the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] and the [[Shaper|shaping machine]] were developed in the early decades of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[Henry Maudslay]], who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of [[Jan Verbruggen]]. In 1774 [[Jan Verbruggen]] had installed a [[horizontal boring machine]] in Woolwich which was the first industrial size [[Lathe]] in the UK. Maudslay was hired away by [[Joseph Bramah]] for the production of high-security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.  Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe.  Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw.  Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|392–95}}  The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions.  Although it was not entirely Maudslay's idea, he was the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|31, 36}}

Maudslay left Bramah's employment and set up his own shop. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]]. These machines were all-metal and were the first machines for [[mass production]] and making components with a degree of [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]]. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]], [[Joseph Clement]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[James Fox (engineer)|James Fox]] of [[Derby]] had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did [[Matthew Murray]] of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.

The impact of machine tools during the Industrial Revolution was not that great because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] is largely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected [[interchangeable parts]] for firearms in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the [[machine industry]] became the largest industrial sector of the U.S. economy, by value added.&lt;ref name="faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu"&gt;Economics 323–2: Economic History of the United States Since 1865 http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jmokyr/Graphs-and-Tables.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
The large-scale production of [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The first of these was the production of [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] by the [[lead chamber process]] invented by the Englishman [[John Roebuck]] ([[James Watt]]'s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of [[rivet]]ed sheets of [[lead]]. Instead of making a small amount each time, he was able to make around {{convert|100|lb|-1}} in each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase.

The production of an [[alkali]] on a large scale became an important goal as well, and [[Nicolas Leblanc]] succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of [[sodium carbonate]]. The [[Leblanc process]] was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and [[hydrochloric acid]]. The [[sodium sulfate|sodium sulphate]] was heated with [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and [[calcium sulfide|calcium sulphide]]. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic [[sodium carbonate|soda ash]] proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants ([[barilla]]) or from [[kelp]], which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,&lt;ref name="Clow52"/&gt; and also to [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]) produced from hardwood ashes.

These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and [[paper]] industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for [[bleach]]ing cloth.

The development of bleaching powder ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) by Scottish chemist [[Charles Tennant]] in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North [[Glasgow]], became the largest chemical plant in the world.

After 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in [[dye]]stuffs, and Germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Hirth, ''State, Cartels and Growth: The German Chemical Industry'' (2007) p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the 1860–1914 era to learn the latest techniques. British scientists by contrast, lacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead, the practice was to hire German-trained chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Johann P. Murmann, ''Knowledge and competitive advantage:''

===Cement===
[[File:Thamestunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[Thames Tunnel]] (opened 1843).&lt;br /&gt;[[Cement]] was used in the world's first underwater tunnel.]]
In 1824 [[Joseph Aspdin]], a British [[bricklayer]] turned builder, patented a chemical process for making [[portland cement]] which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves [[sintering]] a mixture of [[clay]] and [[limestone]] to about {{convert|1400|°C|0|abbr=on}}, then [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and [[gravel]] to produce [[concrete]]. Portland cement was used by the famous English engineer [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] several years later when constructing the [[Thames Tunnel]].&lt;ref name="memphis"/&gt; Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] a generation later.

===Gas lighting===
{{Main|Gas lighting}}
Another major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was [[gas lighting]]. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of [[William Murdoch]], an employee of Boulton &amp; Watt, the [[Birmingham]] [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.

===Glass making===
{{Main|Glass production}}
[[File:Crystal Palace interior.jpg|thumb|The Crystal Palace held the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851]]
A new method of producing glass, known as the [[Cylinder blown sheet glass|cylinder process]], was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was used by the [[Chance Brothers]] to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. [[The Crystal Palace]] is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.

===Paper machine===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for [[Saint-Léger Didot]] family in France. The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], who were [[stationers]] in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.

The method of [[continuous production]] demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other [[continuous production]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Industrial technologies that affected farming included the [[seed drill]], the [[British Agricultural Revolution#The Dutch and Rotherham swing (wheel-less) plough|Dutch plough]], which contained iron parts, and the threshing machine.

[[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth.  This was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.  Tull's seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Foljambe's ''Rotherham [[plough]]'' of 1730 was the first commercially successful iron plough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation, leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the [[Swing Riots]].

[[Machine tools]] and metalworking techniques developed during the Industrial Revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing agricultural equipment, such as reapers, binders and combine harvesters.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Mining===
[[History of coal mining|Coal mining]] in Britain, particularly in [[South Wales]], started early. Before the steam engine, [[Open-pit mining|pits]] were often shallow [[bell pit]]s following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an [[adit]] or [[Drift mining|drift mine]] driven into the side of a hill. [[Shaft mining]] was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a [[sough]] (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698 and the [[Newcomen steam engine]] in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of [[John Smeaton]]'s improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.  The [[Cornish engine]], developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the [[Watt steam engine]].

Coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of [[firedamp]] in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the [[safety lamp]] which was invented in 1816 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] and independently by [[George Stephenson]]. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions continued, often setting off [[coal dust]] [[explosion]]s, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport during the British Industrial Revolution}}
{{See also| Productivity improving technologies (economic history)#Infrastructures}}

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. [[Wagonway]]s were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century.  Improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed 50% between 1750 and 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coren|first1=Michael J.|title=The speed of Europe's 18th-century sailing ships is revamping history's view of the Industrial Revolution|url=https://qz.com/1193455/the-speed-of-europes-18th-century-sailing-ships-is-revamping-historians-view-of-the-industrial-revolution/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network. Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.

====Canals and improved waterways====
{{Main|History of the British canal system}}
[[File:Barton-on-Irwell 11.05.02R.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Bridgewater Canal]], famous because of its commercial success, crossing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], one of the last canals to be built.]]

Before and during the Industrial Revolution navigation on several British rivers was improved by removing obstructions, straightening curves, widening and deepening and building navigation [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]]s.  Britain had over 1000 miles of navigable rivers and streams by 1750.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Canals and waterways allowed bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland.  This was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grübler"&gt;{{Cite book

Building of canals dates to ancient times.  The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in China, "the world's largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence," parts of which were started between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, is {{convert|1121|mi|0|abbr=out}} long and links [[Hangzhou]] with Beijing.&lt;ref name="Langmead"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Langmead|title=Encyclopedia of Architectural and Engineering Feats|url={{Google books|T5J6GKvGbmMC|page=PA37|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-112-0|page=37|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country.  Known for its huge commercial success, the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in [[North West England]], which opened in 1761 and was mostly funded by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]].  From [[Worsley]] to the rapidly growing town of [[Manchester]] its construction cost £168,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|168000|1761|2013|r=-1}}}} {{As of|2013|lc=y}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Timbs|1860|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.&lt;ref name=Bridgewatercollieries&gt;{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: Bridgewater Collieries | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&amp;fromDate=1785-01-01&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08-001&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=1638&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=1&amp;date_mm_From=01&amp;date_yyyy_From=1785&amp;date_dd_to_range=31&amp;date_mm_to_range=12&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1985&amp;date_dd_from_precise=1&amp;date_mm_from_precise=01&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText= |date=1 December 1913 |accessdate=19 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as [[Canal Mania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kindleberger|1993|pp=192–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; New canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the Bridgewater Canal, the most notable being the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] and the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively.

By the 1820s a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. The last major canal to be built in the United Kingdom was the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], which upon opening in 1894 was the largest [[ship canal]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=1 January 1894: Opening of the Manchester ship canal |quote=Six years in the making, the world's largest navigation canal gives the city direct access to the sea |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/17/guardian190-manchester-ship-canal-opens |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 January 1894 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened Manchester as a [[Port of Manchester|port]]. However it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper.

Britain's canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain.

====Roads====
[[File:Rakeman – First American Macadam Road.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the first macadam road in the United States (1823). In the foreground, workers are breaking stones "so as not to exceed 6 ounces in weight or to pass a two-inch ring".&lt;ref name="rakemanPainting"&gt;[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/rakeman/1823.htm "1823 – First American Macadam Road"] ''(Painting – [[Carl Rakeman]])'' US Department of Transportation – Federal Highway Administration (Accessed 10 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

France was known for having an excellent system of roads at the time of the Industrial Revolution; however, most of the roads on the European Continent and in the U.K. were in bad condition and dangerously rutted.&lt;ref name="Grübler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter_1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville |page=18}}''"There exist everywhere roads suitable for hauling".''[[Robert Fulton]] on roads in France&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) [[Toll road|turnpike]] trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a [[Turnpike trusts|turnpike trust]]. New engineered roads were built by [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]], [[Thomas Telford]] and most notably [[John Loudon McAdam|John McAdam]], with the first '[[macadam]]ised' stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown (1991). "Society and Economy in Modern Britain 1700–1850" p. 136. Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of [[Packhorse|pack horse]]. Stagecoaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on [[Un-sprung cart|carriers carts]].

====Railways====
{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain}}
[[File:Opening Liverpool and Manchester Railway.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting the [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in 1830, the first inter-city railway in the world and which spawned [[Railway Mania]] due to its success.]]

Reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, England.
&lt;blockquote&gt;“A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton.  A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration.  Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together.  A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddled iron]] after 1800, the [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] for making rails, and the development of the high-pressure steam engine also around 1800.

Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam [[locomotive]] were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs. See: [[Industrial Revolution#Metallurgy|Metallurgy]]

Steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high-pressure steam engines after the expiration of the [[Boulton and Watt]] patent in 1800. High-pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser and cooling water.  They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines.  A few of these early locomotives were used in mines.  Steam-hauled public railways began with the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825.

The rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 [[Rainhill Trials]], which demonstrated [[Robert Stephenson]]'s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of [[Hot blast]], which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the [[blast furnace]].

On 15 September 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was attended by Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Sussman (2009). "Victorian Technology: Invention, Innovation, and the Rise of the Machine". p. 2. ABC-CLIO, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The railway was engineered by [[Joseph Locke]] and [[George Stephenson]], linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of [[Manchester]] with the port town of [[Liverpool]]. The [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening]] was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to [[Railway Mania]].

Construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution. After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.

==Social effects==
{{Main|Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution}}

===Factory system===
{{Main|Factory system}}
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most of the workforce was employed in agriculture, either as self-employed farmers as landowners or tenants, or as landless agricultural labourers. It was common for families in various parts of the world to spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing.  Households also spun and wove for market production.  At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution India, China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East produced most of the world's cotton cloth while Europeans produced wool and linen goods.

In Britain by the 16th century the [[putting-out system]], by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as ''cottage industry'', was being practiced.  Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  Merchant capitalist typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the [[Piece work|piece]], and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a [[spinning jenny|40 spindle jenny]] for about six pounds in 1792,  was affordable for cottagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later machinery such as spinning frames, [[spinning mule]]s and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.

The majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were unmarried women and children, including many orphans.  They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off.  It was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work.  Lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;	Many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.  (See: [[British Agricultural Revolution]], [[Threshing machine]])

The change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by [[Karl Marx]], however, he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Standards of living===
Some economists, such as [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert E. Lucas, Jr.]], say that the real impact of the Industrial Revolution was that "for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth&amp;nbsp;... Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility."&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt; Others, however, argue that while growth of the economy's overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways workers' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=Charles|title=Pessimism Perpetuated: Real Wages and the Standard of Living in Britain during and after the Industrial Revolution|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=September 1998|volume=58|issue=3|pages=625–58|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4123540|accessdate=6 May 2014|doi=10.1017/s0022050700021100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Szreter &amp; Mooney|title=Urbanization, Mortality, and the Standard of Living Debate: New Estimates of the Expectation of Life at Birth in Nineteenth-Century British Cities|journal=The Economic History Review|date=February 1998|volume=51|issue=1|page=104|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.00084|last2=Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the average height of the population declined during the Industrial Revolution, implying that their nutritional status was also decreasing. Real wages were not keeping up with the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küchenhoff |first1=Helmut |date=2012 |title=The Diminution of Physical Stature of the British Male Population in the 18th-Century |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/afc/cliome/v6y2012i1p45-62.html |journal=Cliometrica |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=45–62 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snowdon |first1=Brian |date=April–June 2005 |title=Measures of Progress and Other Tall Stories: From Income to Anthropometrics |url=https://www.worldeconomics.com/Journal/Papers/Measures%20of%20Progress%20and%20Other%20Tall%20Stories.details?ID=209 |journal=World Economics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87–136 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Industrial Revolution, the [[life expectancy]] of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;

The effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; A series of 1950s essays by [[Henry Phelps Brown]] and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.&lt;ref name="Trends in Real Wages in Britain, 1750-1913"/&gt;&lt;ref name="econlib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hartwell"/&gt;

====Food and nutrition====
{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France, until the late 19th century. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years and about 40 years in Britain. The United States population of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life expectancy of 45–50 years although U.S. life expectancy declined by a few years by the mid 19th century. Food consumption per capita also declined during an episode known as the [[Antebellum Puzzle]].&lt;ref name="The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100"/&gt;

Food supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the [[Corn Laws]] (1815-1846).  The Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers.  The Corn Laws were repealed in the early years of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]].

The initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized textiles, iron and coal, did little, if anything, to lower food prices.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2000"/&gt; In Britain and the Netherlands, food supply increased before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too, as noted by [[Thomas Malthus]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Housing====
The very rapid growth in population in the 19th century in the cities included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such as Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory  Clark,  "Shelter from the storm: housing and the industrial revolution, 1550–1909." ''Journal of Economic History'' 62#2 (2002): 489–511.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with  large contracting firms.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The speculative builders and developers of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11 (1968): 641–90.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825462 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Powell, ''The British building industry since 1800: An economic history'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;   Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kemp, "Housing landlordism in late nineteenth-century Britain." ''Environment and Planning A'' 14.11 (1982): 1437–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults. [[Cholera]] from polluted water and typhoid were endemic. Unlike rural areas, there were no famines such as devastated Ireland in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The Slums of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11.1 (1967): 5–40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825891 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony S. Wohl, ''The eternal slum: housing and social policy in Victorian London'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Daunton, ''House and home in the Victorian city: working-class housing, 1850–1914'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large exposé literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions. By far the most famous publication was by one of the founders of the Socialist movement, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described backstreet sections of Manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude shanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.  These shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings.  There were no sanitary facilities. Population density was extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;Enid Gauldie, ''Cruel habitations: a history of working-class housing 1780-1918''  (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Not everyone lived in such poor conditions. The Industrial Revolution also created a middle class of businessmen, clerks, foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions.

Conditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction. In the introduction of his 1892 edition, Engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. For example, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] led to the more sanitary [[byelaw terraced house]].

====Sanitation====
In ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described how untreated sewage created awful odors and turned the rivers green in industrial cities.

In 1854 [[John Snow]] traced a cholera outbreak in Soho to fecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit.  Snow's findings that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took some years to be accepted, but his work led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems.

====Water supply====
Pre-industrial water supply relied on gravity systems and pumping of water was done by water wheels.  Pipes were typically made of wood.  Steam powered pumps and iron pipes allowed the widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households.&lt;ref name="Hunter_1985"/&gt;

====Increase in literacy====
The invention of the [[paper machine]] and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of [[printing]] supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.

===Clothing and consumer goods===
[[File:BLW Tea and coffee service, Staffordshire.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wedgwood]] tea and coffee service]]
Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating.  Coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in Europe.  Watches and household clocks became popular consumer items.

Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes in Britain, potter and entrepreneur [[Josiah Wedgwood]], founder of [[Wedgwood]] fine china and porcelain, created goods such as [[tableware]], which was starting to become a common feature on dining tables.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

===Population increase===
The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=Hudson|first= Pat|year=1992 |publisher =Routledge, Chapman and Hall, Inc.
|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-7131-6531-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Hughes in ''The Fatal Shore'', the [[Demography of England|population of England]] and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;  Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===Urbanization===
The growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive [[urbanisation]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities,&lt;ref name="prb"/&gt; compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).&lt;ref name="prb6"/&gt; Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.&lt;ref name="britannica7"/&gt;

===Impact on women and family life===
Women's historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Amico, ed. ''Reader's guide to women's studies'' (1998) pp 102–4, 306–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Thomas, "Women and capitalism: oppression or emancipation? A review article." ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534–49. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/178999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a pessimistic side, [[Alice Clark]] argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle- and upper-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;  Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of early industrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the "family consumer economy," in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of thrift and hard work characterized middle-class families as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. These values were displayed in Samuel Smiles' book ''Self-Help'', in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was "voluntary and self-imposed - the results of idleness, thriftlessness, intemperance, and misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thrift|last=Smiles|first=Samuel|publisher=John Murray|year=1875|isbn=|location=London|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour conditions===

====Social structure and working conditions====
In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a [[middle class]] of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life;&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt; however, most workers in textiles, which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  For workers of the laboring classes, industrial life "was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industry and Empire: From 1750 to the Present Day|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric J.|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=978-1565845619|volume=3|location=Harmondsworth, England|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. [[Pre-industrial society]] was very static and often cruel – [[child labour]], dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="industrial4"/&gt;

====Factories and urbanisation====
{{Main|Factory system}}
[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|left|Manchester, England ("[[Cottonopolis]]"), pictured in 1840, showing the mass of factory chimneys]]

Industrialisation led to the creation of the [[factory]]. The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed "[[Cottonopolis]]", and the world's first industrial city.&lt;ref name="Industrial city"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |title=Manchester – the first industrial city |publisher=Entry on Sciencemuseum website |accessdate=17 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184810/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |archivedate=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831. Bradford grew by 50% every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50% of the population of Bradford was actually born there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/industrial_revolution_towns.htm|title=Life in Industrial Towns|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, between 1815 and 1939, 20 percent of Europe's population left home, pushed by poverty, a rapidly growing population, and the displacement of peasant farming and artisan manufacturing. They were pulled abroad by the enormous demand for labor overseas, the ready availability of land, and cheap transportation. Still, many did not find a satisfactory life in their new homes, leading 7 million of them to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures in Contact|last=Hoeder|first=Dirk|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=331–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mass migration had large demographic impacts: in 1800, less than one percent of the world population consisted of overseas Europeans and their descendants; by 1930, they represented 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America in the World|last=Guarneri|first=Carl|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration, largely concentrated in the United States.

For much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically [[List of watermills in the United Kingdom|water-powered]] and built to serve local needs. Later, each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.

In other industries, the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was [[Robert Owen]], known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the [[Robert Owen#Philanthropy in New Lanark (1800)|New Lanark mills]], and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the [[Utopian socialism|early socialist movement]].

By 1746 an integrated [[brass mill]] was working at [[Warmley]] near [[Bristol]]. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]] (whose [[Soho Manufactory]] was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.

====Child labour====
{{see also|Child labour#The Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:coaltub.png|right|frame|A young "drawer" pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery.&lt;ref name="From Coal Mine Upwards: or Seventy Years of an Eventful Life"/&gt; In Britain laws passed in 1842 and 1844 improved mine working conditions.]]

The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution, although ''infant'' mortality rates were reduced markedly.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Demographic Transition and Industrial Revolution: A Macroeconomic Investigation"/&gt; There was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no experienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.&lt;ref name="galbithink"/&gt;

[[Child labour]] existed before the Industrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders,&lt;ref name="victorianweb"/&gt; 10–20% of an adult male's wage.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children as young as four were employed.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Beatings and long hours were common, with some child [[coal mine]]rs and [[hurrying|hurriers]] working from 4 am until 5 pm.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Many children developed [[lung cancer]] and other diseases and died before the age of 25.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; [[Workhouses]] would sell orphans and abandoned children as "pauper apprentices", working without wages for board and lodging.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters [[Shackle|shackling]] them to prevent escape.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed as [[mule scavenger]]s by [[cotton mill]]s would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop [[phossy jaw]].&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed at [[Glassblowing|glassworks]] were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at [[pottery|potteries]] were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt;

Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines&lt;ref name="Testimony Gathered by Ashley's Mines Commission"/&gt; and textile factories,&lt;ref name="The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England"/&gt; and these helped to popularise the children's plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare.

Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid [[starvation]], and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the [[Factory Acts]], were passed in Britain: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however, their scarcity made enforcement difficult.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. Although laws such as these decreased the number of child labourers, child labour remained significantly present in Europe and the United States until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt;

====Organisation of labour====
{{See also|Trade union#History}}
The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of ''combinations'' or [[trade union]]s to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.

The main method the unions used to effect change was [[strike action]]. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the [[Combination Act 1799]] forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. One British newspaper in 1834 described unions as "the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root, under shelter of law, in any country..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tolpuddle Martyrs|last=Evatt|first=Herbert|publisher=Sydney University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0586038321|location=Sydney|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] extended the vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from [[Tolpuddle]] in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, [[Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless, George's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its ''Charter'' of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration.

Working people also formed [[Friendly society|friendly societies]] and [[Cooperative|co-operative societies]] as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as [[Robert Owen]] also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class.

Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a [[general strike]] involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.&lt;ref name="archive5"/&gt;

Eventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

====Luddites====
{{Main|Luddite}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Luddites smashing a power loom in 1812]]

The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The movement started first with [[lace]] and [[hosiery]] workers near [[Nottingham]] and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers, and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of [[Ned Ludd]], a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the [[militia]] or [[army]] to protect industry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or [[Penal transportation|transported]] for life.

Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the [[Captain Swing]] disturbances. Threshing machines were a particular target, and [[hay]]rick burning was a popular activity. However, the riots led to the first formation of [[trade union]]s, and further pressure for reform.

====Shift in production's center of gravity====
The traditional centers of hand textile production such as India, parts of the Middle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machine-made textiles, which over a period of decades destroyed the hand made textile industries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

The Industrial Revolution also generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world, as measured by the share of manufacturing output.

====Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery====
Cheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton; previously, it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown, with little raw cotton available for export. Consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies, particularly in [[Hispaniola]], but Haitian cotton production was halted by the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791. The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to the widespread growth of cotton [[plantation]]s in the United States and Brazil. In 1791 world cotton production was estimated to be 490,000,000 pounds with U.S. production accounting to 2,000,000 pounds.  By 1800 U.S. production was 35,000,000 pounds, of which 17,790,000 were exported.  In 1945 the U.S. produced seven-eights of the 1,169,600,000 pounds of world production.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

The Americas, particularly the U.S., had labor shortages and high priced labor, which made [[slavery]] attractive.  America's cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable, and able to keep up with demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert

===Impact on environment===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the Industrial Revolution, sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.]]
The origins of the [[environmental movement]] lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=14 February 2006 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]]. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.

The manufactured gas industry began in British cities in 1812–1820. The technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers. The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. They usually lost and modified the worst practices. The City of London repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its fish. Finally, Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie  Tomory, "The Environmental History of the Early British Gas Industry, 1812–1830." ''Environmental history'' 17#1 (2012): 29–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Joel A.

In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash, and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Brian William Clapp, ''An environmental history of Britain since the industrial revolution'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrialisation beyond the United Kingdom==

===Continental Europe===
The Industrial Revolution on [[Continental Europe]] came a little later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the [[Ruhr|Ruhr Valley]] in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as [[Iron and steel industry|iron]]), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted.

====Belgium====

[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] was the second country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in continental Europe: [[Wallonia]] (French speaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model successfully. Starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Liège]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories at [[Seraing]] integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.&lt;ref name="publishing"/&gt;

Wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word "houille" was coined in Wallonia),&lt;ref name="language"/&gt; the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its ''[[Sillon industriel]]'', 'Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], [...] there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'.&lt;ref name="ugent"/&gt; Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: "It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain."&lt;ref name="philippe"/&gt; "The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of [[Ghent]]."&lt;ref name="erih"/&gt; Michel De Coster, Professor at the [[University of Liège|Université de Liège]] wrote also: "The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory [...] But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated." &lt;ref name="linguistiques"/&gt;

=====Demographic effects=====
Wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong Socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape. At the left, the ''Sillon industriel'', which runs from [[Mons]] in the west, to [[Verviers]] in the east (except part of North Flanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). Even if Belgium is the second industrial country after Britain, the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different. In 'Breaking stereotypes', Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres [...] at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in [[Ghent]] [...] Also, in [[Wallonia]] the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Liège where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.&lt;ref name="stereotypes"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====France====
{{main|Economic history of France}}The industrial revolution in France followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries. Notably, most French historians argue France did not go through a clear ''take-off''.&lt;ref name="marczewski" /&gt; Instead, France's economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries. However, some stages were identified by Maurice Lévy-Leboyer:
* French Revolution and Napoleonic wars (1789–1815),
* industrialisation, along with Britain (1815–1860),
* economic slowdown (1860–1905),
* renewal of the growth after 1905.

====Germany====
{{main|Economic history of Germany}}

Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first the production of dyes based on [[aniline]] was critical.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;{{harvnb|Haber|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's political disunity – with three dozen states – and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain's. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815–1914'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{Main|Economic history of Sweden}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}

During the period 1790–1815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an ''agricultural revolution'' with larger agricultural estates, new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming, and a ''protoindustrialisation'', with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a ''consumption revolution'' starting in the 1820s.

During 1815–1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in [[Bergslagen]], textile mills in Sjuhäradsbygden and forestry in [[Norrland]]. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842 (as first country in the world), the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848.

During 1850–1890, Sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export, dominated by crops, wood and steel. Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873.

During 1890–1930, Sweden experienced the second industrial revolution. New industries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, [[papermaking]] and textile.

===Japan===
{{Main|Meiji Restoration|Economic history of Japan}}

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as [[Meiji period]] leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan]]).

In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the United States to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/index.htm/|website=Bank of Japan|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west.

Modern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Allen, ''Short Economic History of Modern Japan'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Important American technological contributions during the period of the Industrial Revolution were the [[cotton gin]] and the development of a system for making [[interchangeable parts]], the latter aided by the development of the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] in the US.  The development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the US as the world's leading industrial nation in the late 19th century.

[[Oliver Evans]] invented an automated flour mill in the mid-1780s that used [[process control|control mechanisms]] and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.  This is considered to be the first modern [[Bulk material handling|materials handling system]] an important advance in the progress toward [[mass production]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

The United States originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale applications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s. As a result, industrialisation was concentrated in [[New England]] and the  [[Northeastern United States]], which has fast-moving rivers. The newer water-powered production lines proved more economical than horse-drawn production. In the late 19th century steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to spread to the Midwest.

[[Thomas Somers]] and the [[Cabot Brothers]] founded the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] in 1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its era,&lt;ref name="manufacturers"/&gt; and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use horse power, but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in Slater's Mill.&lt;ref name="publication"/&gt;

In 1793, [[Samuel Slater]] (1768–1835) founded the [[Slater Mill]] at [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. He had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in [[Derbyshire]], England, and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. After founding Slater's Mill, he went on to own 13 textile mills.&lt;ref name="britannica8"/&gt; [[Daniel Day (manufacturer)|Daniel Day]] established a wool carding mill in the [[Blackstone Valley]] at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1809, the third woollen mill established in the US (The first was in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the second at [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].) The [[John Chafee|John H. Chafee]] [[Blackstone Valley|Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor]] retraces the history of "America's Hardest-Working River', the Blackstone. The [[Blackstone River]] and its tributaries, which cover more than {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], was the birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution. At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater's mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of America's Industrial and Technological Development.

[[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell]] from [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810. Realising that the [[War of 1812]] had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America, on his return to the United States, he set up the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]. Lowell and his partners built America's second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], second to the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]]. After his death in 1817, his associates built America's first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a [[Initial public offering|public stock offering]], one of the first uses of it in the United States. [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], using {{convert|5.6|mi|km}} of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the [[Merrimack River]], is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution. The short-lived utopia-like [[Waltham-Lowell system]] was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]], the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.

A major U.S. contribution to industrialization was the development of techniques to make [[interchangeable parts]] from metal.  Precision metal machining techniques were developed by the U.S. Department of War to make interchangeable parts for small firearms.  The development work took place at the Federal Arsenals at Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory.  Techniques for precision machining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in proper position, jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy.  The [[milling machine]], a fundamental machine tool, is believed to have been invented by [[Eli Whitney]], who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program.  Another important invention was the Blanchard lathe, invented by [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]].  The Blanchard lathe, or pattern tracing lathe, was actually a shaper that could produce copies of wooden gun stocks.  The use of machinery and the techniques for producing standardized and interchangeable parts became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Precision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that mechanized the shoe industry.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1989"&gt;{{cite book

The industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham, Massachusetts, at the [[Waltham Watch Company]], with the development of machine tools, gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches.

==Second Industrial Revolution==
{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Hartmann Maschinenhalle 1868 (01).jpg|thumb|[[Sächsische Maschinenfabrik]] in [[Chemnitz]], Germany, 1868]]
&lt;!--The industries created by the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution were mature and their markets saturated by the late 1830s, resulting in an economic downturn at that time, followed by a long period of slow growth.--&gt;    
[[Steel]] is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of [[steel]] was not invented until the 1860s, when [[Henry Bessemer|Sir Henry Bessemer]] invented a new furnace which could convert molten [[pig iron]] into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men, Machines and Modern Times"/&gt;  Bessemer steel was being displaced by the [[open hearth furnace]] near the end of the 19th century.

This Second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include chemicals, mainly the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]], [[petroleum]] (refining and distribution), and, in the 20th century, the [[automotive industry]], and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the United States and Germany.

The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.

A new revolution began with electricity and [[electrification]] in the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industries]]. The introduction of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation in the [[Alps]] enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern Italy, beginning in the 1890s.

By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like [[U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], [[Standard Oil]] and [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] joined the railroad and ship companies on the world's [[stock market]]s.

==Causes==
[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Regional [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita changed very little for most of human history before the Industrial Revolution.]]
The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Industrial Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of [[feudalism]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] after the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.  The [[Enclosure]] movement and the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into [[cottage industry]], for example [[weaving]], and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed [[factory|factories]].&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England"/&gt; The [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of [[financial market]]s and accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] are also cited as factors, as is the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;   A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=13–16|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.&lt;ref name="industrial10"/&gt; However, recent research into the Marketing Era has challenged the traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="association"/&gt;

[[Lewis Mumford]] has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the [[Early Middle Ages]], much earlier than most estimates.&lt;ref name="Technics &amp; Civilization"/&gt; He explains that the model for standardised [[mass production]] was the [[printing press]] and that "the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock". He also cites the [[Monasticism|monastic]] emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that [[medieval]] cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine.

The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and [[tariff]]s on goods traded among them.&lt;ref name="google11"/&gt; Internal tariffs were abolished by [[Henry VIII of England]], they survived in Russia until 1753, 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain.

Governments' grant of limited [[monopoly|monopolies]] to inventors under a developing [[patent]] system (the [[Statute of Monopolies]] in 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors.&lt;ref name="industrialisation"/&gt; Watt's monopoly prevented other inventors, such as [[Richard Trevithick]], [[William Murdoch]],  or [[Jonathan Hornblower]], whom Boulton and Watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.&lt;ref name="dklevine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mott-smith"/&gt;

One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly China, [[Indian subcontinent|India]], and the Middle East (which pioneered in shipbuilding, textile production, water mills, and much more in the period between 750 and 1100&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic Progress|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0195074772|location=New York|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at other times like in [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]&lt;ref name="j-bradford-delong"/&gt; or the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="historyguide"/&gt; A recent account argued that Europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedom-loving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early Indo-European invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Uniqueness of Western Civilization|last=Duchesne|first=Ricardo|publisher=Brill|year=2011|isbn=978-9004232761|location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians, however, have challenged this explanation as being not only Eurocentric, but also ignoring historical context. In fact, before the Industrial Revolution, "there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=Pier|date=2001|title=Are Coal and Colonies Really Crucial?|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These historians have suggested a number of other factors, including education, technological changes&lt;ref name="google12"/&gt; (see [[scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]] in Europe), "modern" government, "modern" work attitudes, ecology, and culture.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Causes"/&gt;

China was the world's most technologically advanced country for many centuries; however, China stagnated economically and technologically and was surpassed by Western Europe before the Age of Exploration, by which time China banned imports and denied entry to foreigners. China was also a totalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;

Historians such as [[David Landes]] and [[Max Weber]] credit the different belief systems in Asia and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S.

Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Han Fei]]zi ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]), [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] ([[Taoism]]), and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] ([[Buddhism]]), resulting in very different worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merson|1990|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include the considerable distance of China's coal deposits, though large, from its cities as well as the then unnavigable [[Yellow River]] that connects these deposits to the sea.&lt;ref name="professor"/&gt;

Regarding India, the Marxist historian [[Rajani Palme Dutt]] said: "The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in Britain."&lt;ref name="india_resource"/&gt; In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], with the major ones in its aftermath including the [[Maratha]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Bengal Subah]], and [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors – agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and there appears to have been little technical innovation. It is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the British take over.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Economic historian [[Joel Mokyr]] has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India by providing "an insurance against economic and technological stagnation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia|last=Jones|first=Eric|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; China had both a printing press and movable type, and India had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

In addition, Europe's monarchs desperately needed revenue, pushing them into alliances with their merchant classes. Small groups of merchants were granted monopolies and tax-collecting responsibilities in exchange for payments to the state.

In the Americas, Europeans found a windfall of silver, timber, fish, and maize, leading historian Peter Stearns to conclude that "Europe's Industrial Revolution stemmed in great part from Europe's ability to draw disproportionately on world resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution in World History|last=Stearns|first=Peter|publisher=Westview Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes in Britain===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|upright=1.35|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies.]]

Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled [[entrepreneur]]s to pioneer the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Nation, the State, and the First Industrial Revolution," ''Journal of British Studies'' (April 2011) 50#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;307–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Key factors fostering this environment were: (1) The period of peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland; (2) no trade barriers between England and Scotland; (3) the rule of law (enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts); (4) a straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of joint-stock companies (corporations); (5) absence of tolls, which had largely disappeared from Britain by the 15th century, but were an extreme burden on goods elsewhere in the world, and (6) a free market (capitalism).&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;
{{Quote box|width=24%|align=left|quote="An unprecedented explosion of new ideas, and new technological inventions, transformed our use of energy, creating an increasingly industrial and urbanised country. Roads, railways and canals were built. Great cities appeared. Scores of factories and mills sprang up. Our landscape would never be the same again. It was a revolution that transformed not only the country, but the world itself." |source = – British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] on the BBC's ''Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here''.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pz9d6|publisher=BBC|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Geographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain were the fact that it had extensive coastlines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality coal in Europe.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|332}}

There were two main values that really drove the Industrial Revolution in Britain. These values were self-interest and an [[entrepreneurial]] spirit. Because of these interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a [[consumer]] revolution.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; These advancements also greatly benefitted the British society as a whole. Countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own Industrial Revolutions.&lt;ref name="Kiely"&gt;Kiely, Ray (November 2011). "Industrialization and Development: A Comparative Analysis". UGL Press Limited: 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas [[British Empire#Colonization|colonies]] or that profits from the British [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="Was slavery the engine of economic growth? Digital History"/&gt; Even though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of Britain's industrial output.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution by Pat Hudson, pg. 198"/&gt;
[[File:William Bell Scott - Iron and Coal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[William Bell Scott]] ''Iron and Coal'', 1855–60]]

Instead, the greater [[liberalisation]] of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the [[Royal Navy]]&lt;ref name="manufacturing"/&gt;). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position – an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe.

Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. [[Enclosure]] of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the [[Northern England|North of England]], the [[English Midlands]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.

The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688 following the [[Glorious Revolution]], and British society's greater receptiveness to change (compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution. Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="dictatorship"/&gt; (This point is also made in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''[[The Servile State]]''.)

The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote about capitalism and religious tolerance in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733), noting why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. "Take a view of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange in London]], a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan [Muslim], and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's word. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians. Letters on the English.|last=Voltaire|first=François Marie Arouet de.|date=1909–14|website=www.bartleby.com|publisher=The Harvard Classics|page=|orig-year=1734|access-date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's population grew 280% 1550–1820, while the rest of Western Europe grew 50–80%. Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain 1750–1800. By 1800, only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain. This was only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had replaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not. Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse's work was mechanised. A workhorse needs {{convert|3|to|5|acres|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy.

In 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain, while the Netherlands had none; so despite having Europe's best transport, most urbanised, well paid, literate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. In the 18th century, it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank. Without coal, Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s.&lt;ref name="continuity"/&gt;

Economic historian [[Robert C. Allen|Robert Allen]] has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-01|title=Explaining the first Industrial Revolution: two views|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/15/1/153/512087/Explaining-the-first-Industrial-Revolution-two|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=15|issue=1|pages=153–168|doi=10.1017/S1361491610000201|issn=1361-4916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, two 2018 studies in ''[[The Economic History Review]]'' showed that wages were not particularly high in the British [[Spinning wheel|spinning]] sector or the construction sector, casting doubt on Allen's explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Jane|last2=Schneider|first2=Benjamin|date=2018-05-23|title=Spinning the industrial revolution|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|doi=10.1111/ehr.12693|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Judy Z.|date=2017-05-13|title='Real' wages?

===Transfer of knowledge===
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]] (ca. 1766). Informal philosophical societies spread scientific advances]]
Knowledge of innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.

Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], in which members met to discuss 'natural philosophy' (''i.e.'' science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, "They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution".&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based [[Royal Society of Arts]] published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual ''Transactions''.

There were publications describing technology. [[Encyclopedia|Encyclopaedias]] such as [[John Harris (writer)|Harris]]'s ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704) and [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1802–1819) contain much of value. ''Cyclopaedia'' contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]'' and Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.

Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the ''Annales des Mines'', published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours.

====Protestant work ethic====
{{Main|Protestant work ethic}}
Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an [[entrepreneur]]ial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.&lt;ref name="Capital and Innovation: How Britain Became the First Industrial Nation"/&gt; The existence of this class is often linked to the [[Protestant work ethic]] (see [[Max Weber]]) and the particular status of the [[Baptists]] and the dissenting Protestant sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] that had flourished with the [[English Civil War]]. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the [[Government debt|national debt]] by the [[Bank of England]], contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.

[[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England's [[Oxbridge|only two universities]] at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|four universities]]). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] became mandatory due to the [[Test Act]], they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences – areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.

Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the [[middle class]], such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.

==Opposition from Romanticism==
{{Main|Romanticism}}
During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic movement.  Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre, eds., ''Romanticism against the Tide of Modernity'' (Duke University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet [[William Blake]] and poets [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The movement stressed the importance of "nature" in art and language, in contrast to "monstrous" machines and factories; the "Dark satanic mills" of Blake's poem "[[And did those feet in ancient time]]". [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged. French Romanticism likewise was highly critical of industry.&lt;ref&gt;AJ George, ''The development of French romanticism: the impact of the industrial revolution on literature'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="manufacturing"&gt;The Royal Navy itself may have contributed to Britain's industrial growth. Among the first complex industrial manufacturing processes to arise in Britain were those that produced material for British warships. For instance, the average warship of the period used roughly 1000 pulley fittings. With a fleet as large as the Royal Navy, and with these fittings needing to be replaced every 4 to 5 years, this created a great demand which encouraged industrial expansion. The industrial manufacture of rope can also be seen as a similar factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sewer overflow RI EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Excessive infiltration/inflow may cause sanitary sewer overflows during wet weather.]]'''Infiltration/Inflow''' ('''I/I''') causes dilution in [[sanitary sewer]]s.  Dilution of sewage decreases the efficiency of treatment, and may cause sewage volumes to exceed design capacity.  Although inflow is technically different from infiltration, it may be difficult to determine which is causing dilution problems in inaccessible sewers.  The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] defines the term infiltration/inflow as combined contributions from both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=e59aece1945f2c220e3474257ee2a251&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:1.0.1.2.32&amp;idno=40#40:1.0.1.2.32.4.142.4 40CFR35.905] Accessed 2010-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Early [[combined sewer]]s used [[surface runoff]] to dilute waste from [[toilet]]s and carry it away from urban areas into natural waterways.  [[Sewage treatment]] can remove some [[pollutant]]s from toilet waste, but treatment of diluted flow from combined sewers produces larger volumes of treated sewage with similar pollutant concentrations.  Modern sanitary sewers are designed to transport domestic and industrial [[wastewater]] directly to treatment facilities without dilution.&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;Steel, E.W. and McGhee, Terence J. ''Water Supply and Sewerage'' (1979) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-060929-2}} p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infiltration==
[[Groundwater]] entering sanitary sewers through defective pipe joints and broken pipes is called ''infiltration''.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, James J. ''The Environmental Dictionary'' (1995) John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-11995-4}} p.335&lt;/ref&gt;  Pipes may leak because of careless installation; they may also be damaged after installation by differential ground movement, heavy vehicle traffic on roadways above the sewer, careless construction practices in nearby trenches, or degradation of the sewer pipe materials.  In general, volume of leakage will increase over time. Damaged and broken sewer cleanouts are a major cause of infiltration into municipal sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/region1/sso/pdfs/PrivateSewerLaterals.pdf EPA Report June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Infiltration will occur where local groundwater elevation is higher than the sewer pipe.  Gravel bedding materials in sewer pipe trenches act as a [[French drain]].  Groundwater flows parallel to the sewer until it reaches the area of damaged pipe.  In areas of low groundwater, sewage may exfiltrate into groundwater from a leaking sewer.&lt;ref name="eddy"&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy ''Wastewater Engineering'' (1972) McGraw-Hill pp.39-44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inflow==
Water entering sanitary sewers from inappropriate connections is called ''inflow''.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;  Typical sources include sump pumps, roof drains, cellar drains, and yard drains where urban features prevent surface runoff, and storm drains are not conveniently accessible or identifiable.  Inflow tends to peak during precipitation events, and causes greater flow variation than infiltration. Peak flows caused by inflow may generate a [[foul flush]] of accumulated [[biofilm]] and sanitary solids scoured from the dry weather [[wetted perimeter]] of oversized sewers during peak flow [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/rrr/wiki-internal/files/sediment%20control.pdf |title=Sewer-Sediment Control: Overview of an EPA Wet-Weather Flow Research Program |last1=Fan |first1=Chi-Yuan |last2=Field |first2=Richard |last3=Lai |first3=Fu-hsiung |website=[[University of California Los Angeles]] |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of inflow can sometimes be identified by [[smoke testing (mechanical)|smoke testing]].  Smoke is blown into the sewer during dry weather while observers watch for smoke emerging from yards, cellars, or roof gutters.&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;Hammer, Mark J. ''Water and Waste-Water Technology'' (1975) John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-34726-4}} pp.303-304&amp;441-442&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Dilution of sewage directly increases costs of pumping and [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], ozonation, or [[ultraviolet disinfection]].  Physical treatment structures including screens and pumps must be enlarged to handle the peak flow.  Primary clarifiers must also be enlarged to treat average flows, although [[primary treatment]] of peak flows may be accomplished in [[detention basin]]s.  Biological [[secondary treatment]] is effective only while the concentration of soluble and colloidal pollutants (typically measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] or BOD) remains high enough to sustain a population of microorganisms digesting those pollutants.  Secondary treatment is expected to remove 85 percent of soluble and colloidal organic pollutants from sewage containing 200&amp;nbsp;mg/L BOD;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr133_07.html "Secondary Treatment Regulation."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' 40 CFR Part 133.&lt;/ref&gt; but BOD removal by conventional biological secondary treatment becomes less effective with dilution and practically ceases as BOD concentrations entering the treatment facility are diluted below about 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L.  Unremoved organics are potentially converted to [[disinfection by-products]] by chemical disinfection prior to discharge.

High rates of infiltration/inflow may make the sanitary sewer incapable of carrying sewage from the design service area.  Sewage may back up into the lowest homes during wet weather, or street manholes may overflow.&lt;ref name="hammer"/&gt;

==Correction==
Smoke test results may not correlate well with flow volumes; although they can identify potential problem locations.  Where sewage flow is expected to be relatively uniform, significance of infiltration and inflow may be estimated by comparison of sewage flow at the same point during wet and dry weather or at two sequential points within the sewer system.  Small areas with large flow differences can be identified if the sewer system provides adequate measuring locations.  It may be necessary to replace a section of sewer line if flow differences cannot be corrected by removing identified connections.&lt;ref name="hammer"/&gt;

'''Integrative communication theory''' is a theory of cross-cultural adaptation proposed by [[Young Yun Kim]]. The first widely published version of Kim's theory is found in the last three chapters of a textbook authored by William Gudykunst with Young Yun Kim as second author.  See [[acculturation]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].  

==Background of integrative communication theory==
'''Young Yun Kim's''' assimilation Theory of Cross-Cultural Adaptation maintains that human transformation takes only one path, assimilative.  Kim argues that all human beings experience conformity as they move into a new and culturally unfamiliar environment and that they do so by "unlearning" who they were originally. The concept, cross-cultural adaptation, refers to a process in and through which an individual achieves an increasing level of psychological and functional fitness with respect to the receiving environment. Kim's theory postulates a zero-sum process whereby assimilation or "adaptation" occurs only to the extent that the newcomer lose the characteristics of their original cultural identity, such as language, customs, beliefs and values.  

Kim's theory however is self-contradictory for on one hand Kim argues that the newcomer "evolves" toward becoming exactly like the host majority by internalizing the majority's ways of thinking, feeling and behaving while unlearning their own.  But on the other hand Kim argues that out of this transformation emerges an ''intercultural identity,'' that somehow exists beyond all the contingencies of culture and language itself.  Kim claims that individuals that enter a new culture for varying lengths of time, and to include migrant workers, diplomats, and expatriates alike &lt;ref name="kim1988"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (1988). Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation: An Integrative Theory. Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters. It is important to note that this book is a trade paperback that has been out-of-print since 1988, that it is not an academic work and it is very difficult to find through interlibrary loan or anywhere&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim2001"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (2001). Becoming Intercultural: An Integrative Theory of Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim2005"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (2005). Adapting to a New Culture. In Gudykunst, W (Ed.), Theorizing about intercultural communication. [[Thousand Oaks, California]]: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigative efforts===
Kim's research into cross-cultural adaptation began in the 1970s through a survey of Korean immigrants in the Chicago area.  It subsequently expanded to study other immigrant and refugee groups in the United States to include American Indians, Japanese and Mexican Americans, and Southeast Asian refugees.  In addition to studying groups of immigrants, Young Yun Kim researched groups of students studying abroad in the United States, as well as international students in Japan, Korean expatriates in the United States and American expatriates in South Korea. The first outline of her theory was found in an article titled, "Toward an Interactive Theory of Communication - Acculturation",&lt;ref name="kim1979"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (1979). Toward an interactive theory of communication-acculturation. In B. Ruben (Ed.), Communication Yearbook 3, 435-453.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a complete rendition of the theory in ''Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation:  An Integrative Theory'',&lt;ref name="kim1988"/&gt; which was further refined and updated with ''Becoming Intercultural:  An Integrative Theory of Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation''.&lt;ref name="kim2001"/&gt;

Kim states that there are five key "missing links" in [[cross-cultural]] adaptation literature, which her theory attempts to cover:{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

# Lack of attention to macro-level factors, such as the cultural and institutional patterns of the host environment
# Need to integrate the traditionally separate areas of investigation of long-term and short-term adaptation
# Cross cultural adaptation must be viewed in the context of new learning and psychological growth to provide a more balanced and complete interpretation of the experiences of individuals in an unfamiliar environment
# Efforts must be made to sort and consolidate the factors constituting and/or explaining the cross-cultural adaptation process of individuals
# Divergent ideological premises of assimilationalism and pluralism need to be recognized and incorporated into a pragmatic conception of cross-cultural adaptation as a condition of the host environment as well as of the individual adapting to that environment.

===Organizing principles===
*Adaptation as a Natural and Universal Phenomenon
**The theory of integrative communication rests on the human instinct to struggle for equilibrium when met with adversarial environmental conditions as experienced in a new culture.  This experience is not limited to any one region, cultural group, or nation, but is a universal concept of the basic human tendencies that accompany the struggle on each individual when they are faced with a new and challenging environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
*Adaptation as an All-Encompassing Phenomenon
**Before efforts at racial and cultural integration in the United States, the main thrust was assimilation.  The stress was on the ideology of the "model minority" which states that the only standard for "appropriate," "effective," and "competent" thinking (cognition), feeling (affect), and behavior (functional fit) was a presumed majority mainstream culture.  The immigrant newcomer was compelled to internalize mainstream ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving or be marginalized.  Beginning even before World War II and certainly after, efforts at racial and ethnic integration grew dramatically and the model minority ideology became untenable (Kramer, 2003 &lt;ref&gt;Kramer, E. (Ed.) (2003). ''The Emerging Monoculture: Assimilation and the "Model Minority"''. Westport, CT: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt;).  But even into the twenty-first century we see remnants of it.  An example is Young Yun Kim's cross-cultural adaptation theory.  Borrowing extensively from Gordon and Park's work, especially Milton Gordon's 1954 book ''Assimilation in American Life'' where he outlines seven stages in the assimilative process, Kim presents a reiteration of the 1950s era notion in her theory of cross-cultural adaptation as a multi-staged process.  The theory focuses on the unitary nature of psychological and social processes and the reciprocal functional personal environment interdependence.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  This view takes into account micro-psychological and macro-social factors into a theoretical fusion "vertical integration" of theory.  While cross-cultural adaptation theory itself is a fusion of previous ideas, it is not about racial or ethnic integration but instead assimilation.  And as such it is unlike the works of Bateson, Ruesch and Bateson, Watzlawick Beavin, and Jackson, and Buss and Kenrick&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; Kim's approach is unilinear.  The sojourner must conform to the majority group culture in order to be "communicatively competent."  Gudykunst and Kim (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; equate integration, adaptation and assimilation writing, "cross-cultural adaptation process involves a continuous interplay of deculturation and acculturation that brings about change in strangers in the direction of assimilation, the highest degree of adaptation theoretically conceivable" (p.&amp;nbsp;360).  In biological science adaptation means the random mutation of new forms of life, not convergence on a single form or monoculture (Kramer, 2003).  The term adaptation is used by Gudykunst and Kim to mean simple conformity to the coercive power (pp.&amp;nbsp;360,371) of what they call a single form of "mainstream culture" with its "objective" "external" reality (p.&amp;nbsp;378) -- "what is real, what is true, what is right, what is beautiful, and what is good" (p.&amp;nbsp;376).  As they define reality, the newcomer's perspective is false, a delusion or "self-deception" (p.&amp;nbsp;380) and any attempt to maintain one's original false values, beliefs, ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitute the mental illness of "maladaptation" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) the way of "upward-forward" (p.&amp;nbsp;382) evolution toward functional fitness and psychological health is for the newcomer to willfully "unlearn" and "deculturize" (p.&amp;nbsp;380) herself.  They propose psychotherapy as well as the abandonment of all ethnic relations and associations with ethnic ties as well as avoidance of "ethnic media" use (pp.&amp;nbsp;365–368) to help immigrants (p.&amp;nbsp;382) achieve "integrative" conformity.  This is not ecological integration but simple disintegration of the newcomer until their identity is erased.  According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) the more the newcomer is disintegrated the better, even if it leads to extreme distress for the immigrant.  As Gudykunst and Kim (2003) put it, "Even extreme mental illness [caused by "conformity pressure" p.&amp;nbsp;371] can be viewed as a process of a potentially positive disintegration that will be reintegrated with new material at a higher level" (p.&amp;nbsp;381).  No matter how unjust or cruel, Gudykunst and Kim (2003) argue that the host way of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitutes the "higher level" of psychic evolution and any resistance to pressure to conform, to disintegration on the part of a minority person indicates that the immigrant is communicatively incompetent, immature (p.&amp;nbsp;381), mentally ill (pp.&amp;nbsp;365, 372-373, 376), weak (p.&amp;nbsp;369), irrationally aggressive or hostile (pp.&amp;nbsp;371, 376), lacking in self-control (p.&amp;nbsp;369), cynical (p.&amp;nbsp;380), pessimistic (p.&amp;nbsp;369), closed-minded (p.&amp;nbsp;369), simple minded (pp.&amp;nbsp;382–383) and "ethnocentric" (pp.&amp;nbsp;376, 382).  Evolutionary progress for the individual requires the individual to "abandon identification with the cultural patterns that have constituted who one is and what one is" (p.&amp;nbsp;377).  These patterns are not just behavioral but "appropriate" ways of thinking as defined by the majority mainstream reality.

Grace (Ed.), ''Comparative Cultures and Civilizations (Vol. 3)''. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton.&lt;/ref&gt;) maintains clear conceptual separation between assimilation, adaptation, and integration. Only assimilation involves conformity to a pre-existing form. Kramer's (2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2003, 2009, 2011) theory of Cultural Fusion, which is based on systems theory and hermeneutics, argues that first it is impossible for a person to unlearn themselves and second that "growth" is, by definition, not a zero sum process that requires the disillusion of one form for another to come into being but rather a process of learning new languages and cultural repertoires (ways of thinking, cooking, playing, working worshipping, and so forth).  One need not unlearn a language in order to learn a new one.  Nor does one have to unlearn who one is in order to learn new ways of dancing, cooking, talking and so forth.  Cognitive complexity involves the ability to code switch between repertoires, not a zero growth, zero-sum process as Gudykunst and Kim claim (2003, p 383).  Learning is growth, not unlearning.
*Adaptation as a Communication-Based Phenomenon
**A person begins to adapt only as they communicate with others in their new environment.  Integration relies on that interaction with the host society and the degree to which an individual adapts depends on the amount and nature of communication with members of the host society.
*Theory as a System of Description and Explanation
**The present theory is designed to identify the patterns that are commonly present within a clearly defined set of individual cases and to translate these patterns into a set of generalized and interrelated statements.  The fact that humans will adapt in a new environment was not questioned, but rather how and why individuals adapt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
*Theorizing at the Interface of Deduction and Induction
**Kim's research has switched between deductive and inductive processes – between the conceptual realm of logical development of ideas from a set of basic assumptions about human adaptation and empirical substantiation of the ideas based on proofs available in social science literature.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  In her research, Kim introduced anecdotal stories and testimonials of immigrants and sojourners available in non-technical sources such as reports, biographies, letters, diaries, dialogues, commentaries, and other materials in magazines, newspapers, fiction and nonfiction books, radio programs, and televisions programs.   These individual accounts are not scientific data, but rather serve as a vital source of insights into the "lived experiences" of cross cultural adaptation.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
*Focal Concepts and Boundary Conditions
**Kim employs two central terms in Integrative Communication Theory, [[adaptation]] and [[wiktionary:stranger|stranger]], in order to help define the theory.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  Stranger incorporates in it all individuals who enter and resettle in a new cultural or sub-cultural environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

==Process of cross-cultural adaptation==
All human beings are born into an unfamiliar environment and are brought up to become part of a culture.  This process is known as [[enculturation]], and refers to the organization, integration, and maintenance of a home environment throughout the formative years along with the internal change that occurs with increasing interaction of the individual in its cultural environment. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Entering a new culture===
The transition into a new culture can be shocking, and internal conflicts often arise.  The individual must learn to adapt and grow into the new environment, as they are often faced with situations that challenge their cultural norms and worldview.  This is the process known as [[acculturation]] as described by Shibutani and Kwan in 1965.  According to Kim, as new learning occurs, deculturation or unlearning of some of the old cultural elements has to occur, at least in the sense that new responses are adopted in situations that previously would have evoked old ones.  The individual is forced to develop new habits, which may come in conflict with the old ones. Kim states that the ultimate theoretical directionality of adaptive change is toward [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], a state of the maximum possible convergence of strangers' internal and external conditions to those of the natives.  Assimilation is an ongoing process and is not usually fully attained, regardless of the amount of time spent in the new culture.

Integrative communication theory suggests that these varying levels of integration within a culture directly impact the individual's experience in the new culture, which other research suggests.  According to '''Don C. Locke''', one major difference among members of various cultural groups within America is the degree to which they have immersed themselves into the culture of the United States.  He states that members of culturally diverse groups can be placed into several categories.  Bicultural individuals are able to function as competently in the dominant culture as their own while holding on to manifestations of their own culture.  Traditional individuals hold on to a majority of cultural traits from the culture of origin and reject many traits of the dominant culture.  A third type of individual will acculturate and give up most cultural traits of the culture of origin and traits of the dominant culture.  Finally, a marginal individual does not fit into the culture of origin nor into the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="locke"&gt;Locke, D (1998). Increasing Multicultural Understanding. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The stress-adaptation-growth dynamic===
Kim has developed an integrative communication theory of cross-cultural adaptation which conceives adaptation as a [[dialectic]] process of the "stress-adaptation-growth" dynamic that gradually leads to greater functional fitness and psychological health with regards to the host environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; This portion of Kim's theory focuses on the [[Stress (biological)|stress]] that inevitably accompanies a cross-cultural move, as the individual strives to retain aspects of their old culture while also attempting to integrate into the new one.  The internal conflict that arises results in a state of disequilibrium of emotional "lows" of uncertainty confusion, and anxiety.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
People handle this change in various ways, to include avoidance, denial, and withdrawal, as well as regression into pre-existing habits in order to eliminate discomfort in the new environment. Others develop new habits and begin the process of [[adaptation]], allowing them to become better suited to their environment.  Once this occurs, a period of growth often accompanies.  The stress adaptation growth dynamic, therefore, is not a linear process but a back and forth endeavor that will entail periods of regression and subsequent progression. Assimilation can be defined as the process by which a person takes material into their mind from the environment, which may mean changing the evidence of their senses to make it fit, whereas accommodation is the difference made to one's mind or concepts by the process of assimilation.&lt;ref name="atherton"&gt;Atherton J.S. (2005) Learning and Teaching:  Piaget's developmental theory.  Retrieved May 2, 2008, from http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/piaget.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The structure of cross-cultural adaptation==

===Personal communication: host communication competence===
Communication is a prerequisite for successful adaptation of individuals into a new environment.  This relies on [[Code|decoding]], or the capacity of strangers to receive and process information, as well as [[encoding]], or the designing and executing mental plans in initiating or responding to messages.
There are three commonly recognized categories:
#Cognitive: Includes such internal capabilities as the knowledge of the host culture and language, history, institutions, worldviews, beliefs, norms, and rules of interpersonal conduct.
#Affective: Affective competence facilitates cross-cultural adaptation by providing a motivational capacity to deal with various challenges of living in the host environment, the openness to new learning, and the willingness to participate in emotional and physical aspects of the host environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
#Operational: Operational competence relates to the other aspects of host communication competence and facilitates strangers' outwardly expressing their cognitive and affective experiences.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Host social communication===
Participation in the interpersonal and [[mass communication]] activities of the host society is crucial. '''Host interpersonal communication''' helps strangers to secure vital information and insight into the mind-sets and behaviors of the local people, thereby providing strangers a reference point for their own behaviors,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} while '''host mass communication''' relies on integrating the individual into the host society via media, radio, television, etc...and serves as an important source of cultural and language learning without relying heavily on individual participation and exposure.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Ethnic social communication===
In the initial phase of integration, ethnic communities serve to allow strangers to receive some of the comforts of their previous culture, and serve to facilitate adaptation.  After the initial phase, ethnic social communication allows individuals to maintain connectedness to their original culture. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Environment===
Some cultures make it easier to assimilate than others, and the host environment has a direct impact on the nature of an individual's integration.  Some societies display more openness and warmth to outsiders than others.  The degree to which a given host environment exerts receptivity and conformity pressure on a stranger is closely influenced by the overall ethnic group strength, which is a measure of a given stranger's ethnic group's capacity to influence the surrounding host environment at large.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Predisposition===
An individual can better prepare themselves to enter a new environment, both physically and emotionally, which will have a positive effect on their ability to transition.  This takes into account the mental, emotional, and motivational readiness to deal with the new environment, including understanding of the new language and culture.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; Having an open mind helps to alleviate some of the [[culture shock]] that is associated with assimilation into the new environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6788">'''Jeremy Paul Axford Commons''' (born 17 December 1933)&lt;ref name="MCreg"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[New Zealand]] [[opera]] historian, scholar, [[impresario]] and [[librettist]]. He is an authority on nineteenth-century Italian opera and has published major works on the composers [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Nicola Vaccai|Nicola Vaccaj]].

== Academic career ==

Commons was born in [[Auckland]] in 1933. After graduating MA in English from [[Auckland University]] and [[Merton College, Oxford]],&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; he spent a year in [[Italy]] as an Italian Government scholarship-holder studying early nineteenth century opera.

He returned to New Zealand in 1959 and worked for the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of External Affairs]] as a junior [[diplomat]], with postings at New Zealand's [[Embassy]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; and the [[High Commission of New Zealand in London|High Commission in London]].

He joined the English Department at [[Victoria University Wellington]] in 1967 as a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] and taught English literature, specialising in the [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] period. Since retiring in 1989, he has devoted his attention full-time to opera-related projects.

In 2006, he was awarded an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctorate]] of Literature from Victoria University for his revival of, and research into, nineteenth-century Italian operas.

== Research and publications ==

He has spent many years in Italian libraries and archives, uncovering not only neglected opera composers and their scores, but also collections of their letters and papers, contemporary accounts and reviews, thus building up an invaluable picture of their lives and productions.

Among other forgotten works he has been instrumental in rediscovering, he has edited in collaboration with the Milanese conductor Daniele Ferrari the opera ''Il convitato di pietra'' (1832), a version of the [[Don Giovanni]] story written by the Italian composer [[Giovanni Pacini]]. The work was given its first modern-day performance at the 2008 [[Rossini in Wildbad]] Festival. The work has been recorded by [[Naxos Records]].

His first major scholarly work was the 1,652 page volume ''The First Performances of the Operas of Donizetti'', produced in collaboration with Annalisa Bini and published in Italian in 1997. On his own he subsequently published in 2008 a collection of more than 2000 letters he has transcribed and edited that were written by or to the composer Nicola Vaccaj, a contemporary of [[Rossini]] and Donizetti, whose singing exercises are used by singers to this day.

At various times during his career, he has been commissioned to write essays, introductions and notes by opera companies in various parts of the world including [[Opera Australia]], San Francisco and [[English National Opera]]. He has worked with leading exponents of Italian opera such as [[Dame Joan Sutherland]] and conductor [[Richard Bonynge]] on articles to accompany their recordings for [[Decca Records]]. Since 1975, he has been a researcher and writer for the London-based company [[Opera Rara]], which has issued award-winning recordings of neglected nineteenth-century Italian operas.

== Opera productions ==

As a producer, Commons has focused on small-scale salon operas, suitable for performance by small groups operating on limited budgets.

He collaborated with the [[Waikato]] Opera Group (later Opera Waikato) in presenting operas by [[Giuseppe Balducci]], whose works he had found in the library of the [[Naples]] [[Conservatorium]]. These included ''I gelosi'' (1993), ''Il noce di Benevento'' (1995) and ''Scherzo'' (1996). He also collaborated with [[Dunedin|Dunedin’s]] Marama Opera  on a production of [[Chabrier|Chabrier’s]] ''[[Une éducation manquée|Une Education manquée]]'' (1996).

In 1995, he branched out on his own with a production of [[Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin]]'s ''La Laitière de Trianon''. Three other Weckerlin salon operas followed: ''Entre deux Feux!'' (1997) ''Le Mariage en poste'' (1999) and ''Carmontel'' (2001), as well as [[Gustave Nadaud]]'s ''Le Docteur Vieuxtemps'' (1998).

In 2002 he established the Sirius Opera label. It ceased operations in 2006.

== Libretti ==

From 1997, he has written libretti for small-scale works in collaboration with several New Zealand composers.

With [[Dorothy Quita Buchanan]] he wrote ''The Mansfield Stories'' (''The Woman at the Store'', ''Miss Brill'' and ''The Daughters of the Late Colonel''). He mounted the first of these in 1998. Orchestrated versions of all three were presented in 1999. He also collaborated with Buchanan on ''It Began with a Pony'' (2003).

With [[John Drummond (musicologist)|John Drummond]] he has produced six operas: ''Mr Polly at the Potwell Inn'' (2000), ''A Beleaguered City'' (2002), ''Marriage à la Mode'' (2004), ''Impersonating Maurice'' (2005), ''Mrs Windermere'' (2006) and ''The Genteel Pigeons'' (2006).

He was the co-librettist with [[Ivan Bootham]] for ''The Death of Venus'' (2002).

He also adapted [[Ian Cross]]'s novel ''[[The God Boy]]'' as a libretto for composer [[Anthony Ritchie]]. The resulting opera was premiered by the [[Dunedin]] Opera Company (Opera Otago) at the 2004 Otago Festival of the Arts, and was subsequently given at the 2006 [[Canterbury University]] Platform Arts Festival.

== Other activities ==

He was president of the New Zealand Opera Society from 1981-1988, and from 1985–1989 he also edited its magazine ''Opera News''. He remains the society's Patron.

He lives in [[Wellington]].

'''''The Jerome Biblical Commentary''''' is a 1968 book of [[Biblical scholarship]] and commentary edited by [[Raymond Edward Brown]], [[Joseph A. Fitzmyer]], and [[Roland E. Murphy]]. It is arguably the most-used volume of [[Catholic]] [[scriptural commentary]] in the United States with the first edition selling 200,000 copies; it was also translated into Spanish, Italian and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;Preface, ''New Jerome Biblical Commentary'', p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's title is a reference to [[Jerome]], known for his translation of the Bible into Latin (the [[Vulgate]]), and his extensive Biblical commentaries.

'''"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt"''' (English: '''"People Life Dance World"''') is a [[song]] by the German [[satirist]] [[Jan Böhmermann]]. It was presented as part of the TV show ''[[Neo Magazin Royale]]'' on 6 April 2017 and released on the same day.

==Background==
On 6 April 2017, Böhmermann criticised the German [[pop music|pop industry]] and the [[Echo Music Prize|Echo Award]] ceremony, which was planned for the next day, on his show ''Neo Magazin Royale''. The 20-minute long [[monologue]] had already been released on [[YouTube]] the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann über Max Giesinger und die neuen deutschen "Songpoeten"|trans-title=|periodical=[[Tonspion]]|publisher=|url=http://www.tonspion.de/news/jan-boehmermann-ueber-max-giesinger-und-die-neuen-deutschen-songpoeten|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Udo Raaf|date=2017-04-06|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among other things, he criticized [[Max Giesinger]], [[Tim Bendzko]] and [[Matthias Schweighöfer]] who, according to Böhmermann, did not write their own lyrics and focused more on the revenue their songs could earn rather than meaningful content. He refers to them as the "new German pop poets" and claims that their songs have "trivial lyrics," sounding like "advertising messages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann lässt Affen Song schreiben|trans-title=|periodical=[[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]]|publisher=|url=http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.klingt-wie-max-giesinger-jan-boehmermann-laesst-affen-song-schreiben.fac275bd-5359-4739-a493-30397eeecf30.html|deadurl=no|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406213726/http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.klingt-wie-max-giesinger-jan-boehmermann-laesst-affen-song-schreiben.fac275bd-5359-4739-a493-30397eeecf30.html|archivedate=2017-04-06|last=|date=2017-04-06|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their [[music video]]s contain numerous [[product placement]]s. To prove how standardised and replaceable German pop songs are, Böhmermann and his production team collected [[advertising slogan]]s, phrases from current pop songs and [[Twitter|tweets]] of the German [[YouTuber]]s [[Bianca Heinicke]] and [[Sami Slimani]]. These text fragments were then randomly put together at [[ZOOM Erlebniswelt Gelsenkirchen]] by five [[chimpanzee]]s, creating the finished song lyrics.&lt;ref name="augsburger"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann landet Charthit. Den Song haben Schimpansen geschrieben|trans-title=|periodical=[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]|publisher=|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/panorama/Jan-Boehmermann-landet-Charthit-Den-Song-haben-Schimpansen-geschrieben-id41126026.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Sandra Liermann|date=2017-04-07|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[pseudonym]] "Jim Pandzko," a [[pun]] made up of "[[Tim Bendzko]]" and "[[chimpanzee]]," was used to identify the song's singer.
The songwriters registered with [[GEMA (German organization)|GEMA]], ''Bono Beau'' and ''Olaf Utan'', are also word plays made up of "[[Bonobo]]" and "[[Orangutan]]", too.&lt;ref name="GEMA" /&gt;

"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt" was recorded at Studio Debussy in [[Essen]]. Audio mixing was done at Klangwelt Studio, also in Essen.&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Pandzko Feat.

==Music and Content==
"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt" is composed in [[verse–chorus form]] with content from different, randomly combined text fragments. Böhmermann says that the words in the title ''Menschen'' (English: people), ''Leben'' (life), ''Tanzen'' (dance) and ''Welt'' (world) describe the four most-used themes in German pop music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Songtext Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt – Jim Pandzko|trans-title=|periodical=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|publisher=|url=https://genius.com/11627584|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann gibt Deutschpop eine saftige Nackenschelle und schreibt mit Schimpansen eigenen Radiohit|trans-title=|periodical=[[Vice (Magazin)|Noisey]]|publisher=|url=https://noisey.vice.com/de/article/jan-bohmermann-gibt-deutschpop-eine-saftige-nackenschelle-und-schreibt-mit-schimpansen-eigenen-radiohit|deadurl=no|format=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408081727/https://noisey.vice.com/de/article/jan-bohmermann-gibt-deutschpop-eine-saftige-nackenschelle-und-schreibt-mit-schimpansen-eigenen-radiohit|archivedate=2017-04-08|last=|date=2017-04-06|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Refrain|chorus]] uses the lyrics "Oh oh eh oh oh" to make remembering and singing along to the song easier.&lt;ref name="Express" /&gt;

== Reception and Reactions ==
The media responded positively to "Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt". ''[[Stern (Zeitschrift)|Stern]]'' wrote: "you cannot illustrate the state of German pop music in 2017 any better than with a song that was written in such a short time and composed by apes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann lässt Schimpansen texten – heraus kommt ein Popsong|trans-title=|periodical=[[Stern (Zeitschrift)|Stern]]|publisher=|url=http://www.stern.de/kultur/musik/jan-boehmermann-laesst-schimpansen-texten---heraus-kommt-ein-popsong-7401078.html|deadurl=no|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406194707/http://www.stern.de/kultur/musik/jan-boehmermann-laesst-schimpansen-texten---heraus-kommt-ein-popsong-7401078.html|archivedate=2017-04-06|last=|date=|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review which discusses the [[satire|satirical]] vein of the song, ''[[Musikexpress]]'' claims that the song is the most emotional one you can listen to today and is unusually catchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt" ist der gefühlvollste Song, den du heute hören wirst|trans-title=|periodical=[[Musikexpress]]|publisher=|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/menschen-leben-tanzen-welt-ist-der-gefuehlvollste-song-den-du-heute-hoeren-wirst-781553/|deadurl=no|format=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119141448/https://www.musikexpress.de/menschen-leben-tanzen-welt-ist-der-gefuehlvollste-song-den-du-heute-hoeren-wirst-781553/|archivedate=2018-01-19|last=Andreas Meixensperger|date=2017-04-06|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The singer of the German band [[Die Toten Hosen]], [[Campino (singer)|Campino]], said during the 2017 Echo Award Ceremony in a reference to the video: "It's better to be uncool than a cool asshole, who cannot be constructive in any way." He also talked about the "Böhmermann [[Zeitgeist]]&lt;nowiki /&gt; [[banter]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.skandal-beim-echo-campino-zu-boehmermann-lieber-uncool-als-ein-cooles-arschloch.51d45012-33cd-444b-998e-f887c6514e0b.html Campino über Böhmermann: „Lieber uncool, als ein cooles Arschloch"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410220014/http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.skandal-beim-echo-campino-zu-boehmermann-lieber-uncool-als-ein-cooles-arschloch.51d45012-33cd-444b-998e-f887c6514e0b.html |date=2017-04-10 }}''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2601">[[File:Bust Serapis Chiaramonti.jpg|thumb|[[Serapis]] wearing the modius]]
The '''modius''' is a type of flat-topped cylindrical headdress or crown found in [[ancient Egyptian art]] and art of the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The name was given by modern scholars based on its resemblance to the jar used as a [[ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman unit of dry measure]],&lt;ref&gt;Judith Lynn Sebesta and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The World of Roman Costume'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 245; Irene Bald Romano, ''Classical Sculpture: Catalogue of the Cypriot, Greek, And Roman Stone Sculpture in the University Of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 2006), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; but it probably does represent a grain-measure, and symbolized powers over fecundity in those wearing it.

The modius is worn by certain deities, including [[Mut]],&lt;ref&gt;Betsy M. Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen from the Reign of Amenhotep III," in ''Servant of Mut: Studies in Honor of Richard A. Fazzini'' (Brill, 2007), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian deities]] and their Roman counterparts, the [[Artemis of Ephesus|Ephesian Artemis]] and certain other forms of the goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Didyma: Apollo's Oracle, Cult, and Companions'' pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hecate]], and [[Serapis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture: The Styles of ca. 331–200 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; On some deities it represents fruitfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, ''Didyma'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to be a form mostly restricted to supernatural beings in art, and by rarely worn in real life, with two probable exceptions.  A tall modius is part of the complex headdress used for portraits of Egyptian queens, ornamented variously with symbols, vegetative motifs, and the [[uraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen," p 36ff.; Paul Edmund Stanwick, ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings As Egyptian Pharaohs'' (University of Texas Press, 2002), p. 35 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the distinctive headdress of [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] priests.&lt;ref&gt;Romano, ''Classical Sculpture,'' p. 294; Lucinda Dirven, ''The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria'' (Brill, 1999), pp. 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">The notion of '''musical similarity''' is particularly complex because there are numerous dimensions of similarity. If similarity takes place between different fragments from one musical piece, a musical similarity implies a [[repetition (music)|repetition]] of the first occurring fragment. As well, eventually, the similarity does not occur by direct repetition, but by presenting in two (or more) set of relations, some common values or patterns. Objective musical similarity can be based on musical features such as:

Pitched parameters
* [[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] interval similarity
* [[Melody|Melodic]] similarity&lt;ref&gt;Greg Aloupis, Thomas Fevens, [[Stefan Langerman]], Tomomi Matsui, Antonio Mesa, Yurai Nunez, and David Rappaport, and Godfried T. Toussaint, "Algorithms for computing geometric measures of melodic similarity," ''Computer Music Journal'', Vol. 30, No. 3, Fall 2006, pp. 67–76.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Modulation (music)|Modulation]] pattern similarity
* [[Timbre|Timbral]] similarity

Non-pitched parameters
* [[Meter (music)|Metrical]] structure similarity
* [[Rhythm]]ic pattern similarity&lt;ref&gt;Godfried T. Toussaint, "A comparison of rhythmic dissimilarity measures," ''FORMA'', Vol. 21, No. 2, 2006, pp. 129–149.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Section (music)|Section]] structure similarity

Semiotic parameters
* [[Modality (semiotics)|Modality]] structure similarity
* [[Extension (semantics)|Extension]]al similarity
* [[Intension]]al similarity

Nevertheless, similarity can be based also on less objective features such as musical genre, personal history, social context (e.g. music from the 1960s), and a priori knowledge.

==Applications==
Automatic methods of musical similarity detection based on [[data mining]] and [[co-occurrence]] analysis has been developed in order to classify music titles for electronic music distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Pachet]], Geert Westermann, Damien Laigre, [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf Musical Data Mining for Electronic Music Distribution].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5330">'''Nathan A. Scott Jr.''' (24 April 1925 – December 2006) was an American scholar who helped establish the modern field of theology and literature and who helped found the well-known Ph.D. program in that field at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Terry. "Religion and Literature from the Modern to the Postmodern: Scott, [[George Steiner|Steiner]] and [[Robert Detweiler (scholar)|Detweiler]]". ''Literature and Theology'' 19.1 (2005) 3-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also published seventeen books, in addition to publishing articles and reviews and editing editions.&lt;ref name="Carrigan"&gt;[http://www.bibliobuffet.com/content/view/738/285/ "Remembering Nathan Scott"] by Henry L. Carrigan, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; He has likewise been the subject of numerous articles and books.

Scott's innovation in literary criticism was to reject the [[New Criticism|New Critics']] idea that poems should be studied as autonomous objects and to remind scholars that authors' personal beliefs are crucial for understanding their texts; in this way, he also returned criticism to a study of the way literature represents the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Hesla, David H.

Scott earned his B.A. at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1944, his B.D. at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in 1946, and his Ph.D at [[Columbia University]] in 1949, having studied under [[Lionel Trilling]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], and [[Jacques Barzun]].&lt;ref name="Carrigan"/&gt; He served as dean of the chapel at [[Virginia Union University]] and was an ordained priest in the Episcopal Church.

{{cquote|Along with [[Stanley Romaine Hopper]] at Drew University, [[Preston Roberts]] and '''Nathan A. Scott Jr.''' at the University of Chicago established the emerging interdisciplinary field that became known variously as religion and literature, theology and literature, or Christianity and literature. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, theologians found themselves looking to the literature of the post-World War II period for articulate expressions of theological themes such as despair, alienation, redemption, and revelation. Drawing primarily on Paul Tillich’s theology of culture—which defined religion as the substance of culture and culture as the form of religion—Scott eloquently explored the crisis of faith in modern literature, the climate of faith in Kafka, Camus, and Bellow, and the themes of alienation and reconciliation in modern plays, poetry, and novels. Scott taught several generations of students that a dialogue with the literary imagination of the age would provide rich rewards for Christian theology by offering a deepening awareness of itself and the time in which it finds itself. In one of his most eloquent and astute observations, Scott pointed out that the sense that the anchoring center of life is broken and that the world is abandoned and adrift is a basic premise underlying most of our literature.}}

Shore explains that "the sense of mastery over language resources that word processing bestows on the experienced user is intimately related to [[Martin Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell|enframing ''(Bestellen'')]], a subjection of the world to human will that Heidegger saw as a characteristic of all modern technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There are sources that claim the concept of neuromantic is not only confined to computer enthusiasts. For instance, there is the so-called neuromantic imagination that inspire architects. Here, the cybernetic frame of mind is fired by the concept of the "third nature," which is occupied by those who inhabit not the actual terrain in which we live, work, and play but the virtual space of media flows that enter the "unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teletechnologies, Place, and Community|last=Wilken|first=Rowan|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415875950|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Flow (psychology)|Flowstates]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10448">The '''Orton-Gillingham''' Approach to [[Reading (activity)|reading]] instruction was developed in the early-20th century.

It is language-based, multisensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, [[cognitive]], and flexible.&lt;ref&gt;The structured flexibility of Orton-GillinghamBB Sheffield - Annals of Dyslexia, 1991 - Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orton-Gillingham Approach has been in use since the 1930s.  An intensive, sequential [[phonics]]-based system teaches the basics of word formation before whole meanings. The method accommodates and utilizes three learning modalities, or pathways, through which people learn&amp;mdash;visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Unlike some scripted and rigid reading programs, the Orton-Gillingham Approach is a system that allows for flexibility.

== Orton and Gillingham ==

[[Samuel Orton|Samuel Torrey Orton]] (1879&amp;ndash;1948), a neuropsychiatrist and [[pathologist]] at [[Columbia University]], brought together neuroscientific information and principles of remediation. As early as the 1920s, he had extensively studied children with the kind of language processing difficulties now commonly associated with [[dyslexia]] and had formulated a set of teaching principles and practices for such children.

[[Anna Gillingham]] (1878&amp;ndash;1963) was an [[educator]] and [[psychologist]] at Teachers College, [[Columbia University]].  Working with Dr. Orton, she trained teachers and compiled and published instructional materials. Gillingham combined Orton’s teaching methods with her analysis of the structure of the English/American language and with Bessie Stillman, she wrote what has become the Orton–Gillingham manual: Remedial Training for Children with Specific Disability in Reading, Spelling and Penmanship. First published in 1935/6, this work is updated and republished regularly.

== Features of the Approach ==

'''Language-based''': The Orton-Gillingham approach is based on a technique of studying and teaching language, understanding the nature of human language, the mechanisms involved in learning, and the language-learning processes in individuals.

'''Multisensory''': Orton-Gillingham teaching sessions are action-oriented and involve constant interaction between the teacher and the student and the simultaneous use of multiple sensory input channels reinforcing each other for optimal learning. Using auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements, all language skills taught are reinforced by having the student listen, speak, read and write. For example, a dyslexic learner is taught to see the letter A, say its name and sound and write it in the air – all at the same time. The approach requires intense instruction with ample practice.
The use of multiple input channels is thought to enhance memory storage and retrieval by providing multiple "triggers" for memory.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Gordon. Can Neuroscience Help to Demystify Dyslexia?  Schwab Learning. Retrieved from http://www.schwablearning.org/articles.aspx?r=430 October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structured, Sequential, and Cumulative''': The Orton-Gillingham teacher introduces the elements of the language systematically. Sound-symbol associations along with linguistic rules and generalizations are introduced in a linguistically logical, understandable order.  Students begin by reading and writing sounds in isolation. Then they blend the sounds into syllables and words. Students learn the elements of language—consonants, vowels, [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], blends, and [[diphthongs]]&amp;mdash;in an orderly fashion. They then proceed to advanced structural elements such as syllable types, roots, and affixes. As students learn new material, they continue to review old material to the level of automaticity. The teacher addresses vocabulary, sentence structure, composition, and reading comprehension in a similar structured, sequential, and cumulative manner.

'''Cognitive''': Students learn about the history of the [[English language]] and study the many generalizations and rules that govern its structure. They also learn how best they can learn and apply the language knowledge necessary for achieving reading and writing competencies.

'''Flexible''': Orton-Gillingham teaching is diagnostic and prescriptive in nature. Teachers try to ensure the learner is not simply recognising a pattern and applying it without understanding. When confusion of a previously taught rule is discovered, it is re-taught from the beginning.

== Research support ==
In 2000, the National Reading Panel included the Orton-Gillingham method in their study, "Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langengerg, Ph.D|first1=Daniel|title=Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/documents/report.pdf|website=National Reading Panel|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel supported the significance of offering classroom instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=S.|title=The Orton-Gillingham Language Approach - A Research Review|date=10 February 2014|page=7|url=http://www.nessy.com/us/files/2014/06/Orton-Gillingham_Report-Final-Version.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida Center for Reading Research reported in 2006 that it was unable to identify any empirical studies examining the efficacy of the approach specifically as described in Orton-Gillingham training materials. Thus there was no direct research evidence to determine its effectiveness, although there are a variety of  studies of derivative methods that incorporate aspects of Orton-Gillingham in combination with other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2007-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overview of all reported studies of Orton-Gillingham derivative methods, such as Alphabetic Phonics or Project Read, revealed only a dozen studies with inconsistent results and a variety of methodological flaws. Despite these conclusions, the article does provide a detailed overview of the available research, which viewed most favorably would show some evidence of benefit from [[classroom]] use of OG methods with first graders, and use in [[special education]] or [[resource room]] settings with older children with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Ritchey2006&gt;{{cite journal

In July 2010, a US Department of Education agency reported that it could not find any studies meeting its evidence standards to support the efficacy of Orton-Gillingham based strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Polis – The Jerusalem Institute of Languages and Humanities''' is a non-profit academic institution based in Jerusalem, Israel. It was           founded in 2011 by an international group of scholars who aimed at a renewal of the humanities through the study of Western and Eastern cultural sources.

Sharing the conviction that languages are the key to our cultural and spiritual heritage, these scholars sensed a need for change in the way ancient languages have been taught since the 19th century. With this in mind, they developed a teaching method intended to allow true language acquisition.

Drawing from the most recent developments in Applied Linguistics and from the Israeli expertise in teaching Modern Hebrew (the Ulpan method), the Polis method attempts to teach the so-called "dead languages" the same way modern languages are usually taught: in a monolingual, full-immersive environment.

It is located in [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Musrara]], near the [[Old City of Jerusalem]].

The Institute was registered in 2011 (cfr. Non Profit Registry (in Hebrew)) and opened [[Modern Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] courses along with [[Ancient Greek]] throughout the year. The main idea was to teach ancient languages as living ones, and to put together teachers of different languages in order to share techniques between them. They soon realized the importance of full immersion during the lessons in the language taught, with both modern and ancient languages. They counted especially on the methods for teaching [[Modern Hebrew]] in Israel and on the experience of Prof. Christophe Rico teaching [[Ancient Greek]].

The main reason for running this activity as a non-profit organization was to foster the culture of dialogue through languages to as many people as possible. It soon became a contribution to better understanding of the different ethnic and religious groups present in Jerusalem.

In 2013, the Institute opened a [[M.A. degree|Master's program]] in [[Philology|ancient Philology]], which brought together several students and scholars from the US and Europe.

In the same years, Polis has organized intensive courses in other countries, such as Italy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.pusc.it/centri/dipartimento-di-lingue/home/corsiestivi Corsi stivi alla usc]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peru]], US,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avemaria.edu/Portals/0/GMC/blog/classics/Polis-Institute-Courses-at-AMU.pdf Hebrew and Latin Intensive Course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002095925/http://www.avemaria.edu/Portals/0/GMC/blog/classics/Polis-Institute-Courses-at-AMU.pdf |date=2 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.es/en/news/uic-and-polis-institute-promote-study-classic-languages Universitat Internacional de Catalunya]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morocco]] and the [[Philippines]].

==The Polis Method==

=== The principles ===
The Polis method encompasses a variety of approaches and techniques unified under two major tenets:

a)     Language learning must take place in a full immersive environment, where only the target language is spoken;

b)     Grammatical structures must be learned according to their natural order of acquisition.

Taking these principles into account, Polis sets together and adapts a wide range of approaches and teaching techniques that have been developed since the 70’s in the States and Canada.

=== Teaching techniques ===

==== Total Physical Response ====
[[Total physical response|Total Physical Response]] (TPR) is a language teaching technique that was first developed by the psychologist James Asher (San José State University) based on his observations of language acquisition in young children. Although the theory behind TPR and the term itself have reached the general public only in the late 70’s, when professor Asher published a book entitled ''Learning Another Language through Actions'', many of Asher’s ideas have a lot in common with those advocated in the late 19th and early 20th century by [[W. H. D. Rouse]], known for his Natural or [[Direct method (education)|Direct Method]].

Within the Polis Method, TPR appears by the very first class and it is present in every step of the learning process. In the first session the student is only required to react physically to a series of commands given by the instructor, and no verbal interaction is expected to take place. More advanced students, however, are asked to describe their actions as they are performed, to verbally anticipate actions or to describe what they have just seen. Though TPR activities tend to decrease as the course progresses, it has been proved quite fruitful even in the most advanced stages, when students face some particularly complex structures, such as the genitive absolute in Greek or the ''accusativus cum infinitivo.''

==== Storytelling ====
Storytelling is a technique created in the 90’s by Spanish teacher Blaine Ray, inspired by [[Stephen Krashen|Steven Krashen]]’s theory on foreign language acquisition and its emphasis on the role of  "comprehensible input" in a student’s mastering of elocution (output). According to Krashen, it is essential that students are exposed to sentences whose meaning they can fully grasp, a feature that requires a strict control of how and when new words and structures are presented, in order to limit new words to a small percentage of the whole message.

In order to provide students with a teaching environment where "comprehensible input" could take place, Blaine Ray developed a series of stories or narrations in which students can be actively engaged. Throughout the narration, the students are presented with messages that correspond to their linguistic level, allowing the introduction of new vocabulary.

Adapting the practice of storytelling, the Polis Method completely excludes translations and explanations in any language other than the one being taught. Another development of the Polis Method consists of often asking students to respond in a complete sentence rather than only by single words, encouraging them to internalize speaking skills.

==== Story building ====
The Story Building technique was first developed by Greg Thomson (University of Alberta) in 2007 within the ''Growing Participator Approach'' (GPA) method. His theory rests on the presentation of images in vignettes which, with each successive image, form a consistent story. Students are then invited to describe the images presented by employing the vocabulary they know. This exercise reinforces retention and permits the insertion of new grammatical structures tied to the images and vocabulary.

Within the Polis method, the Story building technique is often used to practice the switch from present to past tense.

==== Images and props ====
Since human memory is largely dependent on sensorial experience, the use of images and props is a very effective tool to present new vocabulary, enabling students to directly associate a new word with a sensorial experience.

==== Conversation in pairs or small groups ====
Conversations between students in class is a common feature in modern language teaching, applied, through the Polis method, to the teaching of ancient languages. This interaction is a very effective tool, in more advanced classes, for as the student practices producing speech he or she progresses in language acquisition. Guided conversations may engage from two to five students at a time and are carefully designed to maximize each student’s speaking time and minimize error.

==== Other activities and techniques ====
Since activities requiring the language as its sole vehicle can help a great deal in creating a more natural immersive experience, students are encouraged to attend extra-class activities such as the full immersion lunches, where students and teachers dine together while speaking exclusively in the target language.

Songs are also another feature that helps Polis students retain vocabulary and grammar. During the first year of ancient Greek course, for example, some ten songs are taught.

== Academic Programs ==

=== M.A in Ancient Philology ===
The M.A in Ancient Philology is a two-year program dedicated to Ancient Greek and Biblical Hebrew, with an optional track, '''Emphasis in Teaching Ancient Languages,''' focused on the particularities of teaching ancient languages in an immersive setting.

=== M.A. in Near Eastern Languages ===
This program encompasses courses in Modern Hebrew and Arabic, with Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic, and Syriac as electives.

=== One-year Programs ===
Each MA program has a corresponding abridged version called the One Year Program (OYP).

=== Greek Fluency Program ===
This is a two-year academic program focused solely on ancient Greek.

=== Summer programs ===
During summer, Polis offers many intensive language courses, both in Jerusalem and abroad.

=== Language Courses ===
It holds regular language courses in '''''Koine Greek''''', '''''Biblical Hebrew''''', '''''Modern Hebrew''''' (Ulpan), '''''Latin''''', '''''Modern Standard Arabic''''', '''''Spoken Arabic''''' (Palestinian dialect), '''''Classical Syriac''''' and '''''Sumerian'''''.

== Conferences ==
The Institute hosts international conferences on various topics in the field of Humanities.

Three annual conferences have been held so far:

2016 – The Cours de Linguistique Générale revisited: 1916-2016

2015 – The Library of Alexandria

2013 – The Origins of the Alphabet

==Urban Context==
The [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Musrara neighbourhood]], formerly a place of [[Social conflict|social]] and [[ethnic conflicts]], is experiencing today a remarkable renewal: artists, intellectuals, international [[Volunteering|volunteers]] and workers are moving to the neighbourhood, which is becoming peaceful and multicultural. Together with other cultural institutions, such as the Art school Musrara, the School for Arabic music and the "On the Seam" Museum, Polis contributes to the rebuilding of the neighbourhood's image. The central location of the quarter, at the crossroad of several different cultures, as well as its history and its [[picturesque]]ness, make it one of the most popular for Tourism . The Institute is located near several important research centers in Humanities, such as the [[École Biblique|EBAF]], the [[Swedish Theological Institute]] and the [[Mount Scopus]] campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]], as well as to important monuments of [[Jerusalem]]: the [[Dome of the Rock]], the [[Jerusalem City Hall|City Hall]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]].

'''Political science''' is a [[social science]] which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of [[politics|political]] activities, political thoughts, and political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/political-science%20Oxford%20Dictionary:%20political%20science Oxford Dictionary: political science]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and resources. Political scientists "see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/political-science/ Political Science]. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (22 February 1999). Retrieved on 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science -- occasionally called politicology -- comprises numerous subfields, including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], [[international relations]], [[political theory]], [[public administration]], [[public policy]], and [[political methodology]].  Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of [[economics]], [[Legal education|law]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[geography]], [[psychology]]/[[psychiatry]], and [[anthropology]].

Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of [[constitutions]], political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. [[International relations]] deals with the interaction between [[nation-state]]s as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in [[social research]]. Approaches include [[positivism]], [[Verstehen|interpretivism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[behaviouralism]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], and pluralism. Political science, as one of the [[social science]]s, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], [[case studies]], experimental research, and model building.

==Overview==
Political scientists study matters concerning the allocation and transfer of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in [[decision making]], the roles and systems of governance including [[governments]] and [[international organizations]], political behaviour and [[public policies]]. They measure the success of [[governance]] and specific policies by examining many factors, including [[Economic stability|stability]], [[justice]], [[material wealth]],  [[peace]] and [[public health]]. Some political scientists seek to advance [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] (attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) theses by analysing politics. Others advance [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] theses, by making specific policy recommendations.

Political scientists provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the [[Constituency|electorate]] analyse issues. According to Chaturvedy,
{{quote|Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties or as civil servants. They may be involved with [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to [[corporation]]s. Private enterprises such as [[think tank]]s, research institutes, polling and [[public relations]] firms often employ political scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaturvedy|first1=J. C.|title=Political Governance: Political theory|publisher=Isha Books|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzV4V59udu8C&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=28 October 2014|isbn=9788182053175|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, political scientists known as "[[American politics (political science)|Americanists]]" look at a variety of data including [[United States Constitution|constitutional development]], [[elections]], [[public opinion]], and [[public policy]] such as [[Social Security reform]], [[foreign policy]], [[US Congress]]ional committees, and the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]&amp;nbsp;— to name only a few issues.

Because political science is essentially a study of [[human behaviour]], in all aspects of [[politics]], observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though [[experiment]]al methods are increasingly common (see [[experimental political science]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Druckman|editor1-first=James|editor2-first=Donald|editor2-last=Green|editor3-first=James|editor3-last=Kuklinski|editor4-first=Arthur|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Lupia|year=2011|title=Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-17455-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing this difficulty, former [[American Political Science Association]] President [[Lawrence Lowell]] once said "We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science."&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. 1910. "The Physiology of Politics." ''American Political Science Review'' 4: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.

Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in [[biology]] or inanimate objects as in [[physics]]. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. In fact, the designation "political scientist" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|title=How to Become a Political Scientist|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/political-scientists.htm#tab-4|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena.  To date, the &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/apsr|title=American Political Science Association &gt; PUBLICATIONS &gt; About APSA Journals &gt; American Political Science Review|website=www.apsanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;American Political Science Review is the leading journal in Political Science research. 

===Behavioural revolution and new institutionalism===

In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioural revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behaviour swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behaviour, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioural political science, including work by [[Robert Dahl]], [[Philip Converse]], and in the collaboration between sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and public opinion scholar [[Bernard Berelson]].

The late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive, [[game theory|game theoretic]] formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behaviour, such as voting. [[William H. Riker]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of Rochester]] were the main proponents of this shift.

Despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Quaile Hill, "In Search of General Theory," Journal of Politics 74(October 2012), 917-931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anticipating of crises===

The theory of political transitions,&lt;ref&gt;Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677820 "A theory of political transitions."] American Economic Review. 2001 Sep 1:938-963.&lt;/ref&gt; and the methods of their analysis and anticipating of crises,&lt;ref&gt;McClelland C.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600146 "The Anticipation of International Crises: Prospects for Theory and Research."] International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 1, Special Issue on International Crisis:Progress and Prospects for Applied Forecasting and Management (March 1977), pp. 15-38&lt;/ref&gt; form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M., Carpenter S.R., Lenton T.M., Bascompte J., Brock W., Dakos V., Van De Koppel J., Van De Leemput I.A., Levin S.A., Van Nes E.H., Pascual M. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/344 "Anticipating critical transitions."] Science. 2012 Oct 19;338(6105):344-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, a statistical indicator of crisis, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]] in large groups, was proposed for crises anticipation and successfully used in various areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T. A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuran T. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025019 "Sparks and prairie fires: A theory of unanticipated political revolution."] Public Choice, Vol. 61, No. 1 (April 1989), pp. 41–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science in the Soviet Union===
In the [[Soviet Union]], political studies were carried out under the guise of some other disciplines like theory of state and [[law]], [[area studies]], [[international relations]], studies of labor movement, "critique of bourgeois theories", etc. Soviet scholars were represented at the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA) since 1955 (since 1960 by the Soviet Association of Political and State Studies).

In 1979, the 11th World Congress of IPSA took place in [[Moscow]]. Until the late years of the Soviet Union, political science as a field was subjected to tight control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was thus subjected to distrust. Anti-communists accused political scientists of being "false" scientists and of having served the old regime.&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;Political Science in Russia: Institutionalization of the Discipline and Development of the Professional Community&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Soviet Union, two of the major institutions dealing with political science, the Institute of Contemporary Social Theories and the Institute of International Affairs, were disbanded, and most of their members were left without jobs. These institutes were victims of the first wave of [[anticommunist]] opinion and ideological attacks. Today, the Russian Political Science Association unites professional political scientists from all around Russia.

===Recent developments===
In 2000, the [[Perestroika Movement]] in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veelUVVHg8MC|title=Perestroika!: The Raucous Rebellion in Political Science|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300130201|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic [[cognitive bias]]es of current politics.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. "The evolutionary psychology of mass politics".

==Political science education==

Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, "as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name=Stoner&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoner |first=J. R. |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |title=Political Science and Political Education |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the APSA Teaching and Learning Conference ([[American Political Science Association|APSA]]), San Jose Marriott, [[San Jose, California]] |date=22 February 2008 |quote=... although one might allege the same for social science as a whole, political scientists receive funding from and play an active role in both the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [in the United States]. |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130234044/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |archivedate=30 November 2009 }} &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p245585_index.html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate [[College of Arts and Sciences|School
 or College of Arts and Sciences]] per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of Humanities or [[Liberal Arts]].&lt;ref name=Marist&gt;See, e.g., the department of [http://www.marist.edu/liberalarts/polsci/ Political Science] at [[Marist College]], part of a Division of Humanities before that division became the School of Liberal Arts (c. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas classical [[political philosophy]] is primarily defined by a concern for [[Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for "[[modernity]]" and the contemporary [[nation state]], along with the study of classical thought, and as such share a greater deal of terminology with [[sociologists]] (e.g. [[structure and agency]]).

Most [[United States]] [[Higher education in the United States|colleges and universities]] offer B.A. programs in political science. M.A. or M.A.T. and Ph.D. or Ed.D. programs are common at larger universities. The term ''political science'' is more popular in [[North America]] than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of ''political studies,'' ''politics,'' or ''government.'' While ''political science'' implies use of the [[scientific method]], ''political studies'' implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' is the term used to refer to this field by [[Brandeis University]]; [[Cornell College]]; [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; [[Hendrix College]]; [[Lake Forest College]]; [[Monash University]]; [[Mount Holyoke College]]; [[New York University]]; [[Occidental College]]; [[Princeton University]]; [[Ursinus College]]; [[Washington and Lee University]]; and [[Zeppelin University]]. ''Government'' is the term used for this field by [[Bowdoin College]]; [[Colby College]]; [[Cornell University]]; [[Dartmouth College]]; [[Georgetown University]]; [[Harvard University]]; [[Smith College]]; [[Wesleyan University]]; the [[College of William and Mary]]; the [[University of Sydney]]; the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; the [[University of Ulster]]; the [[University of Essex]]; [[Victoria University of Wellington]], which has both a "School of Government" and a separate "Political Science and International Relations Programme"; and the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. ''Politics and government'' is the term used by the [[University of Puget Sound]]. ''Government and politics'' is used by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;/ref&gt; Separate degree granting programs in international relations and [[public policy]] are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Master's level programs in political science are common when political scientists engage in [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vernardakis |first=George |title=Graduate education in government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd3DDiQm3M8C&amp;pg=PA77 |page=77 |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-1171-8 |quote=...existing practices at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is [[Pi Sigma Alpha]].

===Cognate fields===
Most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:
* [[Comparative politics]], including [[area studies]]
* [[International relations]]
* [[Political philosophy]] or political theory
* [[Public administration]]
* [[Public law]]

Some political science departments also classify [[methodology]] as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. In the United States, [[American political science|American politics]] is often treated as a separate subfield.

In contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, [[Theories of political behavior|political behaviour]] (including [[public opinion]], [[collective action]], and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]), and political institutions (including [[legislature]]s and [[international organization]]s). Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categories. The American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/content_4596.cfm APSA Organized Sections | APSA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Add sections here on each subfield --&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of political science}}

As a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. At that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]] which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. The term "political science" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.

'''Project Neptune'''  is a water distribution project in the United Kingdom with the goal of establishing an optimized and more sustainable system for water distribution. The project was officially announced in April 2007, and received a budget of £2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-csd.eng.cam.ac.uk/themes0/water-1/project-neptune-delivering-sustainable-water-systems-by-optimising-existing-infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, water service providers (WSPs) are legally obligated to provide drinking water to all of their customers. The difficulty in optimizing this service involves the minimum water pressure and flow standards, as well as the strict regulations regarding water quality. The innovative technologies required to support the goal of Project Neptune are either partially evolved with no proven reliability or do not exist yet. The Centre for Sustainable Development at the [[University of Cambridge]] is heading the work on integrating [[artificial intelligence]] and mathematical simulation technologies to create an efficient online reporting and analyzing system for monitoring performance of the water distribution system.

== Research priority areas ==
In order to address the technological deficiencies of the project, research priority areas (RPA) have been identified by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The RPA three key concentrations include “data and knowledge management, pressure management (including energy management), and the associated complex decision support systems on which to base interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savic D. A.|last2=Boxall J. B.|last3=Ulanicki B.|last4=Kapelan Z.|last5=Makropoulos C.|last6=Fenner R.|last7=Soga K.|last8=Marshall I. W.|last9=Maksimovic C.|title=Project Neptune: Improved Operation of Water Distribution Networks|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/41024(340)47|journal=Water Distribution Systems Analysis 2008|series=Proceedings|doi=10.1061/41024(340)47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific objectives of the RPA are focused on developing communication networks, sustainable technologies, real time information feedback system, and optimal operations. The function of the communication network is to evaluate the performance and reliability of already implemented hardware and sensors for collecting faraway data. In order to achieve a reduction in energy usage, sustainable technologies that develop innovative energy harvesting technology and reduce the necessity for constant battery replacement are necessary for the project. Real time information relates to acquiring knowledge related to performance of the water distribution system. Optimal operations can be achieved through improvement in understanding and analyzing relevant data, which includes online models of hydraulics. The first round of RPA work is contributing to the initiative headed by Yorkshire Water Services to install the first prototypes of Ground Penetrating Radar Systems (GPRS). The Yorkshire initiative aims to install around 490 prototypes that are connected to sensors that collect pressure and flow data on a half hourly basis.

== Development goals ==
Project Neptune’s academic and industrial partners aim to address the tasks of developing: energy saving options, online simulation model to provide an overlook of a full day’s water distribution patterns, system to mitigate and manage leakage, automate system adjustments, power harvesting methods, and optimized system for reacting to incidents.

Staff involved in the system controls department of the project have the burden of handling large amounts of data received. The Decision Support System (DSS) was developed in order to alleviate this burden and aid the staff in decision making, prioritizing urgent incidents, and identifying faulty alarms. The DSS functions to combine these strategy and decision making outputs into one single and comprehensive presentation of data for the operator.

== Partners and funding ==
The project today receives funding from the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in order to further advance understanding and contribute knowledge about optimal and efficient water supply systems. Industrial funding is also provided for the project, the main contributors include the United Utilities and Yorkshire Water Services. University of Exeter in the UK carries out research for the project in collaboration with seven other research universities located in the UK, including University of Cambridge, the University of Sheffield, Imperial College London, De Montfort University, Lancaster University, University of Leicester, and University of Sheffield.

'''Protoscholastic writing''' re-introduced [[Space (punctuation)|space]] between words into the punctuation of western languages. It replaced [[Liturgy|liturgical]] models starting in the 7th century and by the 14th century it was the standard. The protoscholastic mode of writing was primarily introduced for faster decoding of written texts for scholars, rather than for oral communication (the focus of liturgical models).&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, Paul Henry.

'''Roberto Mangabeira Unger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ŋ|g|ər}}; born 24 March 1947) is a philosopher and politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/73226246-48a7-11e4-9d04-00144feab7de.html#axzz3FNipfHzi|title=Lunch with the FT: Roberto Mangabeira Unger|last=Rathbone|first=John Paul|date=3 October 2014|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written notable works including [[Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory|''Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory'']] and [[The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time|''The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time'']]. He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, and political, and economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What next for the left?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2013/12/roberto-unger-social-democracy|newspaper=The Economist|date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s-1990s while at Harvard Law School as part of the [[Critical Legal Studies]] movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools and led to the writing of [[What Should Legal Analysis Become%3F]]&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Jeremy. "Dirty Little Secret", ''Columbia Law Review 98'', 1 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; His political activity helped the transition to [[History of Brazil|democracy in Brazil]] in the aftermath of the [[Brazilian military government|military regime]], and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015.&lt;ref name=Keliher&gt;{{cite news|last=Keliher|first=Macabe|title=A Vision and a Program for the American Left|url=http://www.possible-futures.org/2012/07/02/vision-program-american-left-conversation-roberto-mangabeira-unger-situation-task-remaking-democratic-party|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Perry, "Roberto Unger and the Politics of Empowerment", ''New Left Review'' 173 (February 1989).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2015/02/1584788-dilma-faz-primeira-troca-de-comando-ministerial-em-seu-segundo-governo.shtml|title=Dilma faz primeira troca de comando ministerial em seu segundo governo|last=Haubert|first=Mariana|date=3 February 2015|work=Folha de São Paulo|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His late work in economics culminates in his characterization and program toward The Knowledge Economy. His work is seen to offer a vision of humanity and a program to empower individuals and change institutions.&lt;ref name="Lee Smolin 2007"&gt;Smolin, Lee. "No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements", ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neu, Jerome.

At the core of his philosophy is a view of humanity as greater than the contexts in which it is placed. He sees each individual possessed with the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is the conviction that the world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural or necessary social, political, or economic arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, [[wage labor]]—for Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to what works for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation.&lt;ref name="Keliher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critique and construction: a symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics|last=Lovin|first=Robin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-35208-8|location=Cambridge|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Making the friendly world behave|last=Connolly|first=William|date=February 7, 1988|work=New York Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger has long been active in Brazilian opposition politics. He was one of the founding members of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] and drafted its manifesto.&lt;ref name=journalism&gt;Simon, William H. "Social Theory and Political Practice: Unger's Brazilian Journalism", ''Northwestern University Law Review 81'' (1986-87): p. 312.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the presidential campaigns of [[Leonel Brizola]] and [[Ciro Gomes]], ran for the Chamber of Deputies, and twice launched exploratory bids for the Brazilian presidency. He served as the Minister of Strategic Affairs in the second [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] administration and the beginning of the second Dilma administration. Unger is also the subject of the feature documentary Visions for the Future directed by [[Robert Rippberger]] chronicling his work in Brazil in the Amazonian state of [[Rondônia]] putting theory into practice.&lt;ref name="Visions for the Future"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rippberger|first=Robert|title=Visions for the Future|url=https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Visions_for_the_Future_Roberto_Mangabeira_Unger?id=La0B0YmULiI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family===
Unger's maternal grandfather was [[Otávio Mangabeira|Octávio Mangabeira]], who served as Brazil's minister of foreign affairs in the late 1920s before the dictatorship of [[Getúlio Vargas]] subjected him to a series of imprisonments and exiles in Europe and the United States. After returning to Brazil in 1945, he co-founded a center-left party. He was elected as a representative in the Câmara Federal in 1946, governor of Bahia in 1947, and Senator in 1958.&lt;ref name=bal&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Octavio Mangabeira|url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.academia.org.br/abl/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm%3Finfoid%3D343%26sid%3D243&amp;usg=ALkJrhjx0OP3AoQJXNm_3PqTMhHxqzJJYg|publisher=Brazilian Academy of Letters|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of Unger's parents were intellectuals. His [[Germans|German]]-born father, Artur Unger, from [[Dresden]], arrived in the United States as a child and later became a U.S. citizen. His mother, Edyla Mangabeira, was a Brazilian poet and journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edyla Mangabeira Unger profile|url=http://www.allaboutarts.com.br/default.aspx?PageCode=12&amp;PageGrid=Bio&amp;item=0804L4|work=AllAboutArts|publisher=allaboutarts.com.br|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artur and Edyla met in the US during the exile of Octávio Mangabeira.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romano|first=Carlin|title=Harvard Law's Roberto Unger takes on the future of Brazil|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=6 June 2008|volume=54|issue=39|page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
Roberto Mangabeira Unger was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1947, and spent his childhood on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]]. He attended the private [[Allen-Stevenson School]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; When he was eleven, his father died and his mother moved the family back to Brazil. He attended a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school and went on to law school at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt;

Unger was admitted to [[Harvard Law School]] in September 1969. After receiving his LLM, Unger stayed at Harvard another year on a fellowship, and then entered the doctoral program. At 23 years old, Unger began teaching jurisprudence, among other things, to first year students.&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt; In 1976, aged 29, he got SJD and became one of the youngest faculty members to receive [[tenure]] from the [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guggenheim Gives Fellowships for '76 Unger Gets Tenure, Too|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/4/5/guggenheim-gives-fellowships-for-76-pa|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=The Harvard Crimson|date=5 April 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career===
The beginning of Unger's academic career began with the books ''[[Knowledge and Politics]]'' and  ''[[Law In Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory|Law in Modern Society]]'', published in 1975 and 1976 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1975). ''Knowledge and Politics''. New York: Free Press.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1976). ''[[Law In Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory]].'' New York: Free Press.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These works led to the co-founding of [[Critical Legal Studies]] (CLS) with [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]] and [[Morton Horwitz]]. The movement stirred up controversy in legal schools across America as it challenged standard legal scholarship and made radical proposals for legal education. By the early 1980s, the CLS movement touched off a heated internal debate at Harvard, pitting the CLS scholars against the older, more traditional scholars.&lt;ref name="franca"&gt;{{cite web|last=Press|first=Eyal|title=The Passion of Roberto Unger|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9903/unger.html|publisher=Lingua Franca|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt;

Throughout much of the 1980s, Unger worked on his magnum opus, ''[[Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory]]'', a three volume work that assessed classical [[social theory]] and developed a political, social, and economic alternative. The series is based on the premise of society as an artifact, and rejects the necessity of certain institutional arrangements. Published in 1987, ''Politics'' was foremost a critique of contemporary social theory and politics; it developed a theory of structural and ideological change, and gave an alternative account of world history. By first attacking the idea that there is a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another, e.g. [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]], it then built an [[false necessity|anti-necessitarian theory of social change]], theorizing the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another.

Unger devoted much of the following decades to further elaborating on the insights developed in ''Politics'' by working out the political and social alternatives. ''[[What Should Legal Analysis Become?]]'' (Verso, 1996) developed tools to reimagine the organization of social life. ''[[Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative]]'' (Verso, 1998) and ''[[The Left Alternative|What Should the Left Propose?]]'' (Verso, 2005) put forth alternative institutional proposals.

===Intellectual influences===
Unger's model of philosophical practice is closest to those philosophers who sought to form a view of the whole of reality, and to do so by using and resisting the specialized knowledge of their time.&lt;ref name="Robin/Perry 1990"&gt;Robin W. Lovin and Michael J. Perry (eds.), ''Critique and Construction: A Symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been read as a form of pragmatism, but also as an attempt to disengage ideas and experiences that developed in the West under the influence of Christianity from the categories of [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements", ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His thought has been called the inverse of [[Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy, affirming the supreme value of life and the reality and depth of the self and eschewing fecklessness.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. "Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion", ''Harvard Law Review 98'', no. 5 (1 March 1985): pp. 1066–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social theory===
Unger's social theory is premised on the idea of classical social theory that society is an artifact and can be created and recreated.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Yack, "Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation," Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas previous thinkers such as Hegel or Marx backslid at some point and held onto the notion that there was a necessary institutional or historical social development, Unger, in the words of one critic, seeks to "take the idea to the hilt and produce a theory of emancipation that will escape the limitations of liberal and Marxist theories." That limitation is the search for an ideal structure of society that can be foreseen and centrally planned; whereas the emancipation leads to societies with greater institutional flexibility and variation.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Yack, "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation," Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Unger, society emerges not through compromise or the winnowing down of best options, but rather though conflict and struggle for control of political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the terms of social interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order Unger calls [[formative context]]. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come to believe and act as if their social words were coherent wholes that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They come to see the existing arrangements as necessary. Unger calls this [[false necessity]]. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition Unger calls [[negative capability]].&lt;ref name="Frank Blackler 1992"&gt;Frank Blackler, "Formative Contexts and Activity System: Postmodern Approaches to the Management of China," in Rethinking Organization: New Directions in Organization Theory and Analysis, ed. M. I. Reed and Michael Hughes (London ; Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1992), 273–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads Unger to the conclusion that change happens piecemeal through struggle and vision, rather than suddenly in revolutionary upheaval with the replacement of one set of institutional arrangements with another. Unger theorizes that cumulative change can alter formative contexts, and he goes on to propose a number of such changes as institutional alternatives to be implemented, which he calls [[Empowered democracy]].&lt;ref name="Frank Blackler 1992"/&gt;

Empowered democracy is Unger's vision of a more open and more plastic set of social institutions through which individuals and groups can interact, propose change, and effectively empower themselves to transform social, economic, and political structures. Unger's strategy in its realization is to combine freedom of commerce and governance at the local level with the ability of political parties at the central government level to promote radical social experiments that would bring about decisive change in social and political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Anderson, "Roberto Unger and the Politics of Empowerment," New Left Review 173 (February 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the theory would involve radical developments in politics at the center, as well as social innovation in localities. At the center, by bestowing wide ranging revising powers to those in office, it would give political parties the ability to try out concrete yet profound solutions and proposals. It would turn partisan conflicts over control and uses of governmental power into an opportunity to question and revise the basic arrangements of social life through a rapid resolution of political impasse. In local communities, empowered democracy would make capital and technology available through rotating capital funds, which would encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Citizens' rights include individual entitlements to economic and civic security, conditional and temporary group claims to portions of social capital, and destabilization rights, which would empower individuals or groups to disrupt organizations and practices marred by routines of subjugation that normal politics have failed to disrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Robin W. Lovin and Michael J. Perry, eds., Critique and Construction : A Symposium on Roberto Unger's Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger's ideas developed in a context where young intellectuals and radicals attempted to reconcile the conventional theories of society and law being taught in university classrooms with the reality of social protest and revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Disillusioned with Marxism, they turned to thinkers like Levi-Strauss, Gramsci, Habermas, and Foucault in attempt to situate understandings of law and society as a benign science of technocratic policy within a broader system of beliefs that legitimized the prevailing social order.&lt;ref name="Frank Blackler 1992"/&gt; Unlike Habermas, however, who formulates procedures for attaining rational consensus, Unger locates resolution in institutions and their arrangements that remain perpetually open to revision and reconstruction. And, unlike Foucault, who also emphasizes the constructed character of social life, Unger takes this as an opportunity to reimagine institutions and social conditions that will unleash human creativity and enable liberation.&lt;ref&gt;William Connolly, "Making the Friendly World Behave," The New York Times, February 7, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal thought===
Unger's work on law has sought to denaturalize the concept of law and how it is represented through particular institutions.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; He begins by inquiring into why modern societies have legal systems with distinctions between institutions, such as legislature and court, as well as a special caste of lawyers possessing a method of reasoning about social problems. Whereas thinkers such as [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Max Weber|Weber]] had argued that such legal arrangements were a product of economic necessity to secure [[property rights (economics)|property rights]] and the autonomy of the individual, Unger shows that this liberal legal order emerged in Europe as a result of the indeterminate relations between monarchy, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie. It took the particular form that it did by emerging out of the long tradition of [[natural law]] and universality, rather than of necessity.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Hugh|title=Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement|journal=Journal of Law and Society|year=1987|page=388|doi=10.2307/1410255|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This early work in historical analysis of law and legal thought laid the basis for Unger's contribution to the [[Critical Legal Studies|Critical Legal Studies movement]].&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; The movement itself was born in the late 1970s among young legal scholars at [[Harvard Law School]] who denounced the theoretical underpinnings of American jurisprudence, [[legal realism]]. The participants were committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality without the hidden interests and class domination of legal institutions. Two tendencies of the movement developed, one, a radical indeterminacy that criticized law as meaning anything we want it to mean, and the other, a neo-Marxist critique that attacked legal thought as an institutional form of capitalism. Unger offered a third tendency, a constructive vision of rethinking rights based on individual emancipation and empowerment, and structural arrangements that would lend themselves to constant revision with the goal of creating more educational and economic opportunities for more people. He laid this out in ''[[The Critical Legal Studies Movement (book)|The Critical Legal Studies Movement]]'', which quickly earned him a following as the philosophical mentor and prophet of the movement.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Allan C., and Patrick J.

===Economic thought===
At the center of Unger's thought about the economy is the commitment to reimagining and remaking the institutional arrangements of how humans produce and exchange. For Unger, economic institutions have no inherent or natural forms, and he rejects the necessitarian tendencies of classical and neo-classical economists, seeking instead alternatives to the arrangements of contemporary societies. In his writings, he has aimed to revise ideas on the importance of market economies and the division of labor in the workplace and national and global economies.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Moyn, "The Politics of Economy," Ethics &amp; International Affairs 16, no. 2 (2002): 135-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critique of economics====
Unger's critique of economics begins with the identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger's analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and as a means to escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, [[marginalism|marginalist economics]] arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.&lt;ref name="Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (1987), ''Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task'', New York: Verso, pp. 120–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger's critique of Marginalism begins with [[Léon Walras|Walras']] equilibrium theory, which attempted to achieve a certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.&lt;ref name="Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task"/&gt;
 
The consequences of the marginalist movement were profound for the study of economics, Unger says. The most immediate problem is that under this generalizing tendency of economics, there is no means by which to incorporate [[empirical evidence]] and thus to re-imagine the world and develop new theories and new directions. In this way, the discipline is always self-referential and theoretical. Furthermore, the lack of a normative view of the world curtails the ability to propose anything more than a policy prescription, which by definition always assumes a given context. The discipline can only rationalize the world and support a status quo. Lastly, Unger finds that this turn in economics ended up universalizing debates in macroeconomics and leaving the discipline without any historical perspective. A consequence, for example, was that Keynes' solution to a particular historical crisis was turned into a general theory when it should only be understood as a response to a particular situation.&lt;ref name="Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task"/&gt;

====Reorientating economics====
Unger's vision of economics is that it cannot be unhinged from ideas about the individual and social life. Human activity and political organization must be incorporated into any analysis of trade and economies. In remaking the discipline, he calls for a return to the normative practice of classical economics but stripped of its necessitarian assumptions and typological references. The development of explanatory claims and prescriptive ideas are necessary. The discipline must connect the transformation of nature with that of society—the making of things with the reorganization of people.&lt;ref name="freetradereimagined"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), ''Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 2-8, 214-22.&lt;!-- ISSN or ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics]]'', he sets forth six ideas to begin thinking about economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), ''Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 77-94.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
#The problem of specialization and discovery. Competition comes to inhibit self transformation when trading partners are unequal but not radically unequal, for both are forced into cost cutting rather than innovating and increasing efficiency.
#The problem of politics over economics. The making and implementation of policy is not one of discovery, but rather of top down implementation. Rigid state control will limit how a society can respond to tensions and crisis, and thus politics creates its own presuppositions and limits creativity and alternative solutions.
#Free trade should strengthen the capacity for self transformation by organizing the trading regime in a way that strengthens the capacity of trading partners to experiment and innovate. It becomes question not of how much free trade, but what kind. The best arrangements are those that impose the least amount of restraint.
#Alternative free trade. The market has no necessary and natural form. If the market economy can be organized in a different way then so can a universal order of free trade among market economies.
#The division of labor remade. The [[Pin Factory#Adam Smith|pin factory organization of labor]] describes the organization of work as if labor were a machine. But we can make machines to do this work. We should then innovate in those areas where we don't yet know how to make the machine to do the work. Production should be one of collective learning and permanent innovation.
#Mind against context. The mind is both a machine and an anti-machine; it is both formulaic and totalizing. Thus we never rest in any context, and we need to have arrangements that constantly lend themselves to reinvention.

====Reconstructing economic institutions====
For Unger, the economy is not only a device for wealth but also permanent innovation and discovery. It should allow the greatest freedom of the recombination of people and resources, and allow people to innovate in institutional settings. The market economy should not be single dogmatic version of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. [http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/lectures.php#pe12 "Political economy after the crisis": lecture 3], harvard.edu, 8 February 2012.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger has presented a number of general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where the idea is to support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when it may be necessary to restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira (2007), ''Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, Chapter 5.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====On the twenty-first-century economic stimulus====
Most recently, in a YouTube video titled {{YouTube|QZPJ8hltDYA|"Beyond Stimulus"}} he laid out three key policies to address the current economy:
#Change the arrangements of finance in relation to production so that finance is in the service of production. Tax and regulate to discourage finance that does not contribute to production. Use public capital for venture capital funds.
#Broaden economic opportunity by supporting small and medium enterprise. Reject government regulation and state controlled models. Support cooperation between government and firms, and cooperation and competition among firms.
#Education. A system of schools to meet needs of a vibrant and flexible economy. Vocational schools that teach general concepts and flexibility, not job-specific skills.

===="Illusions of necessity in the economic order"====
Unger's first writing on economic theory was the article "Illusions of necessity in the economic order" in the May 1978 issue of ''[[American Economic Review]]''. In the article he makes a case for the need of contemporary economic thought to imitate classical political economy in which theories of exchange should be incorporated into theories of power and perception.&lt;ref name="Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. "Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order", ''American Economic Review'' (May 1978): pp. 369-73.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The article articulates the problem of the American economy as one of the inability to realize democracy of production and community in the workplace. This failure, according to Unger, is the result of the lack of a comprehensive program that encompasses production, society, and state, so that immediate attempts to address inequality get swallowed up and appropriated by the status quo in the course of winning immediate gains for the organization or constituency, e.g. unions.&lt;ref name="Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order"/&gt;

To realize a democracy in the workplace and the abolition of wealth and poverty, Unger argues for the need to relate the program of worker community and democracy with an enlargement of democracy at the national level—the goal cannot be only one of economic production and worker's rights, but must be accompanied by a national project at the structural level. He pushes this idea further by calling not just for a restructuring of the relationship between the firm and state based on private property, but that it also has to be replaced with a new set of rights encompassing access to jobs, markets, and capital. Only as private rights are phased out can rights of decentralized decision making and market exchange be extended to workers. This needs to be accompanied by limits on the size of enterprise and how profits are used to control others' labor.&lt;ref name="Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order"/&gt;

[[Neoclassical economics]] is not up to this task because it begins with preconceived standards that it applies to explain empirical data, while leaving out that which is a theoretical anomaly; there is no causal basis of analysis, Unger says, rather everything is embedded in a timeless universal without any account for context. Furthermore, the ambiguity of concepts of maximization, efficiency, and rationalization pin the analysis to a certain notion of the behavior of the rationalizing individual, making the analysis either tautological or reduced to a set of power relations translated into the language of material exchange.&lt;ref name="Illusions of Necessity in the Economic Order"/&gt;

===Programmatic thought===
Key in Unger's thinking is the need to re-imagine social institutions before attempting to revise them. This calls for a program, or programmatic thought. In building this program, however, we must not entertain complete revolutionary overhaul, lest we be plagued by three false assumptions:
*''Typological fallacy'': the fallacy that there is closed list of institutional alternatives in history, such as "[[feudalism]]" or "[[capitalism]]". There is not a natural form of society, only the specific result of the piecemeal institutional changes, political movements, and cultural reforms (as well as the accidents and coincidences of history) that came before it.
*''Indivisibility fallacy'': most subscribers to revolutionary Leftism wrongly believe that institutional structures must stand and fall together. However, structures can be reformed piecemeal.
*''Determinism fallacy'': the fallacy that uncontrollable and little understood law-like forces drive the historical succession of institutional systems. However, there is no natural flow of history. We make ourselves and our world, and can do so in any way we choose.&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

To think about social transformation programmatically, one must first mark the direction one wants society to move in, and then identify the first steps with which we can move in that direction. In this way we can formulate proposals at points along the trajectory, be they relatively close to how things are now or relatively far away. This provides a third way between revolution and reform. It is revolutionary reform, where one has a revolutionary vision, but acts on that vision in a sequence of piecemeal reforms. As Unger puts it, transformative politics is "not about blueprints; it is about pathways. It is not architecture; it is music".&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

====The two Lefts====
Unger sees two main [[Leftist|Lefts]] in the world today, a recalcitrant Left and a humanizing Left. The recalcitrant Left seeks to slow down the march of markets and [[globalization]], and to return to a time of greater government involvement and stronger social programs. The humanizing Left (or '[[reformist Left]]') accepts the world in its present form, taking the market economy and globalization as unavoidable, and attempts to humanize their effects through [[Transfer payment|tax-and-transfer policies]].&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

Unger finds the two major orientations of contemporary [[Leftism]] inadequate and calls for a 'Reconstructive Left' – one which would insist on redirecting the course of globalization by reorganizing the market economy.&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto|title=The Left Alternative|year=2005|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-84467-370-4|pages=vii, ix, xi, xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his two books ''[[The Left Alternative]]'' and ''[[The Future of American Progressivism: An Initiative for Political and Economic Reform|The Future of American Progressivism]]'', Unger lays out a program to democratize the market economy and deepen democracy. This Reconstructive Left would look beyond debates on the appropriate size of government, and instead re-envision the relationship between government and firms in the market economy by experimenting with the coexistence of different regimes of private and social property.&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

It would be committed to social solidarity, but "would refuse to allow our moral interests in social cohesion [to] rest solely upon money transfers commanded by the state in the form of compensatory and retrospective redistribution", as is the case with federal entitlement programs. Instead, Unger's Reconstructive Left affirms "the principle that everyone should share, in some way and at some time, responsibility for taking care of other people."&lt;ref name="left vii, ix, xi, xxi"/&gt;

====The ''Left Alternative'' program====
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2015}}
Unger has laid out concrete policy proposals in areas of economic development, education, civil society, and political democracy.&lt;ref&gt;These policy points are taken from Unger, ''[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]'' (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2007), and Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, {{YouTube|id=uN7PLK6H-KU&amp;list=UUbaZ_Vc_T7tm7iZSV-mMKMg&amp;index=3|title=What Progressives Should Propose}}. September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On ''economic development'', Unger has noted that there are only two models for a national economy available to us today: the US model of business control of government, and the northeast Asian model of top down bureaucratic control of the economy. Citing the need for greater imagination on the issue, he has offered a third model that is decentralized, pluralistic, participatory, and experimental. This would take the form of an economy encouraging small business development and innovation that would create large scale self-employment and cooperation. The emphasis is not on the protection of big business as the main sectors of the economy, but the highly mobile and innovative small firm.
* Unger links the development of such an economy to an ''education system'' that encourages creativity and empowers the mind, not one that he now sees geared for a reproduction of the family and to put the individual in service of the state. He proposes that such a system should be run locally but have standards enforced through national oversight, as well as a procedure in place to intervene in the case of the failing of local systems.
* Unger's critique of and alternative to social programs goes to the heart of ''civil society''. The problem we are faced with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.
* Unger's proposal for ''political democracy'' calls for a high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of the party in power to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.

===Theoretical philosophy===
At the core of Unger's [[theoretical philosophy]] are two key conceptions: first the infinity of the individual, and secondly the singularity of the world and the reality of time. The premise behind the infinity of the individual is that we exist within social contexts but we are more than the roles that these contexts may define for us—we can overcome them. In Unger's terms, we are both "context-bound and context-transcending; "we appear as "the embodied spirit;" as "the infinite imprisoned within the finite."&lt;ref name="David M. Trubek 1989"&gt;David M. Trubek, "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought," American Journal of Sociology 95, no. 2 (1989): 448.&lt;/ref&gt; For Unger, there is no natural state of the individual and his social being. Rather, we are infinite in spirit and unbound in what we can become. As such, no social institution or convention can contain us. While institutions do exist and shape our beings and our interactions, we can change both their structure and the extent to which they imprison us.&lt;ref name="David M. Trubek 1989"/&gt;

The philosophy of the singularity of the world and the reality of time establishes history as the site of decisive action through the propositions that there is only one real world, not multiple or simultaneous universes, and that time really exists in the world, not as a simulacrum through which we must experience the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lee Smolin, "No Eternal Truths, Just Divine Advancements," Times Higher Education Supplement, August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two concepts of infinity and reality lie at the heart of Unger's program calling for metaphysical and institutional revolutions. From the concept of the self as infinite but constrained, Unger argues that we must continually transform our environment to better express ourselves. This can only be done in a singular world within which time is real.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====The self and human nature====
{{Main|Passion: An Essay on Personality}}
In ''Passion: An Essay on Personality'', Unger explores the individual and his relation to society from the perspective of the root human predicament of the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context. Unger's aim is to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking about the human and society.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Neu, "Looking All around for Our Real Selves," New York Times Book Review, July 8, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religion and the human condition====
Unger has written and spoken extensively on [[religion]] and the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="tanner 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The future of religion|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/philosophy.php#7|newspaper=Tanner Lectures|year=2009|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tanner 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The religion of the future|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/philosophy.php#7|newspaper=Tanner Lectures|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unger 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Beyond Nihilism |date=6 June 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDl4_fK3G58&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLNdEBvVYMvsDw5FdQ6N9GGEvIwjnNZuiC |website=YouTube |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion, Unger argues, is a vision of the world within which we anchor our orientation to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence.&lt;ref name="tanner 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nihilism 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDl4_fK3G58&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLNdEBvVYMvsDw5FdQ6N9GGEvIwjnNZuiC |title=Beyond Nihilism |date=6 June 2011 |at=part 1|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira |website=YouTube |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.&lt;ref name="tanner 2"/&gt;

Unger sees four flaws in the human condition. They are, our ''mortality'' and the facing of imminent death; our ''groundlessness'' in that we are unable to grasp the solution to the enigma of existence, see the beginning or end of time, nor put off the discovery of the meaning of life; our ''insatiability'' in that we always want more, and demand the infinite from the finite; and our ''susceptibility to belittlement'' which places us in a position to constantly confront petty routine forcing us to die many little deaths.&lt;ref name="tanner 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Beyond Nihilism |date=6 June 2011 |at=part 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA9SwXdj3fA&amp;list=PLNdEBvVYMvsDw5FdQ6N9GGEvIwjnNZuiC&amp;index=2 |website=YouTube |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major responses in the history of human thought to these flaws: escape, humanization, and confrontation.&lt;ref name="tanner 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Beyond Nihilism |date=6 June 2011 |at=parts 3-6 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUEiyHORu1s&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLNdEBvVYMvsDw5FdQ6N9GGEvIwjnNZuiC |website=YouTube |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The ''overcoming of the world'' denies the phenomenal world and its distinctions, including the individual. It proclaims a benevolence towards others and an indifference to suffering and change. One achieves serenity by becoming invulnerable to suffering and change. The religion of [[Buddhism]] and philosophical thought of [[Plato]] and [[Schopenhauer]] best represent this orientation.
* The ''humanization of the world'' creates meaning out of social interactions in a meaningless world by placing all emphasis on our reciprocal responsibility to one another. [[Confucianism]] and contemporary liberalism represent this strand of thought, both of which aim to soften the cruelties of the world.
* The ''struggle with the world'' is framed by the idea that series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine and give us a larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the moral of the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.

====The religion of the future====
The spiritual orientation of the struggle with the world has given rise to the secular movements of emancipation in the modern world, and it is here that Unger sees the religion of the future. The problem Unger sees, however, is that as an established religion, this orientation has betrayed its ideological underpinnings and has made peace with existing order. It has accepted the hierarchies of class structure in society, accepted the transfer of money as serving as the basis of solidarity, and reaffirmed the basis of existing political, economic, and social institutions by investing in a conservative position of their preservation. Thus, "to be faithful to what made this orientation persuasive and powerful in the first place, we must radicalize it against both established institutions and dominant beliefs."&lt;ref name="tanner 1"/&gt;

Unger's call is for a revolution in our religious beliefs that encompasses both individual transformation and institutional reorganization; to create change in the life of the individual as well as in the organization of society. The first part of the program of individual transformation means waking from the dazed state in which we live our lives, and recognizing our mortality and groundlessness without turning to the feel good theologies and philosophies. The second part of the program of social transformation means supplementing the metaphysical revolution with institutional practices by creating social institutions that allow us to constantly overthrow our constraints and our context, and to make this overthrow not a one time event but a continuing process. This is the program of [[empowered democracy]] that calls for reforms in the market economy, education, politics, and civil society. "The goal is not to humanize society but to divinize humanity." It is "to raise ordinary life to a higher level of intensity and capability."&lt;ref name="tanner 2"/&gt;

===Natural philosophy===
Unger's philosophy of [[space and time]] argues for the singularity of the world and the reality of time. His arguments are grounded in the tradition of [[natural philosophy]]. He takes on the Newtonian idea of the independent observer standing outside of time and space, addresses the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume]], rejects the position of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and attacks speculations about [[many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]] of contemporary [[cosmology]].&lt;ref name="cosmology"&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangbareira|title=Laws and Time in Cosmology|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/video.php#3|accessdate=30 November 2011|newspaper=Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The singularity of the world and the reality of time: an essay in natural philosophy|year=2012|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=Adam|title=Is the search for immutable laws of nature a wild-goose chase?|journal=Discover Magazine|date=10 April 2010|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2010/apr/10-is-search-for-immutable-laws-of-nature-wild-goose-chase/article_view?b_start:int=2&amp;-C=|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At stake is the laying of the foundations for a view of the world and causality that is open to all possibilities; that is not a closed system of options in which our future is governed by deterministic laws and typologies. It is an understanding of society that rejects the naturalness and necessity of current social arrangements; "a form of understanding of society and history that refuses to explain the present arrangements in a manner that vindicates their naturalness and necessity."&lt;ref name="cosmology"/&gt;

The thesis of the singularity of the world states that there is one real world. Such a thesis stands in stark contrast to contemporary [[theoretical physics]] and cosmology, which speculate about multiple universes out of the dilemma of how to have law like explanations if the universe is unique—laws will be universal because they don't just apply to this unique universe but to all universes. However, there is no empirical evidence for multiple worlds. Unger's singularity thesis can better address our empirical observations and set the conceptual platform to address the four main puzzles in cosmology today: [[big bang]], [[initial conditions]], [[horizon problem]], and the precise value of constants, such as [[gravity]], [[speed of light]], and [[Planck's constant]].&lt;ref name="cosmology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The singularity of the world"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The singularity of the world and the reality of time: an essay in natural philosophy|year=2012|pages=Chapters 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis that time is real states that time "really is real" and everything is subject to history. This move is to historicize everything, even the laws of nature, and to challenge our acting as if time were real but not too real—we act as if it is somewhat real otherwise there would be no causal relations, but not so real that laws change. Unger holds that time is so real that laws of nature are also subject to its force and they too must change. There are no eternal laws upon which change occurs, rather time precedes structure. This position gives the universe a history and makes time non-emergent, global, irreversible, and continuous.&lt;ref name="cosmology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The singularity of the world"/&gt;

Bringing these two thesis together, Unger theorizes that laws of nature develop together with the phenomenon they explain. Laws and initial conditions co-evolve, in the same that they do in how cells reproduce and mutate in different levels of complexity of organisms. In cosmological terms Unger explains the passing from one structure to another at the origins of the universe when the state of energy was high but not infinite, and the freedom of movement was greater than when operating under a known set of laws. The conditions of the early universe is compatible with the universe that preceded it. The new universe may be different in structure, but has been made with what existed in the old one, e.g. masses of elementary particles, strength of different forces, and cosmological constants. As the universe cools the phenomena and laws work together with materials produced by sequence; they are path dependent materials. They are also constrained by the family of resemblances of the effective laws against the background of the conceptions of alternative states the universe and succession of universes.&lt;ref name="The singularity of the world"/&gt;

====Mathematics and the one real, time-drenched world====
One consequence of these positions that Unger points to is the revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If there is only one world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, but it is not a part of the world.&lt;ref name="cosmology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The singularity of the world"/&gt;

==Political engagement==
[[File:Mangabeiraunger19062007.jpg|thumb|300px|Roberto Mangabeira Unger speaking in Brazil in 2007 as the Minister of Strategic Affairs]]
Unger has a long history of political activity in Brazil. He worked in early opposition parties in the 1970s/80s against the Brazilian military dictatorship, and drafted the founding manifesto for the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB) in 1980.&lt;ref name=journalism/&gt; He served as an intimate adviser to two presidential candidates, and launched exploratory bids himself in 2000 and 2006. He was the Secretary for Strategic Affairs in the Lula administration from 2007–09, and is currently working on a number of social and developmental projects in the state of [[Rondônia]].&lt;ref name=agora&gt;{{cite news|title=Mangabeira Unger lança Rondônia como modelo de desenvolvimento|url=http://www.rondoniagora.com/noticias/mangabeira-unger-lanca-rondonia-como-modelo-de-desenvolvimento-2011-06-14.htm|accessdate=27 April 2012|newspaper=Rondonia Agora|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driving Unger's political engagement is the idea that society can be made and remade. Unlike Mill or Marx, who posited a particular class as the agent of history, Unger does not see a single vehicle for transformative politics. He advocates world-wide revolution, but does not see this happening as a single cataclysmic event or undertaken by a class agent, like the Communist movement. Rather, he sees the possibility of piecemeal change, where institutions can be replaced one at a time, and permanent plasticity can be built into the institutional infrastructure.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"/&gt;

===Early political activity, 1970s and 1980s===
Unger's engagement in Brazilian politics began in the late 1970s as Brazil started to democratize. In 1979, he presented himself to the main opposition party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), and was appointed chief of staff by party leader Ulysses Guimaraes. His initial work was to develop the positions of the party and draft policy proposals for their party's congressional representatives.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;  When the military regime dissolved the two-party system and established a multi-party system later that year, Unger worked to unite progressive liberals and the independent, non-communist left into the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB). As a co-founder of the party, he authored its first manifesto.&lt;ref name="franca"/&gt; Unger left the party after the rise of a conservative faction, which was a part of the MDB but had been excluded from the initial formation of the PMDB.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"/&gt;

After departing the PMDB in the early 1980s, Unger began looking for political agents who would serve as vehicles for his national alternative. In 1981, he jointed the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party of Brazil]] (PDT) led by [[Leonel Brizola]], a former governor of Rio de Janeiro and a figure of the left prior to the dictatorship. Brizola had founded the PDT and Unger saw it as the authentic opposition to the military regime. Throughout the 1980s he worked with Brizola to travel the country recruiting members, and developing policy positions and a political language.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=A Alternativa Transformadora – Como Democratizar o Brasil|year=1990|publisher=Editora Guanabara|location=Rio de Janeiro|accessdate=13 December 2015|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Brizola, then serving his second of three terms as governor of Rio de Janeiro, appointed Unger to head the State Foundation for the Education of Minors (FEEM), a state-run foundation for homeless children. During his year-long tenure, he began a process of radical reforms of the institutions, such as opening the door to international adoption and reintegrating children with their families. He also set up community organizations in the slums to help support families in order to prevent the abandonment of children.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"/&gt;

===Political campaigns, 1990s and 2000s===
In 1990, Unger ran a symbolic campaign for a seat in the national chamber of deputies. He had no money, no structure, and only campaigned for eight weeks. He ran on a platform of reforming the slums, and went around the slum neighborhoods giving lectures. He received 9,000 votes, just 1,000 votes short of winning the seat. None of the votes came from the slums, however. All his votes had come from the middle class, although he had never campaigned in those neighborhoods or to that constituency. Recalling the experience, Unger says "it was kind of absurd... I had no money, no staff, and I would go into these slums, alone, to hand out pamphlets, often to the local drug pushers."&lt;ref name="franca"/&gt; It is an experience that Unger cites as leading to his belief that the system and possibilities were much more open than he had previously imagined.&lt;ref name="A Alternativa Transformadora"/&gt;

Unger served as Brizola's campaign organizer and primary political adviser in his bids for the Brazilian Presidency in 1989 and 1994. In 1989, Brizola finished in third place, losing the second position, which would have qualified him for a runoff against [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], by a very narrow margin to [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. Brizola and Unger both supported Lula in the second round of the election, but Collor would go on to beat Lula and win the Presidency.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Unger also helped organize the presidential bids of former finance minister and governor of [[Ceará]], [[Ciro Gomes]], in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, Gomes came in third place with 11% of the vote, and in 2002 he came in fourth place with 12% of the vote. Unger had written ''The Next Step: An Alternative to Neoliberalism'' with Gomes in 1996. At the national level in 2002, again in the second round of the election, Unger supported Lula who went on to defeat José Serra to win the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Carta Capital|pages=26–33|date=14 August 2002|title=Unger supports Lula|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the experience of supporting others who imploded politically, Unger discovered that, as he put it, he was committing "the classic mistake of the philosophers in politics, which is to try to find someone else to do the work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Revista Playboy|date=June 2008|title=Interview with Roberto Mangabeira Unger}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he ran in the primaries for the mayor of [[Sao Paulo]], but the PPS party leader suspended the primaries when it became clear that Unger would win the nomination and challenge party control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Por que sou candidato a Prefeito de São Paulo?|newspaper=Diário Popular|date=April 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched an exploratory bid for the 2006 presidential election on the PRB ticket, but the party decided not to put forth its own candidate for the presidency and to support Lula of the PT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Folha de S.Paulo|date=10 January 2005|page=A3|title=PRB supports Lula|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Minister of Strategic Affairs in the Lula administration===
[[File:Unger Lula.jpg|thumb|left|Minister Unger speaking to President Lula in 2007.]]
Unger found President Lula's first term to be conservative and riddled with scandal. He wrote articles calling Lula's administration "the most corrupt of Brazil's history" and called for his impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Ana Paula. [http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/noticias/2007/06/19/materia.2007-06-19.0528040429/view Mangabeira Unger assume secretaria e diz que Lula foi magnânimo ao convidá-lo para o cargo], ''[[Agência Brasil]]'', 19 June 2007; retrieved 8 September 2007. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the criticism, many advisers to Lula insisted that he should invite Unger to join his administration. In June 2007, after winning his second term, Lula appointed Unger as head of the newly established Long-term Planning Secretariat (a post which would eventually be called The Minister of Strategic Affairs).&lt;ref name="boss nova"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romana|first=Carlin|title=Boss Nova|journal=Chronicle of High Education: Chronicle Review|date=6 June 2008|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Boss-Nova/13595|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger's work in office was an attempt to enact his program. Seeing the future in small enterprises and advocating a rotating capital fund that would function like a government run venture capital fund, he pushed for a rapid expansion of credit to smaller producers and a decentralized network of technical support centers that would help broaden the middle class from below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrionuevo|first=Alexei|title='Minister of Ideas' Tries to Put Brazil's Future in Focus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/world/americas/02unger.html?_r=2&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 February 2008|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further called for political solutions that would broaden access to production forces such as information technology, and for states to focus on equipping and monitoring civil society rather than trying to provide social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Szabla|first=Chris|title=After rocky but influential tenure, Brazil's "Minister of Ideas" returns to HLS|url=http://www.hlrecord.org/news/after-rocky-but-influential-tenure-brazil-s-minister-of-ideas-returns-to-hls-1.626458|newspaper=Harvard Law Record|date=4 October 2009|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger's specific projects while in office were focused on giving "ordinary men and women the instruments with which to render this vitality fertile and productive." He aimed to use state powers and resources to allow the majority of poor workers to "follow the path of the emergent vanguard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Souza|first=Jesse|title=Os Batalhadores Brasileiros|year=2010|publisher=Editora da UFMG|location=Belo Horizonte|page=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a series of sectoral and regional initiatives that would prefigure the model of development based on the broadening of economic and educational opportunity by democratizing the market economy and restructuring civil society.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Unger medal.jpeg|thumb|right|Unger receiving a medal of honor on Army Day 2008 from President Lula for his work in formulating Brazil's National Defense Strategy.]]
Sectorally, Unger revamped the educational structure and rewrote labor laws. In education, he implemented a model of secondary education, where analytical problem-solving education was paired with technical education that focused on conceptual capabilities rather than job-specific skills. There are several hundred of these institutions today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haddad|first=Fernando|newspaper=Folha de S.Paulo|date=18 February 2008|author2=Roberto Mangabeira Unger|title=Unger implements model of secondary education|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further drafted legislation to associate national, state and local jurisdictions into common bodies that could intervene when a local school system fell below the minimum acceptable threshold of quality and "fix it the way an independent administrator would fix a failing business under Chapter 11 bankruptcy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Camarena|first=Rodrigo|title=The Rousseff Presidency and Beyond: Interview with Roberto Mangabeira Unger|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2011/01/18/the-rousseff-presidency-and-brazil%E2%80%99s-future-interview-with-roberto-mangabeira-unger|publisher=Foreign Policy Association|date=18 January 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In labor, Unger worked with unions to write new labor laws designed to protect and organize temporary workers, subcontractors, and those working in the informal economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Valor Econômico|date=29 April 2008|title=Unger helps write new labor laws|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regionally, some of Unger's most influential work was the implementation of a developmental strategy for [[Amazon River|the Amazon]] that would be sustainable environmentally by making it socially inclusive. He drafted and passed legislation to regularize small-scale squatters on untitled land by giving them clear legal titles, which would create self-interest in preservation while granting them economic opportunity. Included in this law were protections against large scale land grabbers. Such legislation aimed to empower locals living on Amazonian land by giving them ownership rights and linking their interest in preserving it, rather than pillaging it as quickly as possible in the face of ambiguous ownership rights. This legislation passed and was put into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leal|first=Claudio|title=Roberto Mangabeira Unger: "Amazônia é um caos fundiário"|url=http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI3143316-EI6578,00.html|accessdate=5 June 2012|date=29 August 2008|newspaper=Terra Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901224310/http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI3143316-EI6578,00.html|archivedate=1 September 2008|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Unger plane.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Unger touring the Amazon via small aircraft]]
Unger served in the administration for two years. On 26 June 2009, President Lula announced Unger would be leaving the government and returning to Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nery|first=Natusa|title=Mangabeira Unger deixa governo Lila e retoma Harvard|newspaper=Estado de São Paulo|date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later cited personal and political reasons for his early departure.&lt;ref&gt;Szabla, Chris.

===Engagement outside Brazil===
Unger's attempts to develop global social, political, and economic alternatives have led him in episodic engagements in national debates around the world.&lt;ref&gt;For example: see Unger and Zhiyuan Cui. 1994. "China in the Russian Mirror", ''New Left Review'' 208 (December 1994); Unger, 2009. ''The Left Alternative''. London: Verso, pp. 171-88; Unger, 2009. 	
"España y su futuro ¿un país en transformación?", ''Ediciones Sequitur''; accessed 13 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach in these engagements recognizes that the problems facing contemporary societies are not distinct from nation to nation, and that general structural arrangements can first be implemented, which will allow for local innovation, flexibility, and development in social, economic, and political arenas. There is no institutional blueprint for Unger, however, only a direction that can be pointed to and general proposals that can be implemented to allow further institutional innovation and experimentation. Unger's guiding principle is that institutional flexibility needs to be built into the implemented system, and in this way a diversity of local experiments would take hold the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=The Left Alternatives in Particular Contexts|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/unger/progressive.php#4|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Unger's more promising engagements was the ''Latin American Alternative'' in the late 1990s. Unger and Mexican politician and political scientist [[Jorge Castañeda Gutman]] assembled an informal network of politicians and business leaders dedicated to redrawing the political map. The aim of the group was to provide a critique of [[neoliberalism]] coupled with a way forward in a distinct strategy and institutional model of development. They floated proposals such as guaranteeing every citizen "social rights" (e.g. education and a job), breaking up media oligopolies, and holding town meetings to help citizens supervise municipal spending. The group held a number of meetings over the years, which included Brazilian finance minister [[Ciro Gomes]], Chilean senator [[Carlos Ominami]], Argentinian politicians [[Dante Caputo]] and [[Rodolfo Terragno]], and Mexican politician and future president [[Vicente Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Castaneda, Jorge. "Mexico: Permuting Power", ''New Left Review'' 7 (January–February 2001); accessed 13 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The meetings resulted in a document entitled the "Buenos Aires Consensus" in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061229130401/http://www.robertounger.com/alternative.htm "A Latin American Alternative" document signed at Buenos Aires in November 1997]; accessed 11 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; which Castaneda called "the end of neoliberalism; of the Washington Consensus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herrera|first=Ernesto|title=Consensus de Buenos Aires: Alternatives au néolibéralisme ou simple toilettage?|url=http://www.lagauche.com/gauche/lghebdo/1998/1998-05-05.html|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=La gauche|date=5 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Valente|first=Marcela|title=Centre-Left Seals Buenos Aires Consensus|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=66789|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=Inter Press Service|date=2 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2008 US presidential campaign, Unger was in frequent contact with candidate [[Barack Obama]] via email and Blackberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Remnick|first=David|title=The Bridge|year=2010|publisher=Picador|page=185|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since become critical of the Obama administration, and called for the defeat of Obama in the 2012 election as a first step to remaking the Democratic party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Beyond Obama|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnf4k8EaL7M&amp;feature=share|work=Beyond Series|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current engagement===
Unger's recent political work has focused on the north-western Brazilian state of [[Rondônia]]. He sees the human and natural resources of the state meeting all the conditions to serve as the vanguard of a new model of development for Brazil. Speaking to ''News Rondônia'' he said, "Rondônia is a state formed by a multitude of small and medium entrepreneurs together with the Brazilian government, and that is something truly unique in our country."&lt;ref name="newsrondonia1"&gt;{{cite news|title=DESENVOLVIMENTO: GOVERNO OUVE PROPOSTAS DO SETOR PRODUTIVO|url=http://newsrondonia.com/lerNoticias.php?news=15132|accessdate=27 April 2012|newspaper=News Rondonia|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been traveling the state giving public lectures and encouraging political discourse and engagement in localities.&lt;ref name="newsrondonia1"/&gt; Working with governor João Aparecido Cahulla on development projects,&lt;ref name=agora/&gt; Unger has outlined a series of important areas of focus. The first is to change the agricultural model from one of intensive farming to an industrialization of produces through the recuperation of degraded pastures, supply fertilizers and lime, and diversifying crops and livestock farming. The second key project is transforming education from rote learning to creative thinking and engagement. He helped open the School Teixeira in Porto Velho.&lt;ref name="newsrondonia1"/&gt; Another ongoing project is the construction of a new educational center in accordance with his theory of pedagogical reform, where delinquents would be reintegrated into municipal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mangabeira Unger visita complexo prisional de Porto Velho|url=http://www.olhovivorondonia.com.br/noticias.php?news=19776|accessdate=27 April 2012|newspaper=Olho Vivo Rondonia|date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumstance and influence==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RobertoUngerPortrait.jpg|thumb|150px|Image of Unger]] --&gt;
Unger's philosophical work grapples with some of the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=768–771|doi=10.2307/1288775}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law,&lt;ref name="Weirib 1985 1825–1841"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weirib|first=Ernest J.|title=Enduring Passion|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=June 1985|volume=94|issue=7|pages=1825–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said to have provided one answer to [[Hume's Guillotine]].&lt;ref name="Boyle 1985 1066-`083"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1066–83|doi=10.2307/1340886|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5799&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unger's analysis of liberalism and the philosophical program he builds around rethinking the individual has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism: A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791–816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the ''[[Northwestern University Law Review]]'' devoted an issue to Unger's work, analysing his three volume publication ''[[Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory]]''. Michael J. Perry, a professor of law at [[Northwestern University]], praises Unger for producing a vast work of social theory that combines law, history, politics, and philosophy within a single narrative.&lt;ref name="franca"/&gt;

Early reviewers of ''Politics'' questioned Unger's seeming predicament of criticizing a system of thought and its historical tradition without subjecting himself to the same critical gaze. "There is little acknowledgement that he himself is writing in a particular socio-historical context", wrote one reviewer,&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Allan C. "Review: A Poetic Champion Composes: Unger (Not) on Ecology and Women", ''The University of Toronto Law Journal'' 40, no. 2 (1 April 1990): p. 279.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and another asked, "in what context Unger himself is situated and why that context itself is not offered up to the sledgehammer."&lt;ref&gt;Wilder, Joseph C. "Review", ''The American Political Science Review'' 83, no. 2 (1 June 1989): p. 623.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Yack, Bernard. "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation", ''Harvard Law Review'' 101, no. 8 (1 June 1988)&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also balked at the lack of example or concrete vision of his social and political proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Yack, Bernard. "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation", ''Harvard Law Review'' 101, no. 8 (1 June 1988): 1969.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As one critic wrote, "it is difficult to imagine what Unger's argument would mean in practice", and that "he does not tell us what to make."&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ian. "Review: Constructing Politics", ''Political Theory'' 17, no. 3 (1989): pp. 481-82.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Others have suggested that the lack of imagination of such readers is precisely what is at stake.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Richard. "Unger, Castoriadis, and the Romance of a National Future", ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 82 (1988-87).&lt;!--ISSN or ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sacred food as offering''' is a concept within [[anthropology]] regarding the study of food as it relates to religious ritual.

Many religions have prescriptions about the correct preparation and cooking of food, besides the [[Taboo food and drink|taboos about forbidden subjects]]. Many religions have special [[spellings]] for the food, which sacralize it and, therefore, who will eat it; but there are foods sacred by its inner nature.
In Brazilian [[Candomblé]] by example, fishes are sacred for their connection to [[Iemanjá]], horns given the relation to [[Iansan|Iansã]].
Consequently, those foods are considered offerings. This takes place in other religions too.
Some examples:
*coconut: [[Ganesha]] in Hinduism 
* milk, betel leaves  Shiva in Hinduism
* flowers, tulsi and fruit Krishna Hinduism
*[[Oxalá]] in candomblé (see above)
*bread: representing the [[body of Christ]] in [[Catholicism]]
*the [[challah]] in Judaism is symbol of divine presence in shabat
*chestnut: [[Befana]]
*[[Coca leaf]]: for the [[Andean culture (disambiguation)|Andean culture]]s
*Leola's Maize Corn: Amerindian goddess of prosperity in [[cajun]] of Louisiana.

The '''Scholars Strategy Network''' ('''SSN''') is an association of academics and researchers who coordinate to address public challenges while increasing the accessibility of their findings to those outside of [[academia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/paul-ryan-budget-plan-targeted-progressive-academics_n_1752507.html Siddiqui, Sabrina. "Paul Ryan Budget Plan Targeted By Progressive Academics Via Scholars Strategy Network." ''The Huffington Post.'' 7 August 2012. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/02/environmentalist-failure-to-pass-cap-and-trade#.UR_sYt3N2oc.email "The Politics of Climate Change Legislation." ''Harvard Magazine.'' 15 February 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the work of individual SSN members is typically published in [[academic journals]], the organization encourages its members to write "briefs" about current issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/content/social-scientists-seek-new-ways-influence-public-policy McMurtrie, Beth. "Social Scientists Seek New Ways to Influence Public Policy." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education.'' 30 August 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://themonkeycage.org/2012/06/06/scholars-strategy-network/ Voeten, Erik. "Scholars Strategy Network." ''The Washington Post: The Monkey Cage.'' 24 September 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; These shorter pieces, written in consideration of a lay audience, are published on the organization's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/24/how-legislators-view-their-constituents.html Tomasky, Michael. "How Legislators View Their Constituents." ''The Daily Beast.'' 24 September 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the Scholars Strategy Network with an associated website was originally conceived of in 2009 by [[sociologist]] and [[political scientist]] [[Theda Skocpol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/paul-ryan-budget-plan-targeted-progressive-academics_n_1752507.html Siddiqui, Sabrina. "Paul Ryan Budget Plan Targeted By Progressive Academics Via Scholars Strategy Network." ''The Huffington Post.'' 7 August 2012. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The association is backed by donors Robert Bowditch, Jr. and David desJardins, both of whom are affiliated with the progressive [[Democracy Alliance]], but the Scholars Strategy Network does not take formal positions on policy questions or support or oppose particular political candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news2.sanford.duke.edu/newsletters/Insights11_12.pdf Stanford Insights Staff. "Stanford Professors Join Scholars Strategy Network to Engage with Public." ''Stanford Insights.'' Fall 2012. Accessed 4 December 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional Networks ==

An SSN Regional Network includes scholars who live or work in that region, and each is coordinated by a leader or co-leaders who set the regional agenda and organize discussions and public events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2013/03/21/experts-explore-who-controls-government Shan, Tony.

'''Systematic musicology''' is an [[umbrella term]], used mainly in [[Central Europe]], for several subdisciplines and paradigms of [[musicology]]. "Systematic musicology has traditionally been conceived of as an interdisciplinary science, whose aim it is to explore the foundations of music from different points of view, such as acoustics, physiology, psychology, anthro- pology, music theory, sociology, and aesthetics." &lt;ref name="schneiderleman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leman|first1=Marc|last2=Schneider|first2=Albrecht|editor1-first=Marc|editor1-last=Leman|title=Music, Gestalt, and Computing. Studies in Cognitive and Systematic Musicology|chapter=Origin and Nature of Cognitive and Systematic Musicology: An Introduction|date=1997|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=3-540-63526-2|pages=13–30|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/BFb0034102|accessdate=16 June 2017|ref=Music, Gestalt, and Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important subdisciplines today are [[music psychology]], [[sociomusicology]] (music sociology), [[philosophy of music]] (music philosophy), [[music acoustics]] (physics of music), [[cognitive neuroscience of music]], and the computer sciences of music (including [[sound and music computing]], [[music information retrieval]], and [[computing in musicology]]). These subdisciplines and paradigms tend to address questions about [[music]] in general, rather than specific manifestations of music.

In the European tripartite model of musicology, musicology is regarded as a combination of three broad subdisciplines: [[ethnomusicology]], [[music history]] (or historical musicology), and systematic musicology. Ethnomusicology and historical musicology are primarily concerned with specific manifestations of music such as performances, works, traditions, genres, and the people who produce and engage with them (musicians, composers, social groups). Systematic musicology is different in that it tends not to put these specific manifestations in the foreground, although it of course refers to them. Instead, more general questions are asked about music. These questions tend to be answered either by analysing empirical data (based on observation) or by developing theory - or better, by a combination of both. The 19th-century positivist dream of discovering "laws" of music (by analogy to "laws" in other disciplines such as physics; cf. Adler, 1885), and of defining the discipline of systematic musicology in terms of such laws, slowly evaporated. Ideological trends stemming from [[modernism]] and later [[post-structuralism]] fundamentally altered the nature of the project.

Since systematic musicology brings together several parent disciplines, it is often regarded as being intrinsically interdisciplinary&lt;ref name="current"&gt;{{cite book|editor2-first=Marc|editor2-last=Leman|editor1-first=Rolf|editor1-last=Bader|editor3-first=Rolf-Inge|editor3-last=Godoi|title=Current Research in Systematic Musicology|date=2013|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-36098-5|url=https://link.springer.com/bookseries/11684|accessdate=13 December 2017|ref=Current Research in Systematic Musicology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schneidersystem"&gt;{{cite book|editor2-first=Bram|editor2-last=Gätjen|editor1-first=Klaus Wolfgang|editor1-last=Niemöller|title=Perspektiven und Methoden einer Systemischen Musikwissenschaft|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=978-3-63139502-8|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/40101?tab=toc|accessdate=13 December 2017|ref=Perspektiven und Methoden einer Systemischen Musikwissenschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or as a system of interacting subdisciplines (hence the alternative name "systemic"). However, most systematic musicologists focus on just one or a select few of the many subdisciplines. Systematic musicologists who are oriented toward the [[humanities]] often make reference to fields such as [[aesthetics]], [[philosophy]], [[semiotics]], [[hermeneutics]], [[music criticism]], [[Media studies]], [[Cultural studies]], [[gender studies]], and (theoretic) [[sociology]]. Those who are oriented toward [[science]] tend to regard their discipline as empirical and data-oriented, and to borrow their methods and ways of thinking from [[psychology]], [[acoustics]], [[psychoacoustics]], [[physiology]], [[cognitive science]], and (empirical) [[sociology]].&lt;ref name=current&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently emerged areas of research which at least partially are in the scope of systematic musicology comprise [[cognitive musicology]], [[neuromusicology]], [[biomusicology]], and [[music cognition]] including [[embodied music cognition]]. As an academic discipline, systematic musicology is closely related to practically oriented disciplines such as [[music technology]], [[music information retrieval]], and [[musical robotics]].&lt;ref name=current&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic musicology is less unified than its sister disciplines historical musicology and ethnomusicology. Its contents and methods are more diverse and tend to be more closely related to parent disciplines, both academic and practical, outside of musicology. The diversity of systematic musicology is to some extent compensated for by interdisciplinary interactions within the system of subdisciplines that make it up.

The origins of systematic musicology in Europe can be traced to ancient Greece; philosophers such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristoxenus]] asked general questions about music. Historical musicology and ethnomusicology are much younger disciplines, and the relative importance of the three has fluctuated considerably during the past few centuries. Today, musicology's three broad subdisciplines are of approximately equal size in terms of the volume of research activity.

The '''Test of Economic Knowledge''' or '''TEK''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use in middle schools and in lower-grade levels of high schools.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e., [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Literacy]] (TEL) and [[Test of Understanding in College Economics]] (TUCE)) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TEK was recently revised into its second edition in 2007 and will soon be available, along with an examiner’s manual, for teachers, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The revision process took place at the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]] (NCREE) and included a new set of norm-references that consisted of teacher and student participation from twenty-five U.S. states.  The TEK has two parallel forms, each composed of forty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items with [[content validity]] based on the [[Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics]].

'''''The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love''''' is a [[self-help]] book, written by [[Christian]] writers [[Tim LaHaye|Tim]] and [[Beverly LaHaye]].

==Introduction==
''The Act of Marriage'' is concerned with helping [[marriage|couples]], particularly the female partner, to achieve [[orgasm|sexual satisfaction]]. The book was first printed in 1976 and boasts a readership of over 2.5 million readers.&lt;ref&gt;LaHaye, Tim, and Beverly LaHaye. ''The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love.'' [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]: [[Zondervan]], 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; While the book is written to be understood by anyone, the primary audience is meant to be Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Product/ProductDetail.htm?ProdID=com.zondervan.9780310211778&amp;QueryStringSite=Zondervan Description from the publisher]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the book is noteworthy for opening up dialogue among Christians about their sexuality&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;[http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Product/ProductDetail.htm?ProdID=com.zondervan.9780310211778&amp;QueryStringSite=Zondervan Review] by [[Publishers Weekly]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/us/Story?id=4651272&amp;page=2 "Christians Promote Holy, Hot Sex in Marriage" at abc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;—especially female sexuality and sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Act-of-Marriage/Tim-LaHaye/e/9780310212003#TABS review] by [[Library Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heller, J. 2002. "Marriage, Womanhood, and the Search for 'Something More': American Evangelical Women's Best-selling 'Self Help' Books, 1972–1979", ''The Journal of Religion and Pop Culture'', '''2'''. {{cite web |url=https://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/article-selfhelp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318234158/http://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/article-selfhelp.html |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other self-help books which address human sexuality, ''The Act of Marriage'' helps readers identify how their spirituality and religious beliefs can enhance their love lives.&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt;

Since its initial publishing in 1976, ''The Act of Marriage'' has been published again in 1998 as ''The Act of Marriage, Revised &amp; Updated'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product/939756774?item_no=21177&amp;event=CF&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2000 as ''The Act of Marriage after 40: Making Love for Life''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?item_no=31141&amp;event=CF&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolling Stone]] magazine criticized the book as "an explicit Christian sex manual, condemning [[making out|petting]], [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/5939999/reverend_doomsday/ "Reverend Doomsday"] in the [[Rolling Stone]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Christian groups hail the book as a milestone in contemporary Christian  [[sex education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/excerpt/2008/04/09/rapture_ready/ Salon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianmagazine.com/familyconnections/050217honeymoon.html Meridian Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828163318/http://meridianmagazine.com/familyconnections/050217honeymoon.html |date=2008-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familyfed.org/bfd/book-list_hw_relations.htm familyfed.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020124713/http://www.familyfed.org/bfd/book-list_hw_relations.htm |date=2008-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marriagemoments.org/index.php?s=content&amp;p=resources Marriagemoments.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter summaries ==

=== Chapter 1: The Sanctity of Sex ===
This chapter sets out to convince the reader that [[Religion and sexuality#Christianity|sex is holy and sacred]], not dirty—an attitude they have found to be prevalent among the couples they have [[relationship counseling|counseled]]. They cite several examples in both the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] where intimate behavior between married persons is commended.

=== Chapter 2: What Lovemaking Means to a Man ===
In this chapter the authors set out five benefits that men derive from [[intimacy]] with their [[wife|wives]]:
# It satisfies his [[Libido|sex drive]], which is usually greater than his wife's.
# It boosts his [[self image]].
# It increases the love he feels for his wife and makes it less likely that he will engage in [[extramarital affair]]s.
# It [[Human sexual response cycle#Resolution phase|calms him down]] and makes him less prone to find fault with his family.
# It provides one of the most [[orgasm|exciting experiences]] of his life.
Overall, the chapter is concerned with convincing wives that it is okay for their husbands to want to have sex with them.

=== Chapter 3: What Lovemaking Means to a Woman ===
In this chapter the authors set out five benefits that women derive from intimacy with their husbands.
# It fulfills her sense of [[womanhood]].
# It reassures her of her husband's love. They point out that a woman needs to feel [[interpersonal relationship|companionship love]], [[compassion|compassionate love]], [[romantic love]], and [[affection|affectionate love]] from her husband before she will feel ready to accept [[passion (emotion)|passionate love]].
# It satisfies her sex drive.
# It helps her to relax and to not be high-strung.
# It is the ultimate experience when properly done.
Overall, the chapter is concerned with convincing husbands that women can and need to be sexually satisfied, too.

=== Chapter 4: Why God Created Sex ===
In this chapter the authors present five reasons that [[God]] created sex, in spite of how it is misused by many.
# It is needed to [[sexual reproduction|propagate]] the human race.
# It provides a married couple the means to give mutual pleasure.
# It allows spouses to be fulfilled with each other and to be less tempted by [[extramarital sex|other sexual opportunities]].
# The husband will have claim over his wife and the wife will have claim over her husband.
# It creates a unique union and method of communication between two people that cannot be shared with anyone else.
Overall, the chapter is concerned with convincing couples that sex is a blessing from God, but that it should only be experienced within the bonds of marriage.

=== Chapter 5: Sex Education ===
This chapter explains the [[male reproductive system (human)|male]] and [[female reproductive system (human)|female sex organs]] and how they respond to [[sexual stimulation]]. Some counsel is given on how to avoid or reduce pain when [[virginity|breaking]] the [[hymen]]. Emphasis is placed on the [[clitoris]] as the seat of the female [[orgasm]]. The differences between male and female orgasms are also outlined.

=== Chapter 6: The Art of Lovemaking ===
This chapter outlines the basic steps taken during a lovemaking session. It includes preparations that should be taken, [[foreplay]], [[sexual intercourse|the act itself]], and the "afterglow" that follows completion of the act. They stress the importance of the husband waiting until his wife is fully aroused before entering her vagina and proceeding to orgasm. They recommend that a couple use their [[honeymoon]] for experimentation so that they can best learn how to please their partner. The importance of clitoral stimulation to achieve female orgasm is again stressed. Male and female sexual responses are again compared and a brief discussion of positions is given.

=== Chapter 7: For Men Only ===
This chapter gives eleven suggestions on how men can satisfy their wives.
# Educate yourself on the female anatomy.
# Learn to control your [[ejaculation]] so it does not [[premature ejaculation|happen prematurely]].
# Concentrate on the woman's satisfaction, not your own.
# Remember what arouses a woman (companionship, compassionate, romantic, and affectionate love).
# Control your [[anger|temper]].
# Avoid the use of [[profanity|crude words]].
# Avoid [[gossip|speaking of private matters with friends and colleagues]].
# Avoid [[body odor|smelling bad]].
# Avoid rushing the act.
# Have open communication with your wife.
# Love your wife as a person.

=== Chapter 8: For Women Only ===
This chapter gives nine suggestions on how women can satisfy their husbands and achieve satisfaction themselves during the sex act.
# Keep a [[optimism|positive mental attitude]]. This is broken down into three parts: have a positive attitude about sex, a positive attitude about yourself, and a positive attitude about your husband.
# Recognize that many [[sexual inhibition|inhibitions]] need to be abandoned in the bedroom.
# Remember that your husband is stimulated by sight.
# Avoid nagging, criticizing, or ridiculing your husband.
# Remember that while you may not be in the mood for sexual relations when your husband makes advances, you are capable of responding and "getting into the mood."
# [[feminine hygiene|Keep your feminine parts clean]].
# Communicate with your husband and tell him what pleases you.
# [[prayer|Pray]] and ask God for help in achieving sexual satisfaction.

=== Chapter 9: The Unfulfilled Woman ===
This chapter declares that many wives are not as satisfied by sexual encounters as they could be because they fail to achieve orgasm. Eleven reasons are given why women might experience dissatisfaction with sex and suggestions are given on how to overcome those problems.
# Ignorance on both her part and her husband's part on how to achieve [[clitoral orgasm]].
# Feelings of hate or hostility towards someone else, especially her husband.
# Feelings of guilt, especially those brought on by [[premarital sex]] premarital or extramarital indiscretions.
# Fear that she will not be able to be satisfied or satisfy her husband.
# Being too passive during the act.
# A husband who ejaculates before she has climaxed
# [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]].
# Illness.
# Being [[overweight]].
# Being unwilling to surrender herself to her husband.
# Having weak [[vagina]]l muscles.

=== Chapter 10: The Key to the Feminine Response ===
This chapter explains how [[Arnold Kegel|Dr. Arnold H. Kegel]] started training women to [[Kegel exercise|exercise]] their [[pubococcygeus]] muscle in order to curb postpartum [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. It was discovered that a side effect of this exercise was to improve women's ability to experience orgasm. The authors recommend an exercise regimen for women seeking to improve their sexual response.

=== Chapter 11: The Impotent Man ===
This chapter gives nineteen reasons why husbands may experience [[impotence|inability to maintain an erection]] or ejaculate and gives suggestions on how to overcome those problems.
# The onset of age: they will lose vital energy as they get older.
# Feelings of hate or hostility towards someone else, especially his wife.
# Fear (of rejection, of being unable to satisfy his wife, of being compared with other men, of failure to maintain erection or to ejaculate).
# Ridicule from his wife.
# Feelings of guilt, especially those brought on by premarital or extramarital indiscretions.
# Having unreasonable expectations about how he will be able to perform as his age increases.
# [[Obesity]].
# Poor [[physical fitness]].
# Heavy [[smoking]].
# Mental pressure from outside concerns.
# [[depression (mood)|Depression]].
# Drugs and alcohol.
# [[Masturbation]].
# If his wife has weak vaginal muscles.
# A wife who is too passive during the act.
# Nagging from his wife.
# A dominating wife.
# Premature ejaculation.
# Retarded ejaculation.

=== Chapter 12: Sane Family Planning ===
The authors express their belief that a husband and wife should produce as many children as they can reasonably manage and deplore several reasons some give for avoiding parenthood. They counter with several reasons why parents should seek to have and raise children. They then give suggestions for contraception that they believe are appropriate for Christians (because they are not [[abortifacient]]). They recommend, in order of reliability, [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], [[condom]]s, [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]], [[spermicide|vaginal foam]], the [[calendar-based methods|rhythm method]], and [[coitus interruptus]]. They recommend against permanent methods, such as [[vasectomy]] and [[tubal ligation|having tubes tied]].

=== Chapter 13: Sex Survey Report ===
The authors report the results of a [[opinion poll|survey]] they conducted. Their intent is to show that a) Christians have more fulfilling sex lives than their non-Christian counterparts and b) Christians don't have the [[Victorian morality|Victorian attitudes]] about sex that they are stereotyped as having.

=== Chapter 14: The Missing Dimension ===
In this chapter the authors advocate that the most important element to a satisfying sex life and a satisfying life overall is to have a personal relationship with [[Jesus Christ]]. They advocate a Christian lifestyle and suggest that a shared belief in Christ will help a couple overcome incompatibilities.

=== Chapter 15: Practical Answers to Common Questions ===
In this chapter, the authors field questions on a variety of topics, including [[abortion]], [[adultery]], [[birth control]], communication, counseling, [[dating]], fantasy, [[fornication]], [[free love]], [[homosexuality]], [[masturbation]], [[menopause]], [[oral sex]], [[making out|petting]], [[privacy]], "September sex", etc.

==Academic Study==

Within academia, the Act of Marriage is viewed as an interesting insight into the ever changing relationship between mainstream religion and sexual practice. Michigan State Professor, Amy DeRogatis, took a deep look at this book and others of the sort to explore the impacts they have on gender roles within Protestant Evangelical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/church-history/article/what-would-jesus-do-sexuality-and-salvation-in-protestant-evangelical-sex-manuals-1950s-to-the-present/A0D3B75DDB5D49ADB5E65D2725F72C20&lt;/ref&gt; While it pushes the boundaries of accepted sexual practice within Evangelical heterosexual marriage to that point, it upholds a strictly [[complementarian]] view of gender. At some points within the text it describes men as "beasts" and "uncontrollable" in the context of sexual desire, while it paints women as pleasers and far less sexual than their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;LaHaye, Tim, and Beverly LaHaye. The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this seems overly traditionalist, they were not out of line with commonly held cultural belief. Even secular author Alex Comfort's [[The Joy of Sex]] promotes the idea of natural gender roles and a far more sexually driven male.

'''Trial and error''' is a fundamental method of [[problem solving]].&lt;ref&gt;Evolutionary Epistemology, Rationality, and the Sociology of Knowledge p94 p108&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterised by repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success,&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary p1489&lt;/ref&gt; or until the agent stops trying.

According to [[W.H. Thorpe]], the term was [[neologism|devised]] by [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] (1852–1936) after trying out similar phrases "trial and failure" and "trial and practice".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe W.H. The origins and rise of ethology. Hutchinson, London &amp; Praeger, New York. p26. {{ISBN|978-0-03-053251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Morgan's Canon]], [[ethology|animal behaviour]] should be explained in the simplest possible way. Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial-and-error learning. An example is the skillful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.

[[Edward Thorndike]] showed how to manage a trial-and-error experiment in the laboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the [[law of effect]] in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike E.L. 1898. Animal intelligence: an experimental study of the association processes in animals. ''Psychological Monographs'' #8.&lt;/ref&gt; He plotted learning curves which recorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended by [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[operant conditioning]].

Trial and error is also a [[heuristic]] method of problem solving, [[repair]], tuning, or obtaining [[knowledge]]. In the field of [[computer science]], the method is called '''generate and test'''. In elementary algebra, when solving equations, it is '''"guess and check"'''.

This approach can be seen as one of the two basic approaches to problem solving, contrasted with an approach using [[insight]] and [[theory]]. However, there are intermediate methods which for example, use theory to guide the method, an approach known as ''guided empiricism''.

==Methodology==
This approach is far more successful with simple problems and in games, and is often resorted to when no apparent rule applies. This does not mean that the approach need be careless, for an individual can be methodical in manipulating the variables in an attempt to sort through possibilities that may result in success. Nevertheless, this method is often used by people who have little knowledge in the problem area. The trial-and-error approach has been studied from its natural computational point of view &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1183v2 X. Bei, N. Chen, S. Zhang, On the Complexity of Trial and Error, STOC 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simplest applications===
[[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]] (1960, section 11/5) offers three simple strategies for dealing with the same basic exercise-problem; and they have very different efficiencies:
Suppose there are 1000 on/off switches which have to be set to a particular combination by random-based testing, each test to take one second. [This is also discussed in Traill (1978/2006, section C1.2]. The strategies are:
*the perfectionist all-or-nothing method, with no attempt at holding partial successes. This would be expected to take more than 10^301 seconds, [i.e. 2^1000 seconds, or 3·5×(10^291) centuries!];
*a serial-test of switches, holding on to the partial successes (assuming that these are manifest) would take 500 seconds on average; while
*a parallel-but-individual testing of all switches simultaneously would take only one second.

Note the tacit assumption here that no intelligence or insight is brought to bear on the problem. However, the existence of different available strategies allows us to consider a separate ("superior") domain of processing — a ''"meta-level"'' above the mechanics of switch handling — where the various available strategies can be randomly chosen. Once again this is "trial and error", but of a different type. This leads us to:

===Hierarchies===
Ashby's book develops this "meta-level" idea, and extends it into a whole [[recursion|recursive]] sequence of levels, successively above each other in a systematic hierarchy. On this basis he argues that human intelligence emerges from such organization: relying heavily on trial-and-error (at least initially at each new stage), but emerging with what we would call "intelligence" at the end of it all. Thus presumably the topmost level of the hierarchy (at any stage) will still depend on simple trial-and-error.

Traill (1978/2006) suggests that this Ashby-hierarchy probably coincides with [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s well-known theory of developmental stages. [This work also discusses Ashby's 1000-switch example; see §C1.2]. After all, it is part of Piagetian doctrine that children learn by first ''actively doing'' in a more-or-less random way, and then hopefully learn from the consequences — which all has a certain to Ashby's random "trial-and-error".

===Application===
Traill (2008, ''espec. Table "S" on p.31'') follows [[Niels Kaj Jerne|Jerne]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] in seeing this strategy as probably underlying ''all'' knowledge-gathering systems — ''at least in their initial phase''.

Four such systems are identified:
*[[Natural selection]] which "educates" the [[DNA]] of the species,
*The brain of the individual (just discussed);
*The "brain" of society-as-such (including the publicly held body of science); and
*The [[adaptive immune system]].

===Intention===
In the Ashby-and-[[Cybernetics]] tradition, the word "trial" usually implies ''random-or-arbitrary'', without any ''deliberate'' choice.

However amongst non-cyberneticians, "trial" will often imply a deliberate subjective act by some adult human agent; (e.g. in a court-room, or laboratory). So that has sometimes led to confusion.

Of course the situation becomes even more confusing if one accepts Ashby's hierarchical explanation of intelligence, and its implied ability to be deliberate and to creatively [[design]] — all based ultimately on ''non-deliberate'' actions. The lesson here seems to be that one must simply be careful to clarify the meaning of one's own words, and indeed the words of others. [Incidentally it seems that ''consciousness'' is not an essential ingredient for ''intelligence'' as discussed                  
 
One of the greatest inventor with 1093 patents was Thomas Alva Edison (TAE). One of his most famous sayings was that "Genius was 5% inspiration and 95% perspiration".  Edison and his assistants would tried 500 ways to invent something and when not succeesful, they would try another 500 ways. When an experiment was not successful, he was happy to admit that he now knew the things that did not work. Trial and error was Edison's most successful means of invention. Most today believe Edison did not follow a scientific theory to invent but invented by: Trial And Error (TAE). 

Today, the approach of [[voodoo programming]] is an usage where code is composed with trial and error until something which produces the desired output is found.

==Features==
Trial and error has a number of features:
*solution-oriented: trial and error makes no attempt to discover ''why'' a solution works, merely that it ''is'' a solution.
*problem-specific: trial and error makes no attempt to generalize a solution to other problems.
*non-optimal: trial and error is generally an attempt to find ''a'' solution, not ''all'' solutions, and not the ''best'' solution.
*needs little knowledge: trials and error can proceed where there is little or no knowledge of the subject.

It is possible to use trial and error to find all solutions or the best solution, when a testably finite number of possible solutions exist. To find all solutions, one simply makes a note and continues, rather than ending the process, when a solution is found, until all solutions have been tried. To find the best solution, one finds all solutions by the method just described and then comparatively evaluates them based upon some predefined set of criteria, the existence of which is a condition for the possibility of finding a best solution. (Also, when only one solution can exist, as in assembling a jigsaw puzzle, then any solution found is the only solution and so is necessarily the best.)

==Examples==
Trial and error has traditionally been the main method of finding new drugs, such as [[antibiotics]]. [[Chemist]]s simply try chemicals at random until they find one with the desired effect. In a more sophisticated version, chemists select a narrow range of chemicals it is thought may have some effect using a technique called [[structure-activity relationship]]. (The latter case can be alternatively considered as a changing of the problem rather than of the solution strategy: instead of "What chemical will work well as an antibiotic?" the problem in the sophisticated approach is "Which, if any, of the chemicals in this narrow range will work well as an antibiotic?") The method is used widely in many disciplines, such as [[polymer technology]] to find new polymer types or families.

Trial and error is also commonly seen in player responses to [[Video game|video games]] - when faced with an obstacle or [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], players often form a number of strategies to surpass the obstacle or defeat the boss, with each strategy being carried out before the player either succeeds or quits the game.  

[[Sports team|Sports teams]] also make use of trial and error to qualify for and/or progress through the [[playoffs]] and win the [[championship]], attempting different strategies, plays, lineups and formations in hopes of defeating each and every opponent along the way to victory.  This is especially crucial in [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|playoff series in which multiple wins are required to advance]], where a team that loses a game will have the opportunity to try new tactics to find a way to win, if they are not eliminated yet.

The [[scientific method]] can be regarded as containing an element of trial and error in its formulation and testing of hypotheses. Also compare [[genetic algorithm]]s, [[simulated annealing]] and [[reinforcement learning]] – all varieties for search which apply the basic idea of trial and error.

[[Evolution|Biological evolution]] can be considered as a form of trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Serwall|title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution|journal=Proceedings of the sixth international congress on genetics|date=1932|volume=Number 6|series=Volume 1|page=365|url=http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Random mutations and sexual genetic variations can be viewed as trials and poor reproductive fitness, or lack of improved fitness, as the error. Thus after a long time 'knowledge' of well-adapted genomes accumulates simply by virtue of them being ''able'' to reproduce.

[[Bogosort]], a conceptual sorting algorithm (that is extremely inefficient and impractical), can be viewed as a trial and error approach to sorting a list. However, typical simple examples of bogosort do not track which orders of the list have been tried and may try the same order any number of times, which violates one of the basic principles of trial and error. Trial and error is actually more efficient and practical than bogosort; unlike bogosort, it is guaranteed to halt in finite time on a finite list, and might even be a reasonable way to sort extremely short lists under some conditions.

'''Water supply and women in developing countries''' is a complex topic, as lack of accessible, sufficient, clean and affordable [[water supply]] has adverse impacts specifically related to women in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. In most countries, women are the primary household members responsible for providing water for domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=UNWATER&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/EGM_report.pdf, Gender-Disaggregated Data on Water and Sanitation], UN-DESA and UN-DCP, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of water, which may take up to six hours a day to meet the household needs, is a duty often relegated to women and children. This foregone time often prevents children, especially girls, from attending school and women from pursuing small business opportunities.&lt;ref name=Water&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/es072435t, "Water and Sanitization in Developing Countries: Including Health in the Equation"],  Maggie A Montgomery and Menachem Elimelech, Yale University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Second World Water Forum in The Hague concluded that women are the primary users of domestic water, that women used water in their key food production roles, and that women and children were the most vulnerable to water-related disasters.&lt;ref name="Women and Water"&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/Feb05.pdf, "Women and Water"], UN Division for the Advancement of Women, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At the International Conference on Water and the Environment, the [[Dublin Statement|Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development]] included "Women Play a central part in the provision management and safeguarding of water" as one of 4 principles. Many women's rights and water advocacy organizations have identified water privatization as an area of concern, sometimes alleging negative effects that specifically affect women.&lt;ref name=Diverting&gt;[http://www.wedo.org/wp-content/uploads/divertingtheflow.pdf,  "Diverting the Flow: A Resource Guide to Gender, Rights and Water Privatization"], Women's Environment and Development Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Gender, Water, and Sanitization"&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/inter_agency/gender_water/policybrief.pdf, "Gender, Water, and Sanitization"], UN Water Policy Brief, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion of women and the efficacy of water supply==
[[File:India - Sights &amp; Culture - 33 - woman fetching water.jpg|thumb|A woman walking a long distance fetching water in India]]
Water supply schemes in developing nations have shown higher success when planned and run with full participation of women in the affected communities.&lt;ref name="Gender in Water Resource Management"&gt;, Van Wijk-Sijbesma, Christine, 1998. Gender in Water Resources Management, Water Supply and Sanitation: Roles and Realities.&lt;/ref&gt; A study including 88 communities in 14 countries showed that projects where men and women from intended user households were included in selection of site facilities, and where water projects were initiated by user households, rather than by external agencies or local leaders, achieved a final higher access to services than those that did not.&lt;ref name="WSP"&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/global_plareport.pdf, "Linking Sustainability with Demand,Gender and Poverty"], International Water and Sanitation Centre, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Chile===
Chilean law does not specifically include a gender component relating to water projects, but notes that all water projects must assess impact on the "lives and customs of human groups".&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt; A study commissioned in 2000 by the Direccion General de Aguas relating to gender and the challenges of water resources noted: {{quote|text=All government institutions dealing with water resources have a very low percentage of women at the planning and decision-making levels. In stakeholder associations, their percentage in decision-making functions is even lower because women seldom participate in this kind of organisation. A sample study of water rights shoed that 16 percent of these rights belong to women. In the rural areas, the gender balance in water management is somewhat better, especially in the Indian territories. The current average percentage of women presidents in the rural zones is almost 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Direccion General de Aguas, Maria Angelica Algeria, Ingeniera Jefa Area de Evaluacion de Recursos Hidricos, Chile (this quote does not seem to be from a publication and the publication from which it has been quoted should be added)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Uganda ===

The 1995 Constitution of the [[Republic of Uganda]], Article 33 [2] states "The State shall provide the facilities and opportunities necessary to enhance the welfare of women to enable them to realise their full potential and advancement".&lt;ref name=ugandaconstitution&gt;[http://www.uganda.at/Geschichte/verfassung_der_republik_Uganda_2008.pdf, The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this outlined responsibility, though excluded from official water statutes, has been addressed in the National Gender Policy, National Water Policy, and the Local Government Act. The National Gender Policy lays out a framework for gender-oriented sectoral policy in development. The National Water Policy calls for the inclusion of women at all stages of implementation, noting that "women and men should have equal opportunities to participate fully in all aspects of community management".&lt;ref name=genderwater&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/Gender_Perspectives_Policies.pdf, "The Gender and Water Development Report 2003"], The Gender and Water Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; The local government act requires 30% of the representation on local councils to be women, currently at around 10%.&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt;

=== Kenya ===
[[Kenya]]'s "Country Strategy on Integrated Water Resource Management" addresses the issue of gender and water source:
{{quote|text=As women play an important role in provision,  management and safeguarding of water, particular attention will be placed on adequately incorporating and representing gender considerations in water resource management. The issues will be addressed from two perspectives: facilitating the participation and involvement of both sexes in water resource management; and the access(benefits) of both sexes in availability of water.|sign=Department of Water Management |source=Country Strategy on Integrated Water Resources Management, Section IV. Sectoral Analysis and Policy Recommendations. Poverty and Sustainable Livelihoods.}} The text itself is slighted by critics as not referring to equitable participation and division of workload, as well as benefits. However the Kenyan Women's Bureau has begun to cooperate with the Water Department on these matters, through a focus on environmental management, poverty alleviation, and gender.&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt;

===Malawi===
In [[Malawi]], a group of men managing community water sources was found to be ineffective as they were often absent during the workday. A management group consisting only of women was set up to replace the men, and water supply was reported to have improved. However the burden was too much for the female-only group and communities now split the work with an equitable share of duties.&lt;ref name=MALAWI&gt;Deda, P., Rubian, R., 2004. Women and Biodiversity: The Long Journey from Users to Policy-Makers. Natural Resources Forum, 28(3): 201-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Malawi have also initiative in the maintenance of improved water sources, forming water tap committees composed mostly of women and using the pipelines as footpaths, reporting leaks to the village caretaker.&lt;ref name=WORLDBANK1&gt;World Bank, 1996. Toolkit on Gender in Water and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and capacity development==
In scaling down water projects to the individual level, women have been found to be effective teachers at a domestic levels, and gender-sensitive approaches to water and [[sanitation]] have proven to be cost effective.&lt;ref name=GENDERPERSPECTIVE&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/bground_2.pdf, "A Gender Perspective on Water Resources and Sanitation"], Interagency Task Force on Gender and Water, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eastern Development Region in Nepal,   a small scale water management project under a "Community Water and Sanitation Programme" has shown success in a women-led team, which manages 23 tap stands in a village of the ''Jhapa''' district in addition to running adult literacy programs and latrine construction.&lt;ref name=NEPAL2&gt;Mahapatra, K., 1996. Towards Empowerment:  Women Mobilizers in the Community Water Supply and Sanitation Programme in Nepal. Waterfront,  9:12-13, 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[El Salvador]], The "Watersheds and Gender Project" has taught women technical agricultural knowledge, promoted women as trainers, and fostered female participation in positions previously uniquely occupied by men.&lt;ref name=ELSAVADOR&gt;Agua Project Report, 2002. El Salvador: AGUA Project Evaluation August–September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
Access problems relating to water involve long walking distance to the source, low water quality, lack of a sufficient quantity of water, high water prices and poor system design. Women often suffer disproportionately from these problems. In [[Ghana]], women and children suffer as the result of failed water supply schemes where women consumed unclean water to save money to feed children.&lt;ref name="Ghana"&gt;[http://bscw.ihe.nl/pub/bscw.cgi/d2221893/AmengaEtagoWaterPrivatisationinGhana.pdf, "Water Privatization in Ghana: Womens Rights Under Siege"], Rudolf Amenga-Etego, Coordinator, Advocacy And Campaign Programmes, Integrated Social Development Centre, Accra-Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt; In east [[Nepal]] tap stands and tube wells were located along roads, so that women had to travel long distances or wait until nightfall to avoid being seen by men while bathing freely or washing clothes.&lt;ref name=eastNepal&gt;Regmi, S.C., Fawcett, B., 1999. Integrating Gender Needs Into Drinking Water Projects in Nepal. Gender and Development, 7(3): 62-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
[[File:Schistosomiasis itch.jpeg|thumb|A hand showing [[schistosomiasis]] itch]]
Health and access are often related in gender-related issues of water sourcing. In [[Tanzania]], urinary [[schistosomiasis]] among women and girls was associated with the local practice of washing clothes in water infested with the vectors for the disease. As part of a project to drill wells the washing of clothes at hand pumps had been banned, forcing women to wash clothes in the open, infested water.&lt;ref name=untapped&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/untapped_eng.pdf, "Untapped Connections: Gender, Water, and Poverty"], Women's Environment and Development organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Cholera outbreaks are also of concern, as in Alexandra and KwaZulu, [[South Africa]] following contaminated water use which had been linked by some observers to water supply privatization in some localities.&lt;ref name=Diverting /&gt; In addition, women are often primary caretakers for HIV positive family members who require clean water in treatment, lack thereof can complicate existing effects.&lt;ref name=Diverting /&gt;

==Water and gender in international organizations==
The [[United Nations]] Interagency Network on Women and Gender Equality (IANWGE) established the Gender and Water Task Force in 2003. The Task Force has since become a UN-Water Task Force and is taking responsibility for the gender component of International Water for Life Decade (2005-1015).&lt;ref name=UNWEB&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/TFgender.html, UN Water Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has also called for additional empirical data regarding the issue, as "Neither the quality nor type of data currently collected are adequate to the task of supporting gender [[Millennium Development Goal]]s in water and sanitation".&lt;ref name=letter&gt;[http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/Summary%20of%20EGM%20Report%20on%20Gender-disaggregated%20data-lowres.pdf, Summary Report on Gender-Disaggregated Data on Water and Sanitation], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] Gender and Development Group has also addressed the issue at an institutional level, citing successful "Gender-Mainstreaming" efforts in many of its Water Supply and Sanitation projects.&lt;ref name=WSG&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Water_March07.pdf, "Water, Sanitation and Gender"]&lt;/ref&gt;
