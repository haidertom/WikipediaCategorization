      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23263">'''Artificial intelligence for video surveillance''' utilizes [[computer software]] programs that analyze the images from [[Surveillance cameras|video surveillance camera]]s in order to recognize humans, vehicles or objects. Security contractors program the software to define restricted areas within the camera's view (such as a fenced off area, a parking lot but not the sidewalk or public street outside the lot) and program for times of day (such as after the close of business) for the property being protected by the camera [[surveillance]]. The [[artificial intelligence]] ("A.I.") sends an alert if it detects a trespasser breaking the "rule" set that no person is allowed in that area during that time of day.

The A.I. program functions by using [[machine vision]]. Machine vision is a series of [[algorithm]]s, or mathematical procedures, which work like a flow-chart or series of questions to compare the object seen with hundreds of thousands of stored reference images of humans in different postures, angles, positions and movements. The A.I. asks itself if the observed object moves like the reference images, whether it is approximately the same size height relative to width, if it has the characteristic two arms and two legs, if it moves with similar speed, and if it is vertical instead of horizontal. Many other questions are possible, such as the degree to which the object is reflective, the degree to which it is steady or vibrating, and the smoothness with which it moves. Combining all of the values from the various questions, an overall ranking is derived which gives the A.I. the probability that the object is or is not a human. If the value exceeds a limit that is set, then the alert is sent. It is characteristic of such programs that they are [[Unsupervised learning|self-learning]] to a degree, learning, for example that humans or vehicles appear bigger in certain portions of the monitored image – those areas near the camera – than in other portions, those being the areas farthest from the camera.

In addition to the simple rule restricting humans or vehicles from certain areas at certain times of day, more complex rules can be set. The user of the system may wish to know if vehicles drive in one direction but not the other. Users may wish to know that there are more than a certain preset number of people within a particular area. The A.I. is capable of maintaining surveillance of hundreds of cameras simultaneously. Its ability to spot a trespasser in the distance or in rain or glare is superior to humans' ability to do so.

This type of A.I. for security is known as "[[Logic programming|rule-based]]" because a human programmer must set rules for all of the things for which the user wishes to be alerted. This is the most prevalent form  of A.I. for security. Many video surveillance camera systems today include this type of A.I. capability. The hard-drive that houses the program can either be located in the cameras themselves or can be in a separate device that receives the input from the cameras.

A newer, non-rule based form of A.I. for security called "[[behavioral analytics]]" has been developed. This software is fully self-learning with no initial programming input by the user or security contractor. In this type of [[analytics]], the A.I. learns what is normal behavior for people, vehicles, machines, and the environment based on its own observation of patterns of various characteristics such as size, speed, reflectivity, color, grouping, vertical or horizontal orientation and so forth. The A.I. normalizes the visual data, meaning that it classifies and tags the objects and patterns it observes, building up continuously refined definitions of what is normal or average behavior for the various observed objects. After several weeks of learning in this fashion it can recognize when things break the pattern. When it observes such anomalies it sends an alert. For example, it is normal for cars to drive in the street. A car seen driving up onto a sidewalk would be an anomaly. If a fenced yard is normally empty at night, then a person entering that area would be an anomaly.

== History ==

=== Statement of the problem ===

Limitations in the ability of humans to vigilantly monitor video surveillance live footage led to the demand for artificial intelligence that could better serve the task. Humans watching a single video monitor for more than twenty minutes lose 95% of their ability to maintain attention sufficient to discern significant events.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Mary W. (1999) ''The Appropriate and Effective Use of Security Technologies in  U.S. Schools, A Guide for Schools and Law Enforcement Agencies'', Sandia National Laboratories&lt;/ref&gt; With two monitors this is cut in half again.&lt;ref&gt;Sulman, N.; Sanocki, T.; Goldgof, D.; Kasturi, R., ''How effective is human video surveillance performance?, Pattern Recognition'', ICPR 2008. 19th International Conference on, vol., no., pp.1,3, 8-11 Dec. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Given that many facilities have dozens or even hundreds of cameras, the task is clearly beyond human ability. In general, the camera views of empty hallways, storage facilities, parking lots or structures are exceedingly boring and thus attention is quickly attenuated. When multiple cameras are monitored, typically employing a wall monitor or bank of monitors with split screen views and rotating every several seconds between one set of cameras and the next, the visual tedium is quickly overwhelming. While video surveillance cameras proliferated with great adoption by users ranging from car dealerships and shopping plazas to schools and businesses to highly secured facilities such as nuclear plants, it was recognized in hindsight that video surveillance by human officers (also called "operators") was impractical and ineffective. Extensive video surveillance systems were relegated to merely recording for possible forensic use to identify someone, after the fact of a theft, arson, attack or incident. Where wide angle camera views were employed, particularly for large outdoor areas, severe limitations were discovered even for this purpose due to insufficient resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nuechterlein, K.H., Parasuraman, R., &amp; Jiang, Q. (1983). 
''Visual sustained attention: Image degradation produces rapid sensitivity decrement over time''. Science, 220, 327-329&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases it is impossible to identify the trespasser or perpetrator because their image is too tiny on the monitor.

=== Earlier attempts at solution ===

==== Motion detection cameras ====

In response to the shortcomings of human guards to watch surveillance monitors long-term, the first solution was to add [[Motion detector|motion detectors]] to cameras. It was reasoned that an intruder's or perpetrator's motion would send an alert to the remote monitoring officer obviating the need for constant human vigilance. The problem was that in an outdoor environment there is constant motion or changes of pixels that comprise the total viewed image on screen. The motion of leaves on trees blowing in the wind, litter along the ground, insects, birds, dogs, shadows, headlights, sunbeams and so forth all comprise motion. This caused hundreds or even thousands of false alerts per day, rendering this solution inoperable except in indoor environments during times of non-operating hours.

==== Advanced video motion detection ====

The next evolution reduced false alerts to a degree but at the cost of complicated and time-consuming manual calibration. Here, changes of a target such as a person or vehicle relative to a fixed background are detected. Where the background changes seasonally or due to other changes, the reliability deteriorates over time. The economics of responding to too many false alerts again proved to be an obstacle and this solution was insufficient.

=== Advent of true video analytics ===

Machine learning of visual recognition relates to patterns and their classification.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Domingos, ''The Master Algorithm: How the
Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World'', September 22, 2015 Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, E. R. (2012) ''Computer and Machine Vision, Fourth Edition: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities'' Academic Press, Waltham Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; True video analytics can distinguish the human form, vehicles and boats or selected objects from the general movement of all other objects and visual static or changes in pixels on the monitor. It does this by [[pattern recognition|recognizing patterns]]. When the object of interest, for example a human, violates a preset rule, for example that the number of people shall not exceed zero in a pre-defined area during a defined time interval, then an alert is sent. A red rectangle or so-called "bounding box" will typically automatically follow the detected intruder, and a short video clip of this is sent as the alert.

== Practical application ==

=== Real-time preventative action ===

The detection of intruders using video surveillance has limitations based on economics and the nature of video cameras. Typically, cameras outdoors are set to a wide angle view and yet look out over a long distance. Frame rate per second and dynamic range to handle brightly lit areas and dimly lit ones further challenge the camera to actually be adequate to see a moving human intruder. At night, even in illuminated outdoor areas, a moving subject does not gather enough light per frame per second and so, unless quite close to the camera, will appear as a thin wisp or barely discernible ghost or completely invisible. Conditions of glare, partial obscuration, rain, snow, fog, and darkness all compound the problem. Even when a human is directed to look at the actual location on a monitor of a subject in these conditions, the subject will usually not be detected. The A.I. is able to impartially look at the entire image and all cameras' images simultaneously. Using statistical models of degrees of deviation from its learned pattern of what constitutes the human form it will detect an intruder with high reliability and a low false alert rate even in adverse conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Dufour, Jean-Yves, ''Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems'', John Wiley Publisher (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Its learning is based on approximately a quarter million images of humans in various positions, angles, postures, and so forth.

A one megapixel camera with the onboard video analytics was able to detect a human at a distance of about 350' and an angle of view of about 30 degrees in non-ideal conditions. Rules could be set for a "virtual fence" or intrusion into a pre-defined area. Rules could be set for directional travel, object left behind, crowd formation and some other conditions.

==== Talk-down ====

One of the most powerful features of the system is that a human officer or operator, receiving an alert from the A.I., could immediately talk down over outdoor public address loudspeakers to the intruder. This had high deterrence value as most crimes are opportunistic and the risk of capture to the intruder becomes so pronounced when a live person is talking to them that they are very likely to desist from intrusion and to retreat. The security officer would describe the actions of the intruder so that the intruder had no doubt that a real person was watching them. The officer would announce that the intruder was breaking the law and that law enforcement was being contacted and that they were being video-recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Hantman, Ken (2014) [http://perimeterprotectivesystems.com/content/about-video-analytics/ ''What is Video Analytics, Simply Explained'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verified breach report ====

The police receive a tremendous number of false alarms from burglar alarms. In fact the security industry reports that over 98% of such alarms are false ones. Accordingly, the police give very low priority response to burglar alarms and can take from twenty minutes to two hours to respond to the site. By contrast, the video analytic-detected crime is reported to the central monitoring officer, who verifies with his or her own eyes that it is a real crime in progress. He or she then dispatches to the police who give such calls their highest priority.

==== Continuing advances ====

Analytics work with [[digital camera]]s or [[analog camera]]s that have [[analog-to-digital converter]]s. Various companies aside from VideoIQ and Avigilon offer video analytics. In many cases the software samples down to standard definition or less, regardless of the camera's resolution. The advance achieved by Avigilon is true analytics on up to exceedingly high-resolution 30 megapixel cameras.

== Behavioral analytics  ==

=== Active environments ===

While rule-based video analytics worked economically and reliably for many security applications there are many situations in which it cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Derek, ''Finding &amp; Selling The Value of Analytics'', SDM Magazine (Sept 2015) BNP Media II, Troy Michigan&lt;/ref&gt; For an indoor or outdoor area where no one belongs during certain times of day, for example overnight, or for areas where no one belongs at any time such as a [[Cell site|cell tower]], traditional rule-based analytics are perfectly appropriate. In the example of a cell tower the rare time that a service technician may need to access the area would simply require calling in with a pass-code to put the monitoring response "on test" or inactivated for the brief time the authorized person was there.

But there are many security needs in active environments in which hundreds or thousands of people belong all over the place all the time. For example, a college campus, an active factory, a hospital or any active operating facility. It is not possible to set rules that would discriminate between legitimate people and criminals or wrong-doers.

==== Overcoming the problem of active environments ====

Using behavioral analytics, a self-learning, non-rule-based A.I. takes the data from video cameras and continuously classifies objects and events that it sees. For example, a person crossing a street is one classification. A group of people is another classification. A vehicle is one classification, but with continued learning a public bus would be discriminated from a small truck and that from a motorcycle. With increasing sophistication, the system recognizes patterns in human behavior. For example, it might observe that individuals pass through a controlled access door one at a time. The door opens, the person presents their proximity card or tag, the person passes through and the door closes. This pattern of activity, observed repeatedly, forms a basis for what is normal in the view of the camera observing that scene. Now if an authorized person opens the door but a second "tail-gating" unauthorized person grabs the door before it closes and passes through, that is the sort of anomaly that would create an alert. This type of analysis is much more complex than the rule-based analytics. While the rule-based analytics work mainly to detect intruders into areas where no one is normally present at defined times of day, the behavioral analytics works where people are active to detect things that are out of the ordinary.

A fire breaking out outdoors would be an unusual event and would cause an alert, as would a rising cloud of smoke. Vehicles driving the wrong way into a one-way driveway would also typify the type of event that has a strong visual signature and would deviate from the repeatedly observed pattern of vehicles driving the correct one-way in the lane. Someone thrown to the ground by an attacker would be an unusual event that would likely cause an alert. This is situation-specific. So if the camera viewed a gymnasium where wrestling was practiced the A.I. would learn it is usual for one human to throw another to the ground, in which case it would not alert on this observation.

==== What the artificial intelligence 'understands' ====

The A.I. does not know or understand what a human is, or a fire, or a vehicle. It is simply finding characteristics of these things based on their size, shape, color, reflectivity, angle, orientation, motion, and so on. It then finds that the objects it has classified have typical patterns of behavior. For example, humans walk on sidewalks and sometimes on streets but they don't climb up the sides of buildings very often. Vehicles drive on streets but don't drive on sidewalks. Thus the anomalous behavior of someone scaling a building or a vehicle veering onto a sidewalk would trigger an alert.

==== Varies from traditional mindset of security systems  ====

Typical alarm systems are designed to not miss true positives (real crime events) and to have as low of a false alarm rate as possible. In that regard, burglar alarms miss very few true positives but have a very high false alarm rate even in the controlled indoor environment. Motion detecting cameras miss some true positives but are plagued with overwhelming false alarms in an outdoor environment. Rule-based analytics reliably detect most true positives and have a low rate of false positives but cannot perform in active environments, only in empty ones. Also they are limited to the simple discrimination of whether an intruder is present or not.

Something as complex or subtle as a fight breaking out or an employee breaking a safety procedure is not possible for a rule based analytics to detect or discriminate. With behavioral analytics, it is. Places where people are moving and working do not present a problem. However, the A.I. may spot many things that appear anomalous but are innocent in nature. For example, if students at a campus walk on a plaza, that will be learned as normal. If a couple of students decided to carry a large sheet outdoors flapping in the wind, that might indeed trigger an alert. The monitoring officer would be alerted to look at his or her monitor and would see that the event is not a threat and would then ignore it. The degree of deviation from norm that triggers an alert can be set so that only the most abnormal things are reported. However, this still constitutes a new way of human and A.I. interaction not typified by the traditional alarm industry mindset. This is because there will be many false alarms that may nevertheless be valuable to send to a human officer who can quickly look and determine if the scene requires a response. In this sense, it is a "tap on the shoulder" from the A.I. to have the human look at something.

==== Limitations of behavioral analytics ====

Because so many complex things are being processed continuously, the software samples down to the very low resolution of only [[Common_Intermediate_Format|1 CIF]] to conserve computational demand. The 1 CIF resolution means that an object the size of a human will not be detected if the camera utilized is wide angle and the human is more than sixty to eighty feet distant depending on conditions. Larger objects like vehicles or smoke would be detectable at greater distances.

==== Quantification of situational awareness  ====

The utility of artificial intelligence for security does not exist in a vacuum, and its development was not driven by purely academic or scientific study. Rather, it is addressed to real world needs, and hence, economic forces. Its use for non-security applications such as operational efficiency, shopper heat-mapping of display areas (meaning how many people are in a certain area in a retail space), and attendance at classes are developing uses.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, Illy, ''The Evolution of Video Analytics'', Security Sales &amp;  Integration magazine (August 11, 2012) Security Sales &amp; Integration, Framingham MA&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are not as well qualified as A.I. to compile and recognize patterns consisting of very large data sets requiring simultaneous calculations in multiple remote viewed locations. There is nothing natively human about such awareness. Such multi-tasking has been shown to defocus human attention and performance. A.I.s have the ability to handle such data. For the purposes of security interacting with video cameras they functionally have better visual acuity than humans or the machine approximation to it.  For judging subtleties of behaviors or intentions of subjects or degrees of threat, humans remain far superior at the present state of the technology. So the A.I. in security functions to broadly scan beyond human capability and to vet the data to a first level of sorting of relevance and to alert the human officer who then takes over the function of assessment and response.

Security in the practical world is economically determined so that the expenditure of preventative security will never typically exceed the perceived cost of the risk to be avoided. Studies have shown that companies typically only spend about one twenty-fifth the amount on security that their actual losses cost them.&lt;ref&gt;Bressler, Martin S.,
''The Impact of Crime on Business: A Model of Prevention, Detection &amp; Remedy'', Journal of Management and Marketing Research (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; What by pure economic theory should be an equivalence or homeostasis, thus falls vastly short of it. One theory that explains this is [[cognitive dissonance]], or the ease with which unpleasant things like risk can be shunted from the conscious mind. Nevertheless, security is a major expenditure, and comparison of the costs of different means of security is always foremost amongst security professionals.

Another reason that future security threats or losses are under-assessed is that often only the direct cost of a potential loss is considered instead of the spectrum of consequential losses that are concomitantly experienced. For example, the vandalism-destruction of a custom production machine in a factory or of a refrigerated tractor trailer would result in a long replacement time during which customers could not be served, resulting in loss of their business. A violent crime will have extensive public relations damage for an employer, beyond the direct liability for failing to protect the employee.

Behavioral analytics uniquely functions beyond simple security and, due to its ability to observe breaches in standard patterns of protocols, it can effectively find unsafe acts of employees that may result in workers comp or public liability incidents. Here too, the assessment of future incidents' costs falls short of the reality. A study by [[Liberty Mutual|Liberty Mutual Insurance Company]] showed that the cost to employers is about six times the direct insured cost, since uninsured costs of consequential damages include temporary replacement workers, hiring costs for replacements, training costs, managers' time in reports or court, adverse morale on other workers, and effect on customer and public relations.&lt;ref&gt;''Safety Index Report'', Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The potential of A.I. in the form of behavioral analytics to proactively intercept and prevent such incidents is significant.

In [[applied mathematics]] and [[statistics]], '''basis pursuit denoising''' (BPDN) refers to a [[mathematical optimization]] problem of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\min_x \frac{1}{2}\|y-Ax\|^2_2+\lambda\|x\|_1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter that controls the trade-off between [[Sparse vector|sparsity]] and reconstruction fidelity, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;N \times 1&lt;/math&gt; solution vector, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;M \times 1&lt;/math&gt; vector of observations, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;M \times N&lt;/math&gt; transform matrix and &lt;math&gt;M &lt; N&lt;/math&gt;. This is an instance of [[convex optimization]] and also of [[quadratic programming]].

Some authors refer to basis pursuit denoising as the following closely related problem:
:&lt;math&gt;\min_x \|x\|_1 \;\textrm{subject} \ \textrm{to}\;\;\|y-Ax\|^2_2 \le \delta&lt;/math&gt;
which, for any given &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, is equivalent to the unconstrained formulation for some (usually unknown ''a priori'') value of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. The two problems are quite similar. In practice, the unconstrained formulation, for which most specialized and efficient computational algorithms are developed, is usually preferred.

Either types of basis pursuit denoising solve a [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] problem with a trade-off between having a small residual (making &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; close to &lt;math&gt;Ax&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the squared error) and making &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; simple in the &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt;-norm sense. It can be thought of as a mathematical statement of [[Occam's razor]], finding the simplest possible explanation (i.e. one that yields &lt;math&gt;\min_x \|x\|_1&lt;/math&gt;) capable of accounting for the observations &lt;math&gt; y&lt;/math&gt;.

Exact solutions to basis pursuit denoising are often the best computationally tractable approximation of an underdetermined system of equations.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Basis pursuit denoising has potential applications in statistics (c.f. the [[Lasso (statistics)#Lasso method|LASSO]] method of [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]]), [[image compression]] and [[compressed sensing]].

As &lt;math&gt;\lambda \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; (or when &lt;math&gt;\delta = 0&lt;/math&gt;), this problem becomes [[basis pursuit]].

Basis pursuit denoising was introduced by Chen and Donoho in 1994, in the field of signal processing. In statistics, it is well known under the name [[Lasso (statistics)|LASSO]], after being introduced by Tibshirani in 1996.

==Solving basis pursuit denoising==
The problem is a convex quadratic problem, so it can be solved by many general solvers, such as [[interior point method]]s. For very large problems, many specialized methods that are faster than interior point methods have been proposed.

Several popular methods for solving basis pursuit denoising include the [[in-crowd algorithm]] (a fast solver for large, sparse problems&lt;ref&gt;See ''The In-Crowd Algorithm for Fast Basis Pursuit Denoising'', IEEE Trans Sig Proc 59 (10), Oct 1 2011, pp. 4595 - 4605, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5940245], demo [[MATLAB]] code available [http://molnargroup.ece.cornell.edu/files/InCrowdBeta1.zip]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[homotopy continuation]], [[fixed-point continuation]] (a special case of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140216231347/http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~srbecker/wiki/Forward_Backward_Algorithm forward backward algorithm]) and [[spectral projected gradient for L1 minimization]] (which actually solves [[Lasso (statistics)#Lasso method|LASSO]], a related problem).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">The '''Center of Molecular Immunology''' ('''Centro de Inmunología Molecular''') or '''CIM''', is a [[cancer]] research institution located on the west side of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. {{Coord|23.0755|-82.4708}} Opened on December 5, 1994, it focuses on the research and production of new [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the treatment of cancer and other nontransmissible diseases.

==Facilities==
The design and construction of the Center of Molecular Immunology  was modeled on current [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] guidelines recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] and adopted by Cuba, particularly those also adopted by the member countries of the European Union, then known as the European Community.

Research labs, production areas and administrative offices share the 15,000 square meters of the two floor facility.

Approximately 800 employees work at the CIM, most of them scientists and engineers. These personnel are administratively organized in three main areas: Research and Development, Production, and Quality Assurance.

==Research==
Basic research projects are focused on [[cancer immunotherapy]], especially the development of molecular vaccines. These include [[antibody]] engineering, cellular engineering, [[bioinformatics]] and regulation of the [[immune response]].

CIM conducts clinical trials in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy of varying origin, as well as other immune system diseases, in highly specialized hospitals.

In August 2011 it was announced that the Center of Molecular Immunology released [[CimaVax-EGF]], the first therapeutic [[cancer vaccine]] for [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-09/cuba-releases-worlds-first-lung-cancer-vaccine|title=Cuba Announces Release of the World's First Lung Cancer Vaccine|publisher=PopSci|date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, a new therapeutic cancer vaccine was approved by Cuban regulatory agency. CIMAbid (racotumomab or 1E10)obtained conditional approval for the treatment of lung cancer. This vaccine is an antiidiotypic vaccine targeting N-glicolil GM3, a tumor specific antigen. The project leader was Dr Ana María Vazquez. These vaccine has been associated with statistically significant extension of survival of lung cancer patients  with excellent safety profile and continues to be investigated in confirmatory clinical trials. {{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Products==

Today CIM produces biopharmaceutical products, such as anti-CD3 [[monoclonal antibody]] for the treatment of patients with organ [[transplant rejection]], human recombinant [[erythropoietin]] for the treatment of [[anemia]], [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] for the treatment of [[neutropenia]], and a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the epidermal growth factor receptor for cancer treatment, as well as other monoclonal antibodies for [[tumor]] imaging.

==Commercialization==

Since 1992 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] has been devoted to the commercialization of [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the [[Cuba]]n market and abroad, especially [[monoclonal antibodies]] and other recombinant proteins for the diagnosis and treatment of [[cancer]] and other diseases related to the [[immune system]].

[https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] is the exclusive representative for the commercialization of the products and services of the Center of Molecular Immunology.

It was announced in July 2008 that CIM had also received approval from the Cuban regulatory authorities for a lung cancer vaccine, targeting EGFR.  The vaccine has been in development since 1992 and the project led by Gisela Gonzalez.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11335">'''ClearCurve''' is [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]]'s brand name for a new [[optical fiber]] that can be bent around short-radius curves without losing its signal. It is constructed with a conventional fiber on the inside, surrounded by a cladding containing a new nanostructured reflector. ClearCurve is hundreds of times more flexible than conventional optical cable, transmitting high-quality signals even when wrapped around small objects like a pen, where a conventional cable would lose the signal completely.

Although originally introduced to serve the needs of pulling fiber in apartment buildings and other high-density units where conventional fiber is too inflexible, in 2009 [[Intel]] announced their intention to use it as the basis of a new computer interconnect system code-named [[Light Peak]]. ClearCurve's small size and high bandwidth capabilities offer great improvements over existing copper wiring in this role, and Intel is positioning Light Peak as a truly universal bus that can carry any existing traffic over a single cable.

==Background==
===Conventional fiber===
[[Image:Optical fiber cable.jpg|thumb|right|Conventional single-mode long-haul optical fiber cable.]]

Conventional optical fiber consists of a thin inner cylindrical core of glass or plastic with a similar material layered in a thin coating around it. Slight differences in the [[index of refraction]] between the two layers causes [[total internal reflection]], trapping a light beam inside the inner core. This process is limited to a [[total internal reflection#Critical angle|critical angle]]; when the light beam approaches the interface at a shallow angle most of it will be reflected, but as it gets closer to the critical angle more and more will travel through the interface and be lost.&lt;ref name=works&gt;Craig Freudenrich, [http://www.howstuffworks.com/fiber-optic.htm "How Fiber Optics Work"], How Stuff Works&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical angle depends on the relative difference in index of refraction, larger differences will increase the critical angle and trap more light. However, changing the index of refraction in most materials generally changes its mechanical properties too, which means that different types of cables are used for different purposes. Cables intended to be highly efficient over long runs are generally less flexible, while those that require higher flexibility are generally only useful for shorter distances. Even cables designed to be flexible, like [[TOSLINK]], are less flexible than a similar sized [[Flexible cables|braided copper cable]].

To keep the fibers as straight as possible, most high-performance optical cables use a form of armour that resists tight bending. This is normally a helical winding, similar to [[BX cable]], or a series of straight fibers running parallel to the core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcelect.com/fibercable.htm "The Basics of Fiber Optical Cable"]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the armour is fairly large, the cables normally carry a number of fibers inside. The resulting armoured bundle is then surrounded in an environmental cladding, typically plastic. The bundle is about the size of a conventional power cable found on an electrical appliance, but much less flexible.

===Fiber to the home===
Optical cabling has long formed the backbone of major terrestrial networks, delivering signals over long distances. The signals are then converted into other forms at the company [[end office]]s, and distributed from there in some other form, typically telephone wiring or coax cable in the case of [[cable television]]. The multi-fiber armoured cable is well suited to this role.

Since the 1990s there has been an ongoing effort to supply [[fiber to the home]] (FTTH). Using fiber to deliver signals all the way to the home provides the same advantages as it does on the longer hauls, namely much higher bandwidth, lower costs, and less interference with other sources. However, given the deliberate lack of flexibility of the cable, these installations generally end in a utility room where they are converted to copper for distribution within the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftthcouncil.eu/documents/studies/FTTH-Definitions-Revision_January_2009.pdf "Definition of Terms"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, FTTH Council, 9 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While this sort of installation is useful for individual dwellings, it is less useful in large multi-unit dwellings. Corning estimates that an apartment installation would require an average of twelve right angle turns between the distribution point and the units. Conventional fiber would lose the signal after one or two such bends, making it useless in this role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com/clearcurve/single_mode/bendable.aspx "The ultimately flexible fiber"], Corning, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case for individual homes, the fiber can be converted to copper for the last section of delivery, but the longer runs demand much higher performance, larger cable. Finding room to run these cables in an existing structure may not be possible.

==ClearCurve==
ClearCurve fibers are constructed in a fashion similar to existing cables, starting with a traditional glass fiber in the center. ClearCurve then adds a third layer to the sandwich, a plastic sheath that is infused with microscopic reflectors. Light that passes through the conventional interface has a second chance to be reflected back into the center of the fiber. In the corners of tight bends, the reflectors serve to increase the amount of signal retained within the cable, allowing ClearCurve to be hundreds of times more flexible than conventional cables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com:80/clearcurve/index.aspx "Bend the rules"], Corning, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mehta/&gt; A thin environmental sheath is added on the outside.

Unlike conventional fibers, ClearCurve does not have to be held straight, and therefore eliminates the armour. Lacking armour, there is no lower limit to the size of a ClearCurve cable, which can be as small as a single fiber, although normally they contain two fibres, one upstream and one down. Two-fiber ClearCurve cables are smaller than the wire on a typical [[computer mouse]], yet the high-performance single-mode versions carry 25&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s over long lengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com/clearcurve/single_mode/high_speed.aspx "Nearly unlimited bandwidth for broadband"], Corning, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video demonstration, Corning showed a ClearCurve drop cable being wrapped dozens of times around a small metal rod, and suffering almost no signal loss and providing a perfect video feed. A conventional cable wrapped around the same rod completely lost the signal after only two turns.

===FTTH uses===
ClearCurve is the end result of a Corning research project looking for products better tailored to the fiber to the home market.&lt;ref name=mehta&gt;Stephanie Mehta, [http://www.corning.com/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=23567 "Bend It Like Corning"], ''Fortune'', 6 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Running since 1988 at their Sullivan Park research center in [[New York (state)|New York]], Corning announced ClearCurve at a press event on 19 September 2007 and showed it publicly at the FTTH Conference later that month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com/opticalfiber/news_and_events/news_releases/2007/2007091902.aspx "Corning to Introduce ClearCurve Product Suite at FTTH Conference"], Corning press release, 19 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ClearCurve, a FTTH installation can use existing armoured cabling to deliver the signal to a utility room, then connect individual ClearCurve cables to the fibers in the bundle for distribution within the building. This sort of installation dramatically simplifies the overall complexity of FTTH wiring in multi-unit dwellings, eliminating both the large coax cabling and the need to convert formats from light to electrical. Users were quickly forthcoming; announced in September, only a month later an official press release announced that Connexion Technologies would be using ClearCurve on 30 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-171924288.html "Corning Cable Systems Announces First Sale of ClearCurve Product Solution"], ''Business Wire'', 30 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Since then many additional partners have been announced.

===Computer bus uses===
The single-mode fibers used in conversional telecommunications applications have high performance, but require expensive light sources and highly accurate mechanical positioning in order to gather light from them. In comparison, [[Multi-mode optical fiber|multi-mode]] have wider cores that are easier to connect to and can be effectively driven by lower-cost devices like solid-state IR lasers or [[vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser]]s (VCSELs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/neets/tm/106-10.htm "Mode Theory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215024923/http://www.tpub.com/neets/tm/106-10.htm |date=2009-12-15 }}, Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-mode fiber found some uses in [[high-performance computing]] applications, notably the [[Fibre Channel]] system for high speed disks and some [[parallel computing]] interconnection systems. However, the relatively inflexible cables made them less useful in general roles, where braided copper wiring remains widespread. Fiber has found one consumer use, the [[TOSLINK]] cable used in [[digital audio]] applications. This role uses lower quality multi-mode plastic fibre with limited bandwidth, about 125&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, driven by red [[LED]]s. However, advances in computers have demanded ever increasing bandwidth, and modern [[computer bus]] systems are quickly reaching their limits. There was some discussion of moving to optical fiber for the [[USB3]] standard, but the decision was made to move ahead with copper.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Shankland, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9780794-1.html "USB 3.0 brings optical connection in 2008"], ''cnet'', 18 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Corning announced a multi-mode version of ClearCurve cabling on 13 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2009/2009011301.aspx "Corning Announces Multimode Version of ClearCurve Optical Fiber"], Corning press release, 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It has greater bandwidth than any common copper wiring, and is at least as flexible as copper wiring able to carry the same amount of data. Although it was mentioned only in passing, Intel's new [[Light Peak]] interconnection system uses ClearCurve cabling as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Crothers, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10363956-64.html "Sources: 'Light Peak' technology not Apple idea"], ''cnet news'', 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Light Peak uses a two-fiber cable running at 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s in both directions. Unlike most optical connection systems, Light Peak is being designed to allow daisy-chaining and supply power through a set of coaxial copper wires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13312">The [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] of [[lacquerware]] prevents and mitigates deterioration or damage to objects made with [[lacquer]]. The two main types of lacquer are Asian, made with [[sap]] from the [[Urushi]] tree, and European, made with a variety of [[shellac]] and [[Resin|natural resins]]. Lacquer can be damaged by age, light, water, temperature, or damaged substrate.

Conservation treatments include dry cleaning, wet cleaning, consolidation and filling losses. Eastern cultures use Asian lacquer to repair damages and fill and consolidate losses. Western cultures typically use alternate materials that can be reversed with minimal risk to the original object.

== Production and History of Lacquer ==
Lacquer is a type of [[varnish]] or surface coating, which is diluted with [[solvent]] and applied in several coats to seal a substrate, hardening via a [[chemical reaction]] to create a seal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Lacquer|title=Lacquer - Wiki|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main categories of lacquer: [[Asia]]n lacquer and [[Europe]]an lacquer.

=== Asian Lacquer ===
[[File:Ryukyu Lacquer.jpg|thumb|Ryukyu Lacquer Production, Okinawa, Japan]]
Traditional Asian lacquer has been used for centuries&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bishopmuseum.org/research/pdf/cnsv-lacquer.pdf|title=Bishop Museum Art Conservation Handout: Lacquer|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from [[sap]], prominently that from the Urushi tree; part of the [[sumac]] family grown throughout [[Japan]], [[China]] and [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianart.org/collections/conservation-of-asian-lacquer|title=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Conservation of Asian Lacquer|website=www.asianart.org|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sap from the tree contains a [[chemical compound]] called [[Urushiol|urishol]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;that hardens when exposed to [[humidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Stuart|date=1987-01-01|title=SCIENCE SCOPE: Japanese Urushi: The Finishing Touch|jstor=41731914|journal=Archaeology|volume=40|issue=4|pages=62–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sap is processed to remove [[Impurity|impurities]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lacquer: Technology and conservation: A comprehensive guide to the technology and conservation of Asian and European lacquer.|last=Webb|first=Marianne|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2000|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of lacquerware involves a process of applying a ground layer,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-01/the-conservation-of-oriental-lacquer/|title=The Conservation of Oriental Lacquer|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; oftentimes lacquer mixed with other substances such as [[clay]] or a layer of [[Textile|fabric]], followed by many very thin layers of processed lacquer to a substrate, typically [[wood]], and allowing them to dry completely,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; then curing and [[polishing]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== European Lacquer ===
Developed in the [[17th century|17th Century]], European Lacquerware, or [[Japanning]], was influenced by the import of Asian lacquerware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kisluk-Grosheide|first=Danielle O.|date=1984-01-01|title=A Japanned Cabinet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/1512814|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|volume=19/20|pages=85–95|doi=10.2307/1512814|issn=0077-8958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanned objects are made with a variety of [[shellac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urushi-kobo.com/conservation-restoration.html|title=URUSHI-KOBO in EUROPE - CONSERVATION/ RESTORATION|website=www.urushi-kobo.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and natural [[resin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-52/the-development-of-english-black-japanning-1620-1820/|title=The development of English black japanning 1620-1820|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of Deterioration ==

=== Age ===
When it is produced, lacquer is a very durable substance, both waterproof and [[Solubility|insoluble]]. With age, lacquer can begin to breakdown and deteriorate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[File:Black lacquer box from China, lacquer on wood with silver, 20th century, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|An example of Asian Lacquerware; a 
20th-century Chinese lacquer box.
]]

=== Light ===
Lacquerware is very sensitive to exposure to [[light]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which causes [[photodegradation]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COUEIGNOUX|first=CATHERINE|date=2009-01-01|title=AQUEOUS CLEANING OF PHOTODEGRADED EAST ASIAN LACQUER: A CASE STUDY|jstor=27784652|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=48|issue=1|pages=51–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; fading and discoloration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Water ===
Photodegraded lacquer is extremely sensitive to humidity and [[water]]. Exposure to water and other [[polar solvent]]s can cause blanching, whitening of the surface from the formation of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Temperature ===
High temperatures along with moisture can cause [[Thermochromism|thermochromatic]] change to the lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webb|first=Marianne|date=1998-01-01|title=Methods and Materials for Filling Losses on Lacquer Objects|jstor=3179915|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=37|issue=1|pages=117–133|doi=10.2307/3179915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Damage to the Substrate ===
The supporting structure can be damaged or lost from the effects of expanding and contracting in changing [[Collections care|environmental conditions]], including temperature and humidity, from [[Museum integrated pest management|pest]] damage, or deterioration from age. The damaged support may cause warping, lifting or cracking of the lacquer coating.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Previous Restoration ===
Previous restoration such as fills and overpainting can degrade and potentially damage original surfaces over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/treatment-of-mazarin-chest/|title=A Collaborative Approach|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==

=== Preventive Conservation ===
[[Preventive conservation|Preventive Conservation]] measures can be used to avert damage to lacquerware caused by deterioration. Preventive methods may include limiting exposure to light to a maximum of 40 years at 100 [[lux]] or 80 years at 50 lux,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; maintaining stable temperature and humidity levels, using safe and proper art handling with gloves and proper art storage, per current professional [[museum]] standards such as those from the [[American Alliance of Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/collections-stewardship|title=Museum Standards and Best Practices - Collections Stewardship|website=www.aam-us.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation Treatment ===
Conservation treatment methods vary depending on the individual object and the materials used in its production.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Asian lacquer and European lacquer have different [[Chemical property|chemical properties]], and therefore require different materials and techniques for treatment. Prior to conservation treatment, conservators and conservation scientists analyze and document the properties of the work to determine the best methods and materials for its treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/lacquers/|title=Characterization of European and Asian Lacquers|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional conservators use codes of ethics for best practices, such as those from the [[American Institute for Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.Vx0XxjArI2w|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|website=www.conservation-us.org|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eastern and Western Techniques ====
Different conservation techniques are used to conserve Asian lacquerware in Eastern and Western cultures. Traditionally, Eastern cultures use Asian lacquer to repair damages and fill and consolidate losses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Asian lacquer is [[Toxicity|toxic]] and requires training and expertise to use. The material is also not easily [[:wikt:reversibility|reversible]] nor readily available to attain for conservation use. Western cultures, less familiar with the techniques of producing, applying or curing lacquer, typically use alternate materials for conservation treatment, particularly those that can be reversed with minimal risk to the original object.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/aam_phase2/pdf_assets/files/000/000/208/original/Williams_2008_Conservation_of_Asian_Lacquer.pdf?1384300665|title=Conservation of Asian Lacquer Case Studies at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|last=Williams|first=Jane|date=2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Dry Cleaning =====
Dry cleaning is the process of removing dirt and grime from the surface of the object without the use of solvents. Tools used for dry cleaning of lacquerware can include soft brushes, microfiber cloths, cotton swabs, and fine celled absorbent sponges.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===== Wet Cleaning =====
Wet cleaning is the process of further removal of dirt, grime and residue from the surface of the object that is not successfully removed by dry cleaning. Testing of various solvents should be done prior to wet cleaning the surface of the object in order to prevent possible damage to or removal of the original lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Aqueous solution|Aqueous]] solvents with different [[PH]] levels will have varying levels of success in the removal of dirt and grime from the surface of the lacquer, and have various levels of risk of damaging the surface. This also depends on the condition of the object prior to cleaning. [[Nonpolar solvent|Nonpolar]] solvents are less likely to damage surfaces that have been photodegradad.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Consolidation =====
Consolidation is the process of stabilizing lifting and cracked areas of lacquer to minimize further damage and loss.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Consolidants used can include Asian lacquer or other [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] or organic  [[adhesive]]s such as [[animal glue]] or [[Paraloid B-72]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Adhesives can be thinned with solvents in order to be wicked beneath layers of lifting lacquer or into cracks and allowed to dry while securing the loose area in place.

===== Filling Losses =====
Different types of fill materials are used for European and Asian lacquerware. Losses caused by damage to the lacquer surface can be structural or aesthetic. Losses should only be filled if the surrounding areas are stable, without potential of damage from the fill material. Trained Eastern conservators may choose to use Asian Lacquer as a fill for losses, while Western conservators may use alternate materials such as waxes, polyester resins and epoxy resins. Completed fills can then be inpainted to match the surrounding lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor murals''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[mural]]s, and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

== History ==

[[Mural]]s are most commonly defined as wall paintings, works of art integrated into a specific architectural space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''mural'' is derived from the Latin word ''murus'', meaning wall. Walls have long provided a direct support for aesthetic, political, and social ideas expressed with paint. Cave paintings could be considered the earliest murals, followed over time by wall paintings in tombs, temples, churches, civic buildings, and a variety of outdoor spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern murals grow out of this long tradition. From the beginning of the 20th century, murals have had a significant presence in the architecture of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years murals have changed just as everyday life has changed. Murals were painted on church walls and carved into stone or wood on the outside, to educate those who cannot read.  The tradition has carried on to today’s churches. Visual images and language are one of the most powerful forms of communication, both then and more so now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspective Realia - History of Murals|url = http://www.art.utah.edu/murals/What_We_Do/History_of_Murals.html|website = www.art.utah.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals today share much of the history from past murals, though today’s murals can depict anything. The major job of murals today is to band communities together. In an age where everything is materialistic, and most of us don’t know our neighbors let alone anyone else in our community, finding a way to bring people together can be difficult. Murals have a very positive effect on communities, bring people together and bring pride to the community, and that pride tends to stay and spread to other parts of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspective Realia - History of Murals|url = http://www.art.utah.edu/murals/What_We_Do/History_of_Murals.html|website = www.art.utah.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterioration  ==

Outdoor contemporary murals are generally seen as temporary installation, varying from 10 to 20 years due to weathering and vandalism. Outdoor murals are susceptible to, depending on their physical location, extreme weather conditions. A few of the biggest problems facing murals are graffiti, physical destruction, and desaturation as the paint layers weather and are exposed to UV. UV radiation causes cracking, color change and fading. Oxidation chain reactions are the culprit on a chemical level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.conservators-converse.org/2012/05/40th-annual-meeting-architecture-session-may-10-preservation-of-outdoor-public-murals-research-and-public-outreach-by-amanda-norbutus/|title = AIC's Annual Meeting » AIC’s 40th Annual Meeting – Architecture Session, May 10, "Preservation of Outdoor Public Murals: Research and Public Outreach" by Amanda Norbutus|date = May 21, 2012|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|publisher = |last = Norbutus|first = Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental conditions are a major factor in mural deterioration. Freeze-thaw cycles and capillary rise affect the architectural support of the mural and lead to salt efflorescence, cracking, and lifting of the paint layers if incompatible paints or coatings are used and the mural extends to ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals that face South in direct UV rays are susceptible to fade and also binder deterioration.

== Conservation ==
Murals are traditionally commissioned on private buildings and structures, leaving ownership of the mural in the hands of the owner of the building. Gaining permission to conduct conservation is a key first step in the process. Annual inspections of mural will contribute to it lifetime. Inspections are encouraged to take place during the spring season. This will allow for any damage done during the winter months to not be overseen, and will also allow for conservation to being and take place during the summer.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Preventive conservation can take place before a mural begins. Such as preparing the wall properly and using high-quality, lightfast, and compatible materials—is fundamental. Other preventive actions (e.g., regular maintenance, graffiti removal, and community awareness) can help preserve murals. Much of the damage seen on murals is due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance. Sadly, regular maintenance is not always a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building maintenance is also important to the life of the mural. Communities are aware of well-respected buildings, community engagement is important to continue to spread the word about preserving the sight of the mural. Continue to maintain the grounds that the building reside on. A well maintained building will deter vandalism and also [[litter]]ing around the property. These are all preventive steps that can me undertaken by the community at large, contributing to the murals dialog of bringing a community together.

=== Graffiti ===
[[Graffiti]] plagues the presence of many murals, especially those found within city limits. Graffiti is often seen as a form of territory, and once it premiers on a location it invites others to participate in the act of vandalism. Involving the youth of the community with mural project directly is seen as a way to prevent future graffiti, giving them a profound connection and education with and about the project.

If graffiti is present on a mural, it must be removed in a safe and effective manner that does not directly harm the image beneath it. For this reason, removal should be undertaken by a conservator or an artist/technician familiar with the piece after consultation with or under the supervision of a conservator. Removal without adequate testing, or by an individual without adequate experience or supervision, can irreparably harm the mural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caring for an Existing Mural|url = https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/art/murals-murales/caring-eng.aspx|website = www.cci-icc.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-12-11|last = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===
As murals deteriorate, owners and agencies have several treatment options. They may ask the artist to repaint or restore the work, or they may call a conservator who could either treat the mural according to strict conservation guidelines or work with the artist to conserve and possibly restore the work. With contemporary murals, there are many instances of restoration or even re-creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this takes place it is advised to look back for an existing plan set out before the mural project began planning the steps of its conservation, if and when needed. This document should articulate who will be the lead of the project; conservator, artist, committee etc. and will also state who will approve the conservation work need to be performed. 

A conservator should ideally perform the analysis of the state of the mural and outline procedures and materials need to be performed. This should all then be taken into consideration with the expectations of the community and also the owner of the mural (owner of the building).

A '''corner solution''' is a special solution to an [[Agent (economics)|agent]]'s [[Maximization (economics)|maximization]] problem in which the quantity of one of the arguments in the maximized function is [[0 (number)|zero]]. In non-technical terms,:3 a corner solution is when the chooser is either unwilling or unable to make a tradeoff.  In economics when someone says "I wouldn't buy that at any price" or "I will do X no matter the cost", those are corner solutions.  Another example is "zero-tolerance" policies, or parents who are unwilling to expose their children to any risk, no matter how small and no matter what the benefits of the activity might be.  "Nothing is more important than my child's safety" is a corner solution in its refusal to admit there might be tradeoffs.  The term "corner solution" is sometimes used by economists in a more colloquial fashion to refer to these sorts of situations.  The word "corner" refers to the fact that if one graphs the maximization problem, the optimal point will occur at the "corner" created by the budget constraint and one axis.

A corner solution is an instance where the "best" solution (i.e. maximizing profit, or utility, or whatever value is sought) is achieved based not on the market-efficient maximization of related quantities, but rather based on brute-force boundary conditions. Such a solution lacks [[mathematical elegance]], and most examples are characterized by externally forced conditions (such as "variables ''x'' and ''y'' cannot be negative") that put the actual [[local extrema]] outside the permitted values.

The more usual solution will lie in the non-zero interior at the point of tangency between the [[objective function]] and the constraint. For example, in [[consumer theory]] the objective function is the [[indifference curve|indifference-curve]] map (the [[utility function]]) of the consumer.  The budget line is the constraint.  In the usual case, constrained utility is maximized on the budget constraint with strictly positive quantities consumed of both goods.  For a corner solution, however, utility is maximized at a point on one axis where the budget constraint intersects the highest attainable indifference curve at zero consumption for one good with all income used for the other good.  Furthermore, a range of lower prices for the good with initial zero consumption may leave quantity demanded unchanged at zero, rather than increasing it as in the more usual case.

Another technical way to state it is that a corner solution is a solution to a minimization or maximization problem where the non-corner solution is infeasible, that is, not in the domain. Instead, the solution is a corner solution on an axis where either ''x'' or ''y'' is equal to zero. For instance, from the example above in economics, if the maximal utility of two goods is achieved when the quantity of goods ''x'' and ''y'' are (−2,&amp;nbsp;5), and the utility is subject to the constraint ''x'' and ''y'' are greater than or equal to 0 (one cannot consume a negative quantity of goods) as is usually the case, then the actual solution to the problem would be a corner solution where ''x'' = 0.

'''Dartmoor kistvaens''' are  burial tombs or [[cist]]s from the late [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]], i.e. from c 2500 BC to c 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Phil|title=The Field Archaeology of Dartmoor|year=2011|publisher=English Heritage|location=Frome|isbn=978-1-84802-033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kistvaen]]s have been found in many places, including [[Dartmoor]], a {{convert|954|sqkm|abbr=in}} area of [[moorland]] in south [[Devon]], England. The box-like stone tombs were created when the ancient people of the area lived in [[Grimspound#The hut circles|hut circles]]. Cists are often to be found in the centre of a [[cairn circle]] although some appear solitary which could be the result of the loss of an original slight mound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Jeremy|title=Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities: Vol. 5. - The Second Millennium B.C.|year=1997|publisher=Devon Books|location=Tiverton|isbn=0861149106}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 180&lt;ref name="Newman 2011, p.51"&gt;Newman 2011, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; known cists on Dartmoor although there could be up to 100 that remain buried underneath unexplored cairns.&lt;ref&gt;Of the cairns excavated by the Dartmoor Exploration Committee 12% contained buried cists which would suggest around 100 cists remain concealed, Butler 1997, p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; In the South West there are no cists to be found on the Quantock Hills, only 2 to be found on Exmoor and 58 to be found on Bodmin Moor.&lt;ref name="Newman 2011, p.51"/&gt; The Dartmoor cists are unique in that about 94% have the longer axis of the tomb oriented in a NW/SE direction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Kist off merrivale row-4.jpg|thumb|left|Kistvaen to the south of the [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]] [[stone row]]s]]

==Description==
The word "kistvaen" is derived from the Cornu-Celtic ''Cist-veyn'' or ''Cist-vyin''; in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the word is ''Cist-faen''. All these names mean "a stone chest" (''cist'' is a chest or box, ''maen'' is a stone). Kistvaens are formed using four or more flat stones for the sides and for the ends, and a larger flat stone (the "capstone") for the cover. Some kistvaens are surrounded by circles of erected stones. In general, if a body was to be buried without cremation, it was placed into a kistvaen in a [http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/images/Kistvaen3.gif contracted position]. If on the other hand a body was [[cremate]]d, the [[wood ash|ash]]es were usually put in a [[cinerary urn]], and then the urn was placed in a kistvaen.

However, the majority of the known Dartmoor kistvaens were opened at some time in the past, and whatever they used to hold is missing. The cists were probably robbed in the hope of finding [[treasure]]. Kistvaens were known by many [[common name]]s, including "money pits", "money boxes", "crocks of gold", "caves", "Roman graves" and so on. The idea that ancient tombs might contain valuable items is a very old one; one of the first mentions of searching [[tumuli]] in Devon dates back to 1324. Permission to search was granted by [[Edward II of England]].&lt;ref name="The Reliquary &amp; illustrated archæologist"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZQSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA161| last =Allen| first = John Romilly |author2=[[John Charles Cox]]| title =DARTMOOR KISTVAENS| work =| publisher =London, Bermose and sons Limited| date =January 1895| accessdate = 2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently archaeologists usually use the word [[cist]] when talking about kistvaens, but in the past 120+ years other terms have been used, including "chest", "maen" or "vaen", "a stone" "a stone coffin" and so on.&lt;ref name="The tomb raiders"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/tomb_raider.htm|title=The tomb raiders|accessdate=2009-05-31|publisher=legendarydartmoor.co.uk|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
Tombs of the dead were traditionally regarded as sacred places by the people of Dartmoor. However the various treasure-related common names for these burial sites caused some people to break the [[taboo]] that tombs must be revered and not disturbed. As a result of this tomb-raiding, stories came into being which purport to show that a graverobber's inappropriate and greedy actions will be punished in supernatural ways.

One of the legends is about "the [[parson]]", although this may possibly have been someone's [[nickname]] rather than the title of a real man of the cloth. Either way, the story says he made a map of all of the nearby kistvaens, showing the locations as black dots. Very soon his map had more black dots than a [[Psyllobora vigintiduopunctata|ladybird]] has on its back. The lure of the kistvaens was so great that the parson (and a few other people who agreed to help him) opened every kistvaen that was marked on his map.

After this, the parson was seen counting money every night. His wealth did not make him happy, and neither did it last long. One night a huge electrical storm moved over the [[moorland|moor]]s. Furious [[lightning]] was followed again and again almost immediately by very loud [[thunder]]. Nobody could sleep for the noise of the storm.

Surprisingly the next morning there was very little damage to be seen. Actually all the houses around were intact, except for one house&amp;nbsp;— the house of the parson. His house was in ruins, and it was still burning. Some neighbors even thought they smelled burning [[Fire and brimstone|brimstone]]. Presumably the [[devil]] himself had made the parson pay for desecrating the kistvaens.&lt;ref name="The tomb raiders"/&gt;

===The Money Pit kistvaen story===
This story features a very friendly, good-natured farmer. Once he had a dream about a kistvaen close to his farm. In his dream he saw that the kistvaen was filled with money. Next day he went there, and with a huge effort he managed to move the capstone, and started to dig.

As he dug, a huge [[raven]] circled overhead, mocking him, and encouraging him to dig deeper and deeper. Eventually the farmer put his hand inside, and pulled out a small piece of [[flint]], shaped in the form of a heart. He took his find home. After this incident, his personality changed radically: he became mean and angry, and he lost all his friends. His life became miserable. About a year later, his young son found the flint in the house, and took it outside to play with it. Then the boy went out onto the moor to look for something else to play with, and he dropped the flint as he went along.

On that same day the farmer changed once again, reverting to the "jolly farmer" he had always been until the unfortunate day when he opened the kistvaen.&lt;ref name="The Money Pit"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/money_pit.htm|title=The Money Pit|accessdate=2009-05-31|publisher=legendarydartmoor.co.uk|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These structures have existed for many centuries and after falling out of use and their function having been forgotten the more substantial earth or stone examples have attracted names such as ''Roman Trenches'', ''Old Fortifications'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The hinds were the main target of the hunt.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Silz cerf8.jpg|thumb|290px|Red Deer stags and hinds]]
Deer hay winds, folds and elricks were sites where by means of traps wild deer were killed or caught. Evidence that during Saxon times deer hunting was taking place in this fashion survives in a tract written by a 10th-century monk called Ælfric who wrote "''I weave myself nets and set them in a suitable place and urge on my dogs so that they chase the wild animals until they come into the nets unawares and are thus ensnared and I kill them in the nets.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Saxon documents 'Deer Parks' are recorded to as 'Derhage' or 'Deer-hay'. The Saxon word ''haga'' means a palisade or pale, an enclosure, hedge, or set of nets&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JZ7GlfI8UToC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=How+were+Deer+hayes+used?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=toP0x4LJYd&amp;sig=roOVjtpC5bi_C89-TdDVhvQxvOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTu5-miIjPAhVmLcAKHcPgDn8Q6AEIOTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=How%20were%20Deer%20hayes%20used%3F&amp;f=false Wharton's Pocket Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm#H Forests and Chases in England and Wales, c. 1000 to c. 1850. A Glossary of Terms and Definitions.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also regarded as the etymological root of the word hay. The term ''haga'' or hay effectively came to mean a deer park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''haga'', ''hage'', ''hege'', ''haia'', etc. all relate to the managing of deer.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doomsday Book]] records 31 parks with a few still held by Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; The 'deer-hays' of Anglo-Saxon times would have been more or less temporary structures although some may have developed into places where deer were kept until such a times as they were needed at which point they would be killed.&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

Imparkment developed from the 12th to the 14th centuries, reaching its peak in the early 1300s at which time around 3,200 parks in England covered up to 2% of the total land area representing about a quarter of the country’s woodland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'elerc' or 'erelc' in Gaelic originally meant 'ambush' and later meant a 'deer trap' described as a funnel-like defile, artificial or natural into which deer were herded so that they could be contained and then killed. The personal or place name '[[Elrick]]' is linked to such deer traps.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic name ''Tainchell'' was the term used for the group of beaters who took part.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic word 'eilid' means a hind and this association may explain why the word after linguistic evolution in Wigtownshire to 'eileirg' or ' eileirig' with the meaning of 'deer-trap' and the local place-names 'Eldrig', 'Elrig', 'Elrick', etc. derive from this source and some of the defiles used in the hunt can still be identified.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and function==
[[File:Ordnance gazetteer of Scotland - a survey of Scottish topography, statistical, biographical, and historical (1882) (14804905703).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quillisfield or Coilsfield House.]]
The capture and movement of deer from the wild or from established deer hays or parks was necessary for establishing new ones and for restocking existing ones to replace animals lost via excessive hunting or disease and at times to introduce new breeding stock to maintain vigour in isolated and inbred populations. Deer might also be managed in terms of castrating stags and selectively culling diseased or elderly animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In feudal times the monarch would at times make gifts of live deer to those who were in the royal favour to replenish or establish herds, and a system of capturing deer therefore had to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coilsfield Deer Hay, Tarbolton - ditch system with parallel banks, South Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|thumb|250px|A section of the Parkmoor Deer Hay trenches at Coilsfield]]
To create a deer park the person had to own the land, purchase a license from the monarch and have sufficient funds to empark the area, constructing pales and ditches, deer leaps or salters, etc. Some parks even had towers from which the deer could be shot with bows and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thirty-seven parks or hays are listed in the Domesday Book, and of these nine belonged to the king, five by bishops or monastic houses and twenty three by Norman knights, etc. These hays or parks were isolated in the countryside by physical land divisions such as pales with ditches and served to protect the deer which were to be used for hunting and to help keep out predators whilst also preventing wild deer from eating crops in areas where farming was prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term 'fence month' was applied to the time during fawning and to the annual rut time in the autumn during which the deer were not disturbed and this restricted the period when deer hay winds and elricks could be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both wattle fencing and nets may have been employed in the 'wynding of the deer hay' and it was also important that the animals could be separated into small groups to reduce the chance of them goring each other by accident.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; A wide entrance that narrowed down on a gently rising slope would also slow their progress when pursued by hounds and places where people could hide,&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; possibly with hounds until required would be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The beaters would also separate the stags from the hinds if required.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Elricks or deer hay winds were a places in Scotland and England&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; where deer could be channelled and confined in a corral, a practice that ceased to be used in the 18th century although the practice had a brief resurgence in the days of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Stone lined pits and boulders once heated in fires have been found in association with elricks which may have been used to cook or render the venison from the newly slaughtered animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; A deer hunt of this type was recorded in the medieval romance ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

The native Red Deer ([[Cervus elaphus]]) and later introduced Fallow Deer ([[Dama dama]]) are suited for enclosure in deer parks however European Roe Deer ([[Capreolus capreolus]]) are not as they are aggressive towards other deer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt; Fallow Deer were introduced by the Normans from [[Sicily]], probably in the early twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Deer Hays and Elricks===
[[File:Windy Gill, Water of Fail, Tarbolton.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Windy Gill and the Water of Fail]]
Near Parkmill Farm on Parkmoor (NS 4425 2693), [[Tarbolton]] in [[South Ayrshire]] is a complex system of interlinking deep trenches running down to the Water of Fail that were given the name 'Roman Trenches'.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; The local historian John Smith circa 1895 examined them and also identified what he regarded as an ''Ancient British Stockade'' which had been taken following a siege by Roman troops during which the 'Roman Trenches' were built.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the trenches are still around 9 feet deep and are recorded to have once been much deeper.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; They lie within a few hundred metres from a medieval deer park's boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parkmoor Roman Trenches, Tarbolton.jpg|thumb|upright|The Parkmoor 'Roman trenches']]
In 1428 it is recorded that [[John Stewart of Darnley|John Stewart]] of [[Darnley]] near Glasgow held a deer park with a ditch, bank and pale in the Tarbolton area.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, page 215&lt;/ref&gt; Place names such as Parkmoor, Parkmill and Parkhill reflect the existence of a deer park in this area and a park with a building and pale is recorded on the 1654 map of Kyle by the cartographer Blaeu&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; taken from an earlier map by [[Timothy Pont]]. Herman Moll's map of 1732 shows at least four deer parks in the vicinity of Parkmoor at [[Fail Monastery|Fail Abbey]], Park Mill, at Coilsholm Wood and at Barskimming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.nls.uk/view/00000274 The South Part of the Shire of Air, containing Kyle and Carrick by H. Moll]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once known as 'Quillisfield' the estate was given to the monks of [[Melrose Abbey]] by [[John de Graham|Sir John de Graham]] of [[Dunduff Castle|Dunduff]], Lord of Tarbolton in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harpguitars.net/blog/2011/10/hgg9-scheduled-events/ 'Coilsfield' by Nathaniel Gow]&lt;/ref&gt; After the reformation Coilsfield Castle and Estate was acquired by the Cunninghames of Caprington, it was then sold to the Montgomerie family in 1661. In around 1847 the Coilsfield estate was sold to William Orr who had agreed to become the heir of the architect of the house, John Paterson, on the understanding that he would change his name to Paterson but and also buy the Coilsfield estate, renaming it Montgomerie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://landedfamilies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/189-arthur-of-carlung-house-barshaw.html Landed Families of Britain and Ireland.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The RCAHMS describes these features on the old Coilsfield Estate as an "''irregular series of artificially-cut ditches run roughly parallel in a SE-NW direction down a gently W-facing and wooded slope at c70m OD. They are closely spaced, mostly V-shaped, and range from 0.5m to 2.0m in depth with little evidence of upcast banking. Some conjoin to form wider channels which fade at the steeper slopes above the water of Fail.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/42710/parkmill RCAHMS Parkmoor 'Roman Trenches']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nuthill Estate, 'Old Fortifications'.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The 'Old Fortifications' at Nuthill.]]
Taylor has associated the local place names of Wyndford and Windy Gill at Parkmoor with an early 16th-century reference to the ''winding of the hay yard'' to catch deer at the Nuthill Estate in Fife and has suggested that this made reference to the construction of wattle fencing and nets along the line of the trench banks in preparation for catching deer and that the system of trenches may have been known as a 'wynd'.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scots language]] the word 'Wynd' has been used since at least the 13th century to describe frequently winding, narrow streets or alleys which aptly describes the appearance of known deer hay winds and elricks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/wynd_n_2 Scots Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and wynding would be the creation of narrow alleys or entrances.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; At Parkmoor the deer would naturally enter the Windy Gill to drink&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; and could then be driven by men and hounds towards the deer hay wind. The area that was supposed by John Smith to be an ''Ancient British Stockade'' and the area later used as a bowling green may have been involved in the processing of the deer by comparison with the use of elricks.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the Nuthill Estate in Fife (NO234079) are a system of trenches surveyed by Thomas Winter in 1757 and recorded as 'The Trenches are Old Fortifications' or 'Roman Trenches'. This complex system of trenches and banks are located near the old royal hunting park of Falkland.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is considered to have been used to capture deer from the Lomond Hills by corralling them and then taking suitable hinds and stags to the nearby royal hunting park.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The Falkland Treasurers Accounts of 1505 refer to a payment of 14 shillings to "''John Balfour for ranging through the countryside with bloodhounds to drive the deer to the park''" and for the "''winding of the hay yard to catch them''".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Fields or enclosures called ‘Deerends’ are recorded just to the west of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onomastics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Falkland-to-Strathmiglo-13-Sept-2014-leaflet.pdf Living Lomonds Landscape Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Glen of the Bar - geograph.org.uk - 1465166.jpg|thumb|200px|The Glen of the Bar elrick]]
At Nuthill at least seven trenches can still be discerned with a present-day depth of up to 2 metres and a length of 150 to 200 metres. Some are cut through the bedrock and they curve towards each other towards the west at the bottom of a slope that joins a water course. The glen or gill then acts as a natural channel that runs towards the old Falkland Deer Park and the Lomond Hills lie above.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; A number of place names suggest the past use of the site such as 'Deerends', 'Greyhound Den' and 'Burn of Deer'.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; 

Indications of similar systems of trenches exist at [[Chillingham Castle|Chillingham Park]] in [[Northumberland]] and [[Erringden]] Park in Yorkshire, additionally "''Montrose's Camp''" near [[Fyvie Castle]] has features in common with deer hay winds famously militarily utilised by [[Fyvie Castle|Montrose]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kington, Worcestershire|Kington]] in Worcestershire is recorded to have had a deer hay.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; 

The as yet unidentified system of trenches and banks at the High Parks in the Cadzow Wood area (NS 7343 5347) of [[Chatelherault Country Park]] have a number of characteristics in common with deer hay winds and are located in an area closely associated with the hunting of deer by royalty and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/45727/cadzow Cadzow - Canmore entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some deer hay winds may have consisted of banks and ditches several kilometres long that were used to direct deer for the purpose of capture&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; such as with the so-called "''Deil's Dyke''" near [[New Cumnock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bob_newcumnock/deilsdyke_B/ History of the Parish of New Cumnock]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elricks have been identified at [[Dalkeith]] and others may have existed at the Glen of the Bar in Galloway, on the [[Isle of Rum]] and on the [[Isle of Jura]] where in one case stone walls may have channelled the deer into a corral.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual 'deer trap' may have been the function of a structure with foot high walls at Wet Sleddle Slack near [[Shap]] in [[Cumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

A relevant quote here is that "''Deer hunting has left physical traces on the landscape in the form of banks and dykes used either as park boundaries or for trapping the deer''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bob_newcumnock/deilsdyke_B/ History of the Parish of New Cumnock]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Micro-history==
The fourteenth century treatise ''The Book of Hunting'' illustrates a scene ''The Gathering before the Stag Hunt'' which clearly portrays wattle fencing of the kind used in a deer hay wind.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; 

The town of [[Hayes and Harlington Urban District|Hayes]] in West Middlesex derives its name from the presence of a deer hay in the area.

The village of [[Elrick]] near Aberdeen is named after an elrick and the surname 'Elrick' is common in the area.

In 1559 seven acres of land near Tarbolton named Longhuntflat was leased by John Stewart and his wife Helen Cunninghame of Halrig.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Doctor of Musical Arts''' ('''D.M.A.''') is a [[doctorates|doctoral]] [[academic degree]] in music. The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually [[Performance|music performance]], [[music composition]], or [[conducting]]) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as [[music history]], [[music theory]], or [[Music education|music pedagogy]]. The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the master's and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional [[performance|performers]], [[conducting|conductors]], and [[musical composition|composers]]. As a [[terminal degree]], the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in [[musicology]] or [[music theory]] typically enter a [[Ph.D.]] program, rather than a D.M.A. program.

==Terminology==
The degree is also abbreviated as '''DMA''' (without periods), '''D.Mus.A.''' or '''A.Mus.D.'''. For the related degree [[Doctor of Music]], the abbreviation is '''D.M.''' or '''D.Mus.''' For the related degree [[Doctor of Arts]], the abbreviation '''D.A.''' is used.

==Types==
===Concentrations===
The D.M.A. is widely available in the concentrations of performance (sometimes with a specialization in instrumental or voice pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title [[Doctor of Music]] (D.M. or D.Mus.) or [[Doctor of Arts]] (D.A.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/music/degree_programs/grad_degrees.html The University of Mississippi – Department of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; or Doctor in Musical Studies (Ph.D.) instead of D.M.A. The D.M.A. degree was pioneered by Howard Hanson and the [[National Association of Schools of Music]], who approved the first D.M.A. programs in 1952. Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the D.M.A.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Latimer, "The Nation's First D.M.A. in Choral Music," ''Journal of Historical Research in Music Education'', 32.1 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boston University]] offered its first D.M.A. program in 1955. In 2005, Boston University also expanded into [[online music education]] by launching the first online doctoral degree in music, a D.M.A. program (along with a [[Master of Music]] program) in [[music education]].&lt;ref&gt;As of November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of U.S. institutions offer the D.M.A. degree in the 2010s. The Ph.D. is generally considered to be more research oriented, while other doctorates may  place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component. Such distinctions among degree types are not always so clear-cut, however. For instance, most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written [[dissertation]], regardless of degree designation. The music education degree can be a D.M.A. or Ph.D.  Also, music education Ph.D. programs may include performance-oriented tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida State University – Conducting Degrees|url=http://www.music.fsu.edu/Areas-of-Study/Conducting/Degree-Programs|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In composition, one may study for either the D.M.A. or the Ph.D., depending on the institution. The Ph.D. is the standard doctorate in [[music theory]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], and [[ethnomusicology]].
===Sacred music===
A related program is the Doctor of Sacred Music (D.S.M.), also ''Sacrae Musica Doctor'' (S.M.D.), which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music, choral conducting and organ performance.  In the past, some seminaries titled the degree Doctor of Church Music (D.C.M.).  Only one U.S. institution, [[Claremont Graduate University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claremont Graduate University – Doctor of Church Music|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8740.asp|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; still offers the D.C.M. degree, in addition to the more typical D.M.A.  The vast majority of U.S. seminaries have closed their music doctorate programs, but some still offer a Master of Arts or Master of Sacred Music degree. A new program offered at [[Perkins School of Theology]] is the Doctor of Pastoral Music (D.P.M.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smu.edu/Perkins/FacultyAcademics/degrees/dpm/Apply Perkins School of Theology – Doctor of Ministry Program]&lt;/ref&gt;  While more theology-based and housed within the [[Doctor of Ministry]] (D.Min.) program, admission to the degree requires applicants to hold a Master of Music (M.Mus.), Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.), Master of Church Music (M.C.M.), M.A. in Church Music or equivalent 48 semester hour degree recognized by the National Association of Schools of Music.

==Components==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
D.M.A. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons or mentoring with a professor or instructor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many D.M.A. programs, all of the different D.M.A. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses. Many D.M.A. programs require students to pass a [[comprehensive exam]] on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory. The last stage of the D.M.A. degree is usually the completion of a [[thesis]], [[dissertation]], or research project and the performance of [[recital]]s, usually including at least one lecture-recital.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area within music, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing a D.M.A. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history or Baroque-era dance.

Some institutions permit D.M.A. students to do a sub-specialization in a field ''outside'' music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a D.M.A. in [[piano pedagogy]] may be able to do a sub-specialization in the university's department of psychology (e.g., on the psychology of learning and memory); a student completing a D.M.A. in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub-specialization in the department of [[computer engineering]] (e.g., in computer programming).

While teaching experience is not an official part of most D.M.A. programs, most D.M.A. candidates will have the opportunity to work as a [[teaching assistant]] or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree, either as a requirement of their scholarship/assistantship package or as a part-time employee of the university. D.M.A. students can teach in an area related to their D.M.A. program, or, if they have multiple skill areas (e.g., a person with an M.Mus. in piano performance who is doing a D.M.A. in composition), they may teach in another area.

==Admission requirements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
To be admitted to a D.M.A. degree program, most institutions require a master's degree, such as a M.Mus. degree or an M.A. degree in music or an equivalent course of study, usually with a grade average of "B+" or higher. D.M.A. programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recital—i.e. several advanced pieces from a wide range of styles—in addition to orchestral excerpts. Admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings of live performances. Programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school (or similar) teaching experience, and may further require an example of scholarly writing.

Newly admitted D.M.A. students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history, theory, and sometimes ear-training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles gained in prior study. Advanced courses in these areas are not permitted until the tests are passed and/or remedial coursework in deficient area(s) is completed. Often, the knowledge of a second language – one of languages of major influence in music history (such as German, French, Italian, Spanish, or Russian) – is required to complete the degree. The graduate admissions branch of many US universities require applicants to complete the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE), a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math, vocabulary, and analytical writing. While the outcome of the GRE test may affect an applicant's eligibility for some university-wide scholarships, it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university.

== Brief history ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
After World War II, there had been a sharp rise in music education at the university level. As was the case with many occupations, the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the U.S. Armed Forces. The G.I. Bill was an impetus for many opting for college, causing a spike in demand for college professors, across all disciplines, and a spike in enrollment. In music education, universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians, but many, including those of international rank, lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors. Post World War II also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities. The Nation's renowned conservatories, such as [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] and [[Curtis Institute of Music|Curtis]], at the time, saw no need for the degree – yet many [[alumni]] of those institutions, and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education.

In 1952, after six years of deliberation, the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] (NASM) approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work "in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided." The NASM was, and still is, the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the [[American Council on Education]]. In 1952, 143 music schools had already established standards for undergraduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;"NTSTC One of 32 Colleges for Graduate Study in Music", ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', December 31, 1942, Sec I, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The national launch of DMA by institutions meeting criteria was 1953.

* [[Eastman School of Music]] (the DMA degree was approved by the State of New York Board of Regents in 1953)
* [[Boston University]]
* [[University of Southern California]]

The Dean of the [[University of Rochester]] [[Eastman School of Music]], Howard Harold Hanson (1896–1981), who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925, was one of several high-profile advocates of creating a performance oriented doctors degree.

In 1953, he published a proposal for a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, which was roundly criticized by Paul Henry Lang, PhD, professor of musicology at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Degrees to Musicians – Dissenters Claim Title Not Necessary", ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', November 15, 1953, p. 9F&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Doctor of Musical Arts conferred'''
* 1954: Mathias "Matt" Higgins Doran, DMA (born 1921), [[University of Southern California]]
* 1955: [[Will Gay Bottje]], DMA (born 1925), [[Eastman School of Music]] – some sources attribute Bottje as having been the first in the nation to earn the degree&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6AAKBSlQAxMC&amp;pg ''Howard Hanson: In Theory and Practice''], by Allen Laurence Cohen, p. 14, [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] (2004) {{OCLC|52559264}} {{ISBN|9780313321351}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 1955: Edward F. Gilday, Jr., DMA, [[Boston University]]

'''Non-NASM institutions'''

The alumni of Music conservatories in the United States also seek positions at universities.  The conservatories that are not affiliated with the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] began offering DMAs in the late 1960s.

* 1971: Margaret Hee-Leng Tan, [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] – she is the first woman to earn a DMA from Juilliard; Juilliard added the degree in 1969, the year it moved to [[Lincoln Center]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4423">'''E-NABLE''' is a distributed, [[Open-source model|Open Source]] community that creates and shares open source designs for assistive devices. It is known for creating the first [[3D printing|3D printable]] prosthetic hand and sharing the designs and code for bioelectric limbs.

== History ==
In 2011, [[Ivan Owen]] created a metal, functional puppet hand for a [[Steampunk]] costume. After posting a video of the hand on YouTube, he was contacted by South African carpenter Richard Van As who had lost his fingers in a woodworking accident. Owen and Van As worked on prototypes of a prosthetic hand, before Owen decided to incorporate 3D printing into the design process. This led to the creation of the first 3D printed mechanical hand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://enablingthefuture.org/about/|title=ABOUT US|date=2014-01-15|work=Enabling The Future|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharing of the design of this hand on an [[Open licenses|Open License]] led to the creation of the community. 

The e-NABLE community "started with around 100 or so people who were simply offering to print the files that were already in existence".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Chapters of the organisation exist in many countries, and each works in different ways. For example, one Canadian chapter recycles excess plastic waste to create the prosthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/228565/halifax-e-nable-branch-recycling-plastic-weed-container-lids-into-3d-printed-prosthetic-limbs/|title=Halifax e-NABLE Branch Recycling Plastic Weed Container Lids into 3D Printed Prosthetic Limbs {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chapter in Aden, Yemen, is producing prosthetic hands for people injured in Yemen's civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://enablingthefuture.org/2018/01/02/e-nabling-aden-yemen/|title=e-NABLING Aden – Yemen|date=2018-01-02|work=Enabling The Future|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open Source nature of the project is enabling diverse groups around the world to create prosthetics for people within their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://buffalonews.com/2018/10/27/three-western-new-york-students-receive-prosthetic-hands-designed-for-them-by-other-kids/|title=Three WNY students receive prosthetic hands designed for them by other kids|date=2018-10-27|work=The Buffalo News|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Colombian engineer called Christian Silva has created superhero-themed prosthetic arms for children. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/120465/iron-man-e-nable-hand/|title=Three Year Old Gets His Own Iron Man e-NABLE Prosthetic Hand {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, an [[Iron Man]]-themed arm created by Albert Menero was given to a child by Iron Man actor [[Robert Downey Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Microsoft Office 365|title=The Collective Project: Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a Real Bionic Arm|date=2015-03-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEx5lmbCKtY|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
The E-nable website contains a tool called the “Handomatic,” which is used to fit prosthetic hands according to the measurements of the individual recipient. The tool then creates a custom design which can then be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/science/hand-of-a-superhero.html?linked=facebook|title=Hand of a Superhero|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hundert Jahre Bilder aus der Stadt Zürich - Das Polytechnikum 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Polytechnikum'' in 1865]]
[[File:ETH Zentrum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|ETH Zürich Zentrum]]
ETH was founded on 7 February 1854 by the Swiss Confederation and began giving its first lectures on 16 October 1855 as a polytechnic institute (''eidgenössische polytechnische Schule'') at various sites throughout the city of Zurich.&lt;ref name=hist45-55&gt;{{cite web |title=1848–1855: The polytechnical realisation of a long-held dream |url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/portrait/history/epochs/1848-1855.html |publisher=ETH Zürich |accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially composed of six faculties: [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[forestry]], and an integrated department for the fields of [[mathematics]], natural sciences, literature, and social and [[political science]]s.

It is locally still known as ''Polytechnikum'', or simply as ''Poly'', derived from the original name ''eidgenössische polytechnische Schule'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/ |title=ETHistory 1855-2005 |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=2005 |website=ETHistory  |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to "'''federal polytechnic school'''".

ETH is a ''federal'' institute (i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government), whereas the [[University of Zürich]] is a ''[[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]]'' institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time; the liberals pressed for a "federal university", while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/besichtigungen/epochen/debatte1/index_EN |title=1848-1855: Polytechnical realization of an old dream |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=31 March 2005 |website=ETHistory |accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, both universities were co-located in the buildings of the University of Zürich.

From 1905 to 1908, under the presidency of [[Jérôme Franel]], the course program of ETH was restructured to that of a real university and ETH was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1909 the first doctorates were awarded. In 1911, it was given its current name, ''Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule''. In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. However, it now has 16 departments.

ETH Zurich, the EPFL, and four associated research institutes form the "''ETH Domain''" with the aim of collaborating on scientific projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain/overview |title=ETH Domain |publisher=ETH Board |location=Zurich and Berne, Switzerland |date= |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ETH Zurich is ranked among the top universities in the world. Typically, popular [[College and university rankings|rankings]] place the institution as the best university in continental Europe and ETH Zurich is consistently ranked among the top 1-5 universities in Europe, and among the top 3-10 best universities of the world.

Historically, ETH Zurich has achieved its reputation particularly in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. There are [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|32 Nobel Laureates]] who are associated with ETH. The most recent Nobel Laureate is [[Richard F. Heck]] who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in chemistry in 2010. Albert Einstein is perhaps its most famous alumnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ALBERT EINSTEIN (1879 – 1955) |url=http://www.zuerich.com/en/Visitor/Information/facts/famous-zurich-residents/albert-einstein.html|journal=Zuerich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the [[QS World University Rankings]] placed ETH Zurich at 7th overall in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QS World University Rankings |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2019 |website=Top Universities |publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds |accessdate=16 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ETH was ranked 5th in the world in Engineering, Science and Technology, just behind the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]], [[Cambridge University]] and [[National University of Singapore]].

In a comparison of Swiss universities by [http://rankingswissup.ch/ swissUP Ranking] and in rankings published by [http://www.che.de CHE] comparing the universities of German-speaking countries, ETH Zurich traditionally is ranked first in natural sciences, computer science and engineering sciences.

In the survey [http://www.excellenceranking.org CHE ExcellenceRanking] on the quality of Western European graduate school programmes in the fields biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, ETH was assessed as one of the three institutions to have excellent graduate programmes in all considered fields, the other two being the [[Imperial College London]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. ETH Zurich had a total budget of 1.885 billion CHF&lt;ref name=AR2017/&gt; in the year 2017.

==Admission and education==
{{ETH Institutes}}
[[File:ETH Dome.jpg|thumb|left|Students and locals in ETH front courtyard]]
For Swiss students, ETH is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures. Like every public university in Switzerland, ETH is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the ''[[Matura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Admission to the first semester with a Swiss matriculation certificate ("Matura") | work=ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/swiss-matriculation.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants from foreign countries are required to take either the ''reduced entrance exam'' or the ''comprehensive entrance exam'' although some applicants from several European countries are exempted from this rule. An applicant can be admitted to ETH even without any verifiable educational records by passing the ''comprehensive entrance exam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Admission to first semester without Swiss matriculation certificate |work= ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/other-certificates.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Examinations are often held during examination sessions which are immediately before the beginning of the next semester (only a few select courses offer an exam immediately after the semester ends). After the first year of study, bachelor students must pass a block examination of all courses taken in the first year, called the ''Basisprüfung''. If the weighted average score is not sufficient, a student is required to retake the entire ''Basisprüfung'' which usually means having to re-sit the whole first year. About 50% of the students fail the ''Basisprüfung'' on the first try and many of them choose to drop out of the course instead of repeating the ''Basisprüfung''.
The structure of examinations in higher academic years is similar to the ''Basisprüfung'' (Basis examination), but with a higher success rate.
The regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and three or four further semesters for the [[Master of Science]] degree. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis.

Education at ETH Zurich generally focuses more on theoretical aspects than application and most degree programs contain a high amount of [[mathematics|mathematical training]]. The main language of instruction in undergraduate (Bachelor) studies is German and for admission a proof of sufficient knowledge of the German language is required for Bachelor students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Language requirements | work=ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/other-certificates/language-requirements.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master's programmes and doctoral studies are in English.

[[File:ETH-Hoenggerberg-2008.jpg|thumb|320px|ETH Hönggerberg with the new HIT building]]
ETH Zurich has two campuses. The main building was constructed 1858–1864 outside and right above the eastern border of the town, but nowadays it is located right in the heart of the city. As the town and university grew, the ETH spread into the surrounding vineyards and later quarters. As a result, the ''Zentrum'' campus consists of various buildings and institutions throughout Zürich and firmly integrates the ETH in the city. The main building stands directly across the street from the [[University Hospital of Zurich]] and the [[University of Zurich]].

Because this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the ''Hönggerberg'' on a northern hill in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003; since then, the ''Hönggerberg'' location houses the departments of [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[materials science]] and [[physics]].

===Main building===
[[File:ETH Zürich Hauptgebäude, Ansicht von der Polyterasse 2011-08-06 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|Main building as seen from ''Polyterrasse'']]
[[File:ETH Zürich im Abendlicht.jpg|thumb|ETH Zurich at night.]]
The main building of ETH was built from 1858 to 1864 under [[Gustav Zeuner]]; the architect, however, was [[Gottfried Semper]], who was a professor of architecture at ETH at the time and one of the most important architectural writers and theorists of the age. Semper worked in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] that was unique to him; and the namesake and architect of the [[Semperoper]] in Dresden. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[Donato Bramante]]. During the construction of the University of Zürich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed (1912–1914). At about the same time, Semper's ETH building was enlarged and received its impressive [[cupola]].

===Science City===
In the year of ETH Zurich's 150th anniversary, an extensive project called "Science City" for the Hönggerberg Campus was started with the goal to transform the campus into an attractive district based on the principle of sustainability.
[[File:ETH Hönggerberg Frontansicht.JPG|540px|center|thumb|ETH Hönggerberg from the south, looking at the five "fingers" of the HCI and behind the high HPP building.]]

In September 2014 a new project to connect Science City by train was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adf-innovation.com/publikationen/by_rail_2014_S26-27.pdf |title=Tunnelbahnhof für "Science City" |website=www.adf-innovation.com |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics====
The ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics (LIB) is a physics laboratory located in Science City. It specializes in [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS) and the use of [[ion beam]] based techniques with applications in [[archeology]], [[earth sciences]], [[life sciences]], [[Materials science|material sciences]] and [[physics|fundamental physics]]. An example of such application is the tracing of isotopes and the detection of rare [[Radionuclide|radionuclides]] with [[radiocarbon dating]] and the use of techniques such as [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry]] or [[elastic recoil detection]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{Cite web

==Student life==
ETH students were found to be the busiest students of all institutions of higher education in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.ch/page_news_article.php?typ=157&amp;id=2382 "Willkommen auf Students.ch"] {{De icon}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduates' tight curriculum consists of as much as twice the number of lectures as comparable courses of other Swiss universities.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

ETH has well over 100 student associations. Most notable is the [[VSETH]] (''Verband der Studierenden an der ETH'') which comprises all department associations. The associations regularly organize events with varying size and popularity. Events of the neighboring University of Zürich are well-attended by ETH students and vice versa. The VSETH organizes events of greater public attention, such as the ''Polyball'', the ''Polyparty'' (does not exist any more) and the ''Erstsemestrigenfest'', the first two housed in the main building of ETH. Sometimes, the annual ''Erstsemestrigenfest'' takes place at extraordinary locations, for example the [[Zürich Airport]]. All freshmen enjoy special treatment at that event.

Some of the notable associations that are not affiliated with a specific department are the ETH Entrepreneur Club and ETH Model United Nations. Both organisations enjoy high international standings and are regularly awarded for excellence in their field.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} ETH Juniors is another student run organisation. It forms a bridge between the industry and ETH and offers many services for students and companies alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethjuniors.ch/en/about-us|title=ETH Juniors|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Academic Sports Association of Zürich''' (ASVZ) offers more than 120 sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/english/Seiten/default.aspx | title=Academic Sports Association Zurich | accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest annual sports event is the ''SOLA-Stafette'' (SOLA relay race) which consists of 14 sections over a total distance of 140 kilometers. More than 760 teams participated in the 2009 edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/news/Seiten/SOLA09.aspx SOLA-Stafette 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The 40th edition of the SOLA, held on May 4, 2013, had 900 enrolled teams, of which 893 started and 876 were classified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.sola.asvz.ethz.ch/news/Seiten/ErfolgreicheJubilaeumsstafette.aspx SOLA - Erfolgreiche Jubiläumsstafette]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 ASVZ celebrated their 75th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://75jahreasvz.ch|title=ASVZ|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801034944/http://75jahreasvz.ch/|archivedate=1 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The annual [[Polyball]]  is the most prestigious public event at ETH, with a long tradition since the 1880s. The end of November, the ''Polyball'' welcomes around 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and partygoers in the extensively decorated main building of ETH. The ''Polyball'' is the biggest decorated ball in Europe.

The amicable rivalry between ETH and the neighbouring University of Zürich has been cultivated since 1951 (Uni-Poly). There has been an annual [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] match between teams from the two institutions on the river [[Limmat]].

There are many regular symposia and conferences at ETH, most notably the annual ''Wolfgang Pauli Lectures'', in honor of former ETH Professor [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Distinct lecturers, among them 24 [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]]s, have held lectures of the various fields of [[natural science]]s at this conference since 1962.

'''''Early Music History''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published annually by [[Cambridge University Press]], which specialises in the study of [[music]] from the [[early Middle Ages]] to the end of the 17th century. It was established in 1981 and is edited by [[Iain Fenlon]].
{{cquote|''Early Music History'' exists to stimulate further exploration of familiar phenomena through unfamiliar means, and to add to the growing appreciation of the value of interdisciplianary approaches and their potentialities.  Another emphasis might be called the contextual.  At present some music historians tend to concentrate on the internal analysis of a composition and its relation to a specific and usually narrowly defined historical frame.  Indeed, much musicological writing presents by implication a formidable orthodoxy in which history is perceived as a succession of paradigms of musical language, style, and form.  Some recent work has attempted explanation through exploration of a wider range of evidence, and Early Music History intends to strengthen this trend by encouraging studies that examine the economic, political, and social ramifications of research.  In that musicology itself can on benefit if its vision is extended and its methods refined and broadened, the board believes that ''Early Music History'' will mark a new departure in the development of the discipline while continuing to support its traditional tasks.|15px|15px|Iain Fenlon, preface to Volume I&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iain Fenlon |title=Preface |journal=Early Music History |volume=1 |pages=vii-vii |year=1981|doi= 10.1017/S0261127900000243|url= |issn=1474-0559}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6054">The '''Electronic Visualization Laboratory''' ('''EVL''') is a cross-disciplinary research lab at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].  It brings together faculty and students from the [[Art]] and [[Computer Science]] departments of UIC.  The primary areas of research are in [[computer graphics]], high-performance [[computer networking]], and technological art.

==History==
EVL represents one of the oldest art and engineering collaborations in the United States.  It was founded in 1973 by [[Thomas A. DeFanti|Tom DeFanti]] (then of the UIC Chemistry Department, later Computer Science) and [[Daniel J. Sandin|Dan Sandin]] (of the Art Department).  The lab was originally known as the ''Circle Graphics Habitat'', in reference to the then-name of UIC, the ''University of Illinois at Chicago Circle''.  DeFanti and Sandin have served as Co-Directors of the lab since its founding.  Later in 1987, they were joined by [[Maxine D. Brown]] as Associate Director.

[[Image:CAVE Crayoland.jpg|thumb|The CAVE]]
Work at EVL over the years has included:
* 1977: The Sayre Glove, the first [[wired glove|dataglove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A survey of glove-based input|author1=Sturman, D.J. |author2=Zeltzer, D. |journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=14|issue=1|pages=30–39|date=January 1994|doi=10.1109/38.250916}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1981: The Z Box hardware and ZGRASS software (based on DeFanti's prior [[GRASS programming language]]), an early graphics system for the Bally home computer. This system featured [[NTSC]] video output and was used by a number of computer graphics artists of the time.
* 1988: Computer generated [[PHSColograms]], an [[stereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] 3D technique, with [[Art to the nth laboratory|(art)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;]].
* 1992: The [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment]], a projection-based virtual reality system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cruz-Neira, C. |author2=Sandin, D. |author3=DeFanti, T. |author4=Kenyon, R. |author5=Hart, J. |title=The CAVE: Audio Visual Experience Automatic Virtual Environment|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=35|issue=6|pages=65–72|doi=10.1145/129888.129892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1995: The I-WAY event at Supercomputing '95, a prototype of [[grid computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DeFanti, T., Foster I., Papka, M., Stevens, R., Kuhfuss, T.|title=Overview of the I-WAY: Wide Area Visual Supercomputing|journal=International Journal of Supercomputing Applications|volume=10|issue=2|pages=123–130|doi=10.1177/109434209601000201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997: The STAR TAP project, a linking up of several international high-performance networks.  Followed by the StarLight optical networking facility.
* 2013: SpiderSense, a pioneer project in the field of human augmentics. SpiderSense is a wearable device that integrates ultrasound technology with vibrating hardware, allowing users to have directional awareness and "sense" obstacles in the environment without physically seeing the obstacles. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|author1=Mateevitsi, V., Haggadone, B., Leigh, J., Kunzer, B., Kenyon, R.|title=Sensing the environment through SpiderSense|journal=Proceedings of the 4th Augmented Human International Conference|pages=51-57|doi=10.1145/2459236.2459246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Highlights of the electronic art work done at EVL include:
* Electronic Visualization Events (EVE) in the mid 1970s - live, real-time performances featuring computer graphics, video processing, and music.
* Early computer graphics art videos, created by combining DeFanti's GRASS system on a [[PDP-11]] and the [[Sandin Image Processor]].  The video ''Spiral PTL'' (1980) was included in the inaugural collection of video art at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].
* Computer artist [[Larry Cuba]] spent time at EVL, using the tools there for his films ''3/78'' and ''Calculated Movements'', as well as a short special effects sequence for [[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]].
* In 1996, EVL installed the first publicly accessible CAVE at the [[Ars Electronica Center]] in Austria, and presented a number of virtual reality artworks.

==SIGGRAPH==
The members of EVL have been involved with the [[SIGGRAPH]] organization and conference ever since its inception.  DeFanti has served as Secretary (1977-1981) and Chair (1981-1985) of the organization, and 1979 conference chair.  Brown has served as Vice Chair for Operations (1985-1987) and Secretary (1981-1985), and chaired the 1992 conference.  According to [[Jim Blinn]], the popular Electronic Theatre "started out as a bunch of people crowding into Dan Sandin’s dorm room to watch videotapes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How to Attend a Siggraph Conference|author=Blinn, J.|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=15|issue=4|pages=86–88|doi=10.1109/38.391503|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, DeFanti established the SIGGRAPH Video Review, which EVL has continued to supervise.  At SIGGRAPH '92, EVL organized the "Showcase" event, where researchers demonstrated 35 projects in state-of-the-art computational science and [[scientific visualization]].  At SIGGRAPH '94, EVL organized the VROOM event, demonstrations of the state of [[virtual reality]] technology.

In 1998, Brown received the first ever SIGGRAPH Outstanding Service Award for her contributions to the organization.  In 2000, DeFanti and EVL alumna [[Copper Giloth]] also received the Outstanding Service Award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1408">The '''Finnish Institute of Marine Research''' (FIMR) ({{lang-fi|Merentutkimuslaitos}} and {{lang-sv|Havsforskningsinstitutet}}) was a research institute founded in 1918 that was subordinate to the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]]. The institute's main objective was to produce marine-science information to facilitate decision-making, for Finns, and for use in [[seafaring]].

Since September 2005, the Finnish Institute of Marine Research had its headquarters in [[Dynamicum]], a building it shares with the [[Finnish Meteorological Institute]] in [[Kumpula]], [[Helsinki]]. 

The institute was closed in the beginning of 2009, and its functions were divided between the [[Finnish Environment Institute]] (SYKE) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13811">{{short description|Use of geophysics tools in forensic science}}
'''Forensic geophysics''' is a branch of [[forensic science]] and is the study, the search, the localization and the mapping of buried objects or elements beneath the soil or the water, using [[geophysics]] tools for legal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2012 |last1=Pringle |first1=JK |last2=Ruffell |first2=A |last3=Jervis |first3=JR |last4=Donnelly |first4=L |last5=McKinley |first5=J |last6=Hansen |first6=J |last7=Morgan |first7=R |last8=Pirrie |first8=D |last9=Harrison |first9=M |title=The use of geoscience methods for terrestrial forensic searches |volume=114 |pages=108–123|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|bibcode = 2012ESRv..114..108P |doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various geophysical techniques for forensic investigations in which the targets are buried and have different dimensions (from weapons or metallic barrels to human burials and bunkers). Geophysical methods have the potential to aid the search and the recovery of these targets because they can non-destructively and rapidly investigate large areas where a suspect, illegal burial or, in general, a forensic target is hidden in the [[subsoil]]. When in the subsurface there is a contrast of physical properties between a target and the material in which it is buried, it is possible to individuate and define precisely the concealing place of the searched target. It is also possible to recognize evidences of human soil occupation or excavation, both recent and older. Forensic geophysics is an evolving technique that is gaining popularity and prestige in [[law enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1177/1043986211405885 |year=2011 |last1=Larson |first1=DO |last2=Vass |first2=AA |last3=Wise |first3=M |title=Advanced Scientific Methods and Procedures in the Forensic Investigation of Clandestine Graves |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=149–182 |journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searched for objects obviously include clandestine graves of murder victims, but also include unmarked burials in graveyards and cemeteries, weapons used in criminal activities and environmental crime illegally dumping material.

There are various near-surface geophysical techniques that can be utilised to detect a near-surface buried object, which should be site and case-specific. A thorough desk study (including historical maps), utility survey, site reconnaissance and control studies should be undertaken before trial geophysical surveys and then full geophysical surveys are undertaken in phased investigations. Note also other search techniques should be used to first to prioritise suspect areas, for example [[Search and rescue dog#Human remains detection|cadaver dogs]] or forensic geomorphologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2014 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |last2=McKinley |first2=J |title=Forensic geomorphology |volume=206 |pages=14–22| journal=Geomorphology |bibcode = 2014Geomo.206...14R |doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.12.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

For large-scale buried objects, [[seismic]] surveys may be appropriate but these have, at best, 2m vertical resolution so may not be ideal for certain targets, more typically they are used to detect bedrock below the surface (see.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds|first= JR |title=An Introduction to Applied and Environmental Geophysics, 2nd Edition|publisher=Wiley|date=2011|isbn=978-0-471-48535-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For relatively quick site surveys, bulk ground [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] surveys can be collected which identifies areas of disturbance of different ground but these can suffer from a lack of resolution. This recent Black Death investigation in central London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.04.010 |year=2015 |last1=Dick |first1=HC |last2=Pringle |first2=JK |last3=Sloane |first3=B |last4=Carver |first4=J |last5=Wisneiwski |first5=KD |last6=Haffenden |first6=A |last7=Porter |first7=S |last8=Roberts |first8=D |last9=Cassidy |first9=NJ |title=Detection and characterisation of Black Death burials by multi-proxy geophysical methods |volume=59 |pages=132–141| journal=Journal of Archaeological Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10855986 |year=2000 |last1=Nobes |first1=D |title=The Search for "Yvonne": A Case Example of the Delineation of a Grave Using Near-Surface Geophysical Methods |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=715–721| journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a successful woodland search for a cold case in woodland in New Zealand.

[[Ground-penetrating radar]] (or GPR) has a typical maximum depth below ground level (bgl) of 10 m, depending upon the antennae frequencies used, typically 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1.2 Gz. The higher the frequency the smaller the object that can be resolved but also penetration depths decrease, so operators need to think carefully when choosing antennae frequencies and, ideally, undertake trial surveys using different antennae over a target at a known depth onsite. GPR is the most popularly used technique in forensic search, but is not suitable in certain soil types and environments, e.g. coastal (i.e. salt-rich) and clay-rich soils (lack of penetration). 2D profiles can be relatively quickly collected and, if time permits, successive profiles can be used to generate 3D datasets which may resolve more subtle targets (see &lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;). Recent studies have used GPR to locate mass graves from the Spanish Civil War in mountainous &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.05.040 | year=2016 |last1=Fernandez-Alvarez |first1=J-P |title=Discovery of a mass grave from the Spanish Civil War using Ground Penetrating Radar and forensic archaeology |volume=267 |issue=10 |pages=e10-e17| journal=Forensic Science International }}&lt;/ref&gt; and urban &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.03.034 | year=2018 |last1=Fernandez-Alvarez |first1=J-P |title=GPR and ERT detection and characterization of a mass burial, Spanish Civil War, Northern Spain |volume=287 |pages=e1-e9| journal=Forensic Science International }}&lt;/ref&gt; environments.

Electrical resistivity methods can also detect objects, especially in clay-rich soil which would preclude the use of GPR. There are different equipment configurations, the dipole-dipole (fixed-offset) method is the most common which can traverse across an area, measuring resistivity variations at a set depth (typically 1-2x probe separations) which have been used in forensic searches. More slower methods are putting out many probes and collecting both spatially horizontally and vertically, called [[Electrical resistivity imaging]] (ERI). Multiple 2D profiles is termed [[electrical resistivity tomography]] (ERT).&lt;ref name=pye&gt;{{cite book |last=Pye|first= Kenneth|author2=D.J. Croft|title=Forensic geoscience: principles, techniques and applications|publisher=Geological Society of London|date=2004|isbn=1-86239-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnetometry]] can detect buried metal (or indeed fired objects such as bricks or even where surface fires were) using simple total field magnetometers, through to fluxgate gradiometers and high-end alkali vapour gradiometers, depending upon accuracy (and cost) required (see &lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;). Surface magnetic susceptibility has also shown recent promise for forensic search.

Water-based searches are also becoming more common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.04.012 | year=2017 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |last2=Pringle |first2=JK |last3=Cassella |first3=JP |last4=Morgan |first4=RM |last5=Ferguson |first5=M |last6=Heaton |first6=V |last7=Hope |first7=C | last8=McKinley |first8=J | title=The use of geoscience methods for aquatic forensic searches | journal=Earth-Science Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; with specialist marine magnetometers, side-scan sonar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.05.032 |year=2013 |last1=Schultz |first1=JJ |last2=Healy |first2=CA |last3=Parker |first3=K |last4=Lowers |first4=B|title=Detecting submerged objects: The application of side scan sonar to forensic contexts |volume=231 |pages=306–316| journal=Forensic Science International |pmid=23890654}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other acoustic methods and even water-penetrating radar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S1355-0306(06)71602-1 |year=2009 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |title=Under-water Scene Investigation Using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) in the Search for a Sunken Jet ski, Northern Ireland |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=221–230| journal=Science &amp; Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; methods used to rapidly scan bottoms of ponds, lakes, rivers and near-shore depositional environments.

==Controlled research==
There has been recent efforts to undertake research over known buried and below-water surface simulated forensic targets in order to gain an insight into optimum search technique(s) and/or equipment configuration(s). Most commonly, this involved the burial porcine cadavers and long-term monitoring for soilwater,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Jamie K.|last2=Cassella|first2=John P.|last3=Jervis|first3=John R.|last4=Williams|first4=Anna|last5=Cross|first5=Peter|last6=Cassidy|first6=Nigel J.|date=2015-07-01|title=Soilwater Conductivity Analysis to Date and Locate Clandestine Graves of Homicide Victims|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12802/abstract|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=1052–1060|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12802|issn=1556-4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; seasonal effects on electrical resistivity surveys, burial in walls and beneath concrete,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruffell|first=A|last2=Pringle|first2=JK|last3=Forbes|first3=S|date=2014-01-05|title=Search protocols for hidden forensic objects beneath floors and within walls|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.12.036/abstract|journal=Forensic Science International|language=en|volume=237|pages=237–245|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.12.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Long-Term monitoring in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Jamie K.|last2=Jervis|first2=John R.|last3=Roberts|first3=Daniel|last4=Dick|first4=Henry C.|last5=Wisniewski|first5=Kristopher D.|last6=Cassidy|first6=Nigel J.|last7=Cassella|first7=John P.|date=2016-03-01|title=Long-term Geophysical Monitoring of Simulated Clandestine Graves using Electrical and Ground Penetrating Radar Methods: 4–6 Years After Burial|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.13009/abstract|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|language=en|volume=61|issue=2|pages=309–321|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.13009|issn=1556-4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=John J.|last2=Walter|first2=Brittany S.|last3=Healy|first3=Carrie|date=2016-09-01|title=Long-term sequential monitoring of controlled graves representing common burial scenarios with ground penetrating radar: Years 2 and 3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116301707|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=132|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.06.015|bibcode=2016JAG...132...60S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molina|first=Carlos Martin|last2=Pringle|first2=Jamie K.|last3=Saumett|first3=Miguel|last4=Evans|first4=Gethin T.|date=2016-12-01|title=Geophysical and botanical monitoring of simulated graves in a tropical rainforest, Colombia, South America|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116303706|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=135|pages=232–242|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.10.002|bibcode=2016JAG...135..232M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there has been surveys in graveyards over graves of known ages to determine the geophysical responses of multi-geophysical techniques with increasing burial ages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dick|first=H |last2=Pringle|first2=JK |last3=Wisniewski|first3=KD|last4=Goodwin|first4=J|last5=van der Putten|first5=R|last6=Evans|first6=GT|last7=Francis|first7=JD|last8=Cassella|first8=JP|last9=Hansen|first9=JD|date=2017|title=Determining geophysical responses from burials in graveyards and cemeteries|url=http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/geo2016-0440.1|journal=Geophysics|volume=x|pages=x–x|doi=10.1190/geo2016-0440.1||bibcode=2017Geop...82B.245D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fragment molecular orbital method''' ('''FMO''') is a computational method that can compute very large molecular systems with thousands of atoms using ab initio quantum-chemical wave functions.

== History of FMO and related methods ==
[[File:Ahelix-FMO-Facio.jpg|thumb|320px|An alpha-helix fragmented for FMO using Facio.]]
The fragment molecular orbital method (FMO) was developed by K. Kitaura and coworkers in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fragment molecular orbital method: an approximate computational method for large molecules|year=1999|journal=Chem. Phys. Lett.|volume=313|pages=701–706|author1=K. Kitaura |author2=E. Ikeo |author3=T. Asada |author4=T. Nakano |author5=M.  Uebayasi |doi=10.1016/S0009-2614(99)00874-X|issue=3–4|bibcode=1999CPL...313..701K}}&lt;/ref&gt; FMO is deeply interconnected with the energy decomposition analysis (EDA) by Kitaura and Morokuma, developed in 1976. The main use of FMO is to compute very large molecular systems by dividing them into fragments and performing ab initio or density functional quantum-mechanical calculations of fragments and their dimers, whereby the Coulomb field from the whole system is included. The latter feature allows fragment calculations without using caps.

The mutually consistent field (MCF) method &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Investigation of the interaction between molecules at medium distances: I. SCF LCAO MO supermolecule, perturbational and mutually consistent calculations for two interacting HF and CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules|year=1975|journal=Chem. Phys.|volume=8|pages=192–200|author1=P. Otto |author2=J. Ladik |doi = 10.1016/0301-0104(75)80107-8|issue=1-2|bibcode=1975CP......8..192O}}&lt;/ref&gt; had introduced the idea of self-consistent fragment calculations in their embedding potential, which was later used with some modifications in various methods including FMO. There had been other methods related to FMO including the incremental correlation method by H. Stoll (1992).&lt;ref&gt;H. Stoll (1992), Phys. Rev. B 46, 6700&lt;/ref&gt; Also FMO bears some similarity to the method by J. Gao (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Toward a Molecular Orbital Derived Empirical Potential for Liquid Simulations|year=1997|journal=J. Phys. Chem. B|volume=101|pages=657–663|author=J. Gao|doi = 10.1021/jp962833a|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the applicability of which for condensed phase systems was subsequently demonstrated by carrying out a statistical mechanical Monte Carlo simulation of liquid water in 1998;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gao, (1998), "A molecular-orbital derived polarization potential for liquid water." J. Chem. Phys. 109, 2346-2354.&lt;/ref&gt; this method was later renamed as the explicit polarization (X-Pol) theory. The incremental method uses formally the same many-body expansion of properties as FMO, although the exact meaning of terms is different.  The difference between X-Pol and FMO is in the approximation for estimating the pair interactions between fragments. X-Pol is closely related to the one-body expansion used in FMO (FMO1) in terms of the electrostatics, but other interactions are treated differently.

Later, other methods closely related to FMO were proposed including the kernel energy method of L. Huang&lt;ref&gt;L. Huang, L. Massa, J. Karle, (2005), "Kernel energy method illustrated with peptides", Int. J. Quant. Chem 103, 808-817&lt;/ref&gt; and the electrostatically embedded many-body expansion by E. Dahlke,&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Dahlke, D. G. Truhlar (2007) "Electrostatically Embedded Many-Body Expansion for Large Systems, with Applications to Water Clusters", J. Chem. Theory Comput. 3, 46–53&lt;/ref&gt;
S. Hirata&lt;ref&gt;S. Hirata, M. Valiev, M. Dupuis, S. S. Xantheas, S. Sugiki, H. Sekino, (2005) Mol. Phys.  103, 2255&lt;/ref&gt; and later M. Kamiya&lt;ref&gt;M. Kamiya, S. Hirata, M.
Valiev, (2008), J. Chem. Phys. 128, 074103&lt;/ref&gt; suggested approaches also very closely related to FMO. Effective fragment molecular orbital (EFMO) method combines some features of the effective fragment potentials (EFP) and FMO. A detailed perspective on the fragment-based method development can be found in a recent review.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Gordon, D. G. Fedorov, S. R. Pruitt, L. V. Slipchenko, (2012)
"Fragmentation Methods: A Route to Accurate Calculations on Large Systems.", Chem. Rev. 112, 632-672.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction to FMO ==

In addition to the calculation of the total properties, such as the energy,
energy gradient, dipole moment etc., the pair interaction is obtained for
each pair of fragments. This pair interaction energy can be further
decomposed into electrostatic, exchange, charge transfer and dispersion
contributions. This analysis is known as the pair interaction energy
decomposition analysis (PIEDA) and it can be thought of as FMO-based EDA.
Alternatively, configuration analysis for fragment interaction (CAFI) and fragment interaction analysis based on local MP2 (FILM) were suggested within the FMO framework.

In FMO, various wave functions can be used for ab initio calculations of fragments and their dimers, such as [[Hartree–Fock]], [[Density functional theory]] (DFT), [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field]] (MCSCF), time-dependent DFT ([[TDDFT]]), [[configuration interaction]] (CI), second order [[Møller–Plesset perturbation theory]] (MP2), and [[coupled cluster]] (CC). The solvent effects can be treated with the [[Polarizable continuum model]] (PCM). The FMO code is very efficiently parallelized utilising the generalized distributed data interface (GDDI) and hundreds of CPUs can be used with nearly perfect scaling.

In the FMO book published in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;''The Fragment Molecular Orbital Method: Practical Applications to Large Molecular Systems'', edited by D. G. Fedorov, K. Kitaura, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-4200-7848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; one can find 10 illustrated chapters written by the experts in the FMO development and applications, as well as a CDROM with
annotated samples of input and output files, Facio modelling software and video tutorials (AppliGuide movies, showing mouse clicks) for treating difficult PDB files with Facio. In addition to this book, there are several chapters published in other books.&lt;ref&gt;"(a) D. G. Fedorov, K.

In 2013-2014, a Japanese journal, CICSJ Bulletin, published a series of FMO papers in Japanese (about 100 pages in total), which give a representative summary of the recent FMO development and applications done in Japan, including papers on the GAMESS/FMO interface in Facio and developing an OpenMP version of GAMESS/FMO on the K computer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/cicsj/31/3/_contents/-char/ja/&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest system size computed with FMO so far is a slab of fullerite surface, containing 1,030,440 atoms, whose geometry was fully optimized using FMO-DFTB recently implemented in GAMESS.&lt;ref&gt;Y.

== Applications of FMO ==

There are two main application fields of FMO: biochemistry and molecular dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. In addition, there is an emerging field of inorganic applications. 
 
In 2005, an application of FMO to the calculation of the ground electronic state of photosynthetic protein with more than 20,000 atoms was distinguished with the best technical paper award at Supercomputing 2005.
A number of applications of FMO to biochemical problems has been published, for instance, to [[Drug design]] , quantitative structure-activity relationship ([[QSAR]]) as well as the studies of excited states and chemical reactions of biological systems. In the recent development (2008), the adaptive frozen orbital (AFO) treatment of the detached bonds was suggested for FMO, making it possible to study solids, surfaces and nano systems, such as silicon nanowrires. FMO-TDDFT was also applied to the excited states of molecular crystals (quinacridone).

Among inorganic systems, silica-related materials (zeolites, mesoporous nanoparticles and silica surfaces) were studied with FMO,
as well as ionic liquids and boron nitride ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;http://staff.aist.go.jp/d.g.fedorov/fmo/fmoref.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software for FMO ==
The FMO method is implemented in [[GAMESS (US)]], ABINIT-MP and PAICS software packages, distributed free of charge.

In the earlier stage, the preparation of the GAMESS input files was facilitated with the '''FMOutil''' software.&lt;ref&gt;http://staff.aist.go.jp/d.g.fedorov/fmo/fmoutil.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, various parts of FMOutil were
incorporated in the new graphical user interface called '''fu'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/fusuite/&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Fu''' is a general open-source GUI not limited to FMO or GAMESS. It is written mainly in Python and some critical modules
are in FORTRAN. '''Fu''' is distributed under BSD license so anybody can modify it and redistributed freely.  
In addition, another graphical user interface '''Facio'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.bbiq.jp/zzzfelis/Facio.html&lt;/ref&gt; developed by M. Suenaga has a very convenient specialised support of FMO (in addition to other features), with which an automatic fragmentation of molecular clusters, proteins, nucleotides, saccharides and any combination thereof (e.g., DNA and protein complexes in explicit solvent) can be done in a few minutes, and a manual fragmentation of solids and surfaces can be accomplished by clicking the bonds to be detached. Facio can also visualise results of FMO calculations, such as the pair interactions.

&lt;!--
There is a convenient Web-based interface to FMO, FMOtools, available from the FMO portal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmo-portal.info&lt;/ref&gt; FMOtools can generate FMO input files, visualise results of FMO calculations and  short test calculations can be executed from the Web interface. FragIt &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fragit.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is a Web interface, as well as a standalone program, which can generate (E)FMO input files for GAMESS. It features a unique system of chemical patterns, which allows an automatic fragmentation of in principle an arbitrary molecular system.

In functional-[[cognitive linguistics]], as well as in [[semiotics]], '''iconicity''' is the conceived [[wikt:similarity|similarity]] or [[analogy]] between the form of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] (linguistic or otherwise) and its [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], as opposed to [[arbitrariness]].

Iconic principles:
*Quantity principle: conceptual complexity corresponds to formal complexity
*Proximity principle: conceptual distance tends to match with linguistic distance
*Sequential order principle: the sequential order of events described is mirrored in the speech chain

==Quantity principle==
The use of quantity of phonetic material to iconically mark increased quality or quantity can be noted in the lengthening of words to indicate a greater degree, such as "{{not a typo|looong}}". It is also common to use [[reduplication]] to iconically mark increase, as [[Edward Sapir]] is quoted, “The process is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance” (1921:79). This has been confirmed by the comparative studies of Key (1965) and Moravcsik (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Moravcsik (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen, for example, in [[Amharic language|Amharic]], where ''{{lang|am|täsäbbärä}}'' means "it was broken" and ''{{lang|am|täsäbb'''ab'''ärä}}'' means that "it was shattered".

Iconic coding principles may be [[natural]] tendencies in language and are also part of our [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[biology|biological]] make-up. Whether iconicity is a part of language is an open debate in linguistics. For instance, [[Haspelmath]] has argued against iconicity, claiming that most iconic phenomena can be explained by frequency biases: since simpler meanings tend to be more frequent in the language use they tend to lose phonological material.

[[Onomatopoeia]] (and [[mimesis]] more broadly) may be seen as a kind of iconicity, though even onomatopoeic sounds have a large degree of arbitrariness.

==The evolution of language==
[[Derek Bickerton]] has posited that iconic signs, both verbal and gestural, were crucial in the evolution of human language. [[Animal communication]] systems, Bickerton has argued, are largely composed of [[Indexicality|indexical]] (and, occasionally, iconic) signs, whereas in human language, "most words are symbolic, and&amp;nbsp;... without symbolic words we couldn’t have language". The distinction Bickerton draws between these categories is one of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], with the indexical signs of animal communication systems having no capacity for displacement, and the symbolic signs of human language requiring it. Iconic signs, however, "may or may not have it depending on how they’re used&amp;nbsp;... iconicity, therefore, is the most probable road that our ancestors took into language".

Using a [[Niche construction|niche-construction]] view of human evolution, Bickerton has hypothesized that human ancestors used iconic signs as recruitment signals in the scavenging of dead [[megafauna]]. This process "would have created new words and deployed old words in new contexts, further weakening the uncoupling of words from situations, from current occurrence—even from fitness", and thus allowing for the creation of symbolic language.&lt;ref name="Bickerton (2009)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bickerton |first=Derek |title=Adam's Tongue: How Humans Made Language, How Language Made Humans |year=2009 |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780809022816 |pages=52–53, 218–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'', [[Terrence Deacon]] argues that the emanation of symbolic capacities unique to language was a critical factor in the evolution of the human brain, and that these symbolic capacities are vital to differentiating animal from human forms of communication, processes of learning, and brain anatomy. "The doorway into this virtual world was opened to us alone by the evolution of language, because language is not merely a mode of communication, it is also the outward expression of an unusual mode of thought—symbolic representation."&lt;ref name="Deacon (1997)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deacon |first=Terrence |title=The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Human Brain |year=1997 |publisher=Allen Lane the Penguin Press |isbn=978-0-393-03838-5 |chapter=1 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls and gestures==
Iconic calls and gestures mimic the forms of the things they stand for (such as outlining shapes or moving your hands back and forth multiple times to show repetition.) Iconic calls and gestures are not formally considered [[language]], or language-like communication in that they do not contrast or possess arbitrary characteristics. Noises that imitate sounds of the surrounding environment ([[ideophone]]s) are also iconic. Though humans possess a repertoire of iconic calls and gestures, other [[mammal]]s produce few iconic signals. Despite this, a few captive [[chimpanzee]]s have shown the beginning stages of iconicity. Burling ''et al.'' states: "Chimpanzees in the wild do not point, and rarely do so in captivity, however there is a documented case of one named [[Kanzi]], described by Savage-Rumbaugh et al., who could indicate direction of travel by "extending his hand". Another chimpanzee, Viki (Hayes and Nissen 1971:107) made motions of kneading or ironing when she wanted to knead dough or iron napkins. [[Waggle dance|Bee dances]] are another example of iconicity in [[animal communication|animal communication systems]].&lt;ref name="Burling1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burling |first=Robbins |title=Primate Calls, Human Language, and Nonverbal Communication {{bracket|and Comments and Reply}} |journal=Current Anthropology |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=February 1993 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=30–31 |jstor=2743729 |doi=10.1086/204132 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sign languages==
Iconicity is often argued to play a large role in the production and perception of [[gesture]]. Proposed ways in which iconicity is achieved is through [http://jeroenarendsen.nl/2007/04/hands-that-act-embody-model-and-draw/ Hands that Act, Embody, Model, and Draw]. In sign languages iconicity was often argued to be largely confined to sign formation (comparable to [[onomatopoeia]]). Some proponents believe that iconicity does not play an actual role in perception and production of signs once they have undergone phonological reduction and become part of the conventionalized vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Frishburg (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, as sign language researchers gain confidence (and the fear of losing linguistic status subsidies), the possible role of iconicity is being evaluated again. Current research on sign language phonology acknowledges that certain aspects are semantically motivated. Further, the ability to modify sign meaning through phonological changes to signs is gaining attention. The ability to work creatively with sign language in this way has been associated with accomplished, or native signers.

Iconicity is expressed in the grammatical structure of [[sign languages]] called classifiers. These are used to give descriptive information about a subject or verb. In [[American Sign language]] (ASL) a grammatical marker denoting “intensity” is characterized by a movement pattern with two parts: an initial pause, followed by a quick completion. When this pattern is added to the adjective GOOD the resulting meaning is VERY-GOOD.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The ASL marker for "intensity" is iconic in that the intended meaning (building of pressure, a sudden release) is matched by the articulatory form (a pause, a quick completion).

Like in vocal languages, developmental trends in ASL shy away from iconicity in favor of arbitrariness. These changes "contribute toward symmetry, fluidity, locational displacement and assimilation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frishberg |first=Nancy |title=Arbitrariness and Iconicity: Historical Change in American Sign Language |journal=Language |date=September 1975 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=696–719 |doi=10.2307/412894 |jstor=412894 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sign WE used to contain the sign for each individual being described by the WE. So the signer would sign ME + YOU&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; + YOU&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; + YOU &lt;small&gt;n&lt;/small&gt; + ME. Now the sign has turned into a smooth symbolic sign where the signer makes two touches on the chest, one on each side, with a sweep of the wrist in between.

==Poetry==
Iconicity often occurs within poetry through the use of onomatopoeia, which may be called auditory iconicity. Sometimes, though, the form of the poem resembles or enacts the poem's content, and in this case, a visual iconicity is present. One poet well known for his visual poems, and therefore visual iconicity, is [[E. E. Cummings]]. A subset of visual iconicity involves a spatial iconicity. For instance, in Cummings's grasshopper poem ("r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r") the word "arriving" begins on the far right of the poem with the "a", the "r" is near the middle of the poem, and the rest of the word is on the left of the poem. The reader must travel a great distance across the poem, therefore, in order to "arrive". The spatial dimension, then, can relate to a temporal dimension. In the poems "The Fish" and "The Moose" by Elizabeth Bishop, temporal iconicity is at work. The amount of time it takes to read "The Fish" coincides with the length of time a fish could live outside of water; likewise, the duration of the long bus ride in "The Moose" coincides with the poem's long first sentence as well as the twenty-some stanzas it takes before the passengers on the bus (and the reader) actually encounters the moose.

==Folk etymology==
Iconicity occurs in rejective [[phono-semantic matching]]. "Consider Lithuanian [[Ashkenazic Hebrew]] רע דם ''ra dom'' (cf. [[Yiddish]] ''ra dam''), lit. 'of bad blood' (from [[Hebrew]] רע דם ''ra` dam'' 'of bad blood'). This is a toponymic rejective phono-semantic matching of [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[Radom]]'', the name of a town in Poland (approximately {{convert|100|km}} south of [[Warsaw]]), or of its [[Yiddish]] adaptation ''ródem'' (see [[Uriel Weinreich]] 1955: 609, [[Paul N. Wexler|Paul Wexler]] 1991: 42). Thus, if a pogrom had occurred in Radom, it would surely have been rationalized by ''ra dam'' ‘of bad blood’. Obviously, providing such an [[folk etymology|etymythological]] explanation for the pogrom was regarded by some Jews as a mere play on words. However, others might have conceived of ''ra dam'' as having deep intrinsic truth, which might have been religiously and homiletically based. One should not forget that at that time it was a common belief that all languages were God-created and that Hebrew was the divine ''Ursprache''."&lt;ref name="See p 2006 pp. 237-258"&gt;See p. 246 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad]] (2006), "'[[folk etymology|Etymythological]] [[Othering]]' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective", ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'', edited by [[Tope Omoniyi]] and [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language acquisition==
It has been suggested that iconicity can be used in the teaching of languages. There are two ways this has been suggested. The first being “Horizontal-Iconicity” and the second being vowel magnitude relationships. Horizontal-Iconicity is the phenomenon of opposition of meaning and spelling. For example, in [[Egypt]]ian mer, which means right hand and rem, which means left hand. Because people are more likely to remember things they have more [[Mnemonic]] tags for, it is suggested that it may be helpful to point these things out in the teaching of language.&lt;ref name="Croft 1978"&gt;Croft (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowel magnitude==
Vowel magnitude relationships suggest that, the larger the object, the more likely its name has open vowels such as {{IPAslink|ɒ}}, {{IPAslink|eɪ}}, and {{IPAslink|æ}}; the smaller the object, the more likely its name has closed vowel sounds such as {{IPAslink|iː}}, {{IPAslink|ʊ}}, and {{IPAc-en|j|uː}}. Open vowel sounds are also more likely to be associated with round shapes and dark or gloomy moods, where closed vowel sounds are more likely to be associated with pointed shapes and happy moods.&lt;ref name="Croft 1978"/&gt;

A test run by [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]] asked subjects to differentiate between two different sized tables using invented word pairs such as "mal" and "mil". He discovered a word containing {{IPA|[a]}} was at four times more likely to be judged as larger if paired with a word containing {{IPA|[i]}}. Nuckolls states: "Newman discovered that&amp;nbsp;... as the tongue recedes in articulating vowels from the front to the back of the mouth, and as acoustic frequencies become lower, the vowels are judged to be larger and darker". Bentley and Varron (1933) ran tests asking subjects to differentiate between vowel sounds without providing them, beforehand, contrasting attributes (such as bright and dark.) They found only moderate success rates that decreased when vowel sounds were closer in tone. However, they still found that {{IPA|[a]}} sounds were judged larger or lower than {{IPA|[i]}} sounds.&lt;ref name="Nuckolls 1999 230, 231, 246"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nuckolls |first=Janis B. |title=The Case for Sound Symbolism |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |year=1999 |volume=28 |pages=230–231, 246 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], examples from degree adjectives, such as long, longer, longest, show that the most extreme degree of length is iconically represented by the word with the greatest number of [[phoneme]]s. [[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]] cites examples of word order mimicking the natural order of ideas. In fact, iconicity is now widely acknowledged to be a significant factor at many levels of linguistic structure.&lt;ref name="Nuckolls 1999 230, 231, 246"/&gt;

==Digital media==
Over a seven-year span, [[Marc Davis (academic)|Marc Davis]], Brian Williams, and Golan Levin have managed to develop their own iconic visual language. The creation of their program called [[Media Streams]] was derived from a need and a desire to have a universal language when creating videos. Media accessibility is becoming easier to obtain by the day, and with this growth new development in the field is bound to happen.

Media production was once limited to an elite group of individuals who spent a large portion of their time taking courses and specializing in the art. Now with the technological advancements and internet use of today, much of the skill can be learned out of your own home. As Marc Davis would say, just as the [[printing press]] was given to the users via [[Desktop Publishing]], media production can now, also, be given to these same users. [[Streaming media]] is vastly growing and the manipulation and reconstruction of this hot trend is more than needed and necessary to keep the diversity coming.

From 1991 to 1997, Marc Davis and his colleagues worked out of the Machine Understanding Group of the MIT Laboratory and the [[Interval Research Corporation]] to create their media streams program.

Media Streams "{{bracket|i}}s a system for annotating, retrieving, repurposing, and automatically assembling digital video". (Davis; Media Streams) The system uses a stream based, semantic representation of video content with an [[iconic visual language]] interface of hierarchically structured and searchable primitives.

The goal of this system is to address the problems of annotation convergence and human-computer communication. Developing the iconic visual language was necessary to assist the computational reading and writing of representational consensual interpretations of video content in a standardized way. Illiterate, diverse languages and the like will all be able to work with this system due to its [[universal language]].

The '''Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)''' was initiated in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers - ASHRAE: "[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ashrae/ashraeinsights_201408/ ASHRAE Insights, August 2014]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Lyons Hardcastle, "[http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/07/11/indoor-environmental-quality-alliance-formed/ Indoor Environmental Quality Alliance Formed]", Environmental Leader, July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Governo Law Firm, "Newly Formed Alliance: Premier Resource for Indoor Environmental Quality", July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to improve the actual, delivered indoor environmental quality in buildings through coordination, education, outreach and advocacy. The alliance works to supply information, guidelines and knowledge on the [[Building science|indoor environmental quality (IEQ)]] in buildings and workplaces,&lt;ref&gt;BUILD UP energy solutions for better buildings, "[http://www.buildup.eu/news/41608 International Societies form Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and to provide occupants in buildings and workplaces with an acceptable indoor environmental quality (([[indoor air quality]] (IAQ), thermal conditions, visual quality, and acoustical quality)) and help promote implementation in practice of knowledge from research on the field.

The group has already begun work to collect and critique IEQ standards and is organising and presenting programmes at the conferences of member organisations&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1899131#jumps SEMINAR 8 Indoor environmental quality: a global and holistic perspective, part 1]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1899132#jumps SEMINAR 8 Indoor environmental quality: a global and holistic perspective, part 2]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - AIVC]]: "[http://www.aivc.org/news/indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-first-sessions-june-2015-ashrae-annual-conference Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance first sessions at the June 2015 ASHRAE Annual conference]", September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - AIVC]], "[http://www.aivc.org/sites/default/files/36-AIVC-program.pdf 36th AIVC Conference Programme]", September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

The Alliance was officially launched on June 29, 2014 during [[ASHRAE]]’s 2014 Annual Conference in [[Seattle]]; a [[memorandum of understanding]] was signed and the Alliance was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[[venticool]]: "[http://venticool.eu/international-societies-form-indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-ieq-ga/ International Societies form Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance] (IEQ-GA)", 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Bahnfleth, ASHRAE’s 2013-2014 president, appointed an ad-hoc committee to look at ways for industry groups to cooperate and address aspects of indoor environmental quality and health.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[https://www.ashrae.org/communities/indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-ieq-ga Indoor Environmental Quality--Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners and governmental organisations ==
Founding members of the Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance include organisations that broadly deal with the indoor environments as well as those specialised primarily in [[Indoor Air Quality]](IAQ). 
The Alliance’s current partners include the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre]] (AIVC), [[ASHRAE|the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)]] the Air &amp; Waste Management Association (A&amp;WMA), the Indoor Air Quality Association (IAQA), and the Federation of European Heating and Air-Conditioning Associations ([https://www.rehva.eu/ REHVA]) &lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE, "[https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Communities/Memoranda%20of%20Understanding/IEQ-GA-MOU.pdf Memorandum of Understanding- Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", Retrieved August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. The Alliance is also supported by governmental organisations such as the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE): "[http://www.cibsejournal.com/archive/PDFs/CIBSE-Journal-2014-08.pdf Industry seeks to redress IAQ balance]", CIBSE Journal August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jelly''' was an [[application software|app]] that served as a Q&amp;A platform, created by '''Jelly Industries''', a [[search-engine]] company founded and led by [[Biz Stone]], one of [[Twitter]]'s co-founders.&lt;ref name=wsj-acquire-jelly/&gt; In March 2017, Jelly was acquired by [[Pinterest]] for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fingas|first1=Jon|title=Pinterest acquires Jelly, the startup from Twitter's Biz Stone|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/08/pinterest-acquires-jelly/|accessdate=9 March 2017|work=[[Engadget]]|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jelly differentiates itself from other Q&amp;A platforms such as [[Quora]] and [[ChaCha (search engine)|ChaCha]] by relying on visual imagery to steer people to getting better answers from within and outside their social networks. In particular, it encourages people to use photos to ask questions.&lt;ref name=jelly-announcement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.jelly.co/post/72563498393/introducing-jelly|title = Introducing Jelly|date = January 7, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014|publisher = ''Jelly'' blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunch1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/jelly-biz-stones-new-qa-platform-will-go-live-today/|title = Jelly, Biz Stone’s New Q&amp;A Platform, Uses Images To Find Answers|last = Lunden|first = Ingrid|date = January 7, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''[[AllThingsD]]'' reported on March 28, 2013 that, according to sources, [[Twitter]] co-founder [[Biz Stone]] was close to launching a native mobile app called Jelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20130328/sweet-biz-stone-is-poised-to-launch-new-mobile-startup-called-jelly/|title = Sweet?

In May 2013, while still in stealth mode, Jelly raised Series A funding from [[Spark Capital]], SV Angel, [[Square (payment service)|Square]] CEO [[Jack Dorsey]], [[Reid Hoffman]], [[Al Gore]], [[Bono]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.jelly.co/post/50579107451/business-is-blooming|title = Business is "Blooming"|publisher = ''Jelly'' blog|date = May 16, 2013|accessdate = January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/16/biz-stones-new-startup-jelly-raises-series-a-from-spark-capital-sv-angel-square-ceo-jack-dorsey-reid-hoffman-al-gore-bono-others/|title = Biz Stone’s New Startup Jelly Raises Series A From Spark Capital, SV Angel, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, Reid Hoffman, Al Gore, Bono &amp; Others|last = Perez|first = Sarah|date = May 16, 2013|accessdate = January 24, 2014|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/05/16/biz-stone-gets-funding-from-bono-al-gore-reid-hoffman-and-his-twitter-co-founders-for-his-jelly-startup/|title = Biz Stone’s Jelly nabs Series A funding from Spark Capital, SV Angel, Al Gore, Jack Dorsey, others|last = Yeung|first = Ken|date = May 16, 2013|accessdate = January 24, 2014|publisher = ''The Next Web''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app release was announced, thereby bringing Jelly out of stealth mode, on January 7, 2014.&lt;ref name=jelly-announcement/&gt; The announcement was picked up by much of the technology press and mainstream press.&lt;ref name=techcrunch1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/01/07/biz-stone-jelly/|title = Twitter Cofounder Biz Stone Launches Q&amp;A App Jelly|last = Wagner|first = Kurt|date = January 8, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014|publisher = ''[[Mashable]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/08/tech/social-media/jelly-social-app-stone/|title = Biz Stone: What Jelly can do for you|last = Mendoza|first = Dorrine|date = January 8, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014|publisher = ''[[CNN]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone explained to ''[[TechCrunch]]'' that the primary goal of Jelly was not to help people asking questions but to improve empathy among people answering questions by making them feel helpful to people around them.&lt;ref name=techcrunch2&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/twitter-co-founder-biz-stone-explains-the-surprising-goal-of-his-new-company-jelly/|title = Twitter Co-Founder Biz Stone Explains The Surprising Goal Of His New Company, Jelly|last = Ferenstein|first = Gregory|date = January 7, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', Stone said that he never intended to create a company with Jelly, and that it was largely accidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/i-didn-t-mean-to-start-jelly-search-engine-stone-fJ2VtQG4Q4yoDRWgcz5e5g.html|title =  Biz Stone: Jelly Answers Buy, How, What Questions|publisher = ''[[Bloomberg News]]''|date = January 21, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57617559-93/biz-stone-accidental-jelly-ceo/|title = Biz Stone, accidental Jelly CEO: The former Twitter exec said his latest venture was never meant to be a company.|last = Van Grove|first = Jennifer|publisher = ''[[CNet]]''|date = January 21, 2014|accessdate = January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kiplinger's Personal Finance''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|p|l|ɪ|ŋ|ər|z}} KIP-ling-ers) is an American [[personal finance]] [[magazine]] published by [[Kiplinger]] since 1947. It claims to be the first American personal finance magazine and to deliver "sound, unbiased advice in clear, concise language". It offers advice on managing money and achieving financial security, saving, investing, planning for retirement, paying for college, and major purchases like automobiles and homes. [[Janet Bodnar]] has been the editor of ''Kiplinger's Personal Finance'' magazine since January 2009.

==History==
[[W.M. Kiplinger]], founder of the [[Kiplinger]] family of publications, said he founded the magazine because "The times will always be changing. Much of life and work consists of looking for the changes in advance and figuring out what to do about them."{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  Upon initial production, the magazine was known simply as ''Kiplinger Magazine'', changing its name to ''Changing Times'' in 1949 and acquiring its present name in 1991.

Much like ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, ownership of the Kiplinger's franchise has been kept in the family.  The current editor-in-chief is [[Knight Kiplinger]], who succeeded his father, [[Austin H. Kiplinger]].

On July 14, 2001, it was announced that ''Kiplinger's Personal Finance'' would be acquiring ''Individual Investor'' magazine.  Details of the deal included Kiplinger agreeing to pay $3.5 million for the ''Individual Investor'' subscription list and Kiplinger agreeing to assume $2.6 million in debt. At the time of the acquisition, ''Individual Investor'' had 430,000 subscribers (reportedly, Kiplinger had 1,000,000 subscribers before the acquisition).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/07/14/fin_individual_investor.html Individual Investor magazine shuts down].

'''Los Angeles Science Teachers Network''' is a professional development network for [[science education]] by science teachers for science teachers committed to creating the most engaging hands-on curriculum possible through [[inquiry-based learning]] and [[scientific literacy]].

==History==
The first meeting was held in [[Lisa Ellen Niver]]'s home in September 2009. In October 2013, the professional development network had its fifteenth session. Over seventy teachers and forty schools have been involved to date. In ''[[Westside Today]]'', information about teaching, science and LASTN was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Advisory Council==
Several teachers formed the core group and served as advisors to Niver over the first three years: Susan Bagdasarian, Sasha Moore, Joseph Rose and Judy Weiskopf. Niver was frequently asked about teaching science, she has been quoted in Parenting.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.parenting.com/gallery/everyday-ways-sneak-learning |title      =Everyday Ways to Sneak in Learning |work     =Parenting.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]].org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.pbs.org/parents/education/science/tips/weather-science-lessons/ |title      =Weather Science Lessons |work      = PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Green Living Arizona'' (in print),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.greenlivingaz.com/2012/05/08/5528/ |title      =Science vs. Nutrition the GMO debate |work      =Green Living Magazine Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Huffington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url        =  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/back-to-school-divorce-teachers_n_1761147.html?ir=Divorce#slide=1376638 |title      =Back to School 2012: Teachers Reveal Divorced Parents Biggest Mistakes |work     =  Huffington Post | date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on National television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqZqdq7Al24 |title      =Career Day |work     =National Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        = http://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/2012/08/success-story-science-fair-projects-with-real-world-impact.php |title      =  Success Story: Science Fair Projects with Real-World Impact |work      =Science Buddies}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Niver is on sabbatical with [[We Said Go Travel]], Susan Bagdasarian has been the director of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lisa-niver-rajna/0/871/6a3f |title      =LASTN |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/company/3148346?trk=tyah |title      =LASTN company |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messier 15''' or '''M15''' (also designated '''NGC 7078''') is a [[globular cluster]] in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]. It was discovered by [[Jean-Dominique Maraldi]] in 1746 and included in [[Charles Messier]]'s catalogue of [[comet]]-like objects in 1764.  At an estimated 12.0 billion years old, it is one of the oldest known globular clusters.

==Characteristics==
M15 is about 33,600 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]], and 175 light years in diameter.&lt;ref name="astropix" /&gt; It has an [[absolute magnitude]] of -9.2, which translates to a total [[luminosity]] of 360,000 times that of the [[Sun]]. Messier 15 is one of the most densely packed globulars known in the [[Milky Way galaxy]]. Its core has undergone a contraction known as '[[Core collapse (cluster)|core collapse]]' and it has a central density cusp with an enormous number of stars surrounding what may be a central black hole.&lt;ref name="Gerssen2002"&gt;

Home to over 100,000 stars,&lt;ref name="astropix"&gt;http://www.astropix.com/HTML/SHOW_DIG/M15_Pease1.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; the cluster is notable for containing a large number of [[variable star]]s (112) and [[pulsar]]s (8), including one double [[neutron star]] system, M15 C. M15 also contains [[Pease 1]], the first [[planetary nebula]] discovered within a globular cluster&lt;ref name="Gillettetal1989"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928. Just three others have been found in globular clusters since then.&lt;ref&gt;http://messier.seds.org/more/m015_h2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur astronomy==
At magnitude 6.2, M15 approaches [[naked eye]] visibility under good conditions and can be observed with binoculars or a small telescope, appearing as a fuzzy star.&lt;ref name="astropix" /&gt; Telescopes with a larger aperture (at least 6 in./150&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) will start to reveal individual stars, the brightest of which are of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] +12.6. The cluster appears 18 arc minutes in size.&lt;ref name="astropix" /&gt;

==X-ray sources==
[[Earth-orbiting]] [[satellite]]s [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] and [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] have detected two bright X-ray sources in this cluster: Messier 15 X-1 (4U 2129+12) and Messier 15 X-2.&lt;ref name=Forman&gt;

'''Mucigel''' is a slimy substance that covers the [[root cap]] of the [[root]]s of [[plants]]. It is a highly hydrated [[polysaccharide]], most likely a [[pectin]], which is secreted from the outermost (epidermal) [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of the rootcap. Mucigel is formed in the [[Golgi bodies]] of such cells, and is secreted through the process of [[exocytosis]]. The layer of [[microorganism]]-rich soil surrounding the mucigel is called the [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]].

Mucigel serves several functions, including&lt;!--but probably not limited to--&gt;:
* Protection of rootcap; prevents [[desiccation]]
* Lubrication of rootcap; allows root to more efficiently penetrate the soil
* Creation of [[symbiotic]] environment for [[nitrogen fixing]] [[bacteria]] (i.e. [[diazotrophs]]) and [[fungi]] (which help with water absorption)
* Provision of a 'diffusion bridge' between the fine root system and soil particles, which allows for a more efficient uptake of water and mineral nutrients by roots in dry soils.

The '''National Agricultural Law Center'''  at the [[University of Arkansas]] is a federally funded, nonpartisan research and information center that serves as the nation's leading source of agricultural and food law research and information. The Center is the only institution of its kind in the United States and serves the nation's vast agricultural community, which includes attorneys, farmers, federal and state policymakers, extension personnel, academics, students, consumers, and others.

The Center operates in conjunction with the [[United States National Agricultural Library]], an entity within the [[USDA]] Agricultural Research Service.  
In addition, the Center enjoys an institutional cooperative partnership with the Drake Agricultural Law Center directed by [[Neil Hamilton (lawyer)|Neil D. Hamilton]].

The Center's website is the primary means by which it disseminates its agricultural and food law research and information products. The website is a clearinghouse for legal information that spans nearly four dozen agricultural and food law topics both in the United States and around the world. As such, the website incorporates unique components that cannot be found elsewhere and provides an invaluable resource to those needing information on legal issues surrounding food and agriculture.

The Center is a nonpartisan entity and takes no position on the views expressed in any articles or writings published on the website. All such articles and writings are included for their legal or practical discussions of agricultural or food law topics rather than any particular viewpoint. Furthermore, while every effort is made to supply accurate and up-to-date information, the website is not meant as a source of legal advice, nor is it a substitute for a competent legal professional.

To make the vast store of information provided by this website more user-friendly, the site is divided into sections to help focus the researcher on a particular task at hand.

== About the center ==
This section provides a description of the National Agricultural Law Center, its mission, its history, and its affiliations. Also included are contact information for the Center, biographical and contact information for Center staff, a list of contributors to the website's publications, multi-lingual translations of the Center's brochure, and links to the Center's bi-monthly e-Newsletter and [[The United States Agricultural &amp; Food Law and Policy Blog]].

== Reading rooms ==
One of the most important services provided by the National Agricultural Law Center is the construction and maintenance of its Reading Rooms. A Reading Room is a compilation of electronic resources that provides readers with a way to access extensive agricultural and food law research and information.

At the beginning of each Reading Room is an Overview article designed to familiarize the reader with the particular subject area, followed by a listing of major federal statutes affecting the area, links to applicable federal regulations, and a case law index of citations to recent common-law authority.

Secondary sources relevant to the Reading Room, including Center research publications, Congressional Research Service reports addressing agricultural and food law issues, governmental and non-governmental reference resources, and other publications are included in each Reading Room.

For example, the Agritourism Reading Room defines the term "agritourism" and briefly outlines some potential legal issues inherent in the topic, lists the relevant state and federal statutes that affect this area of the law, provides a case law index of precedential cases, and supplies links to various publications from the federal government, state governments, interested organizations, and experts in the field.

== Publications ==
This section contains articles researched and written by the Center's staff, leading agricultural and food law scholars, and legal practitioners throughout the country and the world. The publications are grouped by topic and listed in alphabetical order.

As a nonpartisan entity, the Center does not advocate for or against any particular viewpoint. While many articles may espouse an author's position on any given issue, the Center publishes the articles for the background and legal analysis on the subject. As such, the publications are provided to assist researchers in understanding the complex web of agricultural and food law issues that confront all components of the agricultural sector.

== The AgLaw Reporter ==
This section includes all issues of the Agricultural Law Update, the professional monthly newsletter of the American Agricultural Law Association (AALA). The Agricultural Law Update Newsletters contain useful and timely articles on a variety of agricultural topics ranging from conservation programs to taxation issues. In addition, the newsletters cover recent cases and laws that affect the nation's agricultural community and the attorneys and policymakers who represent them.

Also included in the area updates to the Federal Register Digest since January, 2002 that provide a brief summary of agricultural and food law regulatory changes published in the Federal Register.

Judicial Officer Decisions on cases heard by those delegated authority by the [[Secretary of Agriculture]] to act as the final deciding officer in USDA adjudicatory proceedings are also contained on this page. Case Law Indexes and Case Summaries compiled and written by Center staff and the ever-expanding are also included in the AgLaw Reporter. The case law indexes and the summaries of these cases provide an extensive annotation of the common law surrounding agricultural and food law issues throughout the country and around the world.

The State Law Clearinghouse provides readers with access to state statutes and administrative codes that regulate agricultural and food law issues such as states' biofuels statutes, recreational use statutes, animal cruelty laws, alternative dispute statutes, and climate change legislation. Many issues pertaining to agriculture are administered on the state or local level, and this resource is geared towards providing the statutory language of state laws and regulations that affect agriculture and food.

== Farm bills ==
Another important service provided by the National Agricultural Law Center, and one of the most popular, is the complete collection of digitized farm bills from the original legislation in 1933 to the most recently enacted 2008 Farm Bill, technically known as the [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008]]. Legislative history of each [[U.S. Farm Bill]], research articles, and links to outside sources concerning the farm bills are included also included in this section of the Center's website.

The depth and breadth of material provided in this area of the website surpasses anything else currently available, making it one of the most complete reference collections anywhere for United States Farm Bills.

== Glossary ==
Agriculture and food law contains thousands of words, definitions, and acronyms not commonly understood by laypersons or many attorneys. To remedy that problem Chuck Culver, Director for Development for the Division of Agriculture at the University of Arkansas, has created and published the Glossary of Agricultural Production, Programs, and Policy—Fourth Edition, an extensive list of legal and non-legal definitions of terms and acronyms used in the food and agricultural fields.

== Agricultural law bibliography ==
Professor Drew Kershen, Earl Sneed Centennial Professor of Law at the [[University of Oklahoma College of Law]], created the Agricultural Law Bibliography, which is a bibliography of agricultural law that spans over 50 years of law journals, law reviews, and legal periodicals that publish articles, comments, notes, and developments that comprise the body of published research in agricultural and food law. The Agricultural Law Bibliography is updated quarterly and published on the Center web site.

Center staff are currently contacting authors and publications listed in the bibliography in an effort to provide digitized copies of as many of the listed articles as possible. More than 1000 articles have been digitized to date.

== Congressional Research Service Reports ==
The Center provides an extensive database of Congressional Research Service Reports pertinent to agricultural and food law and policy issues. The [[Congressional Research Service]] reports are a non-partisan objective analysis of a question posed by a congressman or woman and commonly range in length from 5 to around 30 pages. The reports are grouped according to topic and subtopic, including areas such as animal agriculture, international trade, climate change, and environmental law. The Center continuously publishes new Congressional Research Service reports as they become available.

== Reference desk ==
This section contains the links to many different organizations that have some focus on agriculture or agricultural law. Links on this page include government websites, universities, law reviews and journals, associations, practice groups, libraries, and publications.

== State compilations ==
The State Law Clearinghouse provides readers with access to state statutes and administrative codes that regulate agricultural issues. Many issues pertaining to agriculture and food are administered on the state or local level, and this resource is geared towards providing the statutory language of state laws and regulations that affect agriculture.

The '''National Ignition Facility''' ('''NIF'''), is a large [[laser]]-based [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research device, located at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[Livermore, California]]. NIF uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of [[Fusion power#Fuels|hydrogen fuel]] with the goal of inducing [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. NIF's mission is to achieve [[fusion ignition]] with high [[fusion energy gain factor|energy gain]], and to support [[nuclear weapon]] [[stockpile stewardship|maintenance]] and design by studying the [[equation of state|behavior of matter]] under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/ "About NIF &amp; Photon Science"], Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/world-most-powerful-laser-120322.htm|title=RebelMouse vs. WordPress VIP|author=|date=10 May 2017|website=discovery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the NIF began in 1997 but management problems and technical delays slowed progress into the early 2000s. Progress after 2000 was smoother, but compared to initial estimates, NIF was completed five years behind schedule and was almost four times more expensive than originally budgeted. Construction was certified complete on 31 March 2009 by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]],&lt;ref name="Certified complete"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Energy Announces Completion of World's Largest Laser |url=https://www.energy.gov/news2009/7191.htm |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2009-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401194726/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/7191.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a dedication ceremony took place on 29 May 2009.&lt;ref name="dedication"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dedication of world's largest laser marks the dawn of a new era | url=https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2009/NR-09-05-05.html | publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] | date=2009-05-29 | accessdate=2009-09-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527184853/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2009/NR-09-05-05.html | archivedate=2010-05-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale laser target experiments were performed in June 2009&lt;ref name="firstshots"&gt;{{cite web | title=First NIF Shots Fired to Hohlraum Targets | url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2009/june.php | publisher=National Ignition Facility | date=June 2009 | accessdate=2009-09-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528000229/https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2009/june.php | archivedate=2010-05-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first "integrated ignition experiments" (which tested the laser's power) were declared completed in October 2010.&lt;ref name="Oct8_10"&gt;{{cite web | title = First successful integrated experiment at National Ignition Facility announced | work = General Physics | publisher = PhysOrg.com | date = October 8, 2010 | url = http://www.physorg.com/news205740709.html | accessdate = 2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing the system to its full potential was a lengthy process that was carried out from 2009 to 2012. During this period a number of experiments were worked into the process under the National Ignition Campaign, with the goal of reaching ignition just after the laser reached full power, some time in the second half of 2012. The Campaign officially ended in September 2012, at about {{frac|10}} the conditions needed for ignition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Crandall |first=David |title=Final Review of the National Ignition Campaign |url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_rev6_Koonin_2012.pdf |date=27 December 2010 |publisher=Department of Energy |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments since then have pushed this closer to {{frac|3}}, but considerable theoretical and practical work is required if the system is ever to reach ignition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Assessment of the Prospects for Inertial Fusion Energy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBKfAwAAQBAJ |publisher= National Academies Press |date=July 2013 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, NIF has been used primarily for materials science and weapons research.

==Description==

===ICF basics===
{{Main|inertial confinement fusion#ICF mechanism of action|l1=ICF mechanism}}
Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices use ''drivers'' to rapidly heat the outer layers of a ''target'' in order to compress it. The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). The energy of the laser heats the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inward, eventually compressing it into a small point of extremely high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels toward the center of the compressed fuel from all sides. When it reaches the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed to a greater degree. When the temperature and density of that small spot are raised high enough, fusion reactions occur and release energy.&lt;ref name=how&gt;[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ "How NIF works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Retrieved on October 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, some of which, primarily [[alpha particle]]s, collide with the surrounding high density fuel and heat it further. If this process deposits enough energy in a given area it can cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. However, the fuel is also losing heat through [[x-ray]] losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area, so the rate of alpha heating must be greater than these losses, a condition known as ''bootstrapping''.&lt;ref name=hurricane&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/climbing-mountain-fusion-ignition-interview-omar-hurricane |title=Climbing the mountain of fusion ignition: an interview with Omar Hurricane |website=LLNL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel—high enough density and temperature—this bootstrapping process will result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as ''ignition'', which will lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion and releasing large amounts of energy.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html|title=Inertial Fusion Energy: A Tutorial on the Technology and Economics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221233137/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html|archivedate=2008-12-21 |last=Peterson|first=Per F.|date=1998-09-23|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the target. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles. The laser energy also must be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other drivers have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in [[particle accelerator]]s, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.&lt;ref&gt;Per F. Peterson, [http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/target.html "How IFE Targets Work"], University of California, Berkeley, 1998.

===Driver laser===
NIF aims to create a single 500&amp;nbsp;[[watt|terawatt]] (TW) peak flash of light that reaches the target from numerous directions at the same time, within a few [[1 E-12 s|picoseconds]]. The design uses 192 beamlines in a parallel system of flashlamp-pumped, neodymium-doped phosphate glass lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: NNSA and LLNL announce first successful integrated experiment at NIF|url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/nnsa-and-llnl-announce-first-successful-integrated-experiment-nif|work=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=6 October 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that the output of the beamlines is uniform, the initial laser light is amplified from a single source in the Injection Laser System (ILS). This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an [[ytterbium]]-doped optical fiber laser known as the Master Oscillator.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Wisoff et al., ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..146W NIF Injection Laser System]'', Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5341, pages 146–155&lt;/ref&gt;  The light from the Master Oscillator is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a [[neodymium]] glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6&amp;nbsp;joules. According to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the NIF]'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

[[Image:NIF beamline diagram.png|thumb|left|400px|Simplified diagram of the beampath of a NIF laser beam, one of 192 similar beamlines. On the left are the amplifiers and [[Pockels effect|optical switch]], and on the right is the final spatial filter, switchyard and [[optical frequency multiplier|optical frequency converter]].]]

The main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] by a total of 7,680 [[xenon flash lamp]]s (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a [[capacitor]] bank which stores a total of 422&amp;nbsp;MJ (117&amp;nbsp;kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the main amplifier section four times, using an [[Pockels effect|optical switch]] located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6&amp;nbsp;J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500&amp;nbsp;TW.

Near the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are ''[[spatial filter]]s''. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a [[photomask|mask]] cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the [[Cyclops laser]], an earlier LLNL experiment.

The total length of the path the laser beam propagates from one end to the other, including switches, is about {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}. The various optical elements in the beamlines are generally packaged into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), standardized boxes about the size of a vending machine that can be dropped out of the beamline for replacement from below.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Doug W. (2004). ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..127L NIF laser line-replaceable units (LRUs)]'', ''Optical Engineering at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory II: The National Ignition Facility.'' {{doi|10.1117/12.538467}}. Retrieved on May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After the amplification is complete the light is switched back into the beamline, where it runs to the far end of the building to the ''target chamber''. The target chamber is a {{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-diameter}} multi-piece steel sphere weighing {{convert|130000|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/222792/ |title=Could This Lump Power the Planet? |author=Lyons, Daniel |date=2009-11-14 |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |page=3 |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117020847/http://www.newsweek.com/id/222792 |archivedate=November 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just before reaching the target chamber, the light is reflected off various mirrors in the ''switchyard'' and target area in order to impinge on the target from different directions. Since the length of the overall path from the Master Oscillator to the target is different for each of the beamlines, optics are used to delay the light in order to ensure all of them reach the center within a few picoseconds of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Arnie Heller, ''[https://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug05/VanArsdall.html Orchestrating the World's Most Powerful Laser]'', Science &amp; Technology Review, July/August 2005. Retrieved on May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; NIF normally directs the laser into the chamber from the top and bottom. The target area and switchyard system can be reconfigured by moving half of the 48 beamlines to alternate positions closer to the equator of the target chamber.

[[Image:NIF building layout.png|thumb|right|400px|NIF's basic layout. The laser pulse is generated in the room just right of center, and is sent into the beamlines (blue) on either side. After several passes through the beamlines the light is sent into the "switchyard" (red) where it is aimed into the target chamber (silver).]]

One of the last steps in the process before reaching the target chamber is to convert the infrared (IR) light at 1053&amp;nbsp;nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351&amp;nbsp;nm in a device known as a [[optical frequency multiplier|frequency converter]].&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Wegner et al.,''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..180W NIF final optics system: frequency conversion and beam conditioning]'', Proceedings of SPIE 5341, May 2004, pages 180–189.&lt;/ref&gt; These are made of thin sheets (about 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick) cut from a single crystal of [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]. When the 1053&amp;nbsp;nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527&amp;nbsp;nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527&amp;nbsp;nm light and the remaining 1053&amp;nbsp;nm light into 351&amp;nbsp;nm (UV) light. [[Infrared]] (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot [[electrons]] which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat [[time|temporal]] shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;Bibeau, Camille; Paul J. Wegner, Ruth Hawley-Fedder (June 1, 2006).

One important aspect of any ICF research project is ensuring that experiments can actually be carried out on a timely basis. Previous devices generally had to cool down for many hours to allow the flashlamps and laser glass to regain their shapes after firing (due to thermal expansion), limiting use to one or fewer firings a day. One of the goals for NIF is to reduce this time to less than four hours, in order to allow 700 firings a year.&lt;ref name=performance&gt;''[https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2003/NR-03-06-01.html NIF Project Sets Record for Laser Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528023239/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2003/NR-03-06-01.html |date=2010-05-28 }}'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, June 5, 2003.

The name National Ignition Facility refers to the goal of igniting the fusion fuel, a long-sought threshold in fusion research. In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually in order to keep the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against those losses. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear ''burn''. Ignition is considered a key requirement if [[fusion power]] is to ever become practical.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

NIF is designed primarily to use the ''indirect drive'' method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a [[hohlraum]] (German for "hollow room", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense [[X-ray]]s, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the [[OMEGA laser|OMEGA]] and [[Nova laser]]s, validated this approach through the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;J.D.

The hollow interior also contains a small amount of DT gas.

In a typical experiment, the laser will generate 3&amp;nbsp;MJ of infrared laser energy of a possible 4. About 1.5&amp;nbsp;MJ of this is left after conversion to UV, and about 15 percent of this is lost in the x-ray conversion in the hohlraum. About 15 percent of the resulting x-rays, about 150&amp;nbsp;kJ, will be absorbed by the outer layers of the target.&lt;ref name=gain&gt;Suter, L.; J. Rothenberg, D.

===Other concepts===
NIF is also exploring new types of targets. Previous experiments generally used plastic [[laser ablation|ablators]], typically [[polystyrene]] (CH). NIF's targets also are constructed by coating a plastic form with a layer of sputtered [[beryllium]] or beryllium-copper alloys, and then oxidizing the plastic out of the center.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Wilson et all, ''[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PHPAEN000005000005001953000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes The development and advantages of beryllium capsules for the National Ignition Facility]'', Phys.

Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to traditional plastic targets, beryllium targets offer higher overall implosion efficiencies for the indirect-drive mode where the incoming energy is in the form of x-rays.

Although NIF was primarily designed as an indirect drive device, the energy in the laser is high enough to be used as a ''direct drive'' system as well, where the laser shines directly on the target. Even at UV wavelengths the power delivered by NIF is estimated to be more than enough to cause ignition, resulting in [[Fusion energy gain factor|fusion energy gains]] of about 40 times,&lt;ref&gt;S.

A more uniform beam layout suitable for direct drive experiments can be arranged through changes in the switchyard that move half of the beamlines to locations closer to the middle of the target chamber.

It has been shown, using scaled implosions on the OMEGA laser and computer simulations, that NIF should also be capable of igniting a capsule using the so-called ''polar direct drive'' (PDD) configuration where the target is irradiated directly by the laser, but only from the top and bottom, with no changes to the NIF beamline layout.&lt;ref name=pdd&gt;Yaakobi, B.; R.

Other targets, called ''saturn targets'', are specifically designed to reduce the anisotropy and improve the implosion.&lt;ref&gt;True, M. A.; J. R. Albritton, and E. A.

==History==

===Impetus===
[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]'s (LLNL) history with the ICF program starts with physicist [[John Nuckolls]], who started considering the problem after a 1957 meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear weapons arranged by [[Edward Teller]] at LLNL. During these meetings, the idea later known as [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of small [[hydrogen bomb]]s in large underground caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls/&gt;

There are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium-based atomic bomb known as the ''primary'', and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the ''secondary''. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes ignition. The secondary consists of [[lithium deuteride]] fuel, which requires an external neutron source to begin the reaction. This is normally in the form of a D-T "spark plug" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with D-T gas, essentially making the spark plug the entire secondary. At that point there is no theoretical smallest size - as the secondary got smaller, so did the amount of energy needed to reach ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls&gt;John Nuckolls, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf "Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)"], LLNL, 12 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed the outlines of the ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5&amp;nbsp;MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1&amp;nbsp;MJ beam.&lt;ref name="EarlyNuckolls"/&gt; To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5&amp;nbsp;kt releases 2 million MJ in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html "Convert kilotons, to megajoules"], Unit Juggler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994.

===ICF program begins===
While Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon designer [[Ray Kidder]] was working on the direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed [[KMS Fusion]] to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now a hot topic and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls/&gt; LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]) or KrF (e.g. [[Nike laser]], [[Naval Research Laboratory]]).

Throughout these early stages of development, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily [[LASNEX]]. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the [[Shiva laser]] project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to [[electron]]s rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.

Further upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system emerged as the 20-beam 200&amp;nbsp;kJ [[Nova laser]] concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351&amp;nbsp;nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency.&lt;ref name=peer&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=Matthew |last1=McKinzie |first2=Christopher |last2=Paine |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nif2/findings.asp |title=When Peer Review Fails |publisher=NDRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30&amp;nbsp;kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.

===Halite and Centurion===
With each experiment, the predicted energy needed to reach ignition rose, and it was not clear that post-Nova predictions were any more accurate than earlier ones. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the [[Nevada Test Site]] that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite or Centurion depending on which lab ran it, LLNL or LANL.

Each test was able to simultaneously illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy and the size of the fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted.&lt;ref name=secretadvance&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among Scientists |first=William |last=Broad |date=21 March 1988 |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/21/us/secret-advance-in-nuclear-fusion-spurs-a-dispute-among-scientists.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, "A strategy for determining the driver requirements for high gain ICF implosions utilizing hydrodynamically equivalent capsules on Nova laser", Laser Annual Program Report, 1981, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Livermore, CA, UCRL-50055-80/81, pp.2-29-2-57 (unpublished)&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the tests suggested that about 10&amp;nbsp;MJ of x-ray energy would be needed to reach ignition.&lt;ref name=secretadvance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Math+society+says+no+to+SDI+funding.-a06540237 "Laser advance amid pros and con(fusion)s of DOE fusion path"], Free Online Library, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, Rober McCrory and Michael Campbell, [http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~phy189h1/Ignition%20and%20Inertial%20Confinement%20Fusion.pdf "Progress Toward Ignition and Burn Propagation in Inertial Confinement Fusion"], ''Physics Today'', September 1992, pp. 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/10455/|title=Infighting Among Rival Theorists Imperils 'Hot' Fusion Lab Plan|author=|date=|website=The Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Schewe and Ben Stein, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Lindl.txt "Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Article Announcement"], ''Physics News'', 25 October 1995&lt;/ref&gt; If this energy is supplied by an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original laser energy on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies.&lt;ref name=secretadvance/&gt;

A great debate broke out in the ICF establishment as a result. One group suggested that they attempt to build a laser of this power; [[Leonardo Mascheroni]] and Claude Phipps designed a new type of [[hydrogen fluoride laser]] that was pumped by high-energy [[electron]]s that would be able to reach the 100&amp;nbsp;MJ limit. Others used the same data and new versions of their computer simulations based on these experiments that suggested that careful shaping of the laser pulse and using more beams spread more evenly showed that ignition and net energy gains could be achieved with a laser between 5 and 10&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6686429-47queD/6686429.pdf|title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=osti.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, Development of the Indirect-Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain, Physics of Plasmas Vol. 2, No. 11, November 1995; pp. 3933–4024&lt;/ref&gt;

These results prompted the DOE to request a custom military ICF facility they called the "Laboratory Microfusion Facility" (LMF). LMF would use a driver on the order of 10&amp;nbsp;MJ, delivering fusion yields of between 100 and 1,000&amp;nbsp;MJ. A 1989/90 review of this concept by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] suggested that the LMF was too large a step to make at once, and that fundamental physics issues still needed to be explored. They recommended further experiments before attempting to move to a 10&amp;nbsp;MJ system. Nevertheless, the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy requirements, and noted "Indeed, if it did turn out that a 100 MJ driver were required for ignition and gain, one would have to rethink the entire approach to, and rationale for, ICF".&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Department of Energy's Inertial Confinement Fusion Program, Final Report, National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

===LMF and Nova Upgrade===
Building the LMF was estimated to cost about $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=upgrade&gt;''Nova Upgrade - A Proposed ICF Facility to Demonstrate Ignition and Gain'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ICF Program, July 1992&lt;/ref&gt; LLNL initially submitted a design with a 5&amp;nbsp;MJ 350&amp;nbsp;nm (UV) driver laser that would be able to reach about 200&amp;nbsp;MJ yield, which was enough to attain the majority of the LMF goals. The program was estimated to cost about $600&amp;nbsp;million FY 1989 dollars, and an additional $250&amp;nbsp;million to upgrade it to a full 1,000&amp;nbsp;MJ if needed, and would grow to well over $1&amp;nbsp;billion if LMF was to meet all of the goals requested by the DOE.&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt; Other labs also proposed their own LMF designs using other technologies.

The National Academy of Sciences review led to a reevaluation of these plans, and in July 1990, LLNL responded with the Nova Upgrade, which would reuse the majority of the existing Nova facility, along with the adjacent Shiva facility. The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept, with a driver of about 1&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, M.T et all, ''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/578/5735/00218762.pdf?tp=&amp;isnumber=&amp;arnumber=218762 Target area for Nova Upgrade: containing ignition and beyond]'', Fusion Engineering, 1991, pg. 650–655. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The new design included a number of features that advanced the state of the art in the driver section, including the multi-pass design in the main amplifiers, and 18 beamlines (up from 10) that were split into 288 "beamlets" as they entered the target area in order to improve the uniformity of illumination. The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500&amp;nbsp;TW in a 4&amp;nbsp;ns pulse. The upgrades were expected to allow the new Nova to produce fusion yields of between 2 and 10&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt; The initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around $400&amp;nbsp;million, with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999.

===NIF emerges===
Throughout this period, the ending of the [[Cold War]] led to dramatic changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons.&lt;ref&gt;William Broad, ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D9133DF932A15755C0A962958260 Vast Laser Plan Would Further Fusion and Keep Bomb Experts]'', New York Times, June 21, 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, progress was being made on what would become the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]], which would ban all [[critical mass|criticality]] testing. This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.

[[File:Preamplifier at the National Ignition Facility.jpg|left|400px|thumb|The preamplifiers of the National Ignition Facility are the first step in increasing the energy of laser beams as they make their way toward the target chamber. In 2012 NIF achieved a 500 terawatt shot—1,000 times more power than the [[electric energy consumption#World electricity consumption (2012)|United States uses at any instant in time]].]]
Out of these changes came the [[Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program]] (SSMP), which, among other things, included funds for the development of methods to design and build nuclear weapons that would work without having to be explosively tested. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Charles Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, June 15, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It is not clearly stated why Nova Upgrade would be too small for SSMP, no reason is given in the available resources.}} and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;1.9 Cost (NIF CDR, Chapter 9)&lt;/ref&gt; with completion in 2002.

In spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in several highly critical comments by scientists at other weapons labs, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had "virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues" and that "Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves".&lt;ref&gt;"Livermore's costly fusion laser won't fly, scientists say", Albuquerque Tribune, May 29, 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: "NIF is worthless ... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period".&lt;ref&gt;L. Spohn, "NIF opponents to cite criticism of laser in court battle", Albuquerque Tribune, June 13, 1997, p. A15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrasting view was expressed by Victor Reis, assistant secretary for Defense Programs within DOE and the chief architect of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Reis told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee in 1997 that NIF was "designed to produce, for the first time in a laboratory setting, conditions of temperature and density of matter close to those that occur in the detonation of nuclear weapons. The ability to study the behavior of matter and the transfer of energy and radiation under these conditions is key to understanding the basic physics of nuclear weapons and predicting their performance without underground nuclear testing.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Dr. Victor Reis, Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs, Department of Energy, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1997 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/Director/reisSASC97.html )&lt;/ref&gt; Two JASON panels, which are composed of scientific and technical national security experts, have stated that the NIF is the most scientifically valuable of all programs proposed for science-based stockpile stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Federico Peña, Secretary, US Dept of Energy, before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, March 26, 1998 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from {{cite web |url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205200200/http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |archivedate=2011-02-05 |df= }} )&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the initial criticism, Sandia, as well as Los Alamos, provided support in the development of many NIF technologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/274120-bKjglv/webviewable/274120.pdf |title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both laboratories later became partners with NIF in the National Ignition Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |title=National Ignition Campaign: Participants, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017203631/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructing NIF===
[[File:Beamlet Laser.jpg|thumb|The Beamlet laser tested the design and techniques that would be used on NIF.]]
[[File:NIF target chamber construction.jpg|thumb|The NIF target chamber was so large it had to be built in sections.]]
Work on the NIF started with a single beamline demonstrator, Beamlet. Beamlet operated between 1994 and 1997 and was entirely successful. It was then sent to [[Sandia National Laboratories]] as a light source in their [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]]. A full-sized demonstrator then followed, in AMPLAB, which started operations in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Horvath, ''[https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/234367.pdf Assembly and Maintenance of Full Scale NIF Amplifiers in the Amplifier Module Prototype Laboratory (AMPLAB)]'', Third Annual International Conference on Solid State Lasers for Application (SSLA) to Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF), July 16, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The official groundbreaking on the main NIF site was in May 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/multimedia/photo_gallery/building_nif/?id=1&amp;category=building_nif |title=Multimedia: Photo Gallery, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |date=1997-05-29 |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724042234/https://lasers.llnl.gov/multimedia/photo_gallery/building_nif/?id=1&amp;category=building_nif |archivedate=2012-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the DOE was estimating that the NIF would cost approximately $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion and another $1&amp;nbsp;billion for related research, and would be complete as early as 2002.&lt;ref name=GAO1&gt;''[http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/rc00141.pdf NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY, Management and Oversight Failures Caused Major Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays]'', GAO, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1997 the DOE approved an additional $100&amp;nbsp;million in funding and pushed the operational date back to 2004. As late as 1998 LLNL's public documents stated the overall price was $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion, with the first eight lasers coming online in 2001 and full completion in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Howard T. Powell and Richard H. Sawicki, ''[https://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the National Ignition Facility]'', S&amp;TR, March 1998. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical scale of the facility alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the "conventional facility" (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent of the rest of the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.

There were also unexpected challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Niño weather front dumped two inches of rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just three days before the scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-26-01newsline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726024319/https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-26-01newsline.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/fusion_fun/niffy.php |title=Education: Fusion Fun: NIFFY, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125052443/https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/fusion_fun/niffy.php |archivedate=2013-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of research and development, technology and engineering challenges also had to be overcome, such as working with the optics industry to create a precision large optics fabrication capability to supply the laser glass for NIF's 7,500 meter-sized optics. State-of-the-art optics measurement, coating and finishing techniques were needed to withstand NIF's high-energy lasers, as were methods for amplifying the laser beams to the needed energy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osolin |first=Charles |url=http://www.innovation-america.org/harnessing-power-light |title=Harnessing the Power of Light |publisher=Innovation America |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous-pour glass, rapid-growth crystals, innovative optical switches, and deformable mirrors were among the technology innovations developed for NIF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/nif/seven_wonders.php |title=National Ignition Facility: The Seven Wonders of NIF, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017204200/https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/nif/seven_wonders.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandia, with extensive experience in pulsed power delivery, designed the capacitor banks used to feed the flashlamps, completing the first unit in October 1998. To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed that there was no way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing.&lt;ref name=peer/&gt; Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350&amp;nbsp;million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.&lt;ref name=GAO1/&gt;

===Re-baseline and GAO report===
[[File:Bill Richardson, official DOE photo.png|thumb|Bill Richardson began a review process that brought NIF construction back under control.]]

Throughout this period the problems with NIF were not being reported up the management chain. In 1999 then [[Secretary of Energy]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] reported to Congress that the NIF project was on time and budget, following the information that had been passed onto him by NIF's management. In August that year it was revealed that NIF management had misled Richardson, and in fact neither claim was close to the truth.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;James Glanz, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/081900sci-laser-missiles.html Laser Project Is Delayed and Over Budget]'', New York Times, August 19, 2000. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As the GAO would later note, "Furthermore, the Laboratory's former laser director, who oversaw NIF and all other laser activities, assured Laboratory managers, DOE, the university, and the Congress that the NIF project was adequately funded and staffed and was continuing on cost and schedule, even while he was briefed on clear and growing evidence that NIF had serious problems".&lt;ref name=GAO1/&gt; Richardson later commented "I have been very concerned about the management of this facility... bad management has overtaken good science. I don't want this to ever happen again". A DOE Task Force reporting to Richardson late in January 2000 summarized that "organizations of the NIF project failed to implement program and project management procedures and processes commensurate with a major research and development project... [and that] ...no one gets a passing grade on NIF Management: not the DOE's office of Defense Programs, not the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and not the University of California".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.seab.energy.gov/publications/nif_rpt.pdf Interim Report of the National Ignition Facility Laser System Task Force]'', Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, January 10, 2000.

Given the budget problems, the [[US Congress]] requested an independent review by the [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO). They returned a highly critical report in August 2000 stating that the budget was likely $3.9 billion, including R&amp;D, and that the facility was unlikely to be completed anywhere near on time.&lt;ref name="GAO1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fas101&gt;''[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2000/fyi00.101.htm GAO Report Cites New NIF Cost Estimate]'', FYI, American Institute of Physics, Number 101: August 30, 2000. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The report, "''Management and Oversight Failures Caused Major Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays''," identified management problems for the overruns, and also criticized the program for failing to include a considerable amount of money dedicated to target fabrication in the budget, including it in operational costs instead of development.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Early technical delays and project management issues caused the DOE to begin a comprehensive "Rebaseline Validation Review of the National Ignition Facility Project" in 2000, which took a critical look at the project, identifying areas of concern and adjusting the schedule and budget to ensure completion. [[John A. Gordon|John Gordon]], National Nuclear Security Administrator, stated "We have prepared a detailed bottom-up cost and schedule to complete the NIF project... The independent review supports our position that the NIF management team has made significant progress and resolved earlier problems".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hoffman, ''[http://lanl-the-rest-of-the-story.blogspot.com/2007/06/nuclear-testing-gear-in-doubt-livermore.html Nuclear testing gear in doubt]'', MediaNews Group,&lt;/ref&gt; The report revised their budget estimate to $2.25&amp;nbsp;billion, not including related R&amp;D which pushed it to $3.3&amp;nbsp;billion total, and pushed back the completion date to 2006 with the first lines coming online in 2004.&lt;ref name=fas65&gt;''[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2000/fyi00.065.htm New Cost and Schedule Estimates for National Ignition Facility]'', FYI: The API Bulletin of Science Policy News, American Institute of Physics.

Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up report the next year included all of these items, pushing the budget to $4.2 billion, and the completion date to around 2008.

Miller (physicist)|George Miller]] (who later became LLNL director 2006-2011), who was named acting associate director for lasers. [[Ed Moses (physicist)|Ed Moses]], former head of the [[Atomic vapor laser isotope separation|Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation]] (AVLIS) program at LLNL, became NIF project manager. Since the rebaselining, NIF's management has received many positive reviews and the project has met the budgets and schedules approved by Congress. In October 2010, the project was named "Project of the Year" by the [[Project Management Institute]], which cited NIF as a "stellar example of how properly applied project management excellence can bring together global teams to deliver a project of this scale and importance efficiently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/newsreleases/2010/Oct/NR-10-10-03.html |title=National Ignition Facility wins prestigious 2010 project of the year award |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 11, 2010 |website=llnl.gov |publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent reviews of the project have been positive, generally in keeping with the post-GAO Rebaseline schedules and budgets. However, there were lingering concerns about the NIF's ability to reach ignition, at least in the short term. An independent review by the [[JASON Defense Advisory Group]] was generally positive about NIF's prospects over the long term, but concluded that "The scientific and technical challenges in such a complex activity suggest that success in the early attempts at ignition in 2010, while possible, is unlikely".&lt;ref name=jason&gt;''[http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/jason/nif.pdf NIF Ignition]'', JASON Program, June 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The group suggested a number of changes to the completion timeline to bring NIF to its full design power as soon as possible, skipping over a testing period at lower powers that they felt had little value.

===Early tests and construction completion ===
In May 2003, the NIF achieved "first light" on a bundle of four beams, producing a 10.4 kJ pulse of IR light in a single beamline.&lt;ref name=performance/&gt; In 2005 the first eight beams (a full bundle) were fired producing 153 kJ of infrared light, thus eclipsing OMEGA as the highest energy laser (per pulse) on the planet. By January 2007 all of the LRUs in the Master Oscillator Room (MOOR) were complete and the computer room had been installed. By August 2007 96 laser lines were completed and commissioned, and "A total infrared energy of more than 2.5 megajoules has now been fired. This is more than 40 times what the Nova laser typically operated at the time it was the world's largest laser".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2007/NR-07-11-05.html World's largest laser picks up the pace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527234734/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2007/NR-07-11-05.html |date=2010-05-27 }}'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, November 21, 2007.

===Buildup to main experiments===
On January 28, 2010, the facility published a paper reporting the delivery of a 669 kJ pulse to a gold [[hohlraum]], setting new records for power delivery by a laser, and leading to analysis suggesting that suspected interference by generated plasma would not be a problem in igniting a fusion reaction.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the size of the test hohlraums, laser/plasma interactions produced plasma-optics gratings, acting like tiny prisms, which produced symmetric X-ray drive on the capsule inside the hohlraum.&lt;ref name="Seaver"/&gt;

After gradually altering the wavelength of the laser, they were able to compress a spherical capsule evenly, and were able to heat it up to 3.3 million [[kelvin]]s (285 eV).&lt;ref name="Bullis"/&gt; The capsule contained cryogenically cooled gas, acting as a substitute for the [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] fuel capsules that will be used later on.&lt;ref name="Seaver"/&gt; Plasma Physics Group Leader Dr. Siegfried Glenzer said they've shown they can maintain the precise fuel layers needed in the lab, but not yet within the laser system.&lt;ref name="Bullis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/energy/24720/ |title=Scientists Overcome Obstacle to Fusion |author=Bullis, Kevin |date=January 28, 2010 |publisher=''[[Technology Review]]'' |accessdate=2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2010, the NIF could run as high as 1.8 megajoules. Glenzer said that experiments with slightly larger hohlraums containing fusion-ready fuel pellets would begin before May 2010, slowly ramping up to 1.2 megajoules &amp;mdash; enough for ignition according to calculations. But first the target chamber needed to be equipped with shields to block [[neutrons]] that a fusion reaction would produce.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt; On June 5, 2010 the NIF team fired lasers at the target chamber for the first time in six months; realignment of the beams took place later in June in preparation for further high-energy operation.&lt;ref name="Status2010June"&gt;

===National Ignition Campaign===
[[File:Technician inside NIF target chamber.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Technician works on target positioner inside National Ignition Facility (NIF) target chamber.]]
With the main construction complete, NIF started working on the "National Ignition Campaign" (NIC), the quest to reach ignition. By this time, so sure were the experimenters that ignition would be reached that articles began appearing in science magazines stating that it would be announced only a short time after the article was published. [[Scientific American]] started a 2010 review article with the statement "Ignition is close now. Within a year or two..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Moyer |title=Fusion's False Dawn |magazine=Scientific American |date=March 2010 |pages=50–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first test was carried out on 8 October 2010 at slightly over 1&amp;nbsp;MJ. However, a number of problems slowed the drive toward ignition-level laser energies in the 1.4 to 1.5 MJ range.

Progress was initially slowed by the potential for damage from overheating due to a concentration of energy on optical components that is greater than anything previously attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=superlaser-national-ignition-facility |title=Superlaser fires a blank |author=Eugenie Samuel Reich  |date=October 18, 2010 |publisher=''[[Scientific American]]'' |accessdate=2010-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues included problems layering the fuel inside the targets, and minute quantities of dust being found on the capsule surface.&lt;ref name=kramerreview&gt;David Kramer, [http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html "NIF overcomes some problems, receives mixed review from its DOE overseer"], ''Physics Today'', 21 April 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430001208/http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html |date=April 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the power was increased and targets of increasing sophistication were used, another problem appeared that was causing an asymmetric implosion. This was eventually traced to minute amounts of water vapor in the target chamber which froze to the windows on the ends of the hohlraums. This was solved by re-designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window.&lt;ref name="kramerreview"/&gt; Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science, visited the lab for an update on the NIC on 23 April, the day after the window problem was announced as solved. On 10 March he had described the NIC as "a goal of overriding importance for the DOE" and expressed that progress to date "was not as rapid as I had hoped".&lt;ref name=kramerreview/&gt;

NIC shots halted in February 2011, as the machine was turned over to SSMP materials experiments. As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced Radiographic Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence.

ARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional radiographic techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world's highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/photons-fusion/2014/may|title= Photons &amp; Fusion Newsletter - May 2014|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 2014|website= National Ignition Facility &amp; Photon Science News - Archive - Photons &amp; Fusion Newsletter|publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|access-date=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target to very high precision. The shots tested the symmetry of the X-ray drive during the first three [[nanosecond]]s. Full-system shots fired in the second half of May achieved unprecedented peak pressures of 50&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|megabar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = NIC Team Launches Precision Tuning Campaign | title = Stockpile Stewardship and Diamond EOS Experiments | work = Project Status – 2011 (May) | publisher = Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | date = May 2011 | url = https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2011/may.php | accessdate = 2011-06-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111003170516/https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2011/may.php | archivedate = 2011-10-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Mike Dunne, director of NIF's laser fusion energy program, predicted in a Photonics West 2012 plenary talk that ignition would be achieved at NIF by October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SPIE Europe Ltd |url=http://optics.org/news/3/1/37 |title=PW 2012: fusion laser on track for 2012 burn |publisher=Optics.org |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the NIF fired a record high of 57 shots, more than in any month up to that point.&lt;ref name=nature201203&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/laser-fusion-nears-crucial-milestone-1.10175 |accessdate=21 Mar 2012 |date=7 March 2012 |title=Laser fusion nears crucial milestone |author=Eric Hand |work=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2012, NIF produced a laser pulse with 411 trillion watts of peak power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/23/nif_laser_pulse/|title=Record-breaking laser pulse raises fusion-power hopes|accessdate=2012-03-22 | date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, 2012, it produced a shorter pulse of 1.85 MJ and increased power of 500 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/07/12/worlds-most-powerful-laser-fires-most-powerful-laser-blast-ever/|title=World's most powerful laser fires most powerful laser blast ever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DOE Report, July 19, 2012===
The NIC campaign has been periodically reviewed by a team led by [[Steven E. Koonin]], Under Secretary of Science. The 6th review, May 31, 2012 was chaired by David H. Crandall, Advisor on National Security and Inertial Fusion, Koonin being precluded to chair the review because of a conflict of interest. The review was conducted with the same external reviewers, who had previously served Koonin. Each provided their report independently, with their own estimate of the probability of achieving ignition within the plan, i.e. before December 31, 2012. The conclusion of the review was published on July 19, 2012.&lt;ref name="Crandall"&gt;
{{cite web
| url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_report_rev5_koonin_2012.pdf
| title=External Review of the National Ignition Campaign
| publisher=[[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous review dated January 31, 2012, identified a number of experimental improvements that have been completed or are under way.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt; The new report unanimously praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, operations have all been outstanding, however:
:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging. (Crandall&amp;nbsp;Memo&amp;nbsp;2012,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;2)

Further, the report members express deep concerns on the gaps between observed performance and ICF simulation codes such that the current codes are of a limited utility going forward. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser-plasma interactions. These effects lead to pressure being one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo page 5 discusses the mix of ablator material and capsule fuel due likely to hydrodynamics instabilities in the outer surface of the ablator.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt;

The report goes on to suggest that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this increases its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also keep in mind that [[Nd:YAG laser|neodymium lasers]] can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=5}} The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt;

===Ignition fails, focus shifts, LIFE ends===
The NIC officially ended on September 30, 2012 without achieving ignition. According to numerous articles in the press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=William J. Broad |author-link=William Broad|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/science/fusion-project-faces-a-frugal-congress.html |title=So Far Unfruitful, Fusion Project Faces a Frugal Congress |date=September 30, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=New York Times Dot-Earth Blog |title=With Tight Research Budgets, Is There Room for the Eternal Promise of Fusion? |date=18 October 2012|url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/with-tight-research-budgets-is-there-room-for-the-eternal-promise-of-fusion/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress was concerned about the project's progress and funding arguments may begin anew.&lt;ref name=hatcher&gt;{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Hatcher |url=http://optics.org/indepth/3/10/2 |title=NIF responds to fusion 'deadline' expiry |website=optics.org |date=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Perlman |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Livermore-Lab-Ignition-Facility-s-woes-3797461.php |title=Livermore Lab Ignition Facility's woes |publisher=SFGate |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/forschak/1845698/ |title=Superlaser zündet nicht - Experimente am NIF lauren nicht so glatt die &amp;#124; Forschung Aktuell &amp;#124; Deutschlandfunk |publisher=Dradio.de |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports also suggested that NIF will shift its focus away from ignition back toward materials research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Geoff |last=Brumfiel |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=worlds-most-powerful-laser-facility-shifts-focus-to-warheads |title=World's Most Powerful Laser Facility Shifts Focus to Warheads |journal=Scientific American |date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature |title=Editorial: Ignition switch |url=http://www.nature.com/news/ignition-switch-1.11748 |date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, as NIF was reaching completion, LLNL began the [[Laser Inertial Fusion Energy]] program, or LIFE, to explore ways to use the NIF technologies as the basis for a commercial power plant design. Early studies considered the [[fission-fusion hybrid]] concept, but from 2009 the focus was on pure fusion devices, incorporating a number of technologies that were being developed in parallel with NIF that would greatly improve the performance of the design. All of these, however, were based on the idea that NIF would achieve ignition, and that only minor changes to the basic design would be required to improve performance. In April 2014, Livermore decided to end the LIFE efforts. Bret Knapp, Livermore acting director was quoted as saying that "The focus of our inertial confinement fusion efforts is on understanding ignition on NIF rather than on the LIFE concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livermore Ends LIFE |website=Physics Today |date=April 2014 |first=David |last=Kramer |url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/67/4/10.1063/PT.3.2344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memo sent on 29 September 2013 by Ed Moses describes a fusion shot that took place at 5:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 28 September. It produced 5×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons, 75% more than any previous shot. Alpha heating, a key component of ignition, was clearly seen. It also noted that the reaction released more energy than the "energy being absorbed by the fuel", a condition the memo referred to as "scientific breakeven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/laser-fusion-experiment-yields-record-energy-llnls-national-ignition-facility

| publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]
| date=2013-08-26
| accessdate=2017-05-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This received significant press coverage as it appeared to suggest a key threshold had been achieved, which was referred to as a "milestone".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24429621 |title=Nuclear fusion milestone passed at US lab |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2013-10-07 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of researchers pointed out that the experiment was far below ignition, and did not represent a breakthrough as reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Clery |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2013/10/fusion-breakthrough-nif-uh-not-really-%E2%80%A6 |title=Fusion "Breakthrough" at NIF? Uh, Not Really |website=ScienceInsider |date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted that the definition of breakeven as recorded in many references, and directly stated by Moses in the past, was when the fusion output was equal to the laser input. In this release, the term was changed to refer to the energy deposited in the fuel, not the energy of the laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dale |last=Meade |url=http://fire.pppl.gov/ICF_Scientific_Breakeven_LLNL2.pdf |title=Scientific Breakeven for Fusion Energy |date=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method used to reach these levels, known as the "high foot", is not suitable for general ignition, and as a result, it is still unclear whether NIF will ever reach this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Hecht |url=http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2013/10/progress-at-nif-but-no-breakthrough.html |title=Progress at NIF, but no 'breakthrough' |website=LaserFocusWorld |date=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockpile experiments ===

Since that time, NIF has returned to materials studies. Experiments beginning in 2015 FY have used plutonium targets, with a schedule containing 10 to 12 shots for 2015, and as many as 120 over the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/my-town/ci_27426991/despite-objections-lawrence-livermore-lab-go-forward-plutonium |title=Despite objections, Livermore lab to fire world's largest laser at plutonium |newspaper=Contra Cost Times |date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium shots simulate the compression of the primary in a nuclear bomb by [[high explosive]]s, which has not seen direct testing since the Comprehensive Test Ban. Tiny amounts of plutonium are used in these tests, ranging from less than a milligram to 10 milligrams.&lt;ref name=pumercury/&gt; Similar experiments are also carried out on Sandia's [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independentnews.com/news/plutonium-experiments-expected-on-national-ignition-facility/article_eafe840c-86ff-11e4-b122-13c4c0a58c69.html |title=Plutonium Experiments Expected On National Ignition Facility |first=Jeff |last=Garberson |date=19 December 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |location=Livermore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of LLNL's Primary Nuclear Design Program, Mike Dunning, noted that "This is an opportunity for us to get high-quality data using a regime that was previously unavailable to us".&lt;ref name=pumercury&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |title=Lawrence Livermore National Lab to test plutonium using NIF laser |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_27119177/lawrence-livermore-lab-test-plutonium-using-nif-laser |date=12 December 2014 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One key development on NIF since the Ignition Campaign has been an increase in the shot rate. Although designed to allow shots as often as every 4 hours,{{efn|One source suggested the ultimate aim was one shot per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stolz, "The National Ignition Facility" The world's largest optical system", Optical Design and Testing III, edited by Yongtian Wang, Theo T. Tschudi, Jannick P. Rolland, Kimio Tatsuno Proc. SPIE Vol. 6834, 683402, (2007) · {{DOI|10.1117/12.773365}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in 2014 FY NIF performed 191 shots, slightly more than one every two days. This has been continuously improved, and in April 2015 NIF was on track to meet its goal of 300 laser shots in 2015 FY, almost one a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/efficiency-improvements |title=NIF Lasers Continue to Fire at a Record Rate |website=LLNL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MagLIF experiments===

On 28 January 2016, NIF successfully executed its first gas pipe experiment intended to study the absorption of large amounts of laser light within {{convert|1|cm}} long targets relevant to high-gain [[Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion]] (MagLIF).  In order to investigate key aspects of the propagation, stability, and efficiency of laser energy coupling at full scale for high-gain MagLIF target designs, a single quad of NIF was used to deliver 30 kJ of energy to a target during a 13 nanosecond shaped pulse. Data return was very favorable and analysis is ongoing by scientific staff at Lawrence Livermore and Sandia National Laboratories.

'''Natural beech wood''' is a [[beech]] wood, that is able to replenish and sustain itself on its own.

Beech is a valued timber, but most beech woods requires human intervention to replace old trees, since the young trees are not able to survive at all or at a rate, that sustains the beech population over time. There can be various reasons for this condition. Heavy [[forest floor]] coverage of other plants in the spring, shadowing the young beech-shoots is a common cause. Abundance of nutrient rich soils, will also be difficult to handle for beech woods in the long run.

A natural beech wood have beech trees of all ages, including fallen and dead trees. Other tree species might be mixed in, but not to a degree that threatens the dominant beech.

The term is also used for other tree species, such as 'natural oak wood', 'natural birch wood', etc..

==Natural beech wood forests==
Examples of natural beech wood forests, includes:

* [[Cwm Clydach National Nature Reserve]] in southeast [[Wales]].
* [[Marselisborg Forests]] in [[Denmark]].
* [[Serrahn Hills]] in North-east [[Germany]].
* The slopes of the [[Harz]] range in northern Germany.
* [[Hainich]] National Park in central Germany.
* [[Voděradské bučiny|Voděrady Beechwood]] in [[Czech Republic]].
* [[Stužica]] in [[Slovakia]], one of Europes last primeval beech forests.
* [[Carpathian Biosphere Reserve]] in southwestern [[Ukraine]].

== Threats ==
Agricultural practices can often change the original soil-compositions so much, that the specific natural woodland type once associated with the local area, will change too. This change is almost irreversible. This condition has now affected most of Europe.

Local or global climate changes can also have a profound effect on what kind of natural woodland can grow and survive in a specific area.

[[European beech]] is usually more susceptible to climatic changes than soil-composition and the current [[global climate change]] are found to affect the geographical distribution of natural beech wood habitats.

== Misunderstandings and confusions ==
The term "Natural" is often confusingly used as a synonym for "Primeval". While [[primeval forest|primeval woodland]]s that still exists, are indeed natural, natural woodlands does not have to be primeval per se. [[Secondary forest|Secondary]] or re-established woodlands can also be natural; it is just a matter of whether a given forest type is able to sustain and replace itself on its own - i.e. if the climatic and geological conditions for a given forest type are present or not. These conditions can be objectively determined, and does not depend on the "test of time" exclusively.

The term "semi-natural" is sometimes used to describe any natural woodland, that is not strictly primeval in origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="985">A '''noise print''' is part of a technique used in [[noise reduction]]. A noise print is commonly used in [[audio mastering]] to reduce the effects of unwanted noise from a piece of audio. In this case, the noise print would be a recording of the ambient noise in the room, which is then used to set multiple expanders, effectively 'gating out' those frequencies whilst the signal level in that band is lower than that in the noise print. Many plugins for Studio software can be used to apply noise reduction in this way.

Noise reduction usually results in unwanted [[Compression artifact|artifacts]], sometimes referred to as "twittering" or "birdies". Different algorithms for noise reduction control these artifacts with varying levels of success.

'''Nwya Devu''' is a high-altitude archaeological site on the [[Tibetan Plateau]] located in the eastern [[Changtang]] region of Tibet. At around {{convert|4600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, Nwya Devu is the highest known archaeological site from the [[Paleolithic]] and provides evidence for the earliest known presence of humans at a high-altitude site, at around 40,000-30,000 [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1049}}

==Background==
The site was discovered in 2013 during [[Systematic survey|systematic archaeological surveying]] performed by the Tibetan Cultural Relics Conservation Institute and the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]].{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=3 (Supplementary)}} Nywa Devu lies on the former [[Terrace (geology)#Lacustrine_terraces|lacrustrine terrace]] of Co Ngoin, a nearby freshwater lake to the site's north.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=4 (Supplementary)}}

==Stratigraphy==
Archaeologists identified three [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphic]] layers at the site and excavated around {{convert|170|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} worth of deposits in depth.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1049}} Layer 1 is [[Luminescence dating|OSL dated]] from around 13,000 to 4,000 [[Before Present|BP]]. Mollusc shells taken from the lowest part of Layer 1 yielded [[Radiocarbon dating#Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS date]] ranges from around 12,700 to 12,400 BP, which shows concurrence with the OSL dating. Layer 2 is OSL dated from around 25,000 to 18,000 BP and corresponds with the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. The earliest layer, Layer 3, is OSL dated to around 45,000 to 30,000 BP.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1050}} While artefacts were found outside of Layer 3, the archaeologists who worked the site believe that all of the artefacts come from the assemblage associated with Layer 3.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|pp=1049-1050}}{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} Paleo-environmental evidence suggests that the local climate was milder during the time of Layer 3 when compared against the present.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}}

==Artefacts==
3,683 lithic artefacts were excavated from the site. The lithic assemblage at Nwya Devu consists primarily of blade cores, flake cores, blades, flakes, chunks, and tools. All of the lithic artefacts at Newa Devu were sourced from black [[slate]] that was locally derived, from nearby Nwya Devu Hill, which lies around {{convert|800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} east of the site. Blades found at the site were made using a non-[[Levallois technique]], through the use of prismatic cores.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1050}} Archaeologists believe that Nwya Devu, with access to a good source of raw materials nearby, was likely the site of a lithic tool-making workshop, with a primary focus on creating long knives and scrapers that could be [[Hafting|hafted]].{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} Some of the excavated blades were over {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} The lithic assemblage at Newa Dwvu appears to be unique and not obviously related to any other sites in East Asia.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} It shows some similarities to sites from the Early [[Upper Paleolithic]] in Siberia (Kara Bom) and Mongolia (Tolbor-21).{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1051}}{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=4 (Supplementary)}}

The '''Order Paper''' is a daily publication in the [[Westminster system]] of government which lists the business of [[parliament]] for that day's sitting. A separate paper is issued daily for each house of the legislature.

The Order Paper provides [[Member of Parliament|members of the legislature]] with details of what will be happening in that house, including the questions that have been tabled for departmental question sessions and members who have been selected to speak. It also gives details of when and where the [[standing committees]] and [[select committee (Westminster system)|select committee]]s will be meeting, and the list of debates to be held. Written questions tabled to ministers by members of the legislature on the previous day are listed at the back of the order paper.

British parliamentarians often wave their Order Paper during debates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}

Dyslexia is a complex, lifelong disorder involving difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters and other symbols. Dyslexia does not affect general intelligence, but is often co-diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;ref name="NCLD"&gt;{{cite web|author=NCLD Editorial Team|title=What is Dyslexia|url=http://www.ncld.org/types-learning-disabilities/dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia|publisher=National center for Learning disabilities|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site3074/mainpageS3074P1.html | title = Dyslexia | publisher=Boston Children's Hospital | accessdate = 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least three sub-types of dyslexia that have been recognized by researchers: orthographic, or surface dyslexia, phonological dyslexia and mixed dyslexia where individuals exhibit symptoms of both orthographic and phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name="caplan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caplan|first=David|title=Neurolinguistics and Linguistic Aphasiology|year=1987|publisher=New York: Cambridge University Press|pages=201–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that dyslexia is genetic and can be passed down through families, but it is important to note that, although a genetic disorder, there is no specific locus in the brain for reading and writing. The human brain does have language centers (for spoken and gestural communication), but written language is a cultural artifact, and a very complex one requiring brain regions designed to recognize and interpret written symbols as representations of language in rapid synchronization. The complexity of the system and the lack of genetic predisposition for it is one possible explanation for the difficulty in acquiring and understanding written language.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Wolf, Maryanne. "Part III: When the Brain Can't Learn to Read." Wolf, Maryanne. Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain. New York City: HarperCollins Publisher, 2007. 163-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, recent evidence has found that there are certain genes responsible for causing dyslexia.&lt;ref name="NDS"&gt;"[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm Dyslexia Information Page"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727234247/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm |date=2016-07-27 }}. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 12 May 2010. Retrieved 5 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests a clear genetic basis for developmental dyslexia with abnormalities in certain language areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Witelson"&gt;Witelson, Sandra. "Developmental Dyslexia: TwoRight Hemispheres and None Left." Science, New Series 195.4275(1977): 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there is also evidence that orthography, the correspondence between the language's phonemes (sound units) and its graphemes (characters, symbols, letters), plays a significant role in the type and frequency of dyslexia's manifestations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Paulesu, E, et al. "Dyslexia: Cultural Diversityand Biological Unity." Science 291.5511 (2001): 2165-2167.&lt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/291/5511/2165.full.pdf?sid=e7fcb20f-73c5-49a5-bbc4-f8efd0123b40&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some psycholinguists believe that the complexity of a language’s orthography (whether it has a high phoneme-grapheme correspondence or an irregular correspondence in which sounds don’t clearly map to symbols) affects the severity and occurrence of dyslexia, postulating that a more regular system would reduce the number of cases of dyslexia and/or the severity of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Current psycholinguistic models of dyslexia are "largely developed on the basis of alphabetic writing systems such as English",&lt;ref name="karanth"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karanth, Prathibha |title=The search for deep dyslexia in syllabic writing systems |journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=143–155 |date=March 2002 |pmid= |doi=10.1016/S0911-6044(00)00022-1 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VDV-444807H-5&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=015e4dd9555c8b8eb56797ad842337ec |last2=Jing |first2=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the amount of research on some [[logographic]] orthographies, Chinese in particular,&lt;ref name="pmid19024108"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xu GF, Jing J |title=Major achievements in relation to dyslexia in Chinese characters |journal=Chin. Med. J. |volume=121 |issue=17 |pages=1736–40 |date=September 2008 |pmid=19024108 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also fairly significant. Unfortunately, little research has been done on [[Syllabary|syllabic]] writing systems, and "cross-linguistic studies of the acquired dyslexia and  [[dysgraphia]]s are scarce."&lt;ref name="karanth" /&gt;

==Dyslexia and orthographic features==

===Orthographic Dyslexia===
Orthographic dyslexia, a subtype of dyslexia, results in difficulty decoding and encoding skills due to slow and inaccurate rates of storing word and letter formations into memory. Orthographic dyslexics have difficulty in storing mental representation of words, especially phonetically irregular words such as word spellings that end in -ight ("light" and "sight"). The problems underlying this type of dyslexia are related directly to memory and coding skills that allow representation of printed letters and words, not to poor phonological processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhia|first=Roberts|title=Orthographic Dyslexia: The neglected subtype|year=1997|publisher=The Learning Disabilities Research &amp; Practice|pages=236–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of dyslexia is also termed surface dyslexia because people with this type have the inability to recognize words simply on a visual basis. Words that are misspelled cause the readers difficulty because they attempt to sound out the words by looking at each individual letter rather than the word as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, David. 1987. Disturbances of the sound system. In D. Caplan. Neurolinguistics and Linguistic Aphasiology: An Introduction, 201-232. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; So a reader might read the word "cat" and pronounce the "c" as a hard "c" but then read the word "ice" and pronounce the "c" as a hard "c" as well because they are sounding out each individual phoneme rather than just recognizing the word "ice" in its entirety.

Despite intervention, children suffering from orthographic dyslexia continually have lower achievement reading levels when compared to their peers. Additionally, children show a greater difficulty throughout schooling when spelling words with irregular or unusual orthographies when compared to their other children. Research also shows that dyslexic children have primary difficulties in phonological processing and secondary difficulties in orthographic processing, aiding to the distinction of two subtypes.&lt;ref name="Manis et al., 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manis|first=Franklin|first2=Rebecca|last2=Custodio|last3=Szeszulski|first3=Patricia A.|title=Development of phonological and orthographic skill: A 2-year longitudinal study of dyslexic children|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1993|volume=56|issue=1|pages=64–86|doi=10.1006/jecp.1993.1026|pmid=8366326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The effects of orthographic depth on dyslexia===
The complexity of a language's orthography is directly related to the difficulty of learning to read in that language.  Orthographic complexity also contributes to how dyslexia manifests in readers of different languages.&lt;ref name="Wolf1"&gt;[[Maryanne Wolf|Wolf, Maryanne]] (2007). Proust and the squid. Harper Collins. pp. 190-191. {{ISBN|978-0-06-018639-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deep orthographies]] are writing systems, such as those of [[English orthography|English]] and [[Arabic script|Arabic]], that do not have a one-to-one correspondence between sounds ([[phoneme]]s) and the letters ([[grapheme]]s) that represent them.

[[Shallow orthographies]], such as [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], have a close relationship between [[grapheme]]s and [[phoneme]]s, and the spelling of words is very consistent. With shallow orthographies, new readers have few problems learning to decode words and as a result children learn to read relatively quickly. Most dyslexic readers of shallow orthographic systems learn to decode words with relative ease compared to dyslexics using deep orthographies, though they continue to have difficulty with reading fluency and comprehension.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The hallmark system of dyslexia in a shallow orthography is a comparatively slow speed of [[rapid automatized naming]].
[[File:Dislexia.jpg|thumb|198x198px|Writing and drawing performed by a child with dyslexia, displaying common behavioral symptoms.]]
For languages with relatively deep orthographies, such as [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], readers have greater difficulty learning to decode new words than languages with shallow orthographies. As a result, children's reading achievement levels are lower.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;Goswami, Usha (2005-09-06). "Chapter 28: Orthography, Phonology, and Reading Development: A Cross-Linguistic Perspective". in Malatesha, Joshi. Handbook of orthography and literacy. Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc Inc. pp. 463–464. {{ISBN|0-8058-4652-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that the hallmark symptoms of dyslexia in a deep orthography are a deficit in phonological awareness and difficulty reading words at grade level.&lt;ref name="snowling"&gt;Snowling, Margaret J. (2004). "Chapter 4: The science of dyslexia: a review of contemporary approaches. in Turner, Martin and John Rack. The study of dyslexia. Kluwer Academic/Plenum publishers. p. 80. {{ISBN|0-306-48535-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For these dyslexic readers, learning to decode words may take a long time—indeed, in the deepest orthographies a distinctive symptom of dyslexia is the inability to read at the word level—but many dyslexic readers have fewer problems with fluency and comprehension once some level of decoding has been mastered.

Studies between the English and German (which has a shallower orthography than English) languages have shown that the greater depth of the English orthography has a "marked adverse effect on reading skills" among children with dyslexia, though the dyslexics in these studies still mostly underperformed compared to control groups.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landerl |date= 1997 |title=The impact of orthographic consistency on dyslexia: A German-English comparison |journal=Cognition |volume=63 |issue= 3|pages=315–334  |url=  |doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(97)00005-X |pmid=9265873 |first1=K |last2=Wimmer |first2=H |last3=Frith |first3=U }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frith |first=Uta |date= 1998 |title=Differences in Phonological Recoding in German- and English-Speaking Children |journal=Scientific Studies of Reading |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=31–54  |url=  |doi=10.1207/s1532799xssr0201_2 |last2=Wimmer |first2=Heinz |last3=Landerl |first3=Karin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research, however, has suggested that all children with dyslexia still suffer the same reading difficulties despite different orthographies, including reading speed deficit and slow decoding mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These findings suggest that orthographic differences do not significantly impact the main difficulties those with dyslexia experience.

==Dyslexia in different types of orthographies==
There are a number of different types of writing systems, or orthographies, and they do not necessarily depend on the same neurological skill sets.&lt;ref&gt;Cell Press (2009, October 13). Dyslexia Varies Across Languages. ScienceDaily. Retrieved July 26, 2013, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091012121333.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, certain dyslexic deficits may be more pronounced in some orthographies than in others. For example, in alphabetic languages, [[phonological awareness]] is highly predictive of reading ability. But in Chinese (a logographic system), orthographic awareness and [[Fine motor skill|motor programming]] are highly predictive of reading ability.&lt;ref name="pmid15939871"&gt;{{cite journal

===Dyslexia in alphabetic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Alphabet|Managing dyslexia: alphabetic orthography}}
Most of the current research on dyslexia focuses on alphabetic orthography.&lt;ref name="karanth" /&gt;

Alphabetic writing systems vary significantly in the depth of their orthography. [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are considered deep orthographies in comparison to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] which are [[Orthography#Defectiveness|shallow orthographies]]. A deep orthography like English has letters or letter combinations that do not reliably map to specific phonemes/sound units, and so are ambiguous in terms of the sounds that they represent whereas a transparent or shallow orthography has symbols that (more) uniquely map to sounds, ideally in a one-to-one correspondence or at least with limited or clearly signified (as with accent marks or other distinguishing features) variation. Literacy studies have shown that even for children without reading difficulties like dyslexia, a more transparent orthography is learned more quickly and more easily; this is true across language systems (syllabic, alphabetic, and logographic), and between shallow and deep alphabetic languages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In cross-language studies, Aro and Wimmer report differences in developmental reading skills across several alphabetic orthographies.  Among those tested, [[English language|English]] children achieved only 50% accuracy in [[pseudoword]] testing by the end of first grade and did not attain high accuracy until fourth grade. However, in the same test, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] children all achieved scores approaching 85% and 90% in Grade 1 and Grade 4, respectively.&lt;ref name="Aro"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research provides evidence that orthographic irregularities, such as the "complex grapheme-phoneme relations" found in English, present significant difficulties in the reading development of children.&lt;ref name="Aro" /&gt;

However, there is little evidence that a more "regular" orthographic system would significantly diminish the amount of dyslexia cases. Because there is also a visual aspect to dyslexia, affected children often show symptoms such as mirror letter reversal (e.g. confusing "b" and "d"), which can manifest in any language regardless of orthographic depth.

===Dyslexia in logographic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Logogram}}
Logographic writing systems (such as [[Chinese character]]s and [[Cuneiform]]) are significantly different from alphabetic ones. The primary difference is that their basic [[grapheme]]s are [[logogram]]s, a representation based on meaning ([[morpheme]]s), rather than sounds ([[phoneme]]s). Chinese and Japanese Kanji, two languages with logographic orthographies, use sets of one or more characters to represent morphemes. In kanji, there are usually two ways to read a symbol, one that is similar to the original Chinese and one that is for the Japanese word. There are also a greater number of characters for logographic systems like kanji than for alphabetic and syllabic systems (generally): "The Japanese educational system explicitly teaches a set of 1,945 Joyo Kanji (kanji for daily use). However...most Japanese know many more than these and that 3,000 or more kanji are required to read a daily newspaper."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:XiaozhuanQinquan sized.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Archaic Chinese logograms]]

Development of reading and writing skills in logographic systems depends more heavily on visual memorization than for alphabetic systems.  Thus dyslexics, who often rely on grapheme memorization to cope with phonological awareness deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neural Systems in Dyslexics More Tuned to Memory than to Sound|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/PRNT_Research.html|work=The Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaywitz|first2= B.

====Chinese orthographies====
Chinese children can exhibit a more severe form of dyslexia as opposed to those learning literacy using an alphabetic script such as that used in writing English. Not only are they phonologically at a disadvantage, but their visuospatial processing is impaired. When children have a visuospatial disorder, their visual system when looking at Chinese characters will not activate the semantic information to understand what they are reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siok|last2=Spinks|first2=John A.|last3=Jin|first3=Zhen|last4=Tan|first4=Li Hai|date=13 October 2009|title=Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the co-existence of visuospatial and phonological disorders in Chinese children|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209015498|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=19|pages=R890|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.014|issn=0960-9822|pmid=19825347|access-date=|via=|accessdate=30 July 2013|first1=Wai Ting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In alphabetic languages, phonological awareness plays a central role in reading acquisition; in learning to read Chinese, phonological awareness is much less important. Rather, reading in Chinese is strongly related to a child's writing skills, which depend on orthographic awareness and on motor memory.  In handling alphabetic languages with [[deep orthography|deep orthographies]], the child must cope with having more than one spelling to represent a sound.  In spoken Chinese, a single syllable is used in many different words, and a Chinese child must cope with having many written characters that represent the same syllable.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further complicating the Chinese writing system, the Chinese character is made up of strokes and sub-character components, substantially increasing visual complexity. Thus orthographic processing is an important aspect of reading. Deficient orthography-to-meaning mapping can lead to reading disability. A key strategy in teaching children to read is to have children repeatedly write samples of single characters, thus building the child's awareness of a character's internal structure (orthographic awareness).&lt;ref name="pmid15939871" /&gt;

Rapid naming is one of the best single predictors of dyslexia in all languages tested, including both alphabetic and character-based writing systems.&lt;ref name="pmid15939871" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf2"&gt;Wolf, Maryanne (2007).

===Dyslexia in syllabic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Syllabary}}

In a syllabary,  written characters represent spoken syllables, whereas alphabetic systems use characters/letters to represent separate phonemes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Nick |last2=Natsume |first2=Miwa |last3=Stavropoulou |first3=Katerina |last4=Hoxhallari |first4=Lorenc |last5=Van Daal |first5=Victor|last6=Polyzoe |first6=Nicoletta |last7=Tsipa |first7=Maria-Louisa |last8= Petalas |first8=Michalis |title=The effects of orthographic depth on learning to read alphabetic, syllabic, and logographic scripts|journal=Reading Research Quarterly|year=2004|volume=39|issue=4|pages=438–68 |doi=10.1598/RRQ.39.4.5 |jstor=4151742}}&lt;/ref&gt; A symbol in a syllabary typically has the canonical shape of a consonant-vowel (CV) combination. In the Japanese syllabaries, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], there is a nearly one-to-one correspondence between [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] and characters. The transparency of these syllabaries is the reason for their use in first teaching Japanese children to read before advancing to the complex logographic system of kanji, and by the age of five, prior to any official reading education, 89% of Japanese children can read the majority (60 or more out of 71) of hiragana characters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Syllabary orthographies, like English orthography, can also be very irregular. {{clarify|reason=In which language?|date=May 2015|text=A symbol could mean "i" in one sentence but the same symbol could mean "e" in a different sentence if it is preceded by a different symbol,}}&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, M.

Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons. p. 141. {{ISBN|978-0-470-74096-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which can increase the difficulty of reading for people with dyslexia. However, little research has been done on how dyslexia presents in syllabic systems. One possible reason for this is that because of the different ways that dyslexia can present, {{clarify|date=May 2015|text=(i.e. how visuospatial systems are affected in Chinese dyslexics - or how the logographic system is affected by defects/abnormalities in the visuospatial processing regions, which is more likely since written language is a cultural artifact with no genetic predispositions, and so existing structures must be adapted to handle language)}} the disorder may go unnoticed or not be recognized. On the other hand, a Japanese psychologist {{who|date=May 2015}}  wrote that "while dyslexia, reading disability, reading disorder, reading retardation, or whatever you prefer to call it, comprises a formidable portion of psychiatric practice in Western countries, its incidence in Japan is so rare that specialists in Japan do not get any referrals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Harold W. |last1=Stevenson |first2=James W. |last2=Stigler |first3=G.

A literacy study on children without reading disabilities found that syllabic scripts like Japanese katakana and hiragana, which are very transparent orthographically, are learned more quickly and with better proficiency than more orthographically opaque languages, followed in ease of use and learning by shallow alphabetic scripts that also have many phonological cues, then by complex alphabetic scripts that have irregular orthography (like English), and then by logographic scripts like [[kanji]] which have no phonological cues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The diagnostic category '''pervasive developmental disorders''' ('''PDD'''), as opposed to [[specific developmental disorder]]s (SDD), refers to a group of five [[mental illness|disorder]]s characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including [[socialization]] and [[communication]]. The pervasive developmental disorders are: All [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and [[Rett syndrome]].&lt;ref name="NICHCY"&gt;[[National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities]] (NICHCY) (October 2003) ''[http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs20txt.htm Disability Info: Pervasive Developmental Disorders (FS20).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309164405/http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs20txt.htm |date=2008-03-09 }}'' Fact Sheet 20 (FS20)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four of these disorders are commonly called the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s; the last disorder is much rarer, and is sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not.&lt;ref name="Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG 2000 355–63"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG |title= Autism spectrum disorders|journal=Neuron |volume=28 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=355–63 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00115-X |pmid=11144346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1183–215 |title= Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders |vauthors= Johnson CP, Myers SM, ((Council on Children with Disabilities)) |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2361 |pmid=17967920 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of pervasive developmental disorders occurs during infancy, but the condition is usually not identified until the child is around three years old. Parents may begin to question the health of their child when developmental milestones are not met, including age appropriate motor movement and speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Autism Health Center|title=Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs) |url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/development-disorder|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD.&lt;ref name="NICHCY" /&gt; Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS ([[Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]]).&lt;ref name="NICHCY" /&gt; Others use the general category label of PDD because they are hesitant to diagnose very young children with a specific type of PDD, such as autism.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt; Both approaches contribute to confusion about the term, because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms== 
Symptoms of PDD may include behavioral and communication problems such as:
* Difficulty using and understanding language.&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt;
* Difficulty relating to people, objects, and events;&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt; for example, lack of eye contact, pointing behavior, and lack of facial responses.
* Unusual play with toys and other objects.&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt;
* Difficulty with changes in routine or familiar surroundings.&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt;
* [[Stereotypy|Repetitive body movements]] or behavior patterns,&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt; such as hand flapping, hair twirling, foot tapping, or more complex movements.
* Inability to cuddle or be comforted.
* Difficulty regulating behaviors and emotions, which may result in temper tantrums, anxiety, and aggression.
* Emotional breakdowns.

===Degrees===
Children with PDD vary widely in abilities, intelligence, and behaviors. Some children do not speak at all, others speak in limited phrases or conversations, and some have relatively normal language development. Repetitive play skills and limited social skills are generally evident as well. Unusual responses to sensory information&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt; &amp;ndash; loud noises, lights &amp;ndash; are common too.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually made during early childhood. With the release of the DSM-5 in May 2013, the diagnosis for PDD has been removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorders. Distinction between the past disorders is implicated by a series of severity levels. Individuals who received diagnoses based on the DSM-IV should still maintain their diagnosis under the autism spectrum disorders. However, a editorial published in the October 2012 issue of American Journal of Psychiatry notes that, while some doctors argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the diagnostic distinction between ASD and PDD, multiple literature reviews found that studies showing significant differences between the two disorders significantly outnumbered those that found no difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Psychiatric Publishing|title=Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the recent release of the new diagnostic criteria, the shift in classification and diagnoses will be gradual. Additionally, the replacement of pervasive developmental disorders with autism spectrum disorders has faced great criticism from those with past diagnoses and their family members.

Before the release of the DSM-5, some clinicians used PDD-NOS as a "temporary" diagnosis for children under the age of five when, for whatever reason, they are reluctant to diagnose autism. There are several justifications for this. Very young children have limited social interaction and communication skills to begin with, so it can be tricky to diagnose milder cases of autism in toddlers. The unspoken assumption is that by the age of five, unusual behaviors will either resolve or develop into diagnosable autism. However, some parents view the PDD label as no more than a euphemism for autism spectrum disorders, problematic because this label makes it more difficult to receive aid for [[early childhood intervention]].

===Classification===
The pervasive developmental disorders are:&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt;
* [[Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS), which includes atypical autism, and is the most common (47% of diagnoses);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |title= Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders — Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 14 Sites, United States, 2008 |author= ((Jon Baio, EdS, National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, CDC)) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Autism]], the best-known;
* [[Asperger syndrome]] (9% of autism diagnoses);
* [[Rett syndrome]]; and
* [[Childhood disintegrative disorder]] (CDD).
The first three of these disorders are commonly called the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s; the last two disorders are much rarer, and are sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not.&lt;ref name="Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG 2000 355–63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

In May 2013, the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]-Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'') was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, Autism, Asperger Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The American Psychiatric Association has concluded that using the general diagnosis of ASD supports more accurate diagnoses. The combination of these disorders was also fueled by the standpoint that Autism is characterized by common symptoms and should therefore bear a single diagnostic term. In order to distinguish between the different disorders, the DSM-5 employs severity levels. The severity levels take into account required support, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and deficits in social communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Autism Research Institute|title=DSM-V: What Changes May Mean|url=http://www.autism.com/index.php/news_dsmV|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PDD and PDD-NOS===
There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt; Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt; Others use the general category because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label.&lt;ref name="NICHCY"/&gt;

PDD is not itself a diagnosis, while PDD-NOS is a diagnosis. To further complicate the issue, PDD-NOS can also be referred to as "atypical personality development", "atypical PDD", or "atypical Autism".

Because of the "NOS", which means "not otherwise specified", it is hard to describe what PDD-NOS is, other than its being an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some people diagnosed with PDD-NOS are close to having Asperger syndrome, but do not quite fit. Others have near full-fledged autism, but without some of its symptoms. The psychology field is{{when|date=July 2014}} considering creating several subclasses within PDD-NOS.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Treatment==
Medications are used to address certain behavioral problems; therapy for children with PDD should be specialized according to the child's specific needs.&lt;ref name="NINDS"/&gt;

Some children with PDD benefit from specialized classrooms in which the class size is small and instruction is given on a one-to-one basis. Others function well in standard special education classes or regular classes with support. Early intervention, including appropriate and specialized educational programs and support services, play a critical role in improving the outcome of individuals with PDD.&lt;ref name="NINDS"&gt;{{Include-USGov|agency=National Institutes of Health|article=NINDS Pervasive Developmental Disorders Information Page|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Pervasive-Developmental-Disorders-Information-Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phum Snay''' ({{lang-km| ភូមិ ស្នាយ}}) is an [[Iron Age]] archaeological site discovered in May 2000 in Preah Neat Prey District, [[Banteay Meanchey Province]], Northwest [[Cambodia]], around {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the temple ruins of [[Angkor]]. The site was excavated between 2001 and 2003 by primary excavators Dougald O’Reilly of the [[Australian National University]], Pheng Sitha and Thuy Chanthourn. The excavation was intended to discover more about Iron Age life in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/phum-snay-ruined-other-sites-danger | title = Phum Snay ruined, other sites in danger | publisher =  The Phnom Penh Post | date=April 25, 2003 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The site was discovered in 2000 during roadworks, that linked Phum Snay village with National Road 6. Investigations revealed the presence of a number of ancient burials associated with material including bronzes and semiprecious stones. Immediate widespread looting by the local inhabitants over an area of {{convert|24|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} made a full assessment of the extent of the archaeological remains difficult. Excavations started in February 2001 on a 15 x 5 m area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/460955/Excavations_at_Phum_Snay_Cambodia | title = A Preliminary Report on the Excavation of a Late Prehistoric Cemetery in NorthwestCambodia | publisher =  Academia | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
The site dates roughly between 500 BC and AD 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hl-128-171-57-22.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/17251/1/AP-v45n2-189-211.pdf | title = Archaeology and Archaeozoology of Phum Snay: A late Prehistoric cemetery in Northwestern Cambodia | publisher = ScholarSpace | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/ccaa/en/talk22.htm | title = Prehistoric Culture of Cambodia and Its Relationship towards South China - all the findings can be placed in frame of VII century BC - V century AD, though I think, that the majority of the finds belong to the beginning of AD era | publisher = The Chinese University of Hong Kong | date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dates were not obtained from [[stratigraphy]] as many of the artifacts and burials were disturbed by [[looting]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxenham, M., &amp; Tayles, N. (Eds.). (2006). Bioarchaeology of Southeast Asia (Vol. 43). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronology was therefore determined by comparison to other nearby sites with similar grave goods and mortuary rituals.

== Human remains ==
A general analysis was done of the 134 individuals identified through the [[Minimum number of individuals|minimum number of individuals method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/269337416_fig7_Figure-7-Archaeological-evidence-of-warfare-and-weaponry-at-Phum-Snay-a-adult-male | title = Figure 7. Archaeological evidence of warfare and weaponry at Phum Snay - The minimum number of individuals (MNI) was 134: 124 adults and 10 sub-adults | publisher = research gate | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one burials in total were exhumed that contained human remains. The researchers noted pathological lesions in photos and written descriptions. A few specimens were x-rayed but the images yielded limited results. The majority of the injuries listed were cranial lesions. These were categorized into two groups: those caused by sharp force trauma (henceforth referred to SFT) which left small focused circles or lines and those caused by [[blunt force trauma]] (BFT,) resulting in round depressions in the scalp. SFT lesions are generally caused by sharp edged weapons, such as knives, swords and axes. Projectiles, such as arrows or those used by a slingshot should also be considered as SFT objects or items. BFT lesions result from clubs, cudgels and hammers. Perimortem injuries were identified as separate from healed injuries because they often had bone flakes adhered to the edges of the fractures. Researchers were careful to distinguish between lesions caused by violence and those caused by infectious disease.

== Results ==

===Traumatic lesions===

Out of the sample discovered at Phum Snay, 23.4% of the individuals showed signs of traumatic lesions, a number that is much higher than any other site in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="domett"&gt;Domett, K. M., O'Reilly, D. J. W., &amp; Buckley, H. R. (2011). Bioarchaeological evidence for conflict in Iron Age north-west Cambodia. Antiquity, 85(328).&lt;/ref&gt;  Both BFT and SFT were present within the skeletal remains, but there was a much higher rate of healed lesions than perimortem lesions.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Some individuals had more than one lesion present upon the cranium.  Within a sample of fifteen individuals, seventeen BFT lesions could be seen.  These BFT lesions were rounded in shape, ranging in diameter from roughly 4 to 22&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Estimations suggest that injuries acquired by the individuals at the site were much higher than the remains can represent because a majority of assaults probably caused soft-tissue injuries, which would not be preserved in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;

===Burials===

Within the Phum Snay site, two types of burials were found.  These include bodies that were stretched out lying flat and pits where remains were simply in piles.&lt;ref name="lapteff"&gt;Lapteff, S. V. (2013). Early Iron Age Burial Practices of the Ancient Khmer People: The Phum Snay Necropolis, Northwestern Cambodia. Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia, 41(2), 137-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  The burials contained a variety of grave goods, including ceramic vessels, bronze ornaments (bangles, rings, and bells), and a large quantity of animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, D. J., von den Driesch, A., &amp; Voeun, V. (2006). Archaeology and archaeozoology of Phum Snay: a late prehistoric cemetery in northwestern Cambodia. Asian Perspectives, 45(2), 188-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glover, I., &amp; Bellwood, P. S. (Eds.). (2004). Southeast Asia: from prehistory to history. New York: RoutledgeCurzon.&lt;/ref&gt;  The proportion of left forelimbs of hooved animals suggest a very particular sacrificial practice of animals within the burials.  Researchers found that the manner of the burials and the goods contained within were closest in relation to the [[Óc Eo]] culture of the [[Mekong Delta]].&lt;ref name="lapteff" /&gt;

===Weapons===

Another major find within Phum Snay was the high percentage of burials containing weapons.  The graves contained swords, daggers, spearheads, and projectile points.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Due to the context of burials with high rates of traumatic lesions, the presence of these weapons indicates possible military formation, and certainly an increased level of violence than is seen in other sites within Southeast Asia.  The weapons and tools found within the site were made of iron with bronze adornments.&lt;ref name="lapteff" /&gt;  This solidified the site's place within the Iron Age because iron weapons and tools had many advantages over bronze, such as the high abundance of iron within the Earth, which made the spread of iron very rapid.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, B. A. (2007). Dictionary of artifacts. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  Also present in the burials of a number of young adult males were [[epaulette|ornamental shoulder decorations]], which further support the idea of a violence-oriented society.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  The lack of blunt objects within the burials is slightly puzzling due to the higher rate of BFT lesions than SFT lesions, but this could be explained if the individuals at Phum Snay wore helmets for protection.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;

===Health===

The health of the people living at Phum Snay was also determined from the burials.  Rates of [[attrition (dental)|attrition]], caries, and abscesses in the teeth of the human remains gave an idea of their dietary habits.  The main result from the dentition was the presence of a social structure regarding male and female roles within the community.  Rates of [[dental caries]] in females were higher than the males, which may be attributed to a sexual division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;Domett, K. M., &amp; O'Reilly, D. J. W. (2009). Health in Pre-Angkorian Cambodia: a bioarchaeological analysis of the skeletal remains from Phum Snay. Asian Perspectives, 48(1), 56-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the men are out hunting, they are receiving a higher level of protein in the food they are consuming, while the females may be eating more cariogenic foods if they are back tending the fields and surrounded by [[starches]] and [[carbohydrates]].

===Morphological comparisons===

Measurements were taken on the cranial and dental morphologies of the individuals found within Phum Snay to compare them with those of modern [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], and [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="mats"&gt;Matsumura, H., Domett, K. M., &amp; O'REILLY, D. J. (2011). [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/119/1/119_100511/_article On the origin of pre-Angkorian peoples: perspectives from cranial and dental affinity of the human remains from Iron Age Phum Snay, Cambodia]. Anthropological Science, 119(1), 67-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The morphological similarities were found from Q-mode correlation coefficients of cranial and dental metrics.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;  The findings indicated that the morphology of individuals at Phum Snay were significantly different than any of the other groups being compared.  Overall, the modern groups have less robusticity than is found in the Phum Snay morphologies.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/pre-angkor-warrior-women-found-expert-says-61781/ | title = Pre-Angkor Warrior Women Found, Expert Says | publisher = The Cambodia Daily | date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological significance ==

The high rates of traumatic lesions and weapons within the burials at Phum Snay suggest a society that values warriors.  Fighting was an important part of life to the people, which could be indicative of increasing competition over access to exotic exchange items during the Iron Age.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Furthering this idea is the general location of Phum Snay, right outside the Angkorian capital.  Increasing competition over resources could have been the driving force behind the formation of a hierarchical society and organized state.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;
The differences in morphological features between the human remains at Phum Snay and other modern Southeast Asian areas lends itself to the two-layer hypothesis.  The people at Phum Snay were less affected by the substantial [[gene flow]] received by other areas of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;

'''Power engineering''', also called '''power systems engineering''', is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of [[electric power]], and the electrical apparatus  connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of [[three-phase electric power|three-phase AC power]] – the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world – a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between [[rectifier|AC and DC power]] and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its theoretical base from [[electrical engineering]].

==Pioneering years==
[[Electricity]] became a subject of scientific interest in the late 17th century.  Over the next two centuries a number of important discoveries were made including the [[incandescent light bulb]] and the [[voltaic pile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The History Of The Light Bulb | publisher = Net Guides Publishing, Inc. | year = 2004 | url = http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-the-light-bulb.html | accessdate = 2007-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Thomas | last = Greenslade | title = The Voltaic Pile | publisher = [[Kenyon College]] | url = http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Electricity/Voltaic_Pile/Voltaic_Pile.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the greatest discovery with respect to power engineering came from [[Michael Faraday]] who in 1831 discovered that a change in magnetic flux induces an [[electromotive force]] in a loop of wire&amp;mdash;a principle known as [[electromagnetic induction]] that helps explain how generators and transformers work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Faraday Page | publisher = The Royal Institute | url = http://www.rigb.org/heritage/faradaypage.jsp | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080329153140/http://www.rigb.org/heritage/faradaypage.jsp | archivedate = 2008-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 two electricians built the world's first power station at [[Godalming]] in England. The station employed two waterwheels to produce an alternating current that was used to supply seven Siemens [[arc lamp]]s at 250 volts and thirty-four [[incandescent lamp]]s at 40 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=744 | title=Godalming Power Station | publisher=Engineering Timelines | accessdate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However supply was intermittent and in 1882 [[Thomas Edison]] and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City. The [[Pearl Street Station]] consisted of several generators and initially powered around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jasmin | last=Williams | title = Edison Lights The City | publisher =[[New York Post]] | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/11302007/news/cextra/edison_lights_the_city_514905.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | date=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Casey | last = Grant | title = The Birth of NFPA | publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]] | url = http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us/History&amp;cookie%5Ftest=1 | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228104759/http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us%2FHistory&amp;cookie_test=1 | archivedate = 2007-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The power station used [[direct current]] and operated at a single voltage. Since the direct current power could not be easily transformed to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power loss during transmission, the possible distance between the generators and load was limited to around half-a-mile (800 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Bulk Electricity Grid Beginnings  | publisher=New York Independent System Operator |url=http://www.pearlstreetinc.com/NYISO_bulk_elect_beginnings.pdf | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year in London [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] demonstrated the first transformer suitable for use in a real power system. The practical value of Gaulard and Gibbs' transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at [[Turin]] where the transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a single [[alternating current]] generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html | title=Lucien Gaulard | first=Evgeny | last=Katz | date=2007-04-08 | accessdate=2008-05-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072336/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html |archivedate = 2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the success of the system, the pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting the primaries of the transformers in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] so that switching one lamp on or off would affect other lamps further down the line. Following the demonstration [[George Westinghouse]], an American entrepreneur, imported a number of the transformers along with a [[Siemens]] generator and set his engineers to experimenting with them in the hopes of improving them for use in a commercial power system.

One of Westinghouse's engineers, [[William Stanley, Jr.|William Stanley]], recognised the problem with connecting transformers in series as opposed to [[series and parallel circuits|parallel]] and also realised that making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the [[voltage regulation]] of the secondary winding. Using this knowledge he built the world's first practical transformer based alternating current power system at [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html Great Barrington 1886 - Inspiring an industry toward AC power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/stanley.html | title=Alternating Current Electrification, 1886 | publisher=IEEE | first=Thomas | last=Blalock | date=2004-10-02 | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 349611 | y = 1886 | m = 09 | d = 21 | inventor = William Stanley Jr. | title = Induction Coil}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In 1885 the  Italian physicist and electrical engineer [[Galileo Ferraris]] demonstrated an [[induction motor]] and in 1887 and 1888 the Serbian-American engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] filed a range of patents related to power systems including one for a practical two-phase induction motor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j5bJ5OkGpgC&amp;pg=PA36 |title=Fritz E.

By 1890 the power industry had flourished and power companies had built thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United States and Europe – these networks were effectively dedicated to providing electric lighting. During this time a fierce rivalry in the US known as the "[[War of Currents]]" emerged between Edison and Westinghouse over which form of transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior. In 1891, Westinghouse installed the first major power system that was designed to drive an electric motor and not just provide electric lighting. The installation powered a {{convert|100|hp}} synchronous motor at [[Telluride, Colorado]] with the motor being started by a Tesla induction motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/niagara.htm | title=The Day They Turned The Falls On | first=Jack | last=Foran | accessdate=2008-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151552/http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/niagara.htm | archivedate=2008-05-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the Atlantic, [[Oskar von Miller]] built a 20 kV 176&amp;nbsp;km three-phase transmission line from [[Lauffen am Neckar]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] for the Electrical Engineering Exhibition in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.more-powerful-solutions.com/media/ScreenPDF_Hypower_15_72dpi.pdf | author=Voith Siemens (company) | title=HyPower | pages=7 | date=2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, after a protracted decision-making process, the [[Adams Power Plant|Adams No. 1 generating station]] at [[Niagara Falls]] began transmitting three-phase alternating current power to Buffalo at 11 kV.

==Twentieth century==
===Power engineering and Bolshevism===
[[File:Klutsis (1929) Soviet Power plus electrification.png|thumb|right|1929 poster by [[Gustav Klutsis]]]]
The generation of electricity was regarded as particularly important following the [[October revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power]]. [[Lenin]] stated "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vladimir|first=Lenin|title=Our Foreign and Domestic Position and Party Tasks|year=1920|location=Moscow|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/nov/21.htm|quote=Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country, since industry cannot be developed without electrification.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently featured on many Soviet posters, stamps etc. presenting this view. The [[GOELRO plan]] was initiated in 1920 as the first Bolshevik experiment in industrial planning and in which Lenin became personally involved. [[Gleb Krzhizhanovsky]] was another key figure involved, having been involved in the construction of a power station in [[Moscow]] in 1910. He had also known Lenin since 1897 when they were both in the St. Petersburg chapter of the ''Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class''.

===Power engineering in the USA===
In 1936 the first commercial [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line using [[mercury-arc valve]]s was built between [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] and [[Mechanicville, New York]]. HVDC had previously been achieved by installing direct current generators in series (a system known as the [[Thury system]]) although this suffered from serious reliability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html | title=A Novel but Short-Lived Power Distribution System | date=2005-05-01 | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=2008-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524013821/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html | archivedate=2011-05-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 [[Siemens]] demonstrated the first solid-state rectifier (solid-state rectifiers are now the standard for HVDC systems) however it was not until the early 1970s that this technology was used in commercial power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Gene Wolf | title=Electricity Through the Ages | url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_electricity_ages/ | work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=2000-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 Westinghouse demonstrated the first [[circuit breaker]] that used [[sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] as the interrupting medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=John Tyner, Rick Bush and Mike Eby | title=A Fifty-Year Retrospective | url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_fiftyyear_retrospective/ | work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=1999-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a far superior [[dielectric]] to air and, in recent times, its use has been extended to produce far more compact switching equipment (known as [[switchgear]]) and [[transformer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.abb.com/product/us/9AAC710047.aspx | publisher=ABB | title=Gas Insulated Switchgear | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.sayedsaad.com/Transformer/SF6_Transformer/sf6_transformer_main.htm | title=SF6 Transformer | first=Sayed | last=Amin | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important developments also came from extending innovations in the [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant [[load flow study|load flow studies]] could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for much better remote control of the power system's switchgear and generators.

==Power==
[[File:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|220px|Transmission lines transmit power across the [[Power grid|grid]].]]

Power Engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electricity distribution|distribution]] and utilization of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s and [[power electronics]].

Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid. These systems are called off-grid power systems and may be used in preference to on-grid systems for a variety of reasons. For example, in remote locations it may be cheaper for a mine to generate its own power rather than pay for connection to the grid and in most mobile applications connection to the grid is simply not practical.

==Fields==

[[Electricity generation]] covers the selection, design and construction of facilities that convert energy from primary forms to electric power.

[[Electric power transmission]] requires the engineering of high voltage transmission lines and substation facilities to interface to generation and distribution systems. [[High voltage direct current]] systems are one of the elements of an electric power grid.

[[Electric power distribution]] engineering covers those elements of a power system from a substation to the end customer.

[[Power system protection]] is the study of the ways an electrical power system can fail, and the methods to detect and mitigate for such failures.

In most projects, a power engineer must coordinate with many other disciplines such as civil and mechanical engineers, environmental experts, and legal and financial personnel. Major power system projects such as a large generating station may require scores of design professionals in addition to the power system engineers. At most levels of professional power system engineering practice, the engineer will require as much in the way of administrative and organizational skills as electrical engineering knowledge.

==Professional societies==
In both the UK and the USA, professional societies had long existed for civil and mechanical engineers.  The [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] was founded in the UK in 1871, and the [[AIEE]] in the United States in 1884. These societies contributed to the exchange of electrical knowledge and the development of electrical engineering education.

[[Image:Cologne Cathedral-imp01.jpg|thumb|The high choir of [[Cologne Cathedral]] (1248&amp;ndash;1322) is considered one of the finest Rayonnant structures of the Middle Ages.]]
In French Gothic architecture, '''Rayonnant''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɛjɔnɑ̃}}) was the period between c. 1240 and 1350, characterized by a shift in focus away from the [[High Gothic]] mode of utilizing great scale and spatial rationalism (such as with buildings like [[Chartres Cathedral]] or the nave of [[Amiens Cathedral]]) towards a greater concern for two dimensional surfaces and the repetition of decorative motifs at different scales. After the mid-14th century, Rayonnant gradually evolved into the [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] [[Flamboyant]] style, although the point of transition is not clearly defined.

==Terminology==
The name ''Rayonnant'' derives from the attempts of 19th-century French art historians (notably [[Henri Focillon]] and Ferdinand de Lasteyrie) to classify Gothic styles on the basis of window tracery. Although such efforts are now regarded as mistaken, the resulting terms have to some extent survived (Rayonnant and [[Flamboyant Gothic|Flamboyant]] are still widely used by art historians, though the misleading old term ''Lancet Gothic'' has generally given way to ''High Gothic''). On this basis, Focillon and his colleagues adopted the term ''Rayonnant'' (from the French word meaning "radiating") specifically to describe the radiating spokes of the [[rose windows]] which flourished during this period. (Some sources incorrectly derive the term from the radiating chapels spreading from the [[apse]], but these were not specifically associated with this period and had been a standard feature of Continental architecture since the 11th century on Romanesque buildings like [[Cluny Abbey]] and the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]])

==Origins and development==
[[Image:Porche.eglise.Saint.Nicaise.Reims.2.png|thumb|left|Reconstructed view of the portal of St Nicaise, Reims]]
Although elements of the new style can be found at the Cistercian abbey church of [[Royaumont]] (begun 1228, now mostly destroyed), perhaps the most important step in the development of the Rayonnant style was the building of the Abbey Church of [[Nicasius of Rheims|St Nicaise]], in [[Reims]] (begun 1231). Although this church was entirely destroyed during the French Revolution, its facade is well known from 18th-century engravings. The architect ([[Hugues Libergier]]) took various existing elements of the Gothic decorative vocabulary and used them to create a very new visual aesthetic. Perhaps the most influential feature of the Church of St Nicaise was its west facade, constructed as a series of pointed gables decorated with [[crockets]] and a mixture of blind and open [[tracery]], interspersed with narrow pinnacles. Unlike earlier Gothic west facades, with their clear three-part horizontal and vertical divisions, Libergier's design was more screen-like (indeed it may have been inspired by earlier [[choir screens]]) and on a far more human scale than the cavernous doorways of [[Reims Cathedral]]. Several key elements of the St Nicaise facade were soon taken up by other architects and can be recognised, for example, in the treatment of the North [[transept]] portal of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and around the roof line of the [[Sainte Chapelle]].

==General characteristics==
Whilst all phases of [[Gothic architecture]] were concerned to some degree with levels of illumination and the appearance of structural lightness, Rayonnant takes this to the extreme. More of the wall surface than ever before was pierced by windows (see for example the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]]) and buildings were often given lace-like tracery screens on the exterior to hide the bulk of load bearing wall elements and buttresses (such as at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] or the [[Church of St Urbain, Troyes]]).

[[Image:Basilique Saint-Urbain Troyes Façade 110208.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of the [[Basilique Saint-Urbain de Troyes|Church of St Urbain, Troyes]], showing the use of gables, pinnacles and open tracery]]
As well as increasing the size of window openings, the Rayonnant period coincided with the development of the band window, in which a central strip of richly coloured stained glass is positioned between upper and lower bands of clear or [[grisaille]] glass, which allowed even more light to flood in.

Although changes in window design are the most oft-cited feature of the Rayonnant style, they were actually just one part of a more fundamental aesthetic shift. The key precursor was a change in the construction of window [[tracery]]; the replacement of old-fashioned ''plate-tracery'' (in which the window openings look as if they have been punched out of a flat stone plate) with the more delicate ''bar-tracery'' (in which the stone elements separating the glazing panels within a window are constructed out of narrow carved mouldings, with rounded inner and outer profiles). Bar-tracery probably made its first appearance in the clerestory windows at [[Reims Cathedral]] and quickly spread across Europe. As well as being a more effective and flexible way of constructing windows, bar tracery also paved the way for the development of blind tracery (decorating an otherwise blank wall) and of open tracery, typically all using the same decorative motifs as the adjoining windows. 
[[Image:Basilica di saint Denis vetrata 06.JPG|thumb|right|Bar tracery and glazed triforium in the nave of St Denis (the windows themselves are 19th-century replacements)]]
The final architectural innovation that emerged as part of the Rayonnant style in France was the use of glazed triforia. Traditionally, the [[triforium]] of an Early or High Gothic cathedral was a dark horizontal band, usually housing a narrow passageway, that separated the top of the arcade from the clerestory. Although it made the interior darker, it was a necessary feature to accommodate the sloping lean-to roofs over the side aisles and chapels. The Rayonnant solution to this, as employed to brilliant effect in the 1230s nave of the [[Abbey Church of St Denis]], was to use double-pitched roofs over the aisles, with hidden gutters to drain off the rain-water. This meant the outer wall of the triforioum passage could now be glazed, and the inner wall reduced to slender bar tracery. Architects also began to emphasise the linkage between triforium and clerestory by extending the central mullions from the windows of the latter in a  continuous moulding running from the top of the windows down through the blind tracery of the triforium to the string course at the top of the arcading.

==Influences==
[[File:Doorscath.jpg|thumb|[[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque|Saint Nicholas's Cathedral]], [[Famagusta]]]]
Key elements of the Rayonnant style were incorporated into English architecture with the rebuilding of [[Westminster Abbey]] by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], who had been present at the consecration of Louis IX's Ste Chapelle. The resulting mixture of styles at Westminster (a crucial step in the development of English Decorated Gothic) has been characterised by some art historians as "French architecture with an English accent". Rayonnant was also very influential in the Holy Roman Empire, as evidenced by the cathedrals at Strasbourg, Cologne and Prague. In Spain we find the best examples in the [[León Cathedral]] and the [[Burgos cathedral]], this last one quite modified in the time of [[Flamboyant]] Gothic. The style even reached as far as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] (a French cultural outpost during the Middle Ages) with the most prominent example being [[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque|Saint Nicholas's Cathedral]] in [[Famagusta]].

The various decorative elements employed in the Rayonnant style (bar tracery, blind and open tracery, gables and pinnacles) could also be applied on a much smaller scale, both for the micro-architectural fixtures and fittings within a church (tombs, shrines, pulpits, sacrament houses, etc.) and also for small portable objects like reliquaries, liturgical equipment, ivory diptychs, etc. This combination of flexibility and portability may have been a key factor in the dissemination of Rayonnant and its various offshoots across Europe in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.
[[Image:Ivory adoration crucifixion MRR424.jpg|thumb|left|Typically Rayonnant pierced gables and open tracery employed as a micro-architectural framing device in an ivory diptych]]

The transition (in France) from Rayonnant to Flamboyant Gothic was gradual and evolutionary in form, marked primarily by a shift towards new tracery patterns based on S-shaped curves (these curves resemble flickering flames, from which the new style got its name). However, amidst the chaos of the [[Hundred Years War]] and the various other misfortunes experienced by Europe during the 14th century, relatively little large scale construction occurred and certain elements of the Rayonnant style remained in vogue well into the next century.

During the 1970s, he undertook anthropological field research in a serious of major studies using digitized environmental modeling to help understand the divergent urban contexts of [[Mantua, Philadelphia|Mantua]], in [[West Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u540004|title=Mantua Primer: Toward a Program for Environmental Change {{!}} Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[frazione]]'' of [[San Leucio]] in [[Southern Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/2015945|title=San Leucio: vitalità d'una tradizione: traditions in transition {{!}} Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Adirondack High Peaks]] region in [[New York (state)|New York State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/two-adirondack-hamlets-in-history-keene-and-keene-valley/oclc/43095901|title=Two Adirondack hamlets in history: Keene and Keene Valley {{!}} Purple Mountain Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant work includes a 40-year study in [[Turgutreis]], [[Turkey]], which documented the transformation of small villages into a modern city through the experiences of 15 families,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dr.com.tr/Kitap/Turgutreis-1974-Ingilizce-/Suha-Ozkan/Foreign-Languages/Reference/Architecture-Decoration-Desing/urunno=0000000708529|title=Turgutreis 1974 {{!}} Literatur Yayincilik}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Millennium Cities Initiative]]-developed strategic analysis of [[Accra|Accra, Ghana]]'s Ga Mashie and Nima neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://urbandesignlab.columbia.edu/projects/green-and-sustainable-infrastructure/urban-development-in-accra-ghana-an-implementation-toolkit|title=Urban Development in Accra, Ghana: an Implementation Toolkit {{!}} Urban Design Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saint Louis Science Center''', founded as a planetarium in 1963, is a collection of buildings including a [[science museum]] and [[planetarium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on the southeastern corner of [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]]. With over 750 exhibits in a complex of over {{convert|300000|sqft|sqm}}, it is among the largest of its type in the United States.&lt;ref name=scala&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Park, Saint Louis|author=Craske, Oliver|author2=Peacock, Sarah|author3=Shoolbred, Andrew|publisher=Scala Publishers|isbn=978-1-85759-340-2|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:McDonnellPlanetarium.jpg|thumb|320px|The James S. McDonnell Planetarium, built in 1963 and featuring a [[thin-shell structure|thin-shell]] and [[hyperboloid structure]] by [[Gyo Obata]]. This building is one of the most distinctive components of the Saint Louis Science Center campus]]
Funding for the first structure of the current campus began in 1955, with $1 million of a $110 million city bond issue specified for the construction of a planetarium. Two years were spent surveying locations. The first proposed site, on the northern side of Forest Park near the [[Missouri History Museum|Jefferson Memorial Building]] at Lindell and DeBaliviere, was scrapped because of restrictions on subdivisions. The location was changed to the southern part of the park, on the site of the old [[mounted police]] station, which was demolished in 1960. The plan was to build a planetarium, science museum, and natural history museum.&lt;ref name=fp/&gt;

The Planetarium was designed by [[Gyo Obata]] of [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]] with a unique shape (Obata was later tasked in the 1970s with designing the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]). ''[[Architectural Forum]]'' magazine described it as, "Looking like some strange craft spun down to earth from outer space... St. Louis's new planetarium perches gracefully on a rise in ... Forest Park".&lt;ref name=fp/&gt; [[James Smith McDonnell]] (1899&amp;ndash;1980), an aviation pioneer and co-founder of St. Louis-based [[McDonnell Douglas]], an [[aerospace manufacturer]], donated $200,000 for equipment such as the star projector. The facility was named after him in 1964.&lt;ref name=fp&gt;{{cite book|date=1986|isbn=0-9638298-0-7|author=Loughlin, Caroline|author2=Anderson, Catherine|title=Forest Park|publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]|location=[[Columbia, Missouri]]|page=207&amp;ndash;209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 1997, an air-supported building was added to the main building, the Exploradome. With an additional {{convert|18000|sqft|sqm}}, it was intended as a temporary facility for traveling exhibitions, additional classrooms, and to host large group events.

'''Sexual objectification''' is the act of treating a person as a mere [[Object (philosophy)|object]] of [[sexual desire]]. [[Objectification]] more broadly means treating a person as a [[commodity]] or an object without regard to their [[personality]] or [[dignity]]. Objectification is most commonly examined at the level of a society, but can also refer to the behavior of individuals and is a type of [[dehumanization]].

The concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of [[woman|women]], is an important idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from [[feminism]]. Many feminists regard sexual objectification as playing an important role in [[gender inequality]]. Psychologists associate objectification with a host of physical and mental health risks in women.

Pro-feminist cultural critics such as [[Robert W.

The objection to the objectification of women is not a recent phenomenon. In the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In [[Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy]]'s 1771 play ''The True Mother'' (''La Vraie Mère''), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts &amp;ndash; the respectable treasures of nature &amp;ndash; as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schama |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Schama |contribution=The cultural construction of a citizen: II Casting roles: children of nature |editor-last=Schama |editor-first=Simon |editor-link=Simon Schama |title=[[Citizens.

The issues concerning sexual objectification became first [[problematization|problemized]] during the 1970s by feminist groups. Since then, it has been argued that the phenomenon of female sexual objectification has increased drastically since its problematization in all levels of life, and has resulted in negative consequences for women, especially in the political sphere. However, a rising form of new third-waver feminist groups have also taken the increased objectification of women as an opportunity to use the female body as a mode of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Heldman | first = Caroline | title = Sexualizing Sarah Palin: the social and political context of the sexual objectification of female candidates | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 156&amp;ndash;164 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-9984-6 | date = August 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-011-9984-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]] contends that Western women who exploit their sexuality by, for example, wearing revealing clothing and engaging in lewd behavior, engage in female self-objectification, meaning they objectify themselves. While some women see such behaviour as a form of [[empowerment]], Levy contends that it has led to greater emphasis on a physical criterion or [[sexualization]] for women's perceived self-worth, which Levy calls "[[Raunch aesthetics|raunch culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Ariel |author-link=Ariel Levy (journalist) |title=[[Female Chauvinist Pigs|Female chauvinist pigs: women and the rise of raunch culture]] |publisher=Pocket Books |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4165-2638-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy discusses this phenomenon in ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs]]: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture''. Levy followed the camera crew from the ''[[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]]'' video series, and argues that contemporary America's sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article2523264.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Yes we are bovvered |first=Ginny |last=Dougary |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit [[pornography]] has become a symbol of feminist strength.

==Sexual objectification of men==
[[Feminist]] authors [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and [[Naomi Wolf]] write that women's sexual liberation led women to a [[role reversal]], whereby they viewed men as sex objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Sommers |first=Christina |author-link=Sommers, Christina Hoff |contribution=The gender wardens |title-link=Who Stole Feminism?

=== Media ===
Men's bodies have become more objectified than they previously were. It is known as "Six-pack Advertising," where men are seen as sexual objects. Because of society's established gaze on the objectification of women, the newfound objectification of men is not as widespread. Even with this increase of male objectification, males are still seen as the dominant figures and so the focus is still primarily on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tortajada-Giménez |first1= Iolanda |last2= Araüna-Baró |first2= Núria | last3 = Martínez-Martínez | first3 = Inmaculada José | title = Advertising stereotypes and gender representation in social networking sites | journal = Comunicar | volume = 21 | issue = 41 | pages = 177&amp;ndash;186 | publisher = Grupo Comunicar | date = 2013 | url = https://www.revistacomunicar.com/indice-en/articulo.php?numero=41-2013-17 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://doi.org/10.3916/C41-2013-17 Original Spanish article.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Male sexual objectification has been found in 37% of advertisements featuring men's body parts to showcase a product.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = M.

Similar to the issues of sexual objectification in women, it is common for said objectification to lead men to body shaming, eating disorders, and a drive for perfection. Men in the media are especially pressured to take part in steroid use in order to meet the standard of beauty set by body evaluation. The continued exposure of these "ideal" men subject society to expect all men to fit this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Buchbinder | first = David | author-link = David Buchbinder | title = Object or ground?

Male actors featured in TV shows and movies are oftentimes in excellent shape and have the "ideal" bodies. These men often fill the leading roles. When society is subjected to men who do not have ideal bodies, we typically see them as the comic relief. It is rare to see an out of shape man have a leading role. "There are temporal, cultural and geographical ‘norms’ of gender and other aspects of identity, which are often incorrectly considered to be inherent or natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dawson | first = Leanne | title = Passing and policing: controlling compassion, bodies and boundaries in ''Boys Don’t Cry'' and ''Unveiled/Fremde Haut'' | journal = Studies in European Cinema | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 205&amp;ndash;228 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/17411548.2015.1094258 | date = 2015 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17411548.2015.1094258 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the media, the ideal version of a man is seen as a strong, toned man. The idealized version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one’s physical appearance. This leads to other things like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Self-objectification, which is the way in which we evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women.  Men typically experience it through media display.  The difference is that men typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent that women do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stevens Aubrey | first = Jennifer |title=Investigating the role of self-objectification in the relationship between media exposure and sexual self-perceptions | url = http://www.icahdq.org/page/PastFuture | date = 27 May 2003 }} Paper presented at the annual meeting of the [[International Communication Association]], Marriott Hotel, San Diego, CA, May 27, 2003.

==Views on sexual objectification==
{{see also|Gaze}}
While the concept of sexual objectification is important within feminist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification and what are the ethical implications of such objectification. Some feminists such as [[Naomi Wolf]] find the concept of [[physical attractiveness]] itself to be problematic,&lt;ref name=beautymyth&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |author-link=Naomi Wolf |title=The beauty myth: how images of beauty are used against women |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |year=2002 |origyear=1992 |isbn=978-0-06-051218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some [[radical feminists]]  being opposed to any evaluation of another person's sexual attractiveness based on physical characteristics.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs references to reliable sources|date=September 2015}} [[John Stoltenberg]] goes so far as to condemn as wrongfully objectifying any sexual fantasy that involves the visualization of a woman.&lt;ref name=stoltenberg&gt;{{cite book |last=Stoltenberg |first=John |author-link=John Stoltenberg | chapter = Sexual objectification and male supremacy |chapter-url=http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Stoltenberg-Refusing-to-be-a-Man.pdf |title=Refusing to be a man: essays on sex and justice |publisher=UCL Press |location=London New York | page = 38 |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-84142-041-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists view objectification as playing a central role in reducing women to what they refer to as the "oppressed sex [[Social class|class]]".{{Cite quote|date=September 2015}} While some feminists view mass media in societies that they argue are [[patriarchal]] to be objectifying, they often focus on [[pornography]] as playing an egregious role in habituating men to objectify women.&lt;ref name='MacKinnon "Only Words"'&gt;{{cite book |last=MacKinnon |first=Catharine |author-link=Catharine MacKinnon |title=Only words |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-674-63934-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[social conservatives]] have taken up aspects of the [[feminist]] critique of sexual objectification. In their view however, the increase in the sexual objectification of both sexes in Western culture is one of the negative legacies of the [[sexual revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr. James Dobson |url=http://www.theinterim.com/issues/society-culture/dr-james-dobson-6 |work=The Interim: Canada's life and family newspaper |location=[[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada |publisher=via [[True Media]] |date=12 January 1997 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit1&gt;{{cite book |last=Shalit |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy Shalit |title=A return to modesty: discovering the lost virtue |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-684-86317-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reisman |first=Judith A. |author-link=Judith Reisman |title="Soft porn" plays hardball: its tragic effects on women, children, and the family |publisher=Huntington House Publishers |location=[[Lafayette, Louisiana]] |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-910311-92-2 |pages=32–46, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holz |first=Adam R. |title=Is average the new ugly? |url=http://www.pluggedin.com/familyroom/articles/2007/isaveragethenewugly.aspx |work=[[Plugged In|Plugged In Online]] |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=National Coalition for the Protection of Children &amp; Families |url=http://pureintimacy.org/piArticles/A000000551.cfm |title=Subtle Dangers of Pornography (special report by the National Coalition for the Protection of Children &amp; Families) |work=Pure Intimacy (website) |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |date=July 1997 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics, notably [[Wendy Shalit]], advocate a return to pre-sexual revolution standards of [[sexual morality]], which Shalit refers to as a "return to [[modesty]]", as an antidote to sexual objectification.&lt;ref name=shalit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit2&gt;{{cite web |last=Shalit |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy Shalit |title=Modesty revisited |url=http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles/ShalitModesty.php |website=orthodoxytoday.org |publisher=[[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|Fr.

Others contest feminist claims about the objectification of women. [[Camille Paglia]] holds that "[t]urning people into sex objects is one of the specialties of our species." In her view, objectification is closely tied to (and may even be identical with) the highest human faculties toward conceptualization and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paglia |first=Camille |author-link=Camille Paglia |title=[[Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson|Sexual personae: art and decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]] |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-679-73579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Individualist feminist]] [[Wendy McElroy]] says, given that  'objectification' of women means to make women into sexual objects; it is meaningless because, 'sexual objects', taken literally, means nothing because inanimate objects do not have sexuality. She continues that women are their bodies as well as their minds and souls, and so focusing on a single aspect should not be "degrading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy McElroy |title=A feminist overview of pornography, ending in a defense thereof |url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/freeinqu.htm |website=WendyMcElroy.com |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectification theory==
{{expert needed|Feminism|ex2=Gender Studies|section|reason=The prose is jargon-filled, repetitive and nearly impenetrable to laypeople. The structure needs improvement|date=January 2015}}
Objectification theory is a framework for understanding the experiences of women in cultures that sexual objectify them, proposed by Barbara Fredrickson and Tomi-Ann Roberts in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Roberts, T. (1997). Objectification Theory. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 21(2), 173-206. Retrieved September 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this framework, Fredrickson and Roberts draw conclusions about women’s experiences. This theory states that, because of sexual objectification, women learn to internalize an outsider’s view of their bodies as the primary view of themselves. Women, they explain, begin to view their bodies as objects separate from their person. This internalization has been termed self-objectification. This theory doesn’t seek to prove the existence of sexual objectification; the theory assumes its existence in culture. This self-objectification then, according to objectification theory, leads to increased habitual body monitoring. With this framework in mind, Fredrickson and Roberts suggest explanations for consequences they believe are the result of sexual objectification. The consequences suggested are: increased feelings of shame, increased feelings of anxiety, decreased peak motivational state, and decreased awareness of internal bodily states.

Sexual objectification has been studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can take place in the media or through personal experience.&lt;ref name=bartky&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartky |first=Sandra Lee |author-link=Sandra Bartky |contribution=On psychological oppression |editor-last=Bartky |editor-first=Sandra Lee |editor-link=Sandra Bartky |title=Femininity and domination: studies in the phenomenology of oppression |page=26 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-415-90186-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] perception, which is identified as self-objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaschak |first=Ellyn |author-link=Ellyn Kaschak |title=Engendered lives: a new psychology of women's experience |page=12 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York, New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-465-01349-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social [[gender roles]] and inequalities between the sexes.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldenberg |first1=Jamie L. |last2=Roberts |first2=Tomi-Ann |contribution=The beast within the beauty: an existential perspective on the objectification and condemnation of women |editor-last1=Greenberg |editor-first1=Jeff |editor-last2=Koole |editor-first2=Sander L. |editor-last3=Pyszczynski |editor-first3=Tom |title=Handbook of experimental existential psychology |pages=71–85 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-59385-040-1 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-objectification===

[[Self-objectification]] can increase in situations which heighten the awareness of an individual’s physical appearance.&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fredrickson |first1=Barbara L. |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |author-link1=Barbara Fredrickson |title=Throwing like a girl: self-objectification predicts adolescent girls’ motor performance |journal=[[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=79–101 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/0193723504269878 |date=February 2005|ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} Here, the presence of a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are looking at them, or will be looking at them, they are more likely to care about their physical appearance. Examples of the enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.

===Women, girls, and self-objectification===
Primarily, objectification theory describes how women and girls are influenced as a result of expected social and [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name=bartky/&gt; Research indicates not all women are influenced equally, due to the [[anatomical]], [[hormonal]], and [[Genetics|genetic]] differences of the female body; however, women’s bodies are often objectified and evaluated more frequently.&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82 /&gt;{{rp|90–95}} Self-objectification in girls tends to stem from two main causes: the internalization of traditional beauty standards as translated through media as well as any instances of sexual objectification that they might encounter in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McKay |first=Tajare' |title=Female self-objectification: causes, consequences and prevention |journal=McNair Scholars Research Journal |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=53–70 |publisher=[[Ronald E.

This, in turn, can lead to many serious problems in women and girls, including "body shame, anxiety, negative attitudes toward menstruation, a disrupted flow of consciousness, diminished awareness of internal bodily states, depression, sexual dysfunction, and disordered eating."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Calogero |first1=Rachel M. |last2=Davis |first2=William N. |last3=Thompson |first3=J. Kevin |title=The role of self-objectification in the experience of women with eating disorders |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-1192-9 |date=January 2005 |ref=harv |postscript=.|url=http://brown.uk.com/eatingdisorders/calogero.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual objectification occurs when a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body.&lt;ref name=bartky/&gt; The purpose of this recognition is to bring enjoyment to others, or to serve as a sexual object for society.&lt;ref name=LeMoncheck /&gt; Sexual objectification can occur as a [[social construct]] among individuals.

===Psychological consequences===
Objectification theory suggests both direct and indirect consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include [[self consciousness]] in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment is one of the challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading.&lt;ref name="Doob"&gt;{{cite book |last=Doob |first=Christopher B. |title=Social inequality and social stratification in US society |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-205-79241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into [[mental health]] problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats ([[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia]], and [[sexual dysfunction]]), and increased body shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Moradi |first1=Bonnie |last2=Huang |first2=Yu-Ping |title=Objectification theory and psychology of women: a decade of advances and future directions |journal=[[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=377–398 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00452.x |date=December 2008  |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including [[disordered eating]], [[mental health]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], motor performance, [[body image]], idealized body type, [[stereotype]] formation, sexual perception and sexual typing.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2/&gt;&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82/&gt; Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, [[cosmetic surgery]], etc.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.

===Causes of depression===
[[Learned helplessness]] theory posits that because human bodies are only alterable to a certain point, people develop a sense of body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes this results in a state of depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doob"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">The '''South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology''', or '''SCIAA''', was founded in 1963 as a research institute at [[University of South Carolina]] and as a State cultural resource management agency. In the latter capacity, SCIAA is part of the Executive Department of the South Carolina State Government and serves as the main State agency concerned with the State's Archaeology (both [[Prehistoric archaeology|prehistoric]] and historic), and its discovery, study, interpretation, publication, and official conservation at its curatorial facilities. As a University research institute, SCIAA both initiates and conducts a wide spectrum of field investigations and collections research throughout [[South Carolina]]. SCIAA participates in numerous university projects, and is a significant part of the University's infrastructure, and the University's publication series.

[[Image:Stream capture.png|thumb|200px|Stream capture by [[headward erosion]], leaving a [[wind gap]]]]

'''Stream capture''', '''river capture''', '''river piracy''' or '''stream piracy''' is a [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] phenomenon occurring when a stream or river [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]] or [[Drainage basin|watershed]] is diverted from its own bed, and flows instead down the bed of a neighbouring stream.  This can happen for several reasons, including:
*[[Tectonic]] earth movements, where the slope of the land changes, and the stream is tipped out of its former course
*Natural [[damming]], such as by a [[landslide]] or [[ice sheet]]
*[[Erosion]], either
**[[Headward erosion]] of one stream valley upwards into another, or
**Lateral erosion of a [[meander]] through the higher ground dividing the adjacent streams.
**Within an area of [[karst topography]], where streams may ''sink'', or flow underground (a sinking or [[losing stream]]) and then reappear in a nearby stream valley
*Glacier retreat
[[Image:Maumeerivermap.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Maumee River]] basin. The Maumee, flowing north-east, has broken into part of the [[Wabash River]] basin, capturing west-flowing streams and reversing their flow direction on entering it.]]
The additional water flowing down the capturing stream may accelerate [[erosion]] and encourage the development of a [[canyon]] (gorge).

The now-dry valley of the original stream is known as a [[Wind gap (geographical feature)|wind gap]].

==Capture mechanisms==

===Tectonic uplift===
*[[Barmah Choke]]&lt;p&gt;About 25,000 years ago, an uplift of the plains near Moama first dammed the [[Murray River]] and then forced it to take a new course.  The new course dug its way through the so called Barmah Choke and captured the lower course of the [[Goulburn River]] for {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}}.
*[[Barrier Range]]&lt;p&gt;The original course of the [[Murray River]] was to a mouth near [[Port Pirie]] where a large delta is still visible protruding into the calm waters of [[Spencer Gulf]].  An uplift of the land blocked the river near the southern end of the [[Flinders Ranges]], and the river eventually found its way to a new mouth near [[Lake Alexandrina (South Australia)|Lake Alexandrina]].
* [[Indus River|Indus]]-[[Sutlej]]-[[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]]-[[Yamuna]]&lt;p&gt;The Yumana earlier flowed into the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]] (identified with the Sarasvati River) and later changed its course due to plate tectonics. The Sutlej River flowed into the current channel of the Ghaggar-Hakra River until the 13th century after which it was captured by the Indus River due to plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=ym1&gt;K.N. Dikshit, 2013, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170118032736/http://server2.docfoc.com/uploads/Z2015/11/21/vESLakMBYz/45a03572f94e7a873d7c350293cca188.pdf Origin of Early Harappan Cultures in the Sarasvati. Valley: Recent Archaeological Evidence and Radiometric Dates], Journal of Indian Ocean Archaeology, pp88-&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glacial damming===
[[Image:GoringGap01.JPG|right|thumb|The River Thames as it passes through the [[Goring Gap]]]]
[[File:Val de Laire.jpg|thumb|Stream capture of the Aire by the Aisne]]
*The [[River Thames#Geological history|River Thames]] in southern [[England]] originally entered the [[North Sea]] near [[Ipswich]].  About 450,000 years ago, an [[ice sheet]] expanding from the north pushed the course of the river southwards, forcing the Thames to cut a new mouth where the mouth of the [[River Blackwater, Essex]] now is, north of London. It later moved southwards again to its current position as a result of cutting through the [[Chiltern Hills]] at [[Goring-on-Thames]], an event which created the [[Goring Gap]].

===Formation===
River capture is formed when a river through headward erosion flows into a water divide and cuts off the headwater of another weaker river.

For river capture to occur, the following conditions must be available :
* There must be two parallel consequent rivers separated by a divide or have a common watershed.
* One of the rivers must be more powerful or have more erosive power than the other. 
* The valley of the more powerful river must be deeper than the other. 
* It must cut back into the headland (headers erosion) faster than the other river.

===Headward erosion===
*The [[Teays River]], captured by the [[Ohio River]].
*The [[Rio Grande]] which before capture flowed into a [[Endorheic basin|closed basin]], [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]], but after capture flowed into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].
*The ancestral [[Niger River]] captured what is now the upper reaches of the Niger which once flowed into an [[endorheic basin]] to the east northeast of [[Timbuktu]].&lt;ref name=PG462&gt;{{cite book|title=Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation|year=2005|publisher=Pearson, Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-145139-1|page=462|author=Tom L. McKnight|edition=8th|author2=Darrel Hess |chapter=16, "The Fluvial Processes"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[River Stour, Kent]], largely captured by the [[River Beult]] {{IPAc-en|b|ɛ|l|t}}, [[River Teise]] {{IPAc-en|t|iː|z}} and others.
*The [[River Wey]], in southern [[England]], the western arm of which is the former upper waters of the [[River Blackwater (River Loddon)]].
*The [[River Rheidol]] in [[Wales]] which has captured the headwaters of other streams and now runs for part of its length in a deep gorge.
*The [[River Lyd (Devon)|River Lyd]] in [[Devon]], England.
*The Black River, in [[Kings County, Nova Scotia]], Canada, captured by the [[Gaspereau River]]
*The [[Casiquiare canal]] is a [[distributary]] of the [[Orinoco River]] that is currently in the process of capturing the upper reaches of the latter river.

===Karst===
*The ''Donauversickerung'' ([[Danube Sinkhole|Danube Sink]]), currently developing in [[Germany]], where a large portion of the upper part of the [[Danube]] river sinks into the [[limestone]] bedrock, and resurfaces in the [[Aachtopf]] [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]], a tributary of the River [[Rhine]].

===Glacier retreat===
The [[Slims River]] was previously fed by [[meltwater]] from the [[Kaskawulsh Glacier]] in the [[St. Elias Mountains]] in the  [[Yukon]] and its waters flowed into [[Kluane Lake]] and on to the [[Bering Sea]]. Because of [[climate change]], the glacier has rapidly receded and the meltwater no longer feeds the Slims. The water instead now feeds the Kaskawulsh River which is a tributary to the [[Alsek River]] and drains into the [[Gulf of Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/slims-river-dries-yukon-kluane-glacier-1.3639472 ''Retreating Yukon glacier makes river disappear,'' CBC News Posted: Jun 17, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v10/n5/full/ngeo2932.html|title=River piracy and drainage basin reorganization led by climate-driven glacier retreat|last=Shugar|first=Dan, H. et al.|date=|website=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v10/n5/full/ngeo2932.html|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on freshwater life==
River capture is a shaping force in the [[biogeography]] or distribution of many [[freshwater]] [[fish]] species.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, J. S., &amp; Crampton, W. G. (2010). The geography and ecology of diversification in Neotropical freshwaters. Nature Education Knowledge, 1, 13-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert, J. S., Schoolmaster, D. R., Tagliacollo, V., &amp; Duke-Sylvester, S. M. (2016). Barrier displacement on a neutral landscape: Towards a theory of continental biogeography. Systematic Biology, syw080&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian freshwater fish===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The formerly massive [[Great Dividing Range]] runs the length of the eastern coastline of Australia and has isolated native freshwater fish populations east and west of the range for millions of years. In the last two million years erosion has reduced the Great Dividing Range to a critical point where west-to-east river capture events have been possible. A number of native fish species that originated in the [[Murray River|Murray]]–[[Darling River|Darling]] river system to the west are (or were) found naturally occurring in a number of coastal systems spanning almost the entire length of the range.

None of the river capture events that allowed native fish of the Murray-Darling system to cross into and colonise these East Coast river systems seem to have formed permanent linkages. The colonising Murray-Darling fish in these East Coast river systems have therefore become isolated from their parent species, and due to isolation, the [[founder effect]], [[genetic drift]] and [[natural selection]], have become separate species (see [[allopatric speciation]]).

Examples include:
* [[Golden perch]] ([[Dawson River (Queensland)|Dawson]]–[[Fitzroy River, Queensland|Fitzroy]] river system, central [[Queensland]]).
* [[Eel-tailed catfish]] (several rivers, northern [[New South Wales]]). However, note recent genetic research which now indicates eel-tailed catfish colonised east coast drainages in multiple colonisation events relatively recently (by evolutionary standards) and may subsequently have colonised the Murray–Darling system via an east-to-west river capture event, contrary to usual west-to-east capture events listed here.
* [[Macquarie perch]] ([[Hawkesbury River|Hawkesbury]]-[[Nepean River|Nepean]] rivers, [[Shoalhaven River]], southern [[New South Wales]]).
* [[River blackfish]] (multiple rivers, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]).
* [[Murray cod]], whose eastern species/subspecies are:
** [[Eastern freshwater cod]] ([[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] system, northern [[New South Wales]]. It was also found in the [[Richmond River]] system in [[New South Wales]] but that population is now extinct.)
** [[Brisbane River cod]] ([[Brisbane River]] system, southern [[Queensland]]. That population is now extinct, and its exact taxonomic status is not known.)
** The [[Mary River cod]] ([[Mary River (Queensland)|Mary River]], southern/central [[Queensland]].)
* The [[mountain galaxias]] [[species complex]] (multiple rivers, southern [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]).

Olive perchlet (''Ambassis agassizii''), [[western carp gudgeon]] (''Hypseleotris klungzingeri''), pygmy perch (''Nannoperca australis'') and [[Australian smelt]] (''Retropinna semoni'') also appear to have made crossings into coastal systems, the last two species seemingly many times as they are found in most or all coastal streams in south eastern Australia as well as the [[Murray-Darling]] system.

Unfortunately, with the exception of [[eastern freshwater cod]] and [[Mary River cod]], it has not been widely recognised that these coastal populations of Murray–Darling native fish are separate species and their classifications have not been updated to reflect this. Many are threatened and two, the [[Richmond River cod]] and the [[Brisbane River cod]], have become extinct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="907">The '''Structural Engineering exam''' is a written examination given by state licensing boards in the [[United States]] as part of the testing for licensing [[structural engineer]]s.  This exam is written by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]].  It is given in eight-hour segments over two days, with the first day covering vertical forces.  Problems involving lateral forces are covered on the second day. Each day's morning session features multiple-choice questions, while the afternoon sessions are devoted to essay questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncees.org/exams/se-exam/ |title=SE exam |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swiss Seismological Service'''  ({{lang-de|Schweizerischer Erdbebendienst}}, {{lang-fr|Service sismologique suisse}}, {{lang-it|Servizio sismico svizzero}}, {{lang-rm|Servizi da terratrembels svizzer}})  at [[ETH Zurich]] is the federal agency responsible for monitoring [[earthquakes]] in Switzerland and its neighboring countries and for assessing Switzerland’s seismic hazard. When an earthquake happens, the SED informs the public, authorities, and the media about the earthquake’s location, magnitude, and possible consequences. The activities of the SED are integrated in the [http://www.bafu.admin.ch/naturgefahren/14806/14961/index.html?lang=de federal action plan for earthquake precaution].

== History ==
The beginnings of the SED trace back to the establishment of the Erdbebenkommission in 1878. In 1914, the earthquake monitoring mandate was defined in a federal law. Thus, what had been a voluntary activity was transformed into an institution. In its present form as a nondepartmental unit of ETH Zurich, the SED has been in existence since 2009.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/about-us/portrait/history/|title=History Swiss Seismological Service |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquake monitoring ==
More than 150 seismic monitoring stations installed and serviced by the SED constantly monitor earthquake activity in Switzerland and its neighboring countries. The processing center in Zurich acquires data recorded in Switzerland from two different sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/earthquakes/monitoring/|title=Earthquake Monitoring Switzerland |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swiss National Network (CHNet) consisting of both the Swiss Digital Seismic Network (SDSNet) and the Swiss Strong Motion Network (SSMNet), mainly using broadband seismometers to register weak local, moderate regional and moderate to strong global earthquakes as well as accelerometers to register moderate and strong local earthquakes.
* Special networks (often temporary) in order to monitor increased natural seismic activity, do aftershock deployments, monitor geothermal exploration, support research and educational projects (e.g. AlpArray and seismo@school), or industry projects by third-party assignment.

== Earthquake hazard in Switzerland ==
In comparison with other European countries Switzerland faces a medium seismic hazard, but there are regional differences: In Valais, Basel, the St. Gallen Rhine Valley, Mittelbünden, the Engadine, and Central Switzerland more earthquakes are registered than in other regions. However, earthquakes may occur anytime and anywhere in Switzerland. &lt;br&gt;
A strong earthquake with a magnitude of approximately 6 occurs every 50 to 100 years on average. The last time an earthquake of such magnitude was recorded was in 1946 near Sierre in Valais.&lt;br&gt;
The strongest earthquake in Switzerland so far had a magnitude of approximately 6.6 and destroyed large parts of the city of Basel in 1356. If such an earthquake were to occur in Basel today, several thousand fatalities, tens of thousands of seriously and slightly injured people, and property damage on the order of approximately CHF 140 billion could be expected.&lt;br&gt;
The best protection measures against the effects of an earthquake are an earthquake-resistant building design and securing objects that may topple. 90 percent of the buildings in Switzerland are not built to a seismic code, and it is not clear to what extent they could withstand a strong earthquake. Only few cantons have statutory regulations requiring adherence to construction standards for earthquake-resistant building.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/knowledge/seismic-hazard-switzerland/|title=Earthquake hazard and risk |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/knowledge/earthquake-country-switzerland/historical-earthquakes/basel-1356/|title=Scenario Earthquake Basel |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alert in case of an earthquake ==
Earthquakes can neither be predicted nor prevented. However, the SED records the ground tremors around the clock. Within approximately 90 seconds details about the time, location, magnitude, and possible effects of an earthquake are displayed on the website www.seismo.ethz.ch.&lt;br&gt;
The SED automatically reports any noticeable earthquakes to the authorities and the media. At the same time, this information is transmitted to the SED’s 24-hour on-call service via pager, e-mail, and SMS. This service is also available to the authorities and the media for further information about current earthquakes, and prepares background information that is published on the website.&lt;br&gt;
In case of earthquakes that cause major damage worldwide, the SED additionally informs the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit (SHA).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/earthquakes/alerting/|title=Warning |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and teaching ==
Besides earthquake monitoring and the assessment of seismic hazard, the researchers of the SED are involved in numerous national and international research projects, which are largely financed by third parties. This guarantees the permanent exchange of information across national borders. Fields in which the SED researchers are involved include, for example, glacial and engineering seismology, static seismology, induced seismic activity, as well as the monitoring of landslides and seismotectonics. The training of junior researchers also plays an important role for the SED. This is done with lectures and seminars that are integral parts of the teaching program at ETH, as well as through the supervision of master’s and doctoral theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/research-and-teaching/fields_of_research/|title=Research and Teaching |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear-test-ban treaty monitoring ==
In 1996, the UN countries decided to draft an agreement on the ban of nuclear tests. An international monitoring system was established to control the adherence to this agreement. The SED contributes by supplying the authority in charge in Vienna with data recorded by the seismic station in the Davos region, which was constructed for exactly this purpose. For example, the seismic station already recorded the corresponding ground shaking twelve minutes after the nuclear test in North Korea in 2013.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/earthquakes/monitoring/nuclear-test-ban-treaty-monitoring/|title=Nuclear-test-ban treaty monitoring |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exegesis ===
* Commandment 1
*: Simply put: Do not use the computer in ways that may harm other people.
*: Explanation: This commandment says that it is unethical to use a computer to harm another user. It is not limited to physical injury. It includes harming or corrupting other users' data or files. The commandment states that it is wrong to use a computer to steal someone's personal information. Manipulating or destroying files of other users is ethically wrong. It is unethical to write programs, which on execution lead to stealing, copying or gaining unauthorized access to other users' data. Being involved in practices like hacking, spamming, phishing or cyber bullying does not conform to computer ethics.
* Commandment 2
*: Simply put: Do not use computer technology to cause interference in other users' work.
*: Explanation: Computer software can be used in ways that disturb other users or disrupt their work. Viruses, for example, are programs meant to harm useful computer programs or interfere with the normal functioning of a computer. Malicious software can disrupt the functioning of computers in more ways than one. It may overload computer memory through excessive consumption of computer resources, thus slowing its functioning. It may cause a computer to function wrongly or even stop working. Using malicious software to attack a computer is unethical.
* Commandment 3
*: Simply put: Do not spy on another person's computer data.
*: Explanation: We know it is wrong to read someone's personal letters. On the same lines, it is wrong to read someone else's email messages or files. Obtaining data from another person's private files is nothing less than breaking into someone's room. Snooping around in another person's files or reading someone else's personal messages is the invasion of his privacy. There are exceptions to this. For example, spying is necessary and cannot be called unethical when it is done against illegitimate use of computers. For example, intelligence agencies working on cybercrime cases need to spy on the internet activity of suspects.
* Commandment 4
*: Simply put: Do not use computer technology to steal information.
*: Explanation: Stealing sensitive information or leaking confidential information is as good as robbery. It is wrong to acquire personal information of employees from an employee database or patient history from a hospital database or other such information that is meant to be confidential. Similarly, breaking into a bank account to collect information about the account or account holder is wrong. Illegal electronic transfer of funds is a type of fraud. With the use of technology, stealing of information is much easier. Computers can be used to store stolen information.
* Commandment 5
*: Simply put: Do not contribute to the spread of misinformation using computer technology.
*: Explanation: Spread of information has become viral today, because of the Internet. This also means that false news or rumors can spread speedily through social networking sites or emails. Being involved in the circulation of incorrect information is unethical. Mails and pop-ups are commonly used to spread the wrong information or give false alerts with the only intent of selling products. Mails from untrusted sources advertising certain products or spreading some hard-to-believe information, are not uncommon. Direct or indirect involvement in the circulation of false information is ethically wrong. Giving wrong information can hurt other parties or organizations that are affected by that particular theme.
* Commandment 6
*: Simply put: Refrain from copying software or buying pirated copies. Pay for software unless it is free.
*: Explanation: Like any other artistic or literary work, software is copyrighted. A piece of code is the original work of the individual who created it. It is copyrighted in his/her name. In case of a developer writing software for the organization she works for, the organization holds the copyright for it. Copyright holds true unless its creators announce it is not. Obtaining illegal copies of copyrighted software is unethical and also encourages others to make copies illegally.
* Commandment 7
*: Simply put: Do not use someone else's computer resources unless authorized to.
*: Explanation: Multi-user systems have user specific passwords. Breaking into some other user's password, thus intruding his/her private space is unethical. It is not ethical to hack passwords for gaining unauthorized access to a password-protected computer system. Accessing data that you are not authorized to access or gaining access to another user's computer without her permission is not ethical.
* Commandment 8
*: Simply put: It is wrong to claim ownership on a work which is the output of someone else's intellect.
*: Explanation: Programs developed by a software developer are her property. If he is working with an organization, they are the organization's property. Copying them and propagating them in one's own name is unethical. This applies to any creative work, program or design. Establishing ownership on a work which is not yours is ethically wrong. 
* Commandment 9
*: Simply put: Before developing a software, think about the social impact it can have.
*: Explanation: Looking at the social consequences that a program can have, describes a broader perspective of looking at technology. A computer software on release, reaches millions. Software like video games and animations or educational software can have a social impact on their users. When working on animation films or designing video games, for example, it is the programmer's responsibility to understand his target audience/users and the effect it may have on them. For example, a computer game for kids should not have content that can influence them negatively. Similarly, writing malicious software is ethically wrong. A software developer/development firm should consider the influence their code can have on the society at large.
* Commandment 10
*: Simply put: In using computers for communication, be respectful and courteous with the fellow members.
*: Explanation: The communication etiquette we follow in the real world applies to communication over computers as well. While communicating over the Internet, one should treat others with respect. One should not intrude others' private space, use abusive language, make false statements or pass irresponsible remarks about others. One should be courteous while communicating over the web and should respect others' time and resources. Also, one should be considerate with a novice computer user.

'''VisAD''' is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Component-based software engineering|component library]] for interactive and collaborative [[Scientific visualization|visualization]] and analysis of numerical data. It combines a flexible [[data model]] and [[distributed object]]s (via Java RMI) to support sharing of data, visualizations and user interfaces between different data sources, different computers and different scientific disciplines. It is licensed under the GNU LGPL.&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.google.com/site/whibbard/history&lt;/ref&gt;

VisAD is the basis of the [[IDV|Integrated Data Viewer]], [[McIDAS|McIDAS V]] and other systems.
