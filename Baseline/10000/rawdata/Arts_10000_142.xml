'''''A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful''''' is a 1757 treatise on [[aesthetics]] written by [[Edmund Burke]]. It was the first complete philosophical exposition for separating the beautiful and the sublime into their own respective rational categories. It attracted the attention of prominent thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].

==Summary==

According to Burke, ''the [[Beauty|Beautiful]]'' is that which is well-formed and aesthetically pleasing, whereas ''the [[Sublime (philosophy)|Sublime]]'' is that which has the power to compel and destroy us. The preference for the Sublime over the Beautiful was to mark the transition from the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era.

The origins of our ideas of the beautiful and the sublime, for Burke, can be understood by means of their [[Four causes|causal structures]]. According to [[Aristotelian physics]] and [[metaphysics]], causation can be divided into formal, material, efficient and final causes. The formal cause of beauty is the passion of love; the material cause concerns aspects of certain objects such as smallness, smoothness, delicacy, etc.; the efficient cause is the calming of our nerves; the final cause is God's providence. What is most peculiar and original to Burke's view of beauty is that it cannot be understood by the traditional bases of beauty: proportion, fitness, or perfection. The sublime also has a causal structure that is unlike that of beauty. Its formal cause is thus the passion of fear (especially the fear of death); the material cause is equally aspects of certain objects such as vastness, infinity, magnificence, etc.; its efficient cause is the tension of our nerves; the final cause is God having created and battled Satan, as expressed in [[John Milton]]'s great epic ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.

==Kant's comments==
[[Immanuel Kant]] critiqued Burke for not understanding the causes of the mental effects that occur in the experience of the beautiful or the sublime. According to Kant, Burke merely gathered data so that some future thinker could explain them. 
:"To make psychological observations, as Burke did in his treatise on the beautiful and the sublime, thus to assemble material for the systematic connection of empirical rules in the future without aiming to understand them, is probably the sole true duty of empirical psychology, which can hardly even aspire to rank as a philosophical science." - Immanuel Kant, First Introduction to the [[Critique of Judgment]], X.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kant, Immanuel]], ''First Introduction to the Critique of Judgment'', Library of Liberal Arts, 146, Bobbs-Merril Co., 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''A Symphony of Three Orchestras'' has a duration of roughly 17 minutes and is composed in a single [[Movement (music)|movement]].

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra divided into three ensembles.  The first ensemble comprises three [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], and [[String section|strings]] ([[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, and [[Double bass|basses]]).  The second ensemble comprises two [[clarinet]]s (doubling [[bass clarinet]]), [[E-flat clarinet]], percussion, and strings (violins, cellos, and basses).  The third ensemble comprises two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[piccolo]], two [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], two horns, percussion, and strings (violins, violas, and basses).&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
The composition has been praised by musicians and critics alike.  The cellist [[Fred Sherry]] (who performed the first recording of Carter's [[Cello Concerto (Carter)|Cello Concerto]]) described ''A Symphony of Three Orchestras'' as one of three Carter pieces he would "recommend to every music lover," including his [[Concerto for Orchestra (Carter)|Concerto for Orchestra]] and ''[[Symphonia: sum fluxae pretium spei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huizenga |first=Tom |title=Musicians Remember Elliott Carter |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=December 11, 2012 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2012/12/07/166761348/musicians-remember-elliott-carter |accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The music critic [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "It makes its strongest impression in concert, where one may listen to each ensemble playing its own allotted music, then combining with the other ensembles to create a cumulative whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Page |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Page (music critic) |title=American Composers: Elliott Carter—He Put Motion Into His Movements |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 9, 1998  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/music/features/carter0809.htm |accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Pope Jr.''' (March 25, 1849 –  September 1924) was an American artist, both in paint and wood carving, mostly of sporting and [[still life]] subjects.  He was born in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]] and died in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He studied for a short time under the sculptor [[William Copley (artist)|William Copley]], and was one of America's popular gaming artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=753|title=Dorchester Atheneum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, he carved and sketched animals around his home in Massachusetts. In the 1860s, he worked for his family’s lumber business. Pope studied carving, painting, perspective, and anatomy with [[William Rimmer]], an important romantic-baroque sculptor, painter, and influential teacher of many Boston artists. He published two sets of [[chromolithograph]] versions of his [[watercolor]] paintings: ''Upland Game Birds and Water Fowl of the United States'' (1878), and ''Celebrated Dogs of America'' (1882).

From 1879 to 1883, Pope created many well-received carvings of game; [[Czar Alexander III]] of Russia acquired two of the carvings. Pope became a member of the [[Copley Society of Art]] of Boston after its founding in 1879. In 1893, Pope began painting animal portraits and, later, pursued a career as a portrait painter. He also painted [[trompe l’oeil]] works.

Pope’s work is in many private collections and museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the White House, the [[Brooklyn Museum]], the [[De Young Museum|M.H. De Young Memorial Museum]] and the [[National Museum of Wildlife Art]].

== History ==
Founded in January 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://05.performa-arts.org/venues/art-production-fund PERFORMA05: ART PRODUCTION FUND] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006095219/http://05.performa-arts.org/venues/art-production-fund |date=October 6, 2008 }}. 05.performa-arts.org. Retrieved on 2009-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt; APF developed out of recognition that many ambitious art projects require innovative production strategies because they have few precedents and demand new approaches – they involve the collaboration of several disciplines, exceed the size or scale of traditional art installations, and engage the general public in a unique way.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://ifitshipitshere.wordpress.com/2007/11/24/be-hip-green-merry-simultaneously-wows-vinyl-artist-christmas-tree-2/ Be Hip, Green &amp; Merry Simultaneously: WOW’s Vinyl Artist Christmas Tree « if it’s hip, it’s here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718100544/http://ifitshipitshere.wordpress.com/2007/11/24/be-hip-green-merry-simultaneously-wows-vinyl-artist-christmas-tree-2/ |date=July 18, 2011 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">'''Art fabrication''' is a process or service relating to the production of large or technically difficult artworks.

When a lone artist or designer is incapable or chooses not to realize the creation of his or her own design or conception, he or she may enlist the assistance of an art fabrication studio.  Typically, an art fabrication studio has access to the resources, specialized machinery, and labor necessary to execute particularly complex projects.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Notable art fabricators==

Lippincott, Inc., founded in 1966 by Donald Lippincott and Roxanne Everett, was the first company to devote itself exclusively to art fabrication using industrial techniques. The company encouraged a collaborative relationship between artists and the fabrication crew, allowing the creation of work using media that artists had not previously used. Lippincott, Inc. fabricated work for almost 100 artists, including [[Barnett Newman]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Indiana]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

''Artistic freedom'' should not be confused to the ''freedom of art'' (e.g. ''[[:de:Kunstfreiheit|Kunstfreiheit]]'' in Germanic countries), where it is a constitutional provision to prevent political [[censorship]].&lt;ref name="Barendt2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Barendt|title=Academic Freedom and the Law: A Comparative Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBLcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=19 November 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-84731-610-3|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barendt2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Barendt|title=Freedom of Speech|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnRCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR6-IA30|date=11 August 2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102174-9|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A related colloquial term is ''[[artistic license]]'', the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of grammar or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an artist for artistic effect.&lt;ref name="Peacock1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry W.

==Studies==
In 2012-2013, the [[United Nations]] carried out a comprehensive study on artistic freedom.{{Update inline|date=January 2014}} Based on a background report produced in June-July 2012, as well as an experts meeting and an open consultation in Geneva in December 2012, the UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights Ms. [[Farida Shaheed]] submitted her final report to the UN Human Rights Council in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/755488?ln=en|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur in the Field of Cultural Rights, Farida Shaheed : the right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity|last=Shaheed|first=Farida|date=14 March 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Danish free speech advocacy group Freemuse released their annual  report ''Art Under Threat'' about the state of artistic freedom in 2016 which showed a 119 percent increase in attacks and censorship  from 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/story/artistic-freedom-under-threat|title=Artistic Freedom Under Threat {{!}} USC Center on Public Diplomacy|website=uscpublicdiplomacy.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music industry was the main target of serious violations, and second to film in overall violations, including non-violent censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iq-mag.net/2017/02/artistic-freedom-threat-2016-freemuse/|title=Artistic freedom under attack in 2016 {{!}} IQ Magazine|date=2017-02-08|work=IQ Magazine|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most serious violations included the murder of Pakistani Qawwali singer [[Amjad Sabri]] and the killing of Burundi musician [[Pascal Treasury Nshimirimana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.factmag.com/2017/03/19/art-under-threat/|title=Art Under Threat: The bleak reality of growing attacks on freedom of expression|date=2017-03-19|work=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashley's Sack''' is a mid-1800s cloth seed or feed sack featuring an embroidered text that recounts the [[Slavery in the United States|slave sale]] of a nine-year-old girl named Ashley and the parting gift of the sack by her mother, Rose. The sack is on display at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington D.C. Rose filled the sack with a dress, braid of her hair, pecans, and "my love always." The gift was likely passed down to Ashley's granddaughter, Ruth (Jones) Middleton, who embroidered their story on to the sack in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/artifacts-that-will-send-a-chill-down-your-spine/|title=Artifacts that will send a chill down your spine|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalscene.com/archives/filled-with-my-love-slave-artifact-to-be-displayed-in/article_788d9120-6024-5536-aa6a-c3e569a21558.html|title='Filled with my love' Slave artifact to be displayed in new Smithsonian museum|last=Cantu|first=Leslie|newspaper=Journal Scene|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley's Sack was given to [[Middleton Place]], in [[Dorchester County, South Carolina|Dorchester]] County, [[South Carolina]], one of the nation's preeminent slavery-era plantation sites, in the mid-2000s. While still owned by Middleton Place, the sack is on long-term loan to the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington D.C. According to Tracey Todd, vice president of the Middleton Place Foundation, the sack is a rare material artifact from [[Slavery in the United States|a period in United States history when human slavery was legal]] and families suffered extraordinary losses; the sack typifies the strength and endurance of inter-generational love. "The sack allows us to relate to the enslaved people and feel the same pain today — if you have lost a child or been separated from a parent — that Rose and Ashley felt," said Todd. "Ashley's Sack is a portal to understanding more about our shared history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/national/article103549677.html|title=This scrap of cloth is one of the saddest artifacts at new DC museum|newspaper=kansascity|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://savannahnow.com/column-accent/2016-01-28/looking-pearls-ashleys-sack-davenport-dolls-give-insight-lives-slaves|title=Looking for Pearls: Ashley's Sack, Davenport dolls give insight into lives of slaves|newspaper=savannahnow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ashley's Sack was purchased for $20 at a flea market in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the early 2000s. Alarmed by the embroidered story of a slave sale separating a mother and her daughter, the woman who purchased the sack did an internet search for "slavery" and "Middleton" and then gifted the sack to Middleton Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/a-stitch-in-time-cwu-professor-tracks-history-of-embroidered/article_9f2d8aba-c298-11e6-8653-f7f4a912b32a.html|title=A stitch in time: CWU professor tracks history of embroidered seed sack to people held in slavery on South Carolina plantation|last=tayer@yakimaherald.com|first=Tammy Ayer|newspaper=Yakima Herald-Republic|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On display from 2009-2013 at Middleton Place, the emotionally-charged artifact evoked human suffering and endurance. During this period, the identities of Rose, Ashley, and Ruth were unknown. It was viewed by thousands of museum visitors, including [[Central Washington University]] sociocultural anthropologist and museum studies professor Mark Auslander, who has since traced the history of the sack to identify Ashley, her mother Rose, and the author of the needlepoint, Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/a-stitch-in-time-cwu-professor-tracks-history-of-embroidered/article_9f2d8aba-c298-11e6-8653-f7f4a912b32a.html|title=A stitch in time: CWU professor tracks history of embroidered seed sack to people held in slavery on South Carolina plantation|last=tayer@yakimaherald.com|first=Tammy Ayer|newspaper=Yakima Herald-Republic|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwu.edu/anthropology/story-behind-smithsonian-%E2%80%9Cashley%E2%80%99s-sack-uncovered-cwu-professor|title=Anthropology and Museum Studies {{!}} Story Behind Smithsonian "Ashley's Sack" Uncovered by CWU Professor|website=www.cwu.edu|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the research article he published in 2016, Auslander uses census reports, wills, newspaper announcements of court-degrees, and inventory records to reconstruct their history. The historical chains of remaining evidence suggest that Ashley and her mother Rose were owned by a wealthy Charleston merchant and planter, Robert Martin (c. 1790–1852), who was worth over $300,000 at his death in December 1852. After his death, evidence suggests Ashley was sold away from her mother in order to raise money for his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/record-wednesday-dec-21-full-show|title=The Record: Wednesday, Dec 21, Full Show|last=Staff|first=KUOW|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auslander's archival work retraces the life of Ruth. He posits Ruth Middleton was born Ruth Jones in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], South Carolina around 1903. Her parents, Austin and Rosa Jones, were servants at the [[University of South Carolina]]. Ruth made her way to [[Philadelphia]], Penn. and married Arthur Middleton, who was born around 1899 and also from South Carolina. However, Ruth and her husband are never listed as having lived together. She had a daughter, Dorothy Helen, born in Philadelphia in 1919. In 1921, when Ashley's Sack was embroidered, Ruth would have been a single mother to a young daughter. Newspaper reports and census records suggest that throughout her life Ruth worked in affluent households in Philadelphia. By 1928, she was well-known in Philadelphia's African American [[High society (social class)|high society]], gaining regular mention in the "Smart Set" and "High Society" pages of the [[Philadelphia Tribune]], the leading African American newspaper. Auslander writes that Ruth "host[ed] bridge and cocktail parties and [wore] elegant couture." Her daughter, Dorothy Helen was also known for her fashion-sense and authored several "Smart Set" columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth died in January 1942 of tuberculosis. Dorothy Helen died in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The sack is a rare, important material artifact in African American history. The sack exemplifies the coming together of traditional oral and written history. [[Heather Andrea Williams]][http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v60/n33/heatherandreawilliams.html] describes the sack in the epilogue of her book ''Help Me To Find My People'' as a testimony to inter-generational loss and survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/books/review/help-me-to-find-my-people-by-heather-andrea-williams.html|title='Help Me to Find My People,' by Heather Andrea Williams|last=Perry|first=Imani|date=2012-06-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mark Auslander emphasizes the importance of the sack, and the historical reconstruction of the lives of Ashley, Rose, and Ruth, as a conduit to understanding the endurance of family lineal memory "in the face of terrible fragmentation of family solidarity caused by the domestic slave trade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is an emotional object," said Mary Elliot, museum specialist with the Smithsonian, who worked on the Slavery and Freedom exhibit at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] under curator Nancy Bercaw. "This piece is very important to telling that human story," Elliot said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalscene.com/archives/filled-with-my-love-slave-artifact-to-be-displayed-in/article_788d9120-6024-5536-aa6a-c3e569a21558.html|title='Filled with my love' Slave artifact to be displayed in new Smithsonian museum|last=Cantu|first=Leslie|newspaper=Journal Scene|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">'''Design controls''' designates the application of a formal [[Design management|methodology]] to the conduct of [[new product development|product development]] activities.
It is often mandatory (by regulation) to implement such practice when designing and developing products within regulated industries (e.g. [[medical devices]]).

== Medical devices ==

Since 1990, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has required that [[medical device]] manufacturers that want to market certain categories of medical devices in the USA follow Design Control requirements (21 CFR 820.30). At a high level, this regulation requires:
* [[Design and development planning]]
* [[Design input]], including intended use and [[Voice of the customer|user needs]] (also known as customer attributes)
* [[Design output]], including evaluation of conformance to design input requirements through:
** Design verification confirming that the design output meets the design input requirements ("did we design the device right?")
** Design validation ensuring that the devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses ("did we design the right device?")
* [[Design review]]
* [[Design transfer]] ensuring that the device design is correctly translated into production specifications
* [[Design change|Design changes]]
* [[Design history file]], a demonstration that the design was developed according to the approved design plan and 21 CFR 820.30.

The [[Medical Devices Directive]] (MDD 93/42/EEC) similarly lists several requirements regarding the design of a medical device.
'''[[ISO 13485]]''' is a voluntary standard that contains section 7.3 Design and Development recommending which procedures should be put in place by manufacturers in order to have a quality system that will comply with MDD 93/42/EEC.

The objective of Design Controls, in this context, is to require that manufacturers follow a methodologically-sound process to develop a medical device, with the intent of improving the probability that the device will reach an acceptable level of [[efficacy]] and safety.

'''''Eight Days of Luke''''' is a children's fantasy novel written by [[Diana Wynne Jones]] published in 1975.  It tells the tale of a neglected English boy who encounters what prove to be figures from [[Norse mythology]].

==Plot summary==

===Sunday===
David Allard, an orphan, returns to his hometown of Ashbury from boarding school to discover that his relatives-cum-guardians have nothing arranged for his summer and he will have to endure their mistreatment for his entire holiday.

While walking in the garden, in a fit of frustration he makes up words to use as a curse.  David's words seem to cause the garden wall to crumble, and to release a boy a year or so older than himself with flame-red hair, who identifies himself as Luke. Happy to have made a new friend, David notices Luke's odd references to being released from his "chains" and "bowls of venom".  The two hastily repair the wall, and David notices that Luke's touch seems to burn the bushes growing beside the wall. Luke says ruefully that he "can't bring the dead back to life." Luke also tells David that simply kindling a flame will summon him.

===Monday===
When David and his young cousin-by-marriage, Astrid (who seems the best of the awful relatives) are on a shopping expedition the next day, Luke duly appears when David lights a match.  Luke ingratiates himself with Astrid, and when a bored David suggests it would be great if the building across from them caught on fire, the building suddenly does.  People are trapped.  It is only when David tells Luke that he wants the fire out, and reminds Luke that he cannot bring the dead back to life, that the fire dies down.

That evening, David escapes punishment because his uncle is upset that his gardener has found another job over at Thunderly Hill. David notices more odd things about Luke; he can entertain his friend with fiery doodles.  Also, when Luke is asleep, he seems ageless, and heals uncommonly quickly.

===Tuesday===
In the morning, the new gardener Mr. Chew arrives.  He is very interested in David, and in the place where Luke's release took place.  Luke, who has slept over, seems afraid of Chew, castigating himself for his carelessness in scorching the plants. David helps Luke escape the house without Chew noticing, and they play [[cricket]] (David's obsession) down the street, where they meet a new friend, Alan. David is unable to escape the house in the afternoon, due to Chew's vigilance.  David is sent again to his room without supper, though Astrid secretly brings him food.

===Wednesday===
The next morning, a well-dressed man named Mr. Wedding arrives and persuades David's relations to let him take David out for lunch in a car chauffeured by a beautiful lady. He quickly gains David's trust, and David gladly tells him all the things about school he could not tell his relatives. They arrive at a green island, linked to the mainland by a long arching bridge with a rainbow-like effect.  While David is served a wonderful lunch, Mr. Wedding begins interrogating David about Luke, and David admits only to releasing Luke while trying to curse.  David notices for the first time that Wedding is missing an eye.

Wedding tells David that Luke was imprisoned for doing something terrible.  He tries frightening David, threatening to keep him captive, promising him a bribe, even shaming him.  None of this is successful – David will not betray Luke – and eventually Mr. Wedding returns David home, seeming to admire David for his stubbornness.  But first he makes a deal with David: if David can keep Luke free until Sunday, then Luke is safe for good.

Mr. Wedding sets a talking raven to watch David, but he is able to evade the bird and summon Luke.  He tells Luke about the deal, who is confident that they will win against Mr. Wedding.

===Thursday===
The next day, David is blocked from leaving the house by two ravens – until he distracts them with a joint of meat while he drives off with Astrid.  Luke appears when David strikes a match for Astrid's cigarette, and is suddenly caught by a fair, strong ginger-haired individual. However, after Luke is questioned by the fellow, he is released.  It seems the individual, who seems very nice, has lost something.  Luke denies any knowledge.  David and Luke agree that the best course is for Luke to simply vanish until Monday.

===Friday===
But the next day, the Frys from down the street show up, followed shortly by Mr. Chew and Mr Wedding.  When a confused Astrid needs a cigarette lit, the inevitable happens – Luke appears and is caught by the group.  They begin shouting demands at Luke; Luke denies everything, and David defends him, saying Luke did not act out of revenge, but as a favour for someone now dead.  Luke admits that he did help someone hide something so it might never be found.  The crowd is grudgingly convinced that this is true, and Mr. Wedding strikes a new deal with David: since David has no idea what he is looking for, it is possible for him to find it (according to the rules of the charm Luke laid down). If David restores what the ginger-haired fellow lost by Sunday, Luke will remain free, otherwise he will be sent back to prison.

Astrid has figured out the puzzle, but Luke warns her not to tell David.  David convinces one of the ravens to lead them to a house on Wednesday Hill, where David should find "three Knowing Ones under the tree."  It is Alan's house, and through a secret door, David and Alan find a huge tree, with three blind crones, sharing an eye among them, washing, spinning, and cutting wool at a well.  They refuse to talk until David captures their eye – then they tell David to go to the place (Wallsey) where Mr. Wedding took him and ask the man with the dragon where to look.

===Saturday through Sunday===
The next day, Astrid drives David, Alan, and her husband, Cousin Ronald, to Wallsey, which appears very different from when David saw it with Mr. Wedding.  David searches the hall, which is filled with strong young men cheating pinball machines, until he finds what he was told to look for—a man with a dragon tattoo.

By the rules, the three must run a gauntlet before having their questions answered, which the boys do courageously and Ronald does in a cowardly fashion.  The dragon man admits to taking the item they sought as revenge, on behalf of a woman who blamed Mr. Wedding for something that happened.  The woman can be found on Thunderly Hill, where a hospital is now built.

David, Luke, Astrid, Ronald, and the ginger-haired fellow all proceed to Thunderly Hill, on the excuse that Ronald's minor injuries should be treated. When David and Luke step inside "Firestone Ward", they find themselves on a grassy hillside that burns but is never consumed. Luke admits that he set the fire, long ago, and it will burn until the end of time.  David braves the flames (with Luke doing his best to suppress the fire) and discovers a [[cairn]], on which a hauntingly beautiful lady in armour lies, not quite dead, but barely breathing.  Across her chest rests a stone implement with a too-short handle.  When David realises it is a hammer, suddenly everything falls into place and he realises who everyone really is.  He returns to Luke, and is told that an entire day has passed – David has been outside time.  He restores the hammer to the ginger-haired fellow, who is of course [[Thor]].  Mr. Wedding is [[Woden]], chief of the gods.  The dragon man is [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], and the lady [[Brynhildr|Brunhilda]].

Astrid reveals that (no doubt with divine interference) David's other relatives have been exposed as financial frauds, and have fled.  Astrid will now be David's guardian.  Luke will be around – but at the final battle yet to come, he and Mr. Wedding will be on opposite sides.

==Allusions==
An afterword gives a full explanation of the Norse references on which the story is based.  Luke is [[Loki]], the Norse god of luck and fire. The other gods show up on the day they give their names to in the week:

*Tuesday – One-armed war god [[Týr|Tiu]] in the guise of the gruff gardener Mr. Chew.
*Wednesday – [[Odin]], chief of the gods, appearing as well-dressed Mr. Wedding.
*Thursday – [[Thor]], Norse god of thunder.
*Friday – Fertility gods [[Freyja]] and [[Freyr]] disguised as the boisterous Mr. and Mrs. Fry.

David encountered the [[Norns]] under the great tree [[Yggdrasil]], and travelled to [[Valhalla]] (afterlife for heroes on Wallsey island) with Woden and one of his [[Valkyrie]]s.

==Reception and reviews==
Science fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]], reviewing several Diana Wynne Jones reissues in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', wrote
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Eight Days of Luke'' takes us into the world of the Nordic gods, as both sides in the intensely amoral struggle prepare for [[Götterdämmerung]]. Yet she manages to connect their quarrels and manoeuvres with contemporary life, including giving Thor a leather-jacket gang in a pinball arcade and putting one-eyed Wutan in a business suit. And our hero's passage from "real" to fantasy world and back again is as smooth as in the best of contemporary fantasists – [[Charles de Lint]], for instance, or [[Megan Lindholm]], or [[Lisa Goldstein]]. Yet ''Eight Days of Luke'' bears a 1975 copyright, predating these others by years. (Indeed, I wonder how many of our contemporary fantasists might not have been exposed to Jones in their youth. How strong is her influence? Or is she simply weaving her own thread into the fabric of contemporary myth?)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote "Loosely based on Norse mythology, this story is a smooth blend of myth and reality, a task that Jones ( A Tale of Time City ) performs with ease and assurance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-688-08006-8 | website=Publishers Weekly |title=Eight Days of Luke |publisher=PWxyz LLC |accessdate=10 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasy writer [[Neil Gaiman]], asked whether his 2000 novel ''[[American Gods]]'' was inspired by ''Eight Days of Luke'', responded "Not exactly, although they bear an odd relationship, like second cousins once removed or something."  After coming up with an idea for a story linking Norse gods and the days of the week, he realised "gloomily that I'd managed, working back from first principles, to come up with a wonderful structure for a story – but one that Diana had already used... and, with regret, I abandoned it. Or almost. I kept Mr Wednesday, and the day of his meeting, in the back of my head."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== History ==
Vladislav Golunov and Rich Taylor became online friends in 2001 when Golunov contacted Taylor after he had seen a photo-manipulated image&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/daschle.asp|title=Tom Daschle Pledge of Allegiance|publisher=Snopes.com| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Taylor had created under the pseudonym Internet screenname "Registered". Golunov had an existing website that posted humorous images with the visitor being able to leave comments or share the images via email. Taylor's news based parody&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/kerry2.asp|title=Does a photograph show Senator John Kerry and Jane Fonda sharing a speaker's platform at an anti-war rally?|publisher=Snopes.com| date=2004-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satire images&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/daschle.asp|title=Tom Daschle Pledge of Allegiance|publisher=Snopes.com| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been circulated and often thought to be real&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/flagpatch.html|title=Soldier Wears "Doing The Work Of..." Patch on His Uniform?|publisher=BreakTheChain.org| date=2004-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Internet users that had received them, primarily via email or posted in online forums. During one subsequent conversation, Taylor mentioned to Golunov that he wished there existed a community of Photoshoppers that would create, or "chop" images based on current news stories. Following this discussion, Golunov registered the domain and called the site "FreakingNews", as a mockery of "breaking news". Golunov bought the edited code for Photoshop contests from [[Worth1000]]—by then an already established [[Photoshop contest]] site. Apart from the custom code, [[Worth1000]] played a major role in launching FreakingNews by promoting it to its member artists.

In April 2017, Golunov handed over the site to a new owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction -FreakingNews forum thread|url=http://www.freakingnews.com/stories/thread5.asp?cid=5&amp;eid=144889|publisher=freakingnews.com|accessdate=2017-08-20|date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37644">[[File:Skulptur Grieser Platz (Schmarg) Europa macht Handstand III.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of the long-time chairman of the ''FBK'' Ernst Leonhardt]]
The '''Freie Berliner Kunstausstellung''' ('''FBK'''), the “Free Berlin Art Exhibition” in [[Berlin|Berlin (Germany)]], was “unique in its structure”.&lt;ref name="leonhardt_05" /&gt; For 24 years, from 1971 to 1995, it was the only non-juried art exhibition of its size in Europe. It opened after the ''Große Berliner Kunstausstellung'', the “Grand Berlin Art Exhibition”, a juried art exhibition, had closed its doors. Supported by the [[Senate of Berlin]], an association, called the ''Freie Berliner Kunstausstellung'' was registered in 1970 with the goal to organize annual exhibitions.&lt;ref name="veranstalter" /&gt; Hans-Joachim Zeidler became chairperson of this association for the first four years, followed by [[Ernst Leonhardt (Artist)]]. During the association's last four years, Karin Rech&lt;ref name="vorstand" /&gt; took over the leadership.

== History ==
[[File:Messe berlin II (441067608).jpg|thumb|Exhibition halls at the [[Funkturm Berlin]]]]
The first ''FBK'' took place in the exhibition halls at the [[Funkturm Berlin]] in 1971. At that time, the so-called [[Counterculture of the 1960s]] movement was already in full swing. The unrest of this period had inspired many social groups, and artists as well were “woken up”, as Zeidler reported in his review in 1983.&lt;ref name="zeidler-01" /&gt;  Already at its beginning, the ''FBK'' was able to “look back on a Berlin tradition that was dating back to the [[Weimar Republic]].”&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung" /&gt; However, early evidence of non-juried art exhibitions points to the 19th century. A poster collection at the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] contains a poster by [[Ludwig von Hofmann]]. The draft of this poster – which he had originally designed in 1893 for the first ''Große Berliner Kunstausstellung'' – was rejected. The portrayal of a “sparsely clad young man was apparently seen as an offense and was removed by the Berlin police, according to contemporary reports.”&lt;ref name="fbk_1893" /&gt; As some artists had been rejected by the jury of the ''Große Berliner Kunstausstellung'', a second exhibition, which had called itself ''FBK'', was organized, running concurrently with the ''Große Berliner Kunstausstellung''. Its location was close by, across the road at the [[Moltke Bridge]]. It accepted Ludwig von Hofmann's poster. [[Käthe Kollwitz]], who was still an unknown artist at that time, exhibited in 1895 in the ''FBK''&lt;ref name="kollwitz" /&gt; which had always been seen as an alternative to the juried art exhibitions.

In addition to these early historical roots, the ''Non-Juried Art Exhibition'' featured a direct predecessor in 1965, as mentioned in the archives of the ''Association of Female Artists of Berlin''.&lt;ref name="berliner_kuenstlerinnen" /&gt; After the ''FBK'' had presented its first exhibition in 1971, it took 12 years for an acting mayor of Berlin to officially comment on the exhibition.&lt;ref name="leonhardt-02" /&gt; Such comments had been anticipated for years. In 1983 [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] was the first mayor who was willing to write words of acknowledgement.&lt;ref name="weizsaecker_2" /&gt; Since then greetings from the acting mayor of Berlin became a tradition.

{{Quote
 | text=The Freie Berliner Kunstausstellung has established itself in the cultural life of Berlin and beyond. It has long embodied a piece of [[Zeitgeist]], changeable, full of surprises, appreciated or criticized, always alive. The 13th Freie Berliner Kunstausstellung will also spark discussions, raise questions and leave them unanswered, letting what is transitory and what is permanent come into contact. Berlin can not and should not do without an exhibition of this kind. I hope that it will generate the same lively interest which a receptive audience full of dedication and contradiction also devoted to its predecessors.

}}

For the first time in 1990, after what was called [[Die Wende]] – after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] but before [[German reunification]] – [[Walter Momper]], mayor of Berlin at that time, congratulated the FBK, hoping for “satisfied artists and many interested visitors from East and West”.&lt;ref name="momper" /&gt; In 1991 the time had come to announce: “The 21st FBK is finally a free exhibition for all artists of Berlin.”&lt;ref name="rech" /&gt;

From the very beginning, the “fiercely controversial but hotly loved”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; FBK faced criticism, sometimes there was even harsh rejection. The critics turned against the concept of a non-juried exhibition, as well as the inclusion of anyone who wanted to exhibit. This allowed “young, unknown, perhaps also ‘not so good’ artists, such as hobby artists, to participate.” Many rejected this concept. Leonhardt pointed out the “charm of the FBK” and stressed that for some it was “a spring-board to a great career”.&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; For Nicole Bröhan, the “always controversial mixture of professional and amateur artists […] created its special appeal”.&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung" /&gt; In 1994 she wrote in the [[Berliner Zeitung]]&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung" /&gt; that she saw the FBK as “talent forging”. Despite all the positive reports, the FBK's continued existence was always at risk. “What a triumph! The FBK, which is dead at least once every year, will turn 25. Who would have thought?”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; With these words, Ernst Leonhardt, meanwhile honorary chairman of the association, began his review at the FBK's 25th anniversary. He could not know at that time that, due to the financial situation, it would be the last opening of the FBK. For that exhibition to take place at all, there was an “art auction during which 1,000 works donated by Berlin artists were auctioned off” – “in order to support the exhibition”.&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung_2" /&gt;

Unlike the usual concepts of exhibitions, the goal of the FBK was for the artists themselves, not [[Art dealer|professional gallery owners]] or [[curators]], to take over management and organization of the exhibition, as well as the hanging of the art works. A jury did not exist. Organizer of the exhibitions was the registered association of the FBK. The management of the exhibitions was led by the respective chairperson of the association, while the organizational aspects were handled by a group of seven members. The preparation and execution of the exhibitions was coordinated by the "Colleagues of the Management".&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; As a rule, the FBK took place in the second quarter of each year. Around Christmas the year before, registration forms were sent to the artists.

Two divisions were set up, a ''Free Division'' and a division for groups. The former consisted of professional artists only, the latter of non-professional artists who joined as groups. Among the many exhibiting artist groups were diverse artist associations, as well as students from the [[Berlin University of the Arts]], which regularly exhibited as a large group of their own.

The usually not conflict-free process of hanging the art work was organized based on its own concept. A “Hanging Commission” was set up for the ''Free Division''. It was the commission's responsibility to find a suitable place for about 1,200 works of art within three days.&lt;ref name="leonhardt_01" /&gt; The groups were each assigned a location appropriate to their size in which they arranged the hanging themselves.

Two-thirds of the exhibitors were professional artists, one third ‘hobby artists’.&lt;ref name="roloff-momin_1" /&gt; At the 20th anniversary of the exhibition, the chairman expressed satisfaction that the ''Free Division'' and the groups were now “finally equal” in the allocation of space.&lt;ref name="leonhardt_03" /&gt; Among the celebrities of the exhibitors were Louise Rösler, [[Walter Stöhrer]], Fred Thieler and Jürgen Draeger. The latter presented on his website several cover pages of the catalogs.&lt;ref name="draeger" /&gt; While for almost 20 years male artists were overrepresented, the gender distribution was balanced for the first time in 1990 – “without any quotation”, as Walter Momper acknowledged in his greeting.&lt;ref name="momper" /&gt; In 1991 about 300 artists from the Eastern part of Berlin took part for the first time.

Despite financial difficulties, the FBK provided a catalog for all the exhibitions. These catalogs were printed on high-quality paper with support from the Berlin printing company ''Ruksal''. From 1987 on, the catalogs were supplemented by a hall plan which made it easier to find the artists in the ''Free Division'' as well as in the groups.

== Exhibition ==
For four weeks each year, between April and June, the FBK organizers opened the doors of the exhibition halls at the [[Funkturm Berlin]] and invited the public. “Drawings, pictures, spatial as well as sound and video installations, sculptures, collages, photography” were presented.&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung_2" /&gt; In addition to depressive performances,&lt;ref name="performance" /&gt; there were also humorous inventions, such as a ''potency automat ''(1986)&lt;ref name="morgenpost_2" /&gt; or an ''art licensing machine''(1989).&lt;ref name="kunstberechtigungsautomat" /&gt; Over the years, not only the exhibition itself, but also the accompanying program developed. Prints and small sculptures were sold in a bazaar. On Saturdays there were guided tours. A traditional breakfast with jazz music and discussions enjoyed increasing popularity. A ''Kinderatelier'' (children's art room) was open daily where children, guided by artists, could paint. While the program changed at times, there were special readings by women, or “music played on historical instruments”.&lt;ref name="begleitprogramm" /&gt; The exhibition management was also interested in the outer appearance of the exhibition halls. A proposal for a ''flag project'' was repeatedly turned down by the Senate. Eventually the artists financed the project at their own expense. In 1989 “the visitors of the 19th FBK were greeted at the entrance to the exhibition halls by 70 colourful flags [...], which had never been shown before”.&lt;ref name="fahnenprojekt" /&gt; In 1991, as in previous years, a “graphic competition for students of the [[Berlin University of the Arts]]” was organized.&lt;ref name="rech" /&gt; In 1992, the project began with picture panels, 30 large-format paintings on the outside of the exhibition halls, designed to “catch the eye”.&lt;ref name="berliner_zeitung_2" /&gt; For the first time in 1993, art discussions were held in which artists and visitors alike participated. They took place every day, with the aim to encourage “thinking with one's eyes”.&lt;ref name="rech_2" /&gt; A five-minute-long video, published on YouTube on October 5, 2010, highlights events of the 19th FBK. It provides an impression of the atmosphere typical of the  exhibitions.&lt;ref name="kunstberechtigungsautomat" /&gt;

== Media ==
The media-echo was slow in coming. In 1983 – twelve years after the FBK's opening – Leonhardt still expressed hope “that the media would finally provide stronger support to this exhibition”.&lt;ref name="leonhardt-02" /&gt; In 1990 he was able to report that “the acceptance we have recently received from the media was positive and seems to continue to be so.”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_03" /&gt; The [[Berliner Morgenpost]] which had already devoted a full, richly illustrated page&lt;ref name="morgenpost" /&gt; regarding the FBK, was also reporting regularly.

{{Quote
 | text=A forest of images rushes from Hall 20 at Hammarskjöldplatz to Hall 23, waiting for the visitors to explore it. […] Why should four halls deter Berliners […] trained by an exhibition like the [[Berlin International Green Week]]? And then there is also the matter of taste, which – as is well known – can't be disputed! Thus, Ernst Leonhardt likes to quote the words of the Secretary of State at the ''Kultursenator'', Lutz von Pufendorf: If the FBK did not exist, it would have to be invented.

== Finances ==
Besides numerous sponsors and catalog advertisers, the FBK was financed by the [[Senate of Berlin]]. Over the course of about 20&amp;nbsp;years, from 1971 to 1993, its budget had grown steadily from 120,000&amp;nbsp;[[Deutsche Mark]]&amp;nbsp;(DM) to over 760,000&amp;nbsp;DM. During that period, from 1981 to 1983, the budget of the FBK had been fixed and was slightly reduced in 1984. Well-known companies of the city helped fill the gaps. Senator Volker Hassemer secured the budget in 1985 which increased during the following eight years. The rent also increased considerably over the years and amounted to nearly 400,000&amp;nbsp;DM in 1995, leaving only 360,000&amp;nbsp;DM of the Senate's grants for the realization of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="rech_3" /&gt; This exhibition would not have been possible without donations from the artists. A year later the Senate stopped the grants entirely. That decision sealed the end of the FBK. During the jubilee exhibition in 1995 the organizers assumed that – while budget cuts had to be made – the FBK could still take place every second year, in a “2-year rhythm”,&lt;ref name="roloff-momin_2" /&gt; as the former cultural director Ulrich Roloff-Momin had stated. Nothing came out of it. There were appeals, some of them were drastic:

{{Quote
 | text=A city like Berlin, where famous artists are trained at renowned universities, such a city must also provide for their artists and provide them with a forum. Not only imported art is respectable and noteworthy. A city without free art is dead.

== Figures ==
The figures presented here are incomplete. A first overview was published in the catalog of the 20th FBK relating to the years 1971 to 1989,&lt;ref name="zahlen_1" /&gt; and a second one in the catalog of the 24th FBK for the years 1991 to 1993.&lt;ref name="zahlen_2" /&gt; Thus, there is no information about 1990 and the last two years.

In the documented period –&amp;nbsp;between 1983 and 1989&amp;nbsp;– the number of exhibitors increased from 750 to 2,400, with certain fluctuations. The number of groups involved rose from 25 to 82 and peaked with 91 groups in 1992. The number of visitors varied between 12,400 and 34,000 with a high in 1978. The grants made available by the [[Senate of Berlin]] for the organization and the set-up of the exhibition increased more or less continuously from 150,000 DM to more than 750,000 DM in 1993. In addition, there were not only sponsors, but also artists who sold their art to cover expenses of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="rech_3" /&gt; Nevertheless, money was always scarce, as Ernst Leonhardt's constantly admonishing words in the catalogs testify. The exhibition space had increased over the years to 9,000 square meters&lt;ref name="roloff-momin_1" /&gt; but the rent increased as well. It multiplied sixfold from the beginning to the last exhibition.

With the exception of the first two years, the number of art works that were sold increased consistently and grew steadily to a 6-figure sum, just under half a million in 1992. Yet, Leonhardt regrets: “Not more than about 5&amp;nbsp;% of the visual artists can support themselves through their work.”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_04" /&gt; There were discussions about the often modest purchases of art works by the [[Senate of Berlin]] which were in the single-digit percentage range of the budget for art purchases.“Ridiculous, the disillusioned say, that of a 670,000 DM budget less than 5&amp;nbsp;% was purchased at the FBK, even though the Senator himself considers this exhibition to be the most important of the year in Berlin.”&lt;ref name="leonhardt_04" /&gt;

'''''God of the Sullied''''' is a historical (mythological) fiction book written by [[Gaurav Sharma (author)|Gaurav Sharma]]. The book would have a sequel, ''Long Live the Sullied''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=God of the Sullied: A tale of Kismet and Karma in Kaliyuga|url=http://www.uniindia.com/god-of-the-sullied-a-tale-of-kismet-and-karma-in-kaliyuga/india/news/1365242.html|newspaper=United News of India|date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; God of the Sullied is set in the ninth-century Indian state of Rudraputra (fictional location). Several rejections of this book's manuscript resulted in the creation of the book ''[[The Indian Story of an Author]]'', a symbolic protest by [[Gaurav Sharma (author)|Gaurav Sharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rejection the reason behind me creating my new book, says Gaurav Sharma|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/books-and-art/040818/rejection-is-the-reason-behind-creating-my-new-book-says-gaurav-sharm.html|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My experiments with the truth of publishing, Gaurav Sharma's new book|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/jul/31/my-experiments-with-the-truth-of-publishing-gaurav-sharmas-new-book-1850861.html|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The first edition of  ''God of the Sullied'' was published in September 2018 by Think Tank Books, a Delhi-based publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stay true to your story|url=http://epaper.freepressjournal.in/1864268/Free-Press-Mumbai-Edition/21-Oct-2018?fbclid=#page/18/1|newspaper=Free Press Journal|date=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''God of the Sullied'' is a story about an underachieving, innocent and supposedly cursed child, who in the end, conquers the world and demolishes the evil. The story revolves around ninth century India, just after the sudden demise of [[Adi Shankara|Adi Shankaracharya]] - a time when a unique and exotic [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshavaku]] tribe lives somewhere in Rudraputra. Their scion, Eklavya, as per the predictions of a high priest, will take birth with a purpose of demolishing the evil from the earth. The child is declared mystic. However, he would later be clutched in the hands of [[Kali Yuga|Kali]], the darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=लेखक गौरव शर्मा का उपन्यास 'गॉड ऑफ़ द सलीड' हुआ प्रकाशित|url=|newspaper=Dainik Bhaskar|date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A storm hits this part of the world a day before the birth of Eklavya, claiming many lives. Soon after Eklavya’s birth, his mother dies, and a series of unfortunate events follows. The village deemed the child as sullied and cursed. Eklavya’s father loses his sanity after all this, and his grandmother dies mysteriously. Eklavya is forced to leave the village. He tries to end his life by taking a plunge into the mighty [[Ganges]], but a stranger saves his life by asking his way to the cemetery. Eklavya and that stranger become friends. The stranger offers Eklavya a job in the cemetery. Upon reaching there, Eklavya finds an old man who, as per the stranger, is his father. The stranger disappears in the morning. The old man reveals that he never had any child. Eklavya is baffled and wonders about the stranger.

As days pass by, Eklavya starts sharing a bond with the old man and helping him maintain the cemetery. Everything was going fine until one day Eklavya finds his father dead and brought over to the cemetery for cremation. Weak and thrashed from inside, Eklayva decides to go back to his village, where he was outcast from, after being deemed as sullied. Before he could go there, the high priest came to meet him in the cemetery. It is during a heated conversation that the high priest revealed that he had some hidden motives against Eklavya and his father, and that he was the reason behind Eklavya’s mother’s and grandmother’s death. Seeing the high priest repent his deeds, Eklavya let him go alive.

Eklavya, after few days, leaves the cemetery and the old man, and goes out to find the truth of life. Soon, he attains higher consciousness. During his adulthood, Eklavya trains an entire village to fight against bandits, finds a girl who earlier had saved him from being killed by a tribe, witnessed the death of the old man and eventually, the girl killed by the bandits. It is then revealed that the high priest had become the Chief Minister of the state of Rudraputra and to pay back the cost of his spared life, he helps Eklavya become the King of Rudraputra. Eklavya in his kingship improves the socio-economic condition of his country. And hence, the prophecies of him conquering the world and ending [[Kali Yuga|Kaliyuga]] made before his birth became true.

The '''golden apple''' is an element that appears in various national and ethnic [[folk legends]] or [[fairy tales]]. Recurring themes depict a hero (for example [[Hercules]] or [[Făt-Frumos]]) retrieving the golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]]s hidden or stolen by a monstrous [[antagonist]]. Alternatively, they are depicted as divine food and the source of [[immortality]] in [[Norse mythology]], and as part of the mysterious [[Silver Branch|apple branch]] of [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] in [[Irish mythology]].

== Greek mythology ==
Three instances of golden apples were featured in [[Greek mythology]]:

===Atalanta===
{{Main article|Atalanta}}
[[Image:Guido Reni - Atalanta e Ippomene (Napoli).jpg|thumb|left|340px|''Atalanta and Melanion'', [[Guido Reni]], c. 1622&amp;ndash;25]]

The first case concerns a huntress named Atalanta who raced against a suitor named [[Melanion]].  Melanion used golden apples to distract Atalanta so that he could win the race.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though abandoned by her father as an infant, Atalanta became a skilled hunter and received acclaim for her role in the hunt for the Calydonian boar.  Her father claimed her as his daughter and wished to marry her off.  However, Atalanta was reluctant to marry due to a prophecy that marriage would be her downfall.  Because of her beauty, she gained a number of suitors and finally agreed to marry, but under the condition that her suitor was obligated to beat her in a footrace.  Competitors who failed to beat her would be put to death.  As Atalanta could run extremely fast, all her suitors died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Realizing that Atalanta could not be defeated in a fair race, Melanion prayed to [[Aphrodite]] for help.  The goddess gave him three golden apples and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta.  Sure enough, she quit running long enough to retrieve each golden apple.  It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Melanion finally succeeded, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eventually they had a son [[Parthenopeus|Parthenopaios]], who was one of the Seven against Thebes.  Their marriage ended in misfortune when they were transformed into lions (which the Greeks believed were unable to mate with their own species, only with leopards) for offending the gods.

===Golden Apple of Trojan War Fable===
{{Main article|Judgement of Paris|Apple of Discord}}
[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|left|390px|[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|''El Juicio de Paris'']] by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1904. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is holding the golden apple on his right hand while surveying the goddesses in a calculative manner.]]

[[Zeus]] held a [[banquet]] in celebration of the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of discord, was not invited for her troublesome nature, and upon turning up uninvited, she threw a golden apple into the ceremony, with an inscription that read:  "ΤΗΙ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗΙ" ({{lang-grc|τῇ καλλίστῃ|translit=tē(i) kallistē(i)}}, [[Greek language|Modern Greek]]: τη καλλίστη ''ti kallisti''; "for/to the most beautiful" – cf. [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]). Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. They brought the matter before Zeus. Not wanting to get involved, Zeus assigned the task to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of Troy. Paris had demonstrated his exemplary fairness previously when he awarded a prize unhesitatingly to [[Ares]] after the god, in bull form, had bested his own prize bull.

Zeus gave the apple to [[Hermes]] and told him to deliver it to Paris and tell him that the goddesses would accept his decision without argument. As each goddess wanted to receive the apple, they each stripped off their own clothing and appeared naked before [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. Each of the goddesses also offered Paris a gift as a bribe in return for the apple; Hera offered to make him the king of Europe and Asia Minor, Athena offered him wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered to give to him the love of the world's most beautiful woman, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of Sparta, who was already married to King Menelaus. Paris chose Aphrodite, a decision that caused the [[Trojan war]], and ultimately the destruction of both Paris and his city, Troy.

=== Heracles ===
See [[Labours_of_Hercules#Eleventh_labour:_apples_of_the_Hesperides|Apples of the Hesperides]]

==Norse mythology==
[[Image:Ring5.jpg|right|thumb|[[Freia]], from ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', with the tree of golden apples]]
In [[Norse mythology]], the golden apples are the source of the gods' immortality and perpetual youth; comparable to the role of [[ambrosia]] in [[Greek mythology]]. They are cultivated by—and most often associated with—the goddess [[Iðunn]].

===In myth===
In the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', Iðunn is mentioned in its first chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight [[Æsir|ásynjur]] (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in [[Asgard]] for [[Ægir]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES59&gt;Faulkes (1995:59).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 56, [[Bragi]] tells Ægir about Iðunn's abduction by the [[jötunn]] [[Þjazi]]. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, [[Loki]] finds himself stuck to the bird, and being pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees, and he felt his arms might be pulled out from his shoulders. Loki shouted and begged the eagle for a truce, and the eagle responds that Loki would only be freed if he made a solemn vow to have Iðunn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki accepts and returns to his friends [[Odin]] and [[Hœnir]]. At the time the Þjazi and Loki agreed on, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into "a certain forest", telling her that he had discovered some apples that she would find worth keeping, and told Iðunn that she ought to bring her apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples Loki discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her, and takes her to his home, [[Þrymheimr]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES60&gt;Faulkes (1995:60).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Æsir begin to grow grey and old at the disappearance of Iðunn. The Æsir hold an assembly [[thing (assembly)|thing]], where they ask one another when Iðunn had been seen last. The Æsir realize that the last time that Iðunn was seen was when she was going outside of Asgard with Loki, and so they have Loki arrested and brought to the assembly, where he is threatened with death and torture. Terrified, Loki says that he will search for Iðunn in the land of [[Jötunheimr]] if the goddess [[Freyja]] will lend him her "[[falcon]] shape". Freyja lends the falcon shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to Jötunheimr, and arrives a day later at Þjazi's home. Loki finds that Þjazi is out in a boat at sea, and that Iðunn is home alone. Loki turns her into a [[nut (fruit)|nut]], holds her in his claws, and flies away with her as fast as possible.&lt;ref name=FAULKES60/&gt;

Upon Þjazi's arrival home, he finds that Iðunn is gone. Þjazi assumes his eagle shape, and chases after Loki, causing a storm wind. The Æsir see a falcon flying with a nut, as well as the pursuing eagle, so they go outside from Asgard, with loads of wood shavings. The falcon flies over the fortification, and drops down by the wall. The eagle is unable to stop when he misses the falcon, the feathers of the eagle catch fire, and he falls. The Æsir, close by, kill the jötunn Þjazi within the gates of Asgard, "and this killing is greatly renowned."&lt;ref name=FAULKES60/&gt;

==Irish mythology==
The role of the Golden Apple is far more minor and less specific in [[Irish mythology|Irish lore]], mostly because it is an element of the [[Silver Branch]], or ''Silver Bough'', symbol that is connected to the [[Celtic Otherworld]].

===Apple branch===
Described in [[The Voyage of Bran]] as "a silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eleanor Hull, The Silver Bough in Irish Legend, in Folk-Lore, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; it is said that "to enter the Otherworld before the appointed hour marked by death, a passport was often necessary, and this was usually a silver branch,"&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Gods of the Celts, published by Dalriada Publications – http://www.manannan.net/library/godofthecelts.html&lt;/ref&gt; thus continuing the apple's divine connection found in Greek and Norse myth.&lt;ref name="MacKillop1"&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp.21, 205, 270, 322–3, 346, 359–60. {{ISBN|0-19-280120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This connection is particularly strong regarding the Irish [[water deity|sea deity]] and Otherworld guardian [[Manannán mac Lir]], as evidenced in the tale [[His Three Calls to Cormac]]. In this story Manannán gifts a "branch of silver with three golden apples" to King [[Cormac mac Airt]] and, when shaken, these golden apples produced a music that could put anybody to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;This tale exists in several manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; i. e. Book of Ballymote, and Yellow Book of Lecan, as edited and translated by Stokes, in Irische Texts, III. i. 183–229; cf. Voy. of Bran, i. 190 ff.; cf. Le Cycle Myth. Irl., pp. 326–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac – http://www.manannan.net/library/Lady%20Gregory/His%20Three%20Calls%20to%20Cormac.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory1"&gt;Gregory, Lady Augusta (1903) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/gafm21.htm online "Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac"] in ''Gods and Fighting Men''. Buckinghamshire, Colyn Smyth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Joseph. "The Fate of the Children of Lir." More Celtic Fairy Tales. Illustrated by John D. Batten.

His Three Calls to Cormac – https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14465/14465-h/14465-h.htm#L22&lt;/ref&gt; This gift however, was conditional in that the price was the King's family and, though they are eventually restored to him, Manannán used to silver branch of golden apples as the means to teach Cormac a harsh lesson. In addition, in her ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gods and Fighting Men, Lady Gregory |year=1904 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] describes Manannán's gift as a "shining branch having nine apples of red gold."&lt;ref name="Gregory1"/&gt;

==Music==
In [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', the golden apples have their own [[leitmotif]]. It is first sung by [[Fafnir|Fafner]], when he explains to his brother Fasolt why they must take Freia away from the gods.

In [[Stravinsky]]'s ballet [[The Firebird]] (1910) which is based upon an amalgam of Russian folk-legends, the hero Prince Ivan enters a garden where he witnesses 13 young Princesses' playing with Golden Apples which grow there. (Tableaux VII Scherzo. Jeux des princesses avec les pommes d'or / The Princesses' Game with the Golden Apples).

==Fairy tales==
[[Image:Firebird.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]] catches the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]] who tries to steal golden apples in ''[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]'']]
Many European fairy tales begin when golden apples are stolen from a king, usually by a bird:
*"[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]" (Russian)
*"[[The Golden Bird]]" (German)
*"[[The Golden Mermaid]]" (German)
*"[[The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples]]" (Serbian/Bulgarian)
*"[[Prâslea the Brave and the Golden Apples]]" (Romanian, where the thief is not a bird but a [[zmeu]])
*"[[The Three Brothers and the Golden Apple]]" (Bulgarian, where the thief is not a bird but a [[zmey]])
*"[[The White Snake]]" (German)

==Modern literature==
The [[William Butler Yeats]] poem "The Song of the Wandering Aengus", has the lines:
:''I will find out where she has gone''
:''And kiss her lips and take her hands;''
:''And walk among long dappled grass,''
:''And pluck till time and times are done''
:''The silver apples of the moon,''
:''The golden apples of the sun.''

The [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] play called ''The Golden Apple: A Play for Kiltartan Children'' is a fable in the invented [[Kiltartan]] dialect based on Irish mythology and folklore.

''The Golden Apples'' is the name of Southern writer, Eudora Welty's, fourth short story collection, published in 1949. The stories are interrelated and center around the citizens of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi.

A golden apple plays a crucial role in the climax of [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell's]] sixth novel ''[[The Bone Clocks]]'', published by Random House in 2014.

==Discordianism==
The contemporary religion [[Discordianism]] draws upon the Golden Apple of the goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], also known as the "Apple of Discord", which Eris used to set off the conflict among the goddesses of Olympus that lead to the [[Trojan War]] because she was not invited to a party (the so-called "Original Snub". Emblazoned upon the apple is the word "''[[Kallisti]]''" ("to the fairest").&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/24.php |title=Page 17-18 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden apple can be seen as a metaphor for a practical joke meant to cause [[cognitive dissonance]] in the target.

==Identity and use in other languages==

===Argan fruit===
Michael Hübner has suggested that the fruit of the [[Argania|Argan tree]], endemic to the [[Sous Valley]] in present-day [[Morocco]], may be the golden apples of the [[Hesperides (poetry)|Hesperides]]. Arguing that the location matches most closely the description given in classical texts of [[Atlantis]] and the garden of the Hesperides, he notes that the ripe fruits look like small golden apples and have an aroma like baked apples. He equates the fruit, the seeds of which produce [[Argan oil]], with [[Plato]]'s account of Atlantean fruits "which afford liquid and solid food and unguents", and proposes that the trees' almost reptilian-scale like bark and thorns may have inspired the mythical guardian dragon of the golden apples, [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Hübner|title=Circumstantial Evidence for Plato's Island Atlantis in the Souss-Massa plain in today's South-Morocco|url=http://asalas.org/papers/Huebner_Atlantis_Circumstantial_Evidence_full.pdf|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oranges===
In many languages, the [[orange (fruit)|orange]] is referred to as a "golden apple". For example, the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''χρυσομηλιά,'' and [[Latin]] ''pomum aurantium'' both literally describe oranges as "golden apples". Other languages, like [[German language|German]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], have more complex [[etymologies]] for the word "orange" that can be traced back to the same idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Citr_sin.html#etym ''Orange (Citrus sinensis [L.&amp;#93; Osbeck) Etymology''], Gernot Katzer, [http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/index.html Gernot Katzer Spice Pages], formerly [[University of Graz]], February 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years it was thought that the "golden apples" of myth might have actually been [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], a fruit unknown to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]] before the [[Middle Ages]]. Under this assumption, the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[botanical]] name chosen for all [[citrus]] species was ''Hesperidoeidē'' (Ἑσπεριδοειδῆ, "hesperidoids"). It was also used by [[Carl Linnaeus]], who gave the name Hesperides to an [[order (biology)|order]] containing the [[genus]] Citrus, in allusion to the golden apples of the Hesperides, and is preserved in the term [[Hesperidium]] for the fruits of citrus and some other plants.

One reason why oranges might be considered to be "magical" in so many stories is because they bear flowers and fruit at the same time, unlike other fruit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Quinces===
Frequently, the term "golden apple" is used to refer to the [[quince]], a fruit originating in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.saucemagazine.com/a/890 |title=Quince, the 'Golden Apple'| author=Arnot, Sharon | work= Sauce Magazine|date=April 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomatoes===
The [[tomato]], unknown to the ancient world of the Greeks, is known as the ''pomodoro'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], meaning "golden apple" (from ''pomo d'oro'').{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Popular Culture==
Golden apples are also items that are featured in video games such as *[[Minecraft]]&lt;ref&gt;https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Apple&lt;/ref&gt; and *[[Hello Neighbor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://helloneighbor.gamepedia.com/Apple|website=helloneighbor.gamepedia.com|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarcophagus_archmus_Heraklion.jpg|thumb|320px|The Hagia Triada sarcophagus. Funereal cult. Lyre with seven strings]]
The '''Hagia Triada sarcophagus''' is an early [[Bronze Age]] 137&amp;nbsp;cm-long limestone [[sarcophagus]]. It was originally dated to 1400 BC and was rediscovered in [[Hagia Triada]] on [[Crete]] in 1903. It provides probably the most comprehensive iconography of a pre-Homeric ''thysiastikis'' ceremony and one of the best pieces of information on noble burial customs when Crete was under [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] rule, combining features of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and Mycenaean style and subject matter. The sarcophagus is on display in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]].

==Description==
Coated in plaster and painted in [[fresco]], it has posed an art historical conundrum ever since its rediscovery, since the Minoans (unlike the [[ancient Egypt]]ians) otherwise only used frescoes for the enjoyment of the living and not in funerary practice.&lt;ref&gt;See also A. Papagiannopoulou 1999, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only limestone sarcophagus of its era discovered to date and the only sarcophagus with a series of narrative scenes of Minoan funerary ritual (later sarcophagi found in the Aegean were decorated with abstract designs and patterns). It was originally used for the burial of a prince. The painted frieze around the sarcophagus shows all the stages of the sacred ceremony which was performed at the burial of important personages. In the centre of one of the long sides of the sarcophagus is a scene with bull sacrifice. On the left of the second long side a woman wearing a crown is carrying two vessels. By her side a man dressed in a long robe is playing a seven string [[lyre]]. This is the earliest picture of the lyre known in classical Greece. In front of them another woman is emptying the contents of a vessel-perhaps the blood of the sacrificed bull-into a second vessel, possibly as an invocation to the soul of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.Sakellarakis"Herakleion Museum. Illustrated guide to the Museum" pp. 113,114. Ekdotike Athinon. Athens 1987&lt;/ref&gt; (This scene brings to mind a description in Homer, where the dead needed blood.) On the right three men holding animals and a boat are approaching a male figure without arms and legs and presumably he represents the dead man receiving gifts (the boat for his journey to the next world).&lt;ref&gt;J.A.Sakellarakis"Herakleion Museum. Illustrated guide to the Museum" p. 114. Ekdotike Athinon. Athens 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that they believed that the dead were living in a different state and he could probably reappear.

==Age==
Recent 20th century excavations on the same site have allowed the sarcophagus's dating to be tightened up to 1370-1320 BC, which coincides with the end of the [[18th Dynasty]] in Egypt, a period of extensive contact between Crete and Egypt, thus allowing the sarcophagus's technical and artistic elements to be related to similar decorative techniques in Egyptian temples and tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Martino, Paula 2005, 10-16&lt;/ref&gt; Some miniature sculpture found in other places of Crete (Kamilari, Archanes) during this period are connected with the worship of the dead and there are traces of a true funereal Egyptian cult at the same period. Funereal cults were not common in Crete, but they were practised in certain instances:  at the tombs of dead kings, or possibly of higher officials and kings.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.Sakellarakis."Herakleion Museum.Illustrated guide to the Museum" p 53.Ekdotike Athinon.Athens 1987&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Iconography==
The sacrifice scene may in part be interpreted by the following criteria from classical and archaic Greece used in worshiping two sets of deities, the ouranioi, deities of the heavens, and the chthonioi, earth deities: position of the hands of the worshipers, level of the altar and color of the deity. The position of the hands of the participants is hands down, palms down indicating the deity invoked is a chthonic deity who is the deity in epiphany as a black bird on the betyl behind the low altar, the altar for the chthonioi, who has black color, the color of the chthonioi. The position of the throat of sacrificial animal, the bull, is down indicating the sacrifice is for the chthonioi or chthonic deity. The high altar is reserved for the ouranioi, deities of the heavens. Above the low altar, chthonic altar, are two objects, a jug of water and a basket of fruits of the earth (standard Egyptian icon). The jug of water is for purification of the sacrifice participants who wash their hands before sacrificing the bull. In Classical Greece the offering of fruits of the earth was made to a chthonic deity just as on the Hagia Triada Sarcophagus. On the high altar, altar for the ouranioi, are the horns of consecration and a tree with seven branches. Most often, but not always, the horns of consecration are found in high places in Minoan religious art indicating they related to the ouranioi. The tree, with seven branches, may be a tree representing regeneration and the seven branches is an Egyptian number signifying completeness.
There are seven participants in the sacrifice scene with hands down palms down possibly indicating a forceful prayer or invocation of the chthonic deity behind the low altar
in epiphany. Also, the sacrifice scene has three other elements common in sacrifices in Classical Greece, the presence of a pipe player, incense in the hand of one of the four
rear participants and the jug of water for purification. The time of day of the sacrifice is night because chthonic rituals took place during the night, ouranic rituals took place during the day. The action of both the sacrifice scene and the libation scene moves from left to right. In Egyptian religion, the left was the side of death and right was the side of life.

The libation scene has seven participants giving force to the offering. The two birds in gold color on betyls sit on double axes and are the highest objects in the scene indicating they are deities in epiphany. The blood in the sacrifice scene is transformed into water because it quenches lips of the "thirsty dead" as mentioned in the Pylos Linear B tablets. The dead man (lowest object)receives the "water" as nourishment because the dead did not feed on solid food, but rather on liquids. Therefore, the calves are symbolic food for dead. The stairs in front of the dead man's tomb, an Egyptian concept, allows the spirit of the dead man to ascend into the realm of the living. The tree on a sarcophagus in ancient Egypt represented resurrection or regeneration. &lt;ref&gt;Stewart E Brekke "The Hagia Triada Sarcophagus: Egyptian Influence on Minoan Religion" The Ancient World, Spring 2010, p.155-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Herakleia head''' is the portrait of a probable [[Achaemenid]] Satrap of [[Asia Minor]] of the late 6th century, found in [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]], in [[Bithynia]], modern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="TAM"/&gt; The head is now located in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in [[Ankara]].

The man depicted in the sculpture was probably a [[Satrap]] under [[Darius I]].&lt;ref name="TAM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=CAHN |first1=HERBERT A. |last2=GERIN |first2=DOMINIQUE |title=Themistocles at Magnesia |date=1988 |pages=20 &amp; Plate 3 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42668124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man is the service of the Achaemenid Empire is bearded and mustachioed, but probably a Greek from [[Asia Minor]] rather than a Persian.&lt;ref name="MS97"/&gt; The statue is made of marble, and was probably made by a Greek sculptor.&lt;ref name="MS97"/&gt; The sculpture has been dated to circa 530 BCE, or at leat [[Archaic Greece|Late Archaic]].&lt;ref name="MS97"/&gt;

The Herakliea head is considered as an early attempt towards [[portrait|portraiture]] with a realistic likeliness.&lt;ref name="MS97"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stieber |first1=Mary |title=The Poetics of Appearance in the Attic Korai |date=2010 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292773493 |page=97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaIAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Eastern portrait in purely [[Ionia|East Greek]] [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] style, is one of the two known forerunners of extant Greek portraits, together with the [[Sabouroff head]].&lt;ref name="TAM"/&gt; It is comparable with the [[Sabouroff head]], from about the same period.&lt;ref name="MS97"/&gt; These nearly life-like portraits allow to define a date for early portraiture which is much earlier than had been previously thought.&lt;ref name="MS98"/&gt; The first truely individualistic portrait is often considered to be the 470 BCE portrait of [[Themistocles]].&lt;ref name="TAM"/&gt; In numismatics also, the first portraits of rulers appear with the coins of [[Themistocles]] as ruler of Magnesia, and continue with the nearby rulers of [[Lycia]] towards the end of the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name="MS98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A rare silver fraction recently identified as a coin of Themistocles from Magnesia even has a bearded portrait of the great man, making it by far the earliest datable portrait coin. Other early portraits can be seen on the coins of Lycian dynasts." {{cite book |last1=Carradice |first1=Ian |last2=Price |first2=Martin |title=Coinage in the Greek World |date=1988 |publisher=Seaby |isbn=9780900652820 |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVZmAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Herakleia head is also an important marker for the depiction of Satraps in the period. In particuliar, the banned Athenian general [[Themistocles]], who became Achaemenid Satrap in [[Magnesia on the Meander|Magnesia]], is seen wearing a tight [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] with [[Olive wreath]] on some of his coins (circa 465-459 BCE).&lt;ref name="HC19"&gt;{{cite book |last1=CAHN |first1=HERBERT A. |last2=GERIN |first2=DOMINIQUE |title=Themistocles at Magnesia |date=1988 |page=19 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42668124}}&lt;/ref&gt; This possibly reflects the headwear of Achaemenid [[Satrap]]s, such as seen in the Herakleia head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=CAHN |first1=HERBERT A. |last2=GERIN |first2=DOMINIQUE |title=Themistocles at Magnesia |date=1988 |page=20 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42668124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS98"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stieber |first1=Mary |title=The Poetics of Appearance in the Attic Korai |date=2010 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292773493 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaIAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King &amp; McGaw''' is an art publisher and online retailer. It supplies high quality art prints and products to museums, galleries and retail stores as well as art prints direct to consumers through its online retail site. Production is based in their {{convert|50000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} factory in [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], Sussex.

The company was set up in Sussex in 1982 by three brothers Gyr, Quentin and Perry King under the name King Publishing, as a silkscreen printing company. The company designed upmarket posters for art galleries and small boutique shops.  The brothers negotiated the rights to works of art by new artists and photographers, as well as established artists such as [[Bridget Riley]], [[Howard Hodgkin]] and [[Terry Frost]].&lt;ref name="mynewsdesk.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/pressreleases/james-bidwell-appointed-ceo-of-easyart-as-fast-growing-online-art-company-secures-additional-funding-round-930212|title=James Bidwell appointed CEO of Easyart as fast growing online art... – Easyart UK|work=Mynewsdesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kingandmcgaw-newhaven-factory.jpg|left|thumb|King &amp; McGaw Warehouse in Newhaven]]
The company rebranded to King Posters by the late 1980s with the business developing into other areas including framing and product development for museum shops such as the [[Tate]], [[National Gallery]], [[Louvre]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="mynewsdesk.com" /&gt;

In 1989 King Posters was making annual sales of £2&amp;nbsp;million but later that year a fire destroyed the warehouse and resulted in £3&amp;nbsp;million worth of stock being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/article1037306.ece|title=How I Made It: Gyr King, founder of King &amp; McGaw – The Sunday Times|work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's bank loaned an additional £5000 so the stock could be reprinted and an American supplier, Bruce McGaw, offered to replace some of the missing stock for free, which, in turn, triggered a business deal. As a result, the company was renamed in 1990 to King &amp; McGaw.

During the 1990s, King &amp; McGaw's focused on turning to supplying department stores with pictures and posters as well as museums and galleries resulting in partnerships with [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], [[Next plc|Next]] and [[Debenhams]]. As a result, sales had reached $35&amp;nbsp;million a year by the end of 2000. Further developments occurred in 2007 when the company switched to digital printing, allowing them to print-to-order.
[[File:Kingandmcgaw-popup-shop-london-may2015.jpg|right|thumb|Pop Up Shop in Soho, London]]
By 2011 the company decided to expand into retail by acquiring the online retailer Easyart.com. Easyart was set up by Simon Matthews in 1999 during the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] and in 2002 faced legal allegations from [[Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou]], the founder of [[EasyJet]], over its use of the easy name, accusing Easyart of "passing off" on easyGroup's good name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/11/12/easyart_com_to_face_stelios/|title=Easyart.com to face Stelios in 'easy' court action|work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easyart won the court battle when easyGroup discontinued its legal action, saying it had bigger targets to go after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-3545|title=EasyGroup abandons domain claim against Easyart.com|author=Luisa Deas|publisher=[[Out-Law.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the company, then under CEO and co-founder Marc Lickfett, discontinued the Easyart brand and merged the site within the King &amp; McGaw brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fineart.co.uk/article/easyart-rebrands-as-king--mcgaw-966.aspx|title=Easyart rebrands as King &amp; McGaw|publisher=[[Fine Art Trade Guild]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 King &amp; McGaw used a [[pop-up retail|pop-up]] shop to showcase lithographic posters from the [[Mourlot Studios]] archives on [[D'Arblay Street]], [[Soho]], London.&lt;ref name="itsnicethat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/atelier-mourlot|title=It's Nice That – Gorgeous rare posters by the likes of Picasso, Míro and Le Corbusier|work=It's Nice That}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions from artists such as

Classes in drawing with artist Anna-Louise Felstead and [[screen printing]] classes with Print Club London, a [[screen printing]] company based in [[Dalston]]
were also held at the shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kingandmcgaw.com/inspiration/post/art-workshops-at-the-king-mcgaw-gallery|title=Art Workshops at the King &amp; McGaw Gallery|author=Milly|publisher=King and McGaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kreft's dichromaticity index''' (DI) is a [[measurement|measure]] for quantification of [[dichromatism]]. It is defined as the difference in [[hue]] angle (Δh&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;) between the [[color]] of the sample at the dilution, where the [[colorfulness|chroma]] (color saturation) is maximal, and the color of four times more diluted (or thinner) and four times more concentrated (or thicker) sample. The two hue angle differences are called the dichromaticity index towards lighter (Kreft's DI&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and
dichromaticity index towards darker (Kreft's DI&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This means, that pumpkin seed oil changes its color from green-yellow to orange-red (for 44 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] in [[Lab color space]]) when the thickness of the observed layer is increased from cca 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 2&amp;nbsp;mm; and it changes slightly towards green (for 9 degrees) if its thickness is reduced for four-fold.

The color of pumpkin oil at increasing thickness or concentration presented in [[CIELAB]] colorspace diagram. Straight lines are vectors showing hue (angle) and chroma (length) of the color at maximal chroma (toward the square mark), and the colors of four-fold less or more diluted or thick pumpkin oil (DI&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and DI&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;). Note that DI&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is −44.1 degrees and DI&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to −8.97 degrees.

* 1802 (December 18, London): [[William Reeve]], ''[[Family Quarrels]]''. Part of the Jewish audience catcalled because of perceived anti-Jewish slights.&lt;ref&gt;Chancellor, Valerie E. (2002). "Anti-Racialism or Censorship? The 1802 Jewish Riots at Covent Garden Opera". Opera Quarterly 18 (1): 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1830 (August 25, Brussels): [[Daniel Auber]], ''[[La muette de Portici]]''. Audience members at a performance in Brussels left before the end of the opera to join pre-planned riots that were already taking place across the city, marking the beginning of the [[Belgian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, Sonia. "Opera and Revolution: La Muette de Portici and the Belgian Revolution of 1830 Revisited", ''Journal of Musicological Research'' 3 (1979), 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1838 (September 10, Paris): [[Hector Berlioz]], ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]''. The audience hissed at most of the music after the first few numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hberlioz.com/Special/cwasselin_1e.htm Wasselin, Christian, "Benvenuto Cellini" on the Hector Berlioz website] for a more detailed inside story of the opera&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1868 (March 5, Milan): [[Arrigo Boito]], ''[[Mefistofele]]''. The audience came predisposed to drown out Boito's claquers and succeeded in making the music inaudible with their hisses and boos.&lt;ref&gt;Halperson, Maurice.

* 1913 (March 9, Rome): [[Francesco Balilla Pratella]], ''Musica Futurista''. At the second performance of the work, the audience booed, threw garbage at the orchestra, and some fighting occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Payton, Rodney J.

* 1913 (March 31, Vienna): [[Alban Berg]], ''[[Altenberg Lieder]]''. As part of a front in Vienna's ongoing style wars, the audience booed and catcalled loudly, and some punches were thrown. The event came to be known as the [[Skandalkonzert]].&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;Barker, Andrew (1997).

* 1913 (May 29, Paris): [[Igor Stravinsky]], ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''.

* 1914 (April 21, Milan): [[Luigi Russolo]], three works for [[intonarumori]] (''The Awakening of a City'', ''The Meeting of Automobiles and Aeroplanes'' and ''Dining on the Hotel Terrace'').

* 1923 (March 4, New York): [[Edgard Varèse]], ''[[Hyperprism (Varèse)|Hyperprism]]''.

* 1926 (June 19, Paris): [[George Antheil]], ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]''.

* 1968 (December 9, Hamburg): [[Hans Werner Henze]], ''[[Das Floß der Medusa]]''. Students hung a [[Che Guevera]] banner, the [[Red flag (politics)|Red]], and [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|Black]] flags causing the chorus to protest, and the police to make arrests, which prompted Henze to cancel the concert.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Schnabel]], "Zum Untergang einer Uraufführung" and "Postscriptum nach dreiunddreissig Tagen", in Hans Werner Henze and Ernst Schnabel, ''Das Floss der Medusa: Text zum Oratorium'', 47–61 &amp; 65–79 (Munich: Piper-Verlag, 1969);&lt;br /&gt;[[Andrew Porter (music critic)|Andrew Porter]], "Henze: The Raft of the Frigate 'Medusa' – Oratorio" [record review of DGG 139428-9], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' 47, no. 563 (April 1970): 1625;&lt;br /&gt;Anon.

* 1973 (January 18, New York): [[Steve Reich]], ''[[Four Organs]]''. At a [[Carnegie Hall]] performance of the work, the conservative audience tried yelling and sarcastically applauding to hasten the end of the piece, which received both boos and cheers during the ovation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold C. Schonberg|Schonberg, Harold]]. "Music: A Concert Fuss: Piece by Reich Draws a Vocal Reaction," ''The New York Times'', January 20, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2016 (February 29, Cologne): [[Steve Reich]], ''[[Piano Phase]]''. During a performance of the piece by Iranian [[harpsichord]]ist [[Mahan Esfahani]] in the [[Kölner Philharmonie]], Germany, parts of the crowd started booing, clapping and whistling a few minutes after the concert began. In response to the pandemonium when different factions in the audience yelled each other down, Esfahani stopped his performance and started playing with the ensemble [[Concerto Köln]] a concerto by [[C. P. E. Bach]] instead. Several members of the remaining audience apologised for the incident after the concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/iranian-musician-forced-to-stop-cologne-concert-after-audience-members-jeer-and-shout-speak-german-a6909066.html | title=Iranian musician forced to stop Cologne concert after audience members jeer and shout 'speak German' | work=The Independent | author=Lizzie Dearden | date=2016-03-03 | accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of nontraditional bagpipe usage'''. The [[Bagpipes|bagpipe]] is a musical instrument using enclosed [[reed (music)|reeds]] fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag. Though the Scottish [[Great Highland Bagpipe]] and Irish [[uilleann pipes]] have the greatest international visibility, bagpipes have been for centuries played throughout large parts of [[Europe]], the [[Caucasus]], around the [[Persian Gulf]] and in [[Northern Africa]]. In recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. This list details the use of bagpipes in a variety of works, from classical to jazz and rock.

==In contemporary classical music==

'''Mayer Kirshenblatt''' (1916–2009) was a [[Canadian]] [[Jew]]ish painter and author.

==Biography==
Kirshenblatt was born in Apt (Yiddish)/ [[Opatów]] (Polish) Poland. He left Poland in 1934 and settled in Toronto, Canada, where he ran a paint and wallpaper store for many years. In 2007, he and his daughter [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] published ''They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood before the Holocaust'' (University of California Press in conjunction with the [[Judah L Magnes Museum]]). The book won the [[Canadian Jewish Book Award]], J. I. Segal Book Award, and American Association of University Presses (AAUP) award for book design, and was a finalist in three categories for the National Jewish Book Award. An exhibition of his work, which opened at the Magnes Museum in 2007, will travel to The Jewish Museum (New York City), Jewish Historical Museum (Amsterdam), and Museum of the History of Polish Jews (Warsaw). The book and exhibition are the culmination of a forty-year collaboration between father and daughter. In 1967, Barbara began interviewing Mayer about his childhood. In 1990, at the urging of his wife, daughter, and son-in-law [[Max Gimblett]], Mayer began to paint.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4698">The '''Metropolitan Zoological Park and Museum District''' or '''ZMD''' is a cultural tax district in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis City]] and [[St. Louis County, Missouri]].  The district has five subdistricts, these being the [[St. Louis Art Museum]], [[St. Louis Zoo]], [[St. Louis Science Center]], [[Missouri History Museum]], and [[Missouri Botanical Garden]].  Of these, all but the Botanical Gardens are located in or near [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]].  The subsidies provided by the district ensures that the institutions are public non-profits with free admission for all, with the exception of the Botanical Gardens, which charges a nominal admission fee.

==History==
In the early 1960s, the St. Louis Art Museum and the St. Louis Zoo were both publicly funded by a tax in St. Louis City.  Zoo chairman [[Howard Baer]] and his successor, Circuit Judge [[Thomas F. McGuire]], worked with their supporters to secure the statute to establish the district.  H.B. 23 authorized a 1969 vote in St. Louis City and County, where voters approved the creation of the tax district to fund the Zoo and Art Museum at a rate of 8 cents for every $100 assessed.  The Science Center, which had previously received no tax benefit, was added at a rate of 4 cents for every $100 assessed.&lt;ref name=mzdstl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzdstl.org/History.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125165028/http://www.mzdstl.org/History.htm |archivedate=2010-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earl Wipfler]] was selected as the first Executive Director of the district in 1972, and he guided the initial creation of the district's budgeting and accounting procedures.  The [[Missouri Supreme Court]] approved them.&lt;ref name=mzdstl/&gt; Wipfler served as Executive Director until 1990.

The Missouri Botanical Garden was added as the district's fourth subdistrict in 1983, and the History Museum in 1988.&lt;ref name=mzdstl/&gt;

[[Olney F. Otto]] served as the district's second executive director from 1990 until his death in 2001.  [[Mr. J. Patrick Dougherty]] has served in the position since.&lt;ref name=mzdstl/&gt;

==Revenue==
From an initial annual revenue of $3.9 million in 1972, the district grew to $72 million in 2008.  In the past few years, around 85% of these funds have come from the county with the city providing only about 15%.  Though the tax is the same in both places, the disparity in income and population accounts for the difference in money generated.&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzdstl.org/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207114623/http://www.mzdstl.org/index.htm |archivedate=2009-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing Board==
The eight-member governing board is composed of four appointments from St. Louis City, chosen by the mayor, and four from St. Louis County, chosen by the county executive.  The terms last four years, and two positions open up on January 1 each year, one for the city and one for the county.&lt;ref name=mzdstl/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{POV-section|date=February 2015}}
{{Unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
Through the government subsidy, all five subdistricts are able to operate without charging admission.  Some people have questioned whether tourists and residents of areas outside St. Louis City and St. Louis County should continue to be allowed free admission, and that it might be just to charge them, as they contribute nothing to the regional attractions. The exception to this is the Missouri Botanical Garden, which charges admission to non-residents of St. Louis City and County at double the rate of residents. Institutional and political efforts to persuade neighboring [[Jefferson County, Missouri|Jefferson]], [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles]] and other counties to pass tax levies to join the district (and contribute to operations of the regional attractions) have not been successful.  The issue of equity has come up intermittently throughout the district's history.

==Emulation==
The MZMD is one of the earliest, largest, and most successful cultural districts of its kind.  Other cities have created similar programs and tax districts based on the St. Louis model.&lt;ref name=index/&gt;

[[File:Moving panorama.jpg|thumb|right|400px|1848 illustration of a moving panorama designed by [[John Banvard]].]]

The '''moving panorama''' was a relative, more in concept than design, to [[panoramic painting]], but proved to be more durable than its fixed and immense cousin. In the mid-nineteenth century, the moving panorama was among the most popular forms of entertainment in the world, with hundreds of panoramas constantly on tour in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and many European countries. Moving panoramas were often seen in melodramatic plays. It became a new visual element to theatre and helped incorporate a more realistic quality. Not only was it a special effect on stage, but it also served as an ancestor and platform to early cinema.

The word “panorama” is derived from the Greek words “to see” and “all.” [[Robert Barker (artist)|Robert Barker]], an Irish-born scene painter, coined the term with his first panorama of Edinburgh, displayed in a specially built rotunda in Leicester Square in 1791. This attraction was extremely popular amongst the middle and lower classes for the way it was able to offer the illusion of transport for the viewer to a completely different location that they had most likely never seen.

Panoramic paintings and the various offshoots had become so in demand across Europe and America by the early nineteenth century that the enormous paintings had begun to be displayed in less specialized settings, like community halls, churches, and eventually theaters where they evolved into moving panoramas and became essential to theatrical set design. Moving panoramas were achieved by taking the long, continuous painted canvas scene and rolling each end around two large spool-type mechanisms that could be turned, causing the canvas to scroll across the back of a stage, often behind a stationary scenic piece or object like a boat, horse, or vehicle, to create the illusion of movement and travelling through space. The immense spools were scrolled past the audience behind a cut-out drop-scene or [[proscenium]] which hid the mechanism from public view. [[Robert Fulton]] obtained a patent for the panorama in 1799 in [[France]]; he is credited with helping create the spool mechanisms that allowed for the moving panorama to take hold in theatrical set design, combining the technology of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and art for profit, very much a nineteenth century idea.

However, these paintings were not true [[panorama]]s, but rather contiguous views of passing scenery, as if seen from a boat or a train window. Unlike panoramic painting, the moving panorama almost always had a narrator, styled as its "Delineator" or "Professor", who described the scenes as they passed and added to the drama of the events depicted. One of the most successful of these delineators was [[John Banvard]], whose panorama of a trip up (and down) the [[Mississippi River]] had such a successful world tour that the profits enabled him to build an immense mansion, lampooned as "Banvard's Folly", built on [[Long Island]] in imitation of [[Windsor Castle]]. In Britain, showmen such as the durable [[Moses Gompertz]] toured the provinces with a variety of such panoramas from the 1850s until well into the 1880s.

These moving panoramas were readily accepted in New York, where Americans loved the melodramatic genre of plays, which made use of the newest technologies and relied on spectacle. William Dunlap, America’s first theatre historian, professional playwright, and a painter himself, was commissioned by the Bowery Theatre in New York in 1827 to write, somewhat reluctantly, ''A Trip to Niagara: or Travellers in America: A Farce'', a satirical social comedy, specifically for an already existing painting of a steamboat journey up the Hudson River to the base of Niagara Falls, named the “Eidophusikon.” The production was extremely popular, not for the play, but for the spectacular moving scenery.

The concept of early cinema, “moving pictures,” is a direct evolution of the concept of a moving panorama. The first use of the scrolling background concept early on in film was rear projection. This technique, for example, was used when stationary actors were filming in a car that wasn’t actually moving, but instead had a projection of changing locales behind on the rear window to create the illusion that the car was moving, a trope often used in Hitchcock movies. Today, we have much more realistic computer technology to create this illusion of movement, but the image of a stationary object or actor in front of a changing background harkens back to the moving panorama scroll. Moving projections of clouds or passing objects on cycloramas at the back of a stage sometimes seen in modern live theater productions also utilize the illusion of seamless movement behind a stationary object that was popularized by the moving panorama of the nineteenth century.

== Popular subjects ==
Moving panoramas (or sometimes moving [[diorama]]s) often recreated grand ceremonies.  In [[Philadelphia]] in 1811 nearly {{convert|1300|ft|m}} of painted cloth were unwound to display the [[Federal Procession of 1788]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=1558492038|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O1u4d_XeZZ0C|first=Len|last=Travers|title=Celebrating the Fourth: Independence Day &amp; the Rites of Nationalism in the Early Republic|publisher=[[University of Massachusetts]]|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George IV#Reign|George IV's coronation]] in London was treated as a "Grand Historical Peristrephic Panorama" by the Marshall brothers.&lt;ref&gt;peristrephic means "panoramic, unfolding" ([[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Exotic landscapes and travel were popular themes, particularly trips to [[India]], [[New Zealand]], and the Arctic regions. Popular subjects in America were of river journeys, such as in Dunlap’s ''Trip to Niagara'', and trips out west following the railroads that were quickly springing up as America expanded. [[John Banvard|Banvard]]'s enormous [[Mississippi River]] panorama was shown on both sides of the [[Atlantic]] and a moving panorama of "Romantic and Picturesque Scenery in the Environs of [[Hobart]] Town" taken to London in 1839 allowed people in England to get an impression of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PECK_BIO.html Australian Centre for the Moving Image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901013133/http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PECK_BIO.html |date=2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A narrator explained the scenes passing in front of the audience and music played.  In the [[United States]], moving panoramas were popular throughout the 1850s and 1860s, with multiple touring shows operated by proprietors such as Edwin Beale, T.K. Treadwell, [[Henry Lewis (artist)|Henry Lewis]] and George K. Goodwin. Among the more popular subjects were the Arctic regions, major cities such as [[New York City|New York]], the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Niagara Falls]].

[[Peter Grain (artist)|Peter Grain]]'s ''Panorama of the Hudson and James Rivers - Scenes in Virginia'', painted in oil and watercolor, was exhibited at the San Francisco Hall in [[San Francisco]] in March 1853, concluding a tour of cities across the United States. The work covered 9,400 feet of canvas.

==Poole's Myriorama==
[[Image:Myriorama 1891.jpg|thumb|250px|left|1891 poster for Poole's Myriorama featuring the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition|meeting]] between [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] and [[Emin Pasha]]]]
In the early nineteenth century, [[United Kingdom|British]] traveling panorama shows had been operated by several firms, among them the Marshall brothers of [[Glasgow]] and J.B. Laidlaw.  However, it was not until the 1850s that a nearly year-round programme of such shows was offered by [[Moses Gompertz]], who with his assistants the Poole brothers traveled the length and breadth of Britain. Gompertz continued in this line of work through the mid-1880s, when his business was taken over by the Pooles.  
To distinguish theirs from rival shows, they started to use the name ''Myriorama'' which seems to have originated around 1824 with the [[Myriorama (cards)|toy]] of that name despite suggestions that it was coined by Joseph Poole in about 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huhtamo|first=Erkki|title=Illusions in Motion: Media Archaeology of the Moving Panorama and Related Spectacles|year=2013|isbn=978-0262018517|page=292|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/erkki-huhtamo}} This says :''The word "Myriorama" was introduced around 1883 by Joseph Poole, who defined it: "If we prefix ''horama'' with the Greek ''myriroi'', which signifies "various", we arrive at the latest development of this class of entertainment, 'Myriorama' meaning "to view various scenes and objects."''&lt;/ref&gt;  
By 1900 they had seven separate shows touring for 40 weeks of the year.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Scotsman]]'' obituary of Jim Poole, 21 January 1998&lt;/ref&gt; They added elaborate effects to the scrolling paint-and-cloth panoramas: cut-out figures moving across the scene, accompanied by music, lighting and sound effects. The narrator, often one of the Poole brothers in [[:wikt:evening dress|evening dress]], would describe and interpret. "Poole's Myriorama" was well-known and is even mentioned in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

Stories of travel and adventure, often military adventure, were popular: the action was conveyed by hidden stagehands moving shaped [[Flats (theatre)|flats]] across a fixed backdrop.  One naval battle had them manoeuvring ships accompanied by gunshot noises, puffs of smoke and ''[[Rule Britannia]]'' with waves on a rippling cloth at the front of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1857252047|title=Auld Reekie: An Edinburgh Anthology|editor=Ralph Lownie|publisher=Timewell Press|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shows, with [[Variety show|variety]] acts as well as myriorama displays, employed dozens of people.

Some of the first films seen in the UK were presented in late 19th century myriorama shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/downloads/savoy.pdf |title=Richard Buckley and Heidi Addison, ''An Historic Building Record of the former Cannon Cinema, Abington Square, Northampton'' (2001) |access-date=2007-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924042128/http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/downloads/savoy.pdf |archive-date=2006-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Film|cinema]] eventually replaced the myriorama, this kind of entertainment stayed popular until the late 1920s, and was considered a Christmas-time treat. In December 1912 the Pooles first presented their ''Loss of the Titanic'' in "eight tableaux", starting with "a splendid marine effect" of the ship gliding across the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1903000009|first=Stephen|last=Bottomore|title=The Titanic and Silent Cinema|publisher=The Projection Box|year=2000|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; A descendant of theirs, Hudson John Powell, gathered together the family story in ''Poole's Myriorama!: a story of travelling panorama showmen'' (2002). ''[[The Guardian]]'' has called their myrioramas part of the "popular visual culture of the 19th century".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 January 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The last of the Poole family who were in the Myriorama business was John Reginald Poole (1882 - 1950).
His father Charles William Poole had taken over all the family's entertainment concerns.
In 1937, he published the book
One Hundred Years of Showmanship

===Fuller's Myriorama===
[[Image:Fuller's Myriorama.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Poster for Fuller's Myriorama show about [[Ireland]]]]
A Myriorama company formed in New Zealand in 1896 by [[John Fuller (singer)|John Fuller]] (1850–1923) used [[magic lantern]] images rather than paintings wound on rollers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=2F29|title=Online Dictionary of NZ Biography|website=Dnzb.govt.nz|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their shows offered a changing display of pictures accompanied by commentary and music.

==Surviving moving panoramas==
[[Image:Garibaldi panorama scene25.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Scene 25 from the Garibaldi Panorama ([[Brown University]])]]
Few moving panoramas have survived to this day, and conservation issues prevent them from being shown in their original format. The most notable rediscovered moving panorama in the [[United States]] is the [[Grand Moving Panorama of Pilgrim's Progress]], which was found in storage at the [[York Institute]], now the Saco Museum, in [[Saco, Maine]] by its former curator Tom Hardiman.  It was found to incorporate designs by many of the leading painters of its day, including [[Jasper Francis Cropsey]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], and [[Henry Courtney Selous]] (Selous was the in-house painter for the original Barker panorama in London for many years).  Another significant panorama, Russell and Purrington's "Whaling Voyage 'Round the World," is in the collection of the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] and  it is currently on exhibit during conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/collections/panorama|title=Purrington-Russell Panorama Conservation Project - New Bedford Whaling Museum|first=New Bedford Whaling|last=Museum|website=Whalingmuseum.org|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[C.C.A. Christensen]]'s "Mormon Panorama" survives at [[Brigham Young University]]'s Museum of Art, where it has been the subject of several recent shows and lectures.

Another moving panorama was donated to the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection at the [[Brown University Library]] in 2005. Painted in [[Nottingham]], England around 1860 by John James Story (d. 1900), it depicts the life and career of the great Italian patriot, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] (1807–1882). The panorama stands about 4½ feet high and approximately {{convert|140|ft|m}} long, painted on both sides in watercolor. Numerous battles and other dramatic events in his life are depicted in 42 scenes, and the original handwritten narration survives.
A section of The Moving Panorama of Texas and California (1851-1852), titled "[http://www.thestoryoftexas.com/discover/artifacts/independence-hall-at-washington-on-the-brazos Independence Hall at Washington-on-the-Brazos]" is on display at the [[Bullock Texas State History Museum]] in Austin, Texas. This panorama was commissioned by Levi Sala, and painted by Charles L. Smith. The panorama made its public debut at the Dan Rice Amphitheater on St. Charles Street in New Orleans on May 1, 1852. The scenes were painted by Charles L. Smith from drawings and sketches provided by James G. Benton of sites of historical interest in Texas, including scenes along the Brazos River from San Felipe to Washington-on-the-Brazos, as well as views of the San Antonio Missions and episodes of the Texas Revolution of 1835-1836. Also, a member of the Mier Expedition, Charles McLaughlin, contributed eyewitness sketches of the 1842 Texas incursion into Mexico. An artist known only as Mr. Perrine would supply drawings of the California gold country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Painting in Texas: The Nineteenth Century|last = Pinckney|first = Pauline|publisher = University of Texas Press|year = 1967|isbn = 9780292736825|location = Austin, TX|pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crankies==
'''Crankies''' are moving panoramas on a smaller scale, with a typical example being roughly twenty feet long by eighteen inches high. Like the larger moving panorama, a crankie is typically displayed with live music or narration. In the form of crankies, the moving panorama has experienced a revival in the United States since the mid-2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Colson |first1=Nicole S. |title=Crankie Revival is Nod to Theatrical History |url=http://www.sentinelsource.com/elf/crankie-revival-is-nod-to-theatrical-history/article_d98ba022-f7a1-11e7-964c-f773e4fa01e4.html |accessdate=13 August 2018 |work=SentinelSource.com |publisher=[[The Keene Sentinel]] |date=12 January 2018 |ref=KeenSentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sullivan |first1=Robert |title=What Can an Old Folk Song Tell Us? |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/what-can-an-old-folk-song-tell-us |accessdate=13 August 2018|publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date=17 March 2018 |ref=NewYorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mughal Tahakhana''' ''or'' '''Shah Shuja Tahakhana''' is a three storied building known as ''Tahakhana''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shibganj.chapainawabganj.gov.bd/upazilla_tourist_spot |title=উপজেলার দর্শনীয় স্থান &amp;#124; Shibganj Upazilla &amp;#124; শিবগঞ্জ উপজেলা |website=Shibganj.chapainawabganj.gov.bd |date= |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''({{lang-bn|তাহখানা}}, [[Persian Language|Persian]]: تاهخانا {{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɑː|h|ɑː|k|ɑː|n|ɑː}})'', means cold building or palace. The historical Tahakhana is located at the [[Gauḍa (region)]] in Firozpur area in the west of a big pond. It is 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chapai Nawabganj District]] in Shahbajpur Union at [[Shibganj Upazila, Chapai Nawabganj|Shibganj Upazila]].&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin, Mohammad (6 March 2010)। "শাহ নিয়ামতুল্লাহ (রঃ) এর মাজার"। ''গৌড়বঙ্গ ও চাঁপাইনবাবগঞ্জ এর প্রাচীন নিদর্শন'' (2 সংস্করণ)। ঢাকা, বাংলাদেশ: জাতীয় সাহিত্য পরিষদ। পৃ:&amp;nbsp;১০১।&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Sultan of Bengal]], [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] founded this palace as a 'Temperature Control Unit' in honour of his [[Murshed]] Shah Syed Niyamatullah, mainly for comfort in winter. Son of [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]], Shah Shuja founded this palace between 1619 and 1658 (or 1639–1660).&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, Rajinikanth (January 1999)। [http://50.30.47.15/ebook/bangla/Gourer_Itihas.pdf ''গৌড়ের ইতিহাস''] (PDF) (1 &amp; 2 সংস্করণ)। Bankim Chatterjee Street, Calcutta 700 073: Dev's Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; There is a saying that, when he came to meet with [[Murshed]] used the middle wider room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shahabajpurup.chapainawabganj.gov.bd "সোনামসজিদ তোহাখানা মাজার শরিফ"]। মন্ত্রিপরিষদ বিভাগ, এটুআই, বিসিসি ও বেসিস&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of unknown graves inside the 'Tahakhana Complex' considered as companions or Khadems of Shah Syed Niyamatullah.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Structure ==
Ancient architecture like [[Gauḍa (region)|Gauḍa]] is rarely found except Tahakhana. Her ceiling and partition are coagulated on the beam by concrete casting. The Mosque and Tahakhana are on the lake name 'Dafe-ul-Balah'. Two stare cases are sank into the lake. Two more structures are on the north west side of the palace, nearer one is a three domed mosque and another one is one domed tomb with bolted veranda. All the buildings are founded by the same time for a specific purpose and considered as a complex unit. Main materiel of the building is brick. Black stone is used for the threshold and wooden vim used for plain roof. The building seems to be single storied from the west side but assumed double storied from the east side, extended by the rooms directly raised the archway from the lake. A [[Turkish bath|hammam]] is in the west of the building supplied water from an octagonal reservoir. A small family mosque is in the north and at its back side an open room which connected with an octagonal tower. This tower possibly used for [[contemplation]]. This octagonal tower balanced the complex. The palace is plastered and engraved by the crafts following [[Mughal architecture]].

'''Censorship of music''' refers to the practice of editing of [[music|musical works]] for various reasons, stemming from a wide variety of motivations, including moral, political, or religious reasons. Censorship can range from the complete government-enforced legal prohibition of a musical work, to private, voluntary removal of content when a musical work appears in a certain context.

==Motivations==
===Decency===
Songs are commonly edited for broadcast on [[radio]] and [[television]] to remove content that may be considered objectionable to an outlet's [[target audience]]—such as [[profanity]], or references to subjects such as [[sexual activity|sex]] and [[recreational drug|drug usage]]. This is typically done to comply with any relevant [[broadcast law]] or [[codes of conduct]], and to make the songs more marketable to a mainstream audience.&lt;ref name=MIAcensdoubstandard/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt; Songs edited for content in this manner by are often referred to as a "[[clean version]]" or a "[[radio edit]]" (the latter also referring to songs that may be edited for length on radio airplay, and in the past, space limitations on 45 RPM [[vinyl record]]s).&lt;ref name=cp-attentionspans&gt;{{cite news|title=QuickHitz offers radio hit parade edited for short attention spans|url=http://www.theprovince.com/news/QuickHitz+offers+radio+parade+edited+short+attention+spans/10102495/story.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|agency=Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3395823.stm|title=Banned on the run|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common editing techniques include distorting vocals to obscure offending words (including muting, [[bleep censor|bleeping]], and [[backmasking]]), or replacing them with alternative lyrics.&lt;ref name="guardian-sandm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ewing|first=Tom|title=How pop is provoking the censors again|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/09/rihanna-lyrics-censorship-radio-one|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of censorship required may vary between broadcasters, depending on [[standards and practices]] and their target audience; for example, [[Radio Disney]] imposes stricter content guidelines than conventional U.S. radio stations, as it primarily targets a youth audience and family listening.&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/08/454606994/the-art-of-the-clean-version|title=The Art Of The 'Clean Version'|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some radio stations may relegate unedited versions of tracks containing objectionable content to airplay during [[Watershed (broadcasting)|time periods deemed appropriate]], such as late-night hours.&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban"/&gt; Joel Mullis, an Atlanta sound engineer who became well-known in the industry for his work on radio edits, noted that his job was often complicated by differing standards between broadcasters (such as [[BET]] and [[MTV]]), requiring different edits to meet their individual needs. Mullis' edit of the [[Ying Yang Twins]]' "[[Wait (The Whisper Song)]]" was constructed by splicing in vocals from other Ying Yang Twins songs, but Mullis eventually had to bring the group back to his studio after facing demands for additional edits.&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt;

In some cases, a [[record label]] may choose to withhold a release entirely if they believe that its subject matter would be too controversial; [[Ice-T]] and [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]] both had [[gangsta rap]] albums withheld or indefinitely delayed by [[Warner Bros. Records]] over content concerns, with Ice-T's [[Home Invasion (album)|''Home Invasion'']] delayed due to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] and controversy over "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]"—a song by Ice-T's metal band [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], and Paris's ''[[Sleeping with the Enemy (album)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]'' over its songs "[[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] Killa" and "Coffee, Doughnuts, &amp; Death". [[Insane Clown Posse]] faced similar issues after they signed to [[Disney]]-owned [[Hollywood Records]]; despite compliance with the label's demands to censor specific songs and lyrics, ''[[The Great Milenko]]'' was recalled almost immediately after its release (but not before selling 18,000 copies out of 100,000 shipped). All three acts moved to different labels (including [[Priority Records]] and [[Island Records]]), which released their respective albums without objections.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/violent-j-breaks-down-insane-clown-posses-joker-card-lps-20150213/the-great-milenko-1997-20150213|title=Violent J Gives the Twisted Stories Behind ICP's Best LPs|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/1997/07/25/great-milenko/|title=The Great Milenko|date=1997-07-25|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/09/controversial-rap-album-covers/paris-sleeping-with-the-enemy|title=A History of Scandalous Rap Album Covers: Paris, Sleeping with the Enemy (1992)|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Notable examples ====
Multiple edits of [[CeeLo Green]]'s song "[[Fuck You (CeeLo Green song)|Fuck You]]" exist, including one which changed the titular lyric to "Forget You", and one which muted "fuck" without replacing it. Green also performed a [[Parody music|parody]] of the song about [[Fox News]] in an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/11/10/cee-lo-green-colbert-fox-news/|title=Cee-Lo Green swaps 'Fox News' for 'F--k You' on 'Colbert'|last=|first=|date=2010-11-10|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129454158|title=Cee Lo's Viral Hit: Blunt and Sweet|date=August 26, 2010|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/30/cee.lo.song.video/index.html|title=Cee Lo's YouTube hit you won't hear on radio|last=Brown|first=Damon|date=August 30, 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Black Eyed Peas]] re-wrote "Let's Get Retarded"—a song from their album ''[[Elephunk]]'', as "[[Let's Get It Started]]" to serve as a promotional song for television coverage of the [[2004 NBA Playoffs]]. "Let's Get It Started" was subsequently released as a standalone single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1487022/black-eyed-peas-collaborating-with-darkness.jhtml|title=Black Eyed Peas To Make Their Own 'Walk This Way' — With The Darkness|date=14 May 2004|publisher=MTV|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard-jingles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/super-bowl-xlvii/481117/10-hits-you-didnt-know-were-jingles|title=10 Hits You Didn't Know Were Jingles|website=Billboard|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When performing his song "[[Power (Kanye West song)|Power]]" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', [[Kanye West]] similarly replaced an entire verse, which contained profanities as well as lyrics directly criticising the program (such as "Fuck ''SNL'' and the whole cast") with newly-written lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/kanye-west-power-lyrics-changed-saturday-night-live-performance-nbc-article-1.186295|title=Kanye uses 'Power' to change lyrics on 'SNL'|work=New York Daily News|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Songs containing potentially objectionable [[double entendre]]s or [[mondegreen]]s have also been subject to censorship. For example, the title and chorus of [[Britney Spears]]' single "[[If U Seek Amy]]" was intended to be misheard as "[[Sexual intercourse|F-U-C-K me]]"; her label issued a radio edit which changed the word "seek" to "see", in order to remove the wordplay.&lt;ref name=nzherald&gt;{{cite web | author=Guy Adams | title=Britney forced to rerecord 'sexually offensive' song | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]| date=January 21, 2009 | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10552846 | accessdate=December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mtvone"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gil Kaufman | title=Britney Spears' 'If U Seek Amy' Poses Censorship Problems For Radio | work=MTV.com |publisher=MTV Networks| date=February 12, 2009 | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1602458/20090109/spears_britney.jhtml | accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns were raised by radio stations over The Black Eyed Peas' "[[Don't Phunk With My Heart]]" upon its release, as the word "phunk" (a deliberate misspelling of "funk") could be misinterpreted by listeners as sounding like the word "fuck".&lt;ref name=mtvone/&gt; [[Meghan Trainor]] recorded an alternate version of her debut single "[[All About That Bass]]" for Radio Disney and conservative [[adult contemporary]] stations, which removed the song's suggestive metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6266667/ac-radio-disney-are-all-about-that-edited-bass|title=AC, Radio Disney Are All About That (Edited) 'Bass'|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt;

Censorship of music is not limited to lyrical content; [[MTV]] edited the [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] song "[[Paper Planes]]" to replace sounds of gunfire in its chorus with alternative sound effects, and remove a reference to cannabis. Similar sound edits occurred when M.I.A. performed the same song on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' (broadcast by then-corporate sibling [[CBS]]). M.I.A. subsequently criticized both MTV and ''Late Show'' for censoring her song.&lt;ref name=MIAcensdoubstandard&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom  |last=Breihan |title=M.I.A. and the Double Standard of MTV Censorship|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/archives/2007/12/mia_and_the_dou.php|archivedate=February 19, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219004257/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/archives/2007/12/mia_and_the_dou.php|dead-url=yes|work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIAPlanesBlognytobserver"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://observer.com/2007/12/tube-surfing-mias-paper-planes/ | title=Tube Surfing: M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' | author=Gillian Reagen | work=[[The New York Observer]] | date=December 17, 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
Some listeners have expressed dissatisfaction over the editing of songs for radio airplay, arguing that it compromises the artistic integrity of the original song, and encourage listeners to seek out alternative platforms that are not subject to such censorship, such as digital streaming. At the same time, edits are considered a necessary concession to receive the radio airplay that can influence a song's overall performance.&lt;ref name="npr-artofclean"/&gt; [[N.W.A.]]'s debut album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' (which had attracted controversy for its song "[[Fuck tha Police]]") contains a song entitled "[[Express Yourself (N.W.A song)|Express Yourself]]", which criticizes radio censorship of music as inhibiting [[free expression]], and also criticizes other rappers for releasing inoffensive songs without profanity in order to receive radio airplay. Despite its themes, "Express Yourself" is the only song on the album to not contain profanities.&lt;ref name="smh-expressyourself"/&gt;

=== Sensitivity ===
Some songs may be pulled or downplayed by broadcasters if they are considered to be inappropriate to play in the aftermath of specific events. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], many broadcasters altered their music programming for these reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Neil | title = The Pop Life; After the Horror, Radio Stations Pull Some Songs | work= [[The New York Times]]| date = November 19, 2001 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E2D9153BF93AA2575AC0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all| accessdate = August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]], whose program directors compiled an [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum|internal list]] of "lyrically questionable" songs. The list included all [[Rage Against the Machine]] songs, as well as various songs with themes related to war, destruction, flight, or [[New York City]]. ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' noted several unusual choices on the list, including "[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]", two [[Cat Stevens]] songs (Stevens had converted to the [[Islamic faith]] and changed his name to Yusuf Islam), and [[John Lennon]]'s "explicitly pacifist anthem '[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Eliza|title=It's the End of the World as Clear Channel Knows It|work=[[Slate.com|Slate]]|date=September 17, 2001|url=http://slate.com/id/1008314/|accessdate=September 17, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015200337/http://slate.com/id/1008314/| archivedate= October 15, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="austin-imagine"&gt;{{cite web

Following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in February 2003, [[Mark Wills]]' "[[19 Somethin']]" was temporarily pulled by some radio stations as it contains a lyric referencing the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 2003|title=Singles minded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OA8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=19+Somethin+pulled+columbia+disaster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0AH0eUw4-7&amp;sig=3-MHmFYaADmGOfeiaIBV_wn0K4Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixmsaT0ObUAhUo34MKHbvADQ4Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage|journal=Billboard|volume=|pages=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s then-upcoming music video for "[[American Life (song)|American Life]]" generated controversy due to its politicized and "unpatriotic" imagery (such as a [[fashion show]] featuring women dressed in military equipment, and a scene where the singer throws a [[grenade]]-shaped [[lighter]] to a [[George W. Bush]] lookalike to light his [[cigar]]), which were considered to be especially sensitive in the wake of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]]. Due to the negative response, Madonna pulled the video prior to its planned premiere, as she did not want to "risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2003/04/01/madonna-pulls-controversial-american-life-video/|title=Madonna pulls controversial ''American Life'' video|date=2003-04-01|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/antiwar.artsfeatures|title=Madonna takes swipe at Bush|last=Child|first=Ben|date=2003-02-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, after [[Gary Glitter]] was convicted of child sexual abuse in [[Vietnam]], the [[National Football League]] banned the original recording of his song "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll]]" (which was popularly played at U.S. sporting events)&lt;ref name="SIV"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1992/11/30/127693/the-vibes-of-victory-sports-fans-know-that-the-strains-of-rock-and-roll-part-ii-can-turn-chumps-to-champs|title=Sports fans know that the strains of 'Rock and Roll Part II' can turn chumps to champs|publisher=Time Inc.|author=Lisa Twyman Bessone|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from being played at its games. While the NFL still allowed a [[cover version]] of the song to be played, in 2012 the league instructed its teams to "avoid" playing the song entirely, following negative reception from British media over its continued use by the [[New England Patriots]], and the possibility it could be played during [[Super Bowl XLVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/6273999/why-convicted-child-sex-offender-gary-glitters-hey|title=Why Convicted Child-Sex Offender Gary Glitter’s ‘Hey Song’ Is Still Getting Played|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/gary-glitter-10-1269123|title=NFL bosses ban Gary Glitter's 'Rock And Roll Part II' from the Super Bowl|date=2012-02-02|work=NME|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Chris Brown]]'s alleged physical altercation with his then-girlfriend [[Rihanna]], various radio stations began to voluntarily pull Brown's music from their playlists as a condemnation of his actions.&lt;ref name="mtv-willmore"&gt;{{cite web|title=Will More Radio Stations Stop Playing Chris Brown?|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1604845/will-more-radio-stations-stop-playing-chris-brown/|website=MTV.com|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Brown's songs, TV appearances yanked from air|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1604786/chris-browns-songs-tv-appearances-yanked-from-air/|website=MTV.com|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, [[HMV]] removed the entire catalogue of [[Lostprophets]] from its stores after the band's lead singer [[Ian Watkins (Lostprophets)|Ian Watkins]] was charged with thirteen sexual offences against children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/29/lostprophets-removed-hmv-ian-watkins|title=Lostprophets' music removed from HMV following Ian Watkins trial|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=2013-11-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
Songs and albums may, in some cases, be censored due to [[copyright]] problems (particularly related to [[Sampling (music)|sampling]]) or other legal issues.

The [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and the Australian Music Retailers Association (AMRA) maintain a self-regulatory system known as the "Recorded Music Labelling Code of Practice", which utilizes a three-tier ratings system for objectionable content in music recordings. "Level 1" applies to content of a "moderate impact" (including "infrequent aggressive or strong coarse language; or
moderate-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes"), "Level 2" for "strong impact" ("frequent aggressive or strong coarse language", or strong references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes), and "Level 3" for "high impact" content (graphic and high-impact references to drug use, violence, sexual activity or themes). The Level 3 classification was introduced in March 2003, and requires purchasers to be over the age of 18. The code bans the distribution or sale of any recording with material that exceeds Level 3 classification, which includes content "which promote, incite, instruct or exploitatively or gratuitously depict drug abuse, cruelty, suicide, criminal or sexual violence, child abuse, incest, bestiality or any other revolting or abhorrent activity in a way that causes outrage or extreme disgust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2453315.stm |title= Australia plans CD 'censorship' |work= BBC News |date= 2002-11-12|access-date= 2018-03-22 |language= en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/senate/legal_and_constitutional_affairs/completed_inquiries/2010-13/classificationboard/report/~/media/wopapub/senate/committee/legcon_ctte/completed_inquiries/2010-13/classification_board/report/c09.ashx |title= Inquiry |last=|first= |date= |website= Parliament of Australia |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date= March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian customs law also bans the import of any product that "describe[s], depict[s], express[es] or otherwise deal[s] with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-singapore-pornography/singapore-pilot-fined-in-australia-for-laptop-child-porn-idUKSIN10289320080213|title=Singapore pilot fined in Australia for laptop child porn|agency=Reuters|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, copies of an album by [[grindcore]] band Intense Hammer Rage were seized by the [[Australian Customs Service]], and the three band members were each fined [[Australian dollar|AUD$]]500 each for violating customs law.

In May 1990, Nick Franklin, acting news director of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s radio station [[Triple J]], was suspended by the ABC's management after having played a portion of [[N.W.A.]]'s song "[[Fuck tha Police]]". The song had received airplay on the station for several months, but ABC Radio head Malcom Long requested that the song be given a "rest"; in the offending segment, Franklin discussed the song's vulgar lyrics and subject matter. In protest of the suspension, Triple J staff went on strike, and the station [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunted]] by playing the N.W.A. song "Express Yourself" on a loop. The stunt ended after the ABC resolved the dispute and reinstated Long. The song was ultimately played 82 times in a row.&lt;ref name="smh-expressyourself"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/express-yourself-the-day-triple-j-played-the-same-nwa-song-82-times-in-a-row-20150902-gjdk0d.html|title=Express yourself: The day Triple J played the same N.W.A. song 82 times in a row|last=Casimir|first=Paul Chamberlin and Jon|date=2015-09-02|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, content broadcast by radio and television is self-regulated under the code of ethics of the [[Canadian Association of Broadcasters]] by a group known as the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC), which acts upon complaints submitted by the general public. The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) can intervene in more substantial cases.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

In 2011, the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic]] panel of the CBSC, in response to a complaint against [[CHOZ-FM]], ruled that the original version of [[Dire Straits]]' 1985 single, "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" violated the ethics code, because of its use of the word "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]"—a homophobic slur. However, the CRTC called upon the CBSC to review the decision with a national panel, as it "elicited a strong public reaction and created uncertainty for private radio stations across the country." In particular, the CRTC asked the CBSC to consider the overall context of the slur in relation to the rest of the song, as well as how the word was used at the time of the song's release.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/CRTC+asks+review+Dire+Straits+song/4144591/story.html|title=CRTC asks for review of Dire Straits song ban|last=Abma|first=Derek|agency=Postmedia News|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBSC overturned the ruling; while panellists agreed that the slur was inappropriate, it was considered to be satirical and non-hateful in context. It was also noted that lead singer [[Mark Knopfler]] had substituted the word himself with alternatives (such as "queenie") during live performances, which was considered an admission that his original choice in words was in bad taste. The CBSC stated that it was up to individual stations whether or not they would play the unedited version.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The ruling and controversy were ridiculed by critics; veteran Canadian radio personality [[Alan Cross]] commented that the controversy made Canada look "silly", remarking that "I talked to people from the U.S. and the U.K. and they were like, 'What's wrong with you people? Don't you get it? It's a joke. It's a satire. You didn't understand the context?" ''[[National Post]]'' columnist Chris Selley described the CBSC's new ruling as a "comedy classic" and "colossal waste of time", explaining that "it's one thing for a censor to decide whether something is legitimately artistic; it's another for it to declare whether or not it enjoys the art, as if it somehow mattered."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-selley-broadcast-standards-ruling-on-money-for-nothing-a-comedy-classic|title=Chris Selley: Broadcast Standards ruling on Money for Nothing a comedy classic|date=2011-09-01|work=National Post|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/canada-lifts-ban-on-dire-straits-money-for-nothing-20110901|title=Canada Lifts Ban on Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing'|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{See also|Censorship in China}}
During the rule of [[Mao Zedong]], "[[Yellow Music]]" became subject to criticism and censure, since the [[Communist Party of China]] saw Shanghai ''[[shidaiqu]]'' [[C-pop|pop music]]&lt;ref name="shanghai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/article/367361/shanghai-love |title=From Shanghai with love |date=31 December 2001 |work=South China Morning Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; as indecent, and critics saw the sentiments of love songs as appealing only to the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''. The genre was also criticized over its connections to American [[jazz]] music, due to [[Anti-American sentiment]] from the [[Korean War]]. This resulted in many artists associated with shidaiqu, including [[Li Jinhui]] (who had been credited as a leading figure in the genre) and [[Chen Gexin]], being branded as "[[Right-wing politics|rightists]]" and persecuted. Shanghai pop was displaced by [[Political music in China|revolutionary music]] that promoted [[Maoism]] and other ideologies of the Communist Party. In 1966, [[Tian Han]]—writer of the Chinese national anthem "[[March of the Volunteers]]"—was imprisoned over his allegorical play ''Xie Yaohuan'' (which was critical of Mao's regime) in one of the opening salvos of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. His works were banned, leading to "[[The East Is Red (song)|The East is Red]]"—a song which glorified Mao's [[cult of personality]], being used as the ''de facto'' national anthem at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiQJmCxVICcC&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Jazz Planet |editor= E.

To appeal to the country's conservatism, television broadcasters have sometimes [[List of banned K-pop videos|pulled music videos from airplay]] for containing content they deem to be inappropriate, such as violent or sexually suggestive content. While Korea's three major television networks—[[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], and [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]—have all banned videos at some point, the [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] KBS is known for doing so more often due to its stricter regulations, which additionally forbid songs that encourage inappropriate behaviour (especially among youth), or contain references to brand names or Japanese words. This results in some songs, such as [[Psy (rapper)|Psy]]'s "[[Gentleman (Psy song)|Gentleman]]" (which was banned by KBS for a scene in which the singer kicks over a [[traffic cone]]) being banned only by KBS, but still receiving airplay by other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/6531811/gain-hawwah-interview-religion-south-korea|title=Gain Goes In on New 'Hawwah' EP, Religion and South Korea's Conservative Music Industry|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170614000718|title=G-Dragon, NCT 127 songs deemed unsuitable for KBS|work=The Korea Herald|date=2017-06-14|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/04/11/10-songs-banned-korean-broadcast|title=10 songs banned from Korean broadcast|website=SBS PopAsia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/04/03/crayon-pops-uh-ee-banned-for-shiny-japanese-word/|title=Crayon Pop’s ‘Uh-ee’ Banned for Shiny Japanese Word|last=Gale|first=Alastair|date=2014-04-03|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/01/25/kbs-bans-one-shinees-jonghyuns-new-songs|title=KBS bans one of SHINee's Jonghyun's new songs|website=SBS PopAsia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/04/18/south-korean-tv-network-bans-psys-video/|title=South Korean TV Network Bans Psy’s Video|last=Kwaak|first=Jeyup S.|date=2013-04-18|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] was historically known for [[List of songs banned by the BBC|censoring]] various songs from being played on its [[BBC Radio|radio]] and [[BBC Television|television]] stations; from the 1930s through 1960s, the BBC had banned songs such as "[[Hold My Hand (1953 song)|Hold My Hand]]" for its religious references, pop arrangements of classical tunes (though barring "[[Sabre Dance]]" because it was "not a well-loved classic whose perversion we would be encouraging"), and during [[World War II]], songs that were "slushy in sentiment", such as "[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]", due to concerns that it would affect the morale of soldiers. "[[Mack the Knife]]" was also banned from airplay outside of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', as the BBC felt it would be offensive outside of the context of the play.&lt;ref name="Unfit for aunties"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/unfit-for-aunties-airwaves-the-artists-censored-by-the-bbc-765106.html|title=Unfit for Auntie's airwaves: The artists censored by the BBC|date=14 December 2007|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Kinks]]' "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" was briefly banned under the BBC's anti-[[product placement]] rules, as its lyrics contain references to the brand name [[Coca-Cola]].

The [[Sex Pistols]]' 1977 single "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was controversial upon its release, as it was critical of the British government and monarchy (among other things, referring to the United Kingdom as a "fascist regime"), and was released during the year of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|silver jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1219770.stm |title= Sex Pistols cover tops chart |publisher= BBC |accessdate= 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "God Save the Queen" was banned by the BBC and all [[independent local radio]] stations, but still peaked at #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] during the week of the official Jubilee celebration. It was alleged that the chart's rules were changed for that week only to exclude sales from record shops that sold their own records (in this case, [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]), in a deliberate effort to prevent the controversial song from reaching the number-one spot and causing wider offence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2010060.stm|title=Bragg attacks Pistols' royal views|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/apr/12/artsfeatures.popandrock|title=Leaders of the banned|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=2002-04-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/music-charting-the-number-ones-that-somehow-got-away-1145809.html|title=Music: Charting the number ones that somehow got away|date=1998-02-20|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] song "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" generated controversy due to its suggestive lyrics; the chorus contained double entendres such as "when you want to suck to it" and "when you want to come", which were interpreted as being oblique references to [[oral sex]] and [[ejaculation]] respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/27/radio-1-relax-ban-john-peel-1984-archive|title=Shake-up planned at Radio 1 after Relax ban|last=Harron|first=Mary|date=1984-01-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1984, Radio 1 morning DJ [[Mike Read]] stopped the song on-air during a chart rundown to point out its "obscene" lyrics, and announced that he would no longer play the song during his show. The BBC subsequently restricted the song to evening airplay. When the band made statements in a ''[[Daily Express]]'' interview confirming the possibility of sexual connotations in the lyrics, the BBC banned "Relax" entirely. The ban only [[Streisand effect|increased interest]] in the single, causing it to become the number-one song in Britain only two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/959284.stm|title='Banned' Frankie tops chart|date=6 October 2000|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-relaxban" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In December 2007, BBC Radio 1 began to play a version of [[The Pogues]]' popular Christmas song "[[Fairytale of New York]]" that censored the words "faggot" and "slut" from one of its verses. The BBC cited concerns over the homophobic slurs as reasoning, despite the song having historically been played without censorship. The BBC reversed the decision after it was criticized by listeners, the band itself, and the mother of the song's featured vocalist [[Kirsty MacColl]]. Radio 1 controller [[Andy Parfitt]] argued that "While we would never condone prejudice of any kind, we know our audiences are smart enough to distinguish between maliciousness and creative freedom. In the context of this song, I do not feel that there is any negative intent behind the use of the words, hence the reversal of the decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/18/bbc.radio|title=Radio 1 censors Christmas standard|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=2007-12-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7150693.stm|title=Radio 1 backs down in Pogues row|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the song's [[Sadomasochism|subject matter]] was deemed too inappropriate for airplay pre-watershed, BBC Radio 1 played an edited version of [[Rihanna]]'s song "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]" during the daytime hours, and referred to the song using the alternate title "Come On". As Rihanna objected to the censorship of the song's title, the BBC later compromised by referring to the song as "S&amp;M (Come On)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657491/rihanna-s-and-m-renamed.jhtml|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Renamed Again By BBC Radio|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=2011-08-02|work=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/music/854875-rihannas-s-m-outrage-exposed-as-pr-stunt|title=BBC Radio 1 ban 'S&amp;M' from daytime radio|date=2011-07-02|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reasons, Ofcom deemed the song's music video to be unfit for broadcast pre-watershed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the 2013 death of former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], "[[Ding-Dong!

BBC Radio 1 did not play the full song during ''[[The Official Chart]]'' programme, and instead played a short snippet accompanied by a ''[[Newsbeat]]'' report about the campaign.

"[[Liar Liar GE2017]]", a song released during the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] that is critical of prime minister [[Theresa May]], was not played by British radio stations due to broadcasting regulations in force during electoral campaigns, which forbid political advertising and require impartial coverage.&lt;ref name="wp-liarliar"&gt;{{cite web|date=31 May 2017|last=Taylor|first=Adam|title=A song that calls Britain’s Theresa May a liar is climbing the charts — but it isn’t being played on the radio|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/31/a-song-that-calls-britains-theresa-may-a-liar-is-climbing-the-charts-but-it-isnt-being-played-on-the-radio/|website=Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611100420/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/31/a-song-that-calls-britains-theresa-may-a-liar-is-climbing-the-charts-but-it-isnt-being-played-on-the-radio/|archive-date=11 June 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the suppression, the song still managed to reach #4 on the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/40129621/theresa-may-protest-track-liar-liar-ge2017-number-four-on-official-singles-chart|title=Theresa May protest track, Liar Liar GE2017, number four on Official Singles Chart|date=2017-02-06|website=BBC Newsbeat|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC), founded by [[Tipper Gore]], published the "Filthy Fifteen"—a list of fifteen songs it deemed to be the most objectionable due to their references to drugs and alcohol, sexual acts, violence, or "[[occult]]" activities.&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/pmrcs-filthy-15-where-are-they-now-20150917|title=PMRC's 'Filthy 15': Where Are They Now?|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group pushed for the adoption of a [[Content rating|ratings system]], and for lyrics to be printed on the back covers of albums so they could be previewed by parents.&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) opposed these proposals; during a [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearing on the matter in September, musicians such as [[John Denver]] and [[Frank Zappa]] argued that such guidelines would inhibit [[free expression]]. Zappa, in particular, argued that the PMRC's proposal for a method to "assist baffled parents in the determination of the 'suitability' of records listened to by 'very young children'" would reduce American music to "the intellectual level of a [[Saturday morning cartoon]]".&lt;ref name="NPR-pal" /&gt;

Following the hearings, the RIAA introduced a standard [[Parental Advisory]] label (which took its current form, reading "Parental Advisory — Explicit Content", in 1994 following subsequent hearings), which is designed to be applied to the cover art of songs and albums which may contain objectionable content; the RIAA recommends that it be used on releases containing "strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse to such an extent as to merit parental notification." The Parental Advisory label is a voluntary scheme; some retailers—particularly [[Walmart]]—adopted policies to enforce the label program by not stocking music releases which carried it.&lt;ref name="Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=parental_advisory|title=Parental Advisory Label ("PAL") Program|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=July 5, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701220958/http://riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?content_selector=parental_advisory|archivedate=July 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR-pal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/10/29/130905176/you-ask-we-answer-parental-advisory---why-when-how|title=You Ask, We Answer: 'Parental Advisory' Labels — The Criteria And The History|last=Cole|first=Tom|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gangsta rap]] generated controversies due to its often-provocative subject matter. "[[Fuck tha Police]]", a song from [[N.W.A.]]'s debut album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', proved to be particularly controversial. The song criticized [[police brutality]] and [[racial profiling]], and contained lyrics condoning violence against police officers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/08/the-worst-moments-of-the-90s-worst-band-names-worst-lyrics-worst-video/130809-worst-of-the-90s-c-delores/|title=A Decade in Rap Censorship (1990-1999)|website=Spin|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The FBI as music critic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrington|first1=Richard|title=The FBI as music critic|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/10/04/the-fbi-as-music-critic/3f9abdb7-bed1-45b2-83ca-7a6e7da59fa9/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil rights activist [[C.

Although music has been big element when it comes to the pre-Islamic cultures of Iran it became confined in courts or performed by street artists after Iran spread. Music played a large role in the lives of Islamic people. However, they were eventually told they must do without it. In fact it got to the point where music was entirely eliminated meaning no concerts were allowed of any kind and musical instruments were to be destroyed back in the late 70’s. Iran’s reason for eliminating music was because it was believed to be betraying their country and its youth. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leone|first=Massimo|date=November 2012|title=My schoolmate: protest music in present-day Iran|url=http://ky5ry5jk2j.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=My+Schoolmate%3A+Protest+Music+in+Present-Day+Iran&amp;rft.jtitle=Critical+Discourse+Studies&amp;rft.au=Leone%2C+Massimo&amp;rft.date=2012&amp;rft.issn=1740-5904&amp;rft.eissn=1740-5912&amp;rft.volume=9&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=347&amp;rft.externalDocID=R04953625&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=My schoolmate: protest music in present-day Iran|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmasi|first=Farzaneh|date=Winter 2013|title=Intimating Dissent: Popular Song, Poetry, and Politics in Pre-Revolutionary Iran|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/ethnomusicology.57.1.0057|journal=Intimating Dissent: Popular Song, Poetry, and Politics in Pre-Revolutionary Iran|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences''' ('''NATAS''') was created in 1955 to advance the arts and sciences of television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lonestaremmy.org/about/history/|title=History {{!}} National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences – Lone Star|website=lonestaremmy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in New York, NATAS's membership is national and the organization has local chapters around the country. It was also known as the '''National Television Academy''' until 2007.

== Organization ==

One of its past presidents, [[Don DeFore]], was instrumental in arranging for the [[Emmy Award]]s to be broadcast on national TV for the first time on March 7, 1955. Other past presidents include John Cannon, Peter Price and [[Frank Radice]].

In June 2002, the Board of Trustees of the [[National Television Academy]] (NTA) unanimously approved the formation of the Lone Star Chapter in [[Texas]], and in four years, the chapter has grown to become one of the largest in the country.&lt;ref name="urlLone Star Chapter of NATAS - About Us"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lonestaremmy.org/_about_us/overview.php |title=Lone Star Chapter of NATAS - About Us |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}Academy Formation and Boundary&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

NATAS distributes several groups of Emmy Awards, including the [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, the [[Sports Emmy Award]]s, the [[News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award|News and Documentary Emmy Awards]], the [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award|Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards]], and "Public Service".

NATAS also supervised the primetime Emmy Awards until a split between the East and West memberships in the 1970s led to the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] leaving NATAS. ATAS supervises the primetime and Los Angeles area Emmys, while NATAS is in charge of the other Emmy honors. In 2007, the organization spawned a peer organization dedicated to new media, called the National Academy of Media Arts &amp; Sciences (NAMAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmyonline.org/namas/|title=NATAS|publisher=Emmy Online|accessdate=May 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922021711/http://www.emmyonline.org/namas/|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local NATAS chapters organize award ceremonies of their own, handing out Emmy statues similar to those given out at the national ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/chapters.html |title=The Emmy Awards - National Academy Chapters |publisher=Emmyonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922040419/http://www.emmyonline.org/chapters.html |archivedate=2009-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lone Star Emmy Awards are a division of the NATAS. The division was founded in 2002 and in addition to granting the Lone Star Emmy Awards, it recognizes awards scholarships, honors industry veterans at the Silver Circle Celebration, conducts National Student Television Awards of Excellence, has a free research and a nationwide job bank. The chapter also participates in judging Emmy entries at the regional and national levels.&lt;ref name="urlLone Star EMMY Educational Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lonestaremmy.org/awards/ |title=Lone Star EMMY Educational Foundation |author=[[NATAS]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}Educational Information&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plagiarism detection''' is the process of locating instances of [[plagiarism]] within a work or document. The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet has made it easier to plagiarize the work of others. Most cases of plagiarism are found in academia, where documents are typically essays or reports. However, plagiarism can be found in virtually any field, including novels, scientific papers, art designs, and source code.

Detection of plagiarism can be either manual or software-assisted. Manual detection requires substantial effort and excellent memory, and is impractical in cases where too many documents must be compared, or original documents are not available for comparison. Software-assisted detection allows vast collections of documents to be compared to each other, making successful detection much more likely.  

The practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software is known as [[rogeting]].&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Jack|title=Sinister buttocks? Roget would blush at the crafty cheek  Middlesex lecturer gets to the bottom of meaningless phrases found while marking essays|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/sinister-buttocks-roget-would-blush-at-the-crafty-cheek/2015027.article|accessdate=15 July 2015|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software-assisted detection==
Computer-assisted plagiarism detection (CaPD) is an [[Information retrieval|Information retrieval (IR)]] task supported by specialized IR systems, referred to as plagiarism detection systems (PDS).

===In text documents===
Systems for text-plagiarism detection implement one of two generic detection approaches, one being external, the other being intrinsic.&lt;ref name="Stein07"/&gt;
External detection systems compare a suspicious document with a reference collection, which is a set of documents assumed to be genuine.&lt;ref name=Potthast09/&gt;
Based on a chosen [[Information retrieval#Model types|document model]] and predefined similarity criteria, the detection task is to retrieve all documents that contain text that is similar to a degree above a chosen threshold to text in the suspicious document.&lt;ref name=Stein07a/&gt;
Intrinsic PDS solely analyze the text to be evaluated without performing comparisons to external documents. This approach aims to recognize changes in the unique writing style of an author as an indicator for potential plagiarism.&lt;ref name=MeyerZuEissen06/&gt;
PDS are not capable of reliably identifying plagiarism without human judgment. Similarities are computed with the help of predefined document models and might represent false positives.&lt;ref name=Bao06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clough00/&gt;&lt;ref name="Culwin01"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancaster03/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer07/&gt;

====Effectiveness of in higher education settings====
{{onesource|section|date=December 2017}}
A study was conducted to test the effectiveness of plagiarism detection software in a higher education setting. One part of the study assigned one group of students to write a paper. These students were first educated about plagiarism and informed that their work was to be run through a plagiarism detection system. A second group of students was assigned to write a paper without any information about plagiarism. The researchers expected to find lower rates in group one but found roughly the same rates of plagiarism in both groups.&lt;ref name="Youmans"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Youmans|first1=Robert J.|title=Does the adoption of plagiarism-detection software in higher education reduce plagiarism?|journal=Studies in Higher Education|date=November 2011|volume=36|issue=7|pages=749–761|doi=10.1080/03075079.2010.523457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Approaches====
The figure below represents a classification of all detection approaches currently in use for computer-assisted plagiarism detection. The approaches are characterized by the type of similarity assessment they undertake: global or local. Global similarity assessment approaches use the characteristics taken from larger parts of the text or the document as a whole to compute similarity, while local methods only examine pre-selected text segments as input.

[[File:PDS Classification.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Classification of computer-assisted plagiarism detection methods]]

=====Fingerprinting=====
Fingerprinting is currently the most widely applied approach to plagiarism detection. This method forms representative digests of documents by selecting a set of multiple substrings ([[n-gram]]s) from them. The sets represent the fingerprints and their elements are called minutiae.&lt;ref name=Hoad03/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein05/&gt;
A suspicious document is checked for plagiarism by computing its fingerprint and querying minutiae with a precomputed index of fingerprints for all documents of a reference collection. Minutiae matching with those of other documents indicate shared text segments and suggest potential plagiarism if they exceed a chosen similarity threshold.&lt;ref name="Brin95"/&gt; Computational resources and time are limiting factors to fingerprinting, which is why this method typically only compares a subset of minutiae to speed up the computation and allow for checks in very large collection, such as the Internet.&lt;ref name=Hoad03 /&gt;

=====String matching=====
[[String matching]] is a prevalent approach used in computer science. When applied to the problem of plagiarism detection, documents are compared for verbatim text overlaps. Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this task, of which some have been adapted to external plagiarism detection. Checking a suspicious document in this setting requires the computation and storage of efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection to compare them pairwise. Generally, suffix document models, such as [[suffix tree]]s or suffix vectors, have been used for this task. Nonetheless, substring matching remains computationally expensive, which makes it a non-viable solution for checking large collections of documents.&lt;ref name=Monostori00/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker93/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khmelev03/&gt;

=====Bag of words=====
Bag of words analysis represent the adoption of [[Vector space model|vector space retrieval]], a traditional IR concept, to the domain of plagiarism detection. Documents are represented as one or multiple vectors, e.g. for different document parts, which are used for pair wise similarity computations. Similarity computation may then rely on the traditional [[Cosine similarity|cosine similarity measure]], or on more sophisticated similarity measures.&lt;ref name=Si97/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreher07"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muhr09/&gt;

=====Citation analysis=====
Citation-based plagiarism detection (CbPD)&lt;ref name=Gipp14/&gt; relies on [[citation analysis]], and is the only approach to plagiarism detection that does not rely on the textual similarity.&lt;ref name=Gipp10/&gt; CbPD examines the citation and reference information in texts to identify similar [[pattern]]s in the citation sequences. As such, this approach is suitable for scientific texts, or other academic documents that contain citations. Citation analysis to detect plagiarism is a relatively young concept. It has not been adopted by commercial software, but a first prototype of a citation-based plagiarism detection system exists.&lt;ref name=Gipp13/&gt; Similar order and proximity of citations in the examined documents are the main criteria used to compute citation pattern similarities. Citation patterns represent subsequences non-exclusively containing citations shared by the documents compared.&lt;ref name=Gipp10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp11a/&gt; Factors, including the absolute number or relative fraction of shared citations in the pattern, as well as the probability that citations co-occur in a document are also considered to quantify the patterns’ degree of similarity.&lt;ref name=Gipp10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp11a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp09/&gt;

=====Stylometry=====
[[Stylometry]] subsumes statistical methods for quantifying an author’s unique writing style&lt;ref name=Holmes98/&gt;&lt;ref name=Juola08/&gt; and is mainly used for authorship attribution or intrinsic CaPD. By constructing and comparing stylometric models for different text segments, passages that are stylistically different from others, hence potentially plagiarized, can be detected.&lt;ref name=MeyerZuEissen06 /&gt;

====Performance====
Comparative evaluations of plagiarism detection systems&lt;ref name=Potthast09 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTW04/&gt;&lt;ref name=HTW08/&gt;&lt;ref name=HTW10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Potthast10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Potthast11/&gt; indicate that their performance depends on the type of plagiarism present (see figure). Except for citation pattern analysis, all detection approaches rely on textual similarity. It is therefore symptomatic that detection accuracy decreases the more plagiarism cases are obfuscated.

[[File:PD Methods Detection Performance.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Detection performance of CaPD approaches depending on the type of plagiarism being present]]

Literal copies, aka copy and paste (c&amp;p) plagiarism, or modestly disguised plagiarism cases can be detected with high accuracy by current external PDS if the source is accessible to the software. Especially substring matching procedures achieve a good performance for c&amp;p plagiarism, since they commonly use lossless document models, such as [[suffix tree]]s. The performance of systems using fingerprinting or bag of words analysis in detecting copies depends on the information loss incurred by the document model used. By applying flexible chunking and selection strategies, they are better capable of detecting moderate forms of disguised plagiarism when compared to substring matching procedures.

Intrinsic plagiarism detection using [[stylometry]] can overcome the boundaries of textual similarity to some extent by comparing linguistic similarity. Given that the stylistic differences between plagiarized and original segments are significant and can be identified reliably, stylometry can help in identifying disguised and [[Paraphrasing of copyrighted material|paraphrased]] plagiarism. Stylometric comparisons are likely to fail in cases where segments are strongly paraphrased to the point where they more closely resemble the personal writing style of the plagiarist or if a text was compiled by multiple authors. The results of the International Competitions on Plagiarism Detection held in 2009, 2010 and 2011,&lt;ref name="Potthast09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Potthast10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Potthast11" /&gt; as well as experiments performed by Stein,&lt;ref name=Stein11/&gt; indicate that stylometric analysis seems to work reliably only for document lengths of several thousand or tens of thousands of words, which limits the applicability of the method to CaPD settings.

An increasing amount of research is performed on methods and systems capable of detecting translated plagiarisms. Currently, cross-language plagiarism detection (CLPD) is not viewed as a mature technology&lt;ref name=Potthast10a/&gt; and respective systems have not been able to achieve satisfying detection results in practice.&lt;ref name=HTW10 /&gt;

Citation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches, because it is independent of textual characteristics.&lt;ref name=Gipp10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp11 /&gt; However, since citation-pattern analysis depends on the availability of sufficient citation information, it is limited to academic texts. It remains inferior to text-based approaches in detecting shorter plagiarized passages, which are typical for cases of copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism; the latter refers to mixing slightly altered fragments from different sources.&lt;ref name=Weber-Wulff08/&gt;

====Software====
	The design of plagiarism detection software for use with text documents is characterized by a number of factors:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

|}

Most large-scale plagiarism detection systems use large, internal databases (in addition to other resources) that grow with each additional document submitted for analysis. However, this feature is considered by some as a [[Turnitin#Concerns about violation of student copyright in the United States|violation of student copyright]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===In source code===
Plagiarism in computer source code is also frequent, and requires different tools than those used for text comparisons in document. Significant research has been dedicated to academic source-code plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/assessment/plagiarism/research_sourcecode.html "Plagiarism Prevention and Detection - On-line Resources on Source Code Plagiarism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115105655/http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/assessment/plagiarism/research_sourcecode.html |date=15 November 2012 }}. [[Higher Education Academy]], [[University of Ulster]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinctive aspect of source-code plagiarism is that there are no [[essay mill]]s, such as can be found in traditional plagiarism. Since most programming assignments expect students to write programs with very specific requirements, it is very difficult to find existing programs that already meet them. Since integrating external code is often harder than writing it from scratch, most plagiarizing students choose to do so from their peers.

According to Roy and Cordy,&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Chanchal Kumar;Cordy, James R. (26 September 2007).[http://research.cs.queensu.ca/TechReports/Reports/2007-541.pdf "A Survey on Software Clone Detection Research"].

* Strings – look for exact textual matches of segments, for instance five-word runs. Fast, but can be confused by renaming identifiers.
* Tokens – as with strings, but using a [[Lexical analysis|lexer]] to convert the program into [[token (parser)|token]]s first. This discards whitespace, comments, and identifier names, making the system more robust to simple text replacements. Most academic plagiarism detection systems work at this level, using different algorithms to measure the similarity between token sequences.
* [[parse tree|Parse Trees]] – build and compare parse trees. This allows higher-level similarities to be detected. For instance, tree comparison can normalize conditional statements, and detect equivalent constructs as similar to each other.
* [[call graph|Program Dependency Graphs]] (PDGs) – a PDG captures the actual flow of control in a program, and allows much higher-level equivalences to be located, at a greater expense in complexity and calculation time.
* Metrics – metrics capture 'scores' of code segments according to certain criteria; for instance, "the number of loops and conditionals", or "the number of different variables used". Metrics are simple to calculate and can be compared quickly, but can also lead to false positives: two fragments with the same scores on a set of metrics may do entirely different things.
* Hybrid approaches – for instance, parse trees + [[suffix tree]]s can combine the detection capability of parse trees with the speed afforded by suffix trees, a type of string-matching data structure.

The previous classification was developed for [[code refactoring]], and not for academic plagiarism detection (an important goal of refactoring is to avoid duplicate code, referred to as [[code clone]]s in the literature). The above approaches are effective against different levels of similarity; low-level similarity refers to identical text, while high-level similarity can be due to similar specifications. In an academic setting, when all students are expected to code to the same specifications, functionally equivalent code (with high-level similarity) is entirely expected, and only low-level similarity is considered as proof of cheating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15287">A '''re-edited film''' is a [[film]] that has been [[film editing|modified]] from its original [[theatrical release]]. These films are typically preceded by the disclaimer, "''This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen and edited for content''." Reasons for this type of editing may range from the distributor's demands to accommodating different audience groups. Fan-made movie edits are often met with controversy, as they bring up issues of copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120601/03533819162/fan-made-movie-edits-another-cultural-loss-hands-copyright.shtml|title=Fan-Made Movie Edits: Another Cultural Loss At The Hands Of Copyright|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of re-editing ==
There are three main types of film editing: format, length, and content.
* '''Format''': Feature films are commonly produced in a [[widescreen]] 1.85:1 aspect ratio or 2.40:1 aspect ratio. which is different from the screen formats television currently has – A standard 1.33:1 (or 4:3) aspect ratio of [[analog television]] and the growing standard of 1.77:1 (or 16:9) aspect ratio for [[digital television]]. Prior to the beginning of a film presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio on [[VHS]] tapes or [[DVD]]s, a disclaimer appears (mainly a black background), reading, ''This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.'' Since the adoption of [[High-definition television|HD]] television, some theatrical films intended for 2.39 or 2.40 aspect ratios have been reframed for 1.78 (16x9) for television and home video, and also require the modification warning as per [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]] rules.
* '''Length''': Films may be shortened for [[television]] [[broadcasting]] or for use on [[airline]]s.  DVD releases of films may also contain longer cuts.  In a growing trend, more and more films are being released in an ''Unrated'' cut of the film. Prior to when TV airings of the film begins, a format screen appears reading, "''The following film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit this screen, to run in the time allotted and edited for content''" (see below).  The end credits on TV airings of films sometimes speed up to make time for the next show or film to start, or to free up more airtime for advertisements, which has become an increasingly-common practice.
* '''Content''': Some films have content deemed "objectionable" to "family audiences": [[sexual content]], [[obscene language]], [[graphic violence]], and perceived racial insensitivity.  To make these films suitable for younger or more typical audiences, or to appeal to [[advertisers]] when a film is shown on [[basic cable]] or [[broadcast]] TV, alternative versions are created with such content removed or replaced. Often, [[profanities]] are replaced with [[minced oath]]s.  The editing of these versions is performed by a censor and not the producer or director of the work. In addition, a film is often times edited if it receives the NC-17 (No one 17 and under admitted) rating from the MPAA, as NC-17 rated films are not screened at mainstream cinemas or advertised on television. Therefore, studios will often re-edit the film to achieve an R rating instead.  

== Re-editing techniques ==
There are two main techniques for re-editing films:

=== Manual re-editing ===
Purchased film content is downloaded onto an editing work station hard drive and third-party editors manually re-edit the video and audio tracks, removing objectionable content.  The re-edited version is then copied onto media (VHS or DVD) and made available for rental or purchase provided an original version has been purchased in correlation with the re-edited copy. Some manual re-edits are done by fans (see ''[[The Phantom Edit]]'') to cut a film to their own – or their peers – specifications.

Although the recent court ruling prohibits business from manually re-editing commercial films, the law still allows for individuals to self censor and edit their own films for personal use.

=== Programmed re-editing ===
Programmed re-editing occurs when software (such as that employed in a DVD player) is used to skip portions of the video and/or audio content on-the-fly according to pre-programmed instruction sets which are knowingly used by the consumer.

==Opening disclaimers==
In any case, theatrical films that aired on television in the 1970s and most of the 1980s would simply have an "Edited For Television" disclaimer superimposed right after the opening credits, or, in a few cases, superimposed over the movie title card itself, just below the title. However, today, when a theatrical film or television special is aired on network or syndicated television or is re-issued on video in a form different from its original version, variations of the following disclaimers appear:
* ''"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.''"
* ''"The following film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen."''
* ''"This film has been modified as follows from its original version: It has been formatted to fit your screen."''
* Depending on content and time, the disclaimer will add: ''"...to run in the time allotted and for content."'' or ''"...and to run in the time allotted."'' or ''"...and edited for content."''
* Disney films prepared for television by [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] and other select TV stations will have: ''"This film has been edited for television"'', or ''"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been edited for television and formatted to fit this screen."''
* Many DVD releases that contain versions of films different from the theatrical releases, such as [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment|Universal Studios Home Video]]'s ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' director's cut DVD will have: ''"This film has been modified from its original version to include additional material not in the original release."''
* In the instance of black-and-white films that have been [[film colorization|colorized]], there will often be a disclaimer such as the following: ''"This is a colorized version of a film originally marketed and distributed to the public in black and white. It has been altered without the participation of the principal director, screenwriter, and other creators of the original film."''

== History of manual re-editing ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Early cases of this practice go back to the [[Nazism|Nazis]], who regularly stole prints of American movies from European countries during their [[Blitzkrieg]] raids. They would then either cheaply reanimate the movie (see ''[[Hochzeit im Korallenmeer]]''), or they would change the names in the credits (as with [[Max and David Fleischer]]'s cartoons).

As theatrical movies began to air on television, networks successfully sought permission to air shortened versions of movies. These TV version of theatrical films had scenes or sections of movies cut out, in order to provide a length short enough to fit in fixed number normal television half-hour-based time slots (often four half-hour slots). This also allowed scenes unsuitable for television to be cut or trimmed such as those with sex or graphic violence. On the other hand, networks would also often add footage deleted from a film's theatrical release to pad out a certain running time (3 to 4 hours).

In response to consumer demand, families began to re-edit purchased VHS tapes literally by making cuts and splices to the tape. A hotbed for this activity has been Utah with its conservative and entrepreneurial population. When [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']] was released on VHS, a video store owner in Utah began offering to re-edit purchased copies of the film for a $5 service fee. The service became very popular. Before long, several video rental businesses purchased VHS tapes and had them re-edited for their rental club/co-op members to watch.

At the end of the 1990s, some small companies began selling copies of movies, without the violent, indecent or foul language parts, to appeal to the family audience. By 2003, [[Hollywood]] reacted against these unauthorized modifications, as it considered them to be a destruction of the filmmakers work, and a violation of the controls an author has over his or her works. Famous directors and producers, such as [[Steven Spielberg]], have publicly criticized this practice in magazines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

When DVD technology emerged, the re-editing industry began offering for sale or rental a disabled DVD accompanied by a re-edited version of the film on a coupled DVD-R  Several companies attempted this business. First, some tried to do it via physical brick and mortar stores, the most successful being the deal model and proprietary stores owned by [[CleanFlicks]], Inc. of Utah. [[Clean Films]] later became the largest and most successful company in the business by employing an online rental model (similar to [[Netflix]]) and avoiding any physical stores. CleanFlicks and CleanFilms were sued with several others and a federal judge in Colorado ruled that the companies were violating copyright. Those named in the lawsuit ceased renting and selling edited films. The legal argument was that the editing resulted in a derivation on a fixed media. At all times, for instance, CleanFilms sold edited films with a legitimately purchased original copy.  Furthermore, every rented unit in edited format had a corresponding original copy that was purchased at retail.  The judge ruled that the fixed media caused the violation. [[ClearPlay]] was not affected by this ruling, as they did not sell fixed media, and editing took place as the unaltered streamed media was altered by the consumer's control of ClearPlay's software.

The lawsuit started because a CleanFlicks franchisee in Colorado pre-emptively sued major directors. The franchisee feared the directors were going to sue because the DGA's website said as much. The [[Directors Guild of America]] and the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] counter-sued and also included several edited film companies for [[copyright infringement]] and claims regarding derivative works. In 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch of the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]] ruled that it was a copyright violation to distribute re-edited films without the consent from the film studios (key was the fixed media aspect of the businesses).

In an odd twist, despite Judge Matsch's decision and order to the re-editing companies to destroy all their re-edited inventory, shortly after the studios' victory in the Denver court, the lawyers for the studios negotiated with lawyers for the re-editing companies allowing for the sale of existing inventory. One of the companies in the first three days of a "going out of business sale" generated more than a quarter of a million dollars in revenue and eventually sold enough re-edited movies to provide original investors a five times or better return on investment. This is an unexpected investor outcome given the loss of a major infringement case.

Less controversial than external bodies editing movies were the rise of [[director's cut]] editions of movies, which flourished with the advent of [[DVD]]s. These restore (and occasionally also shorten or omit, as in the case of [[Alien (film)|Alien]]) scenes or footage from movies which had been shortened for whatever reason (including studio interference with the directors creative vision, inability to finish what was intended due to technology, or even the reactions of test audiences).

== History of programmed re-editing ==
[[ClearPlay]] was sued by the DGA and MPAA, but the case was rendered moot by [[Family Entertainment and Copyright Act|The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005]], which clarified that ClearPlay's filtering approach was legal and did not violate copyright law. As a result, ClearPlay has been able to offer its products to consumers in the U.S. while others have discontinued for legal reasons.

Another aspect of re-editing comes with consumer made edits, which are called [[fan edit]]s (or fanedits). It is when consumers load the films into their computers and use video editing software to produce mostly a version with changed content for their own entertainment. Fan edits are becoming more popular since they are spread over the internet.

== Future of the industry ==
It is unclear where this industry is headed.  There is demand for the product.{{original research?|date=January 2017}} A 2005 [[ABC News]] poll of 1,002 adults from across the United States found that 39% of those polled were interested in purchasing re-edited films, while 58% of respondents said that would not be interested in such a purchase (with a 3-point error margin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=692068 "ABC News Poll"]. (2005, April 22).  Poll: Mixed Reviews for 'Sanitized' Movies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the aforementioned legal rulings, companies continue to sell re-edited movies via the Internet. Some have been shut down as well. Yet, search engine results on the web reveal companies continue to provide fixed media products, such as Clean Play DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/|title=Edited Movies and Clean Family Edited DVDS for Sale ,|date=9 January 2011|website=archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109164222/http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/|archivedate=9 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes they use "going out of business" tactics to move inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/?gclid=CICOp_z1p6cCFQpvbAodLGjD_w|title=Edited Movies and Clean Family Edited DVDS for Sale ,|date=8 July 2011|website=archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708163539/http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/?gclid=CICOp_z1p6cCFQpvbAodLGjD_w|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, physical "brick and mortar" stores have been shut down, such as Cougar Video in Provo, Utah, which remained open long after the named companies in the aforementioned lawsuit were closed down.

One company, Swank, offers re-edited movies created by the studios themselves, supposedly for showings in correctional facilities and other non-theatrical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.swankmp.com/insti/edited.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510012800/http://college.swankmp.com/insti/edited.asp |archivedate=2011-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if these versions are the same re-edited versions that studios create for airlines or television showings.

"'''Red Hot Catholic Love'''" is the 87th episode of the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on July 3, 2002. It was selected No. 2 on the "10 South Parks that Changed the World" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-039-South-Park-039-Episodes-that-Changed-the-World-36019.shtml|title=The 'South Park' Episodes that Changed the World|author=Elena Gorgan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612151952/http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-039-South-Park-039-Episodes-that-Changed-the-World-36019.shtml|archivedate=2011-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also part of "South Park's Dirty Dozen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletterarchive.org/2007/06/13/173395-South+Park+Booster+Club+Newsletter+-+The+Dirty+Dozen The Dirty Dozen] South Park Club Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Father Maxi travels to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to confront the growing problem of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic priests molesting children]]. Meanwhile, Cartman discovers that it is possible to defecate from the mouth.

==Plot==
The parents of South Park are a bit concerned when [[List of recurring South Park characters#Father Maxi|Father Maxi]] informs them about the Young Men's Catholic Retreat and agree that they do not want their kids to go. They also decide to have a [[Mental Health Counselor|counselor]] talk to the boys to find out if the priest had been [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] them. The counselor, assuming the children were molested, asks, "Did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt?" Having never been abused by Father Maxi, the boys are completely baffled about the question's meaning. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] has a "brilliant" idea, reasoning she meant it could be possible that eating food through the rectum can cause defecation through the mouth. The other boys (especially [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]) think it is stupid and disgusting, and Cartman bets him $20 it will work. While the counselor is questioning the boys, all the parents decide to become [[atheism|atheists]], as the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sexual molestation scandals]] have destroyed their faith in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[God]].

Cartman ultimately does defecate out of his mouth, winning the bet and continually boasts the fact to Kyle, who becomes increasingly angered by it. News of this spreads, and it is concluded nationwide that this method of eating is much healthier than the traditional method (with the surgeon general basing that on "absolutely nothing"). The adults of South Park immediately adopt the new method of eating, calling it ''interorectogestion'' and even start passing trash cans around at social situations to openly collect the waste (literally "spewing crap from their mouths"), completely disregarding the previously long-held custom that defecation should occur in private. 

Meanwhile, Maxi has gathered a meeting of Catholic priests in Colorado to discuss the problem of child molestation. Maxi is appalled by such behavior and wants it to cease entirely, but to Maxi's horror, all of the other priests there have molested their altar boys. Maxi decides he has to go to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]]. Once there, he quickly finds the same: priests from all over the world (and from other worlds, specifically an alien race known as the Gelgameks) are molesting children and claim [[Catholic sex abuse cases#Celibacy theory|they need to continue the practice to receive gratification]]. They claim the "Holy Document of Vatican Law" does not prohibit the behavior, so Maxi wants to change the canon law to outlaw sodomy, as well as to [[clerical marriage|allow sex with women]]. The Cardinal tells him that the Document cannot be changed as no one knows where it is. Maxi decides to try to find it. Meanwhile, Kyle has lost his patience with Cartman's incessant boasting and tells Cartman that he accepts the fact that he beat him fairly. This angers Cartman, as he wanted to hold the victorious bet over Kyle's head indefinitely.

Maxi searches through the lower levels of the Vatican, and goes through a gauntlet in the style of ''[[Pitfall!]]'' in order to reach the Holy Document. But the [[Pope John Paul II|Pope]] says they must first consult the highest power. He summons the "Queen Spider", which has for centuries been responsible for the pedophilia in the church, and declares that the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed. Angered by this, Maxi finally snaps and tears the Document in two, and [[St. Peter's Basilica|the building]] begins to crumble. Maxi stands in front of the ruins, and tells everyone that Catholicism is not about the Holy Document of Vatican Law, molestation, or Queen Spiders, but about being a good person. He says by clouding the moral lessons of the [[Bible]] with needless ceremony and so many literal translations, the Vatican has caused people to reject religion and argues that "when they have no mythology to live their lives by, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths". The parents, watching this on TV, regain their faith in God, deciding to stop shoving food up their rectum and to start going to church again, wanting to owe God an apology.

==Production==
In the DVD commentary for this episode, [[Matt Stone|Stone]] and Parker refer to their irritation towards arguments from more socially liberal/atheistic/secular minded types of people, as well as from socially religious conservatives.  The scene where the parents discuss atheism while crapping out their mouths is based on Parker's annoyance with atheists. When Maxi searches for the Holy Document the scene is animated in the style of ''[[Pitfall!]]'' Randy's nightmare about the priest molesting the boys is done using footage from [[The Love Boat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2005|title=South Park: The Complete Sixth Season: "Red Hot Catholic Love" ''(Audio commentary)'' |medium= DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rod and ring symbol''' is a symbol that is depicted on Mesopotamian [[stela]]s, [[cylinder seal]]s and [[relief]]s. It is held by a god or goddess and in most cases is being offered to a king who is standing, often making a sacrifice, or otherwise showing respect. The symbol dates from the [[Sumerian Renaissance]] to the [[Neo-Assyrian Period]], and is commonly explained as a [[wiktionary:coil|coil]] of [[measuring string]] and a [[yardstick]].&lt;ref name="TJ"&gt;Jacobsen, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories are that they are a [[shepherd's crook]] and a [[nose rope]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallo, W.W. 2005. Sumerian history in pictures: a new look at the ‘Stele of the Flying Angels’, in: Y. Sefati et al (eds), ‘An Experienced Scribe who Neglects Nothing’: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Honor of Jacob Klein. Bethesda, MD: CDL Press, 142-62.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the ring is no rope at all.&lt;ref&gt;Van Buren, E.D. 1949. The rod and ring. ArO 17 (2), 434-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the symbol is seen on the [[Code of Hammurabi]] stela. The most elaborate depiction is found on the  [[Ur-Nammu]]-stela, where the winding of the cords has been detailed by the sculptor. This has also been described as a "staff and a chaplet of beads".&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, Anthony Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia'', Rod and Ring, p 156.&lt;/ref&gt; There is discussion whether the Ur-Nammu-stela is showing the same thing.

The myth of [[Inanna]]'s descent to the nether world describes how the goddess dresses and prepares herself: "She held the lapis-lazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand."&lt;ref&gt;cf.

The Sumerian has: gi-diš-'''nindan''' '''eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' za-gin&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; šu ba-ni-in-du&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; i.e. taken literally the rod would have the length of one ''nindan'' (6 cubit = 5.94m) and the eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  the surveyor's line - would be ten ''nindan'' in length.&lt;/ref&gt;

In tablet IV of the [[Enuma Elish]], the rod and ring symbol is referenced as:
:"They rejoiced, and they did homage unto him, saying, "[[Marduk]] is King!"&lt;br&gt;They bestowed upon him the scepter, and the throne, and the ring.&lt;br&gt;They gave him an invincible weaponry which overwhelmeth the foe."&lt;ref&gt;Enuma Elish, tablet IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols that appear similar==
*The Egyptian [[Shen ring]] has an identical resemblance.
*The Greek goddess [[Nike (goddess)|Nike]] uses a different type of [[investiture]] symbol for the victor in the sporting races, a ''wreath of laurel'', or a wreath of olive branches, but she is depicted with a ring, a rigid circle.
*The [[Faravahar]], the symbol of [[Zoroastrianism]], also holds a ring.
*The Egyptian [[Ankh]] has a vaguely similar form but is used in very different contexts.
*At the 6th century B.C.E. archaeological site of [[Cancho Roano]], located near [[Zalamea de la Serena]], Badajoz, Spain, a large feature in the shape of the rod and ring symbol was modeled into the floor of the innermost chamber of a [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] temple.
*This symbol also bears a resemblance to an ancient rune called a [[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]] or thorn, which means "frost giant" or "giant".

'''Siegmund L’Allemand''' (8 March 1840, [[Vienna]] - 24 December 1910, Vienna) was an Austrian painter, known for history and war scenes, [[Genre art|genre]] works and portraits.

== Biography ==
His father, Thaddäus (1810-1872), was an engraver and his uncle was the history painter, {{ill|Fritz L’Allemand|de}}, who gave him his first lessons. His had his formal studies at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna]], with [[Christian Ruben]] and [[Karl von Blaas]].&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{ÖBL|4|409||L’Allemand Siegmund|Schöny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, he became a member of the [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]]. Later that year, he served as a battle painter in the [[Second Schleswig War]]. Two years later, he served in the same capacity in the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], an offshoot of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], and participated in the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]]. His uncle, Fritz, died that same year and Siegmund completed his unfinished paintings.&lt;ref name="O" /&gt;

After 1883, he was a Professor at the Academy in Vienna. In October, 1907, he was a member of the Examination Board (chaired by [[Christian Griepenkerl]]) that voted to reject [[Adolf Hitler]]'s application for admission to the school.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brigitte Hamann]]: ''Hitlers Wien. Lehrjahre eines Diktators''. Piper. München 1996. {{ISBN|3-492-03598-1}}; pg.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

He received numerous awards, including a medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)]], the Reichel Prize from the Academy (1876) and the "[[Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria|Karl Ludwig]] Medal" in 1879.&lt;ref name="O" /&gt;

He was interred at the [[Zentralfriedhof]]. Many of his works are on display at the [[Museum of Military History, Vienna]]; notably a monumental portrait of Ernst Gideon von Laudon that was created for the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]].

'''Spray-on hair''' or '''hair in a can''' is a [[hairstyling product]] consisting of an [[aerosol spray]] applied to [[balding]] areas of the [[scalp]] to create artificial [[hair]] covering that area. Spray-on hair generally works in one of two ways. Either it directly colors the scalp and enhances whatever hair is in the area by thickening it, or it generates hair-like filaments that cling to the scalp and existing hair.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Rassman, Robert M. Bernstein, ''Hair Loss and Replacement For Dummies'' (2008), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spray-on hair was one of the products pioneered by [[Ronco]] in the 1980s, under the name "GLH-9" (Great Looking Hair Formula #9).&lt;ref&gt;Gersh Kuntzman, ''Hair!: Mankind's Historic Quest to End Baldness'' (2001), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The product "was popular in the 1990s with 30-minute infomercials for the product on late-night cable TV",&lt;ref name="Segreve"&gt;Kerry Segrave, ''Baldness: A Social History'' (1996), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ronco version sold over a half million cans.&lt;ref name="Segreve"/&gt;

In the [[documentary TV series]] ''[[Bald!]]'', spray-on hair is one of the products tried by a participant on the show, with poor results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4151">'''Syndell Studio''' was an [[art gallery]] located in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], California, between 1954 and 1956.

==History==
Syndell Studio was founded in 1954 by [[Walter Hopps]] and [[Jim Newman (television producer)|Jim Newman]], with Michael Scoles, poet Ben Bartosh and his wife Betty Brunt. It was located at 11756 Gorham Avenue, Brentwood, in a (no longer extant) building constructed from used pier pilings and remnants from a demolished [[Santa Monica]] beach club.&lt;ref name=brad&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradnock|first1=Lucy|title=Walter Hopps's Los Angeles Pastoral|journal=Art Journal|date=2012|volume=71|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to oral history interviews with Hopps, Newman, and artist [[Edward Kienholz]], the gallery was named after Maurice Sindel, a Midwestern farmer who died on the highway in Ohio on 6 June 1953.&lt;ref name=Peabody&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peabody|first1=Rebecca et al. (eds)|title=Pacific Standard Time: Los Angeles Art, 1945-80|date=2011|publisher=Getty|location=Los Angeles|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohio Department of Health|title=Certificate of Death|journal=Ohio Historical Society|pages=state file no. 42714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident was witnessed by Newman as he drove from [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]] to Los Angeles. Hopps stated, "It's just too absurd, that this man dies in obscurity. We're going to make him an artist. We're going to create work for him. We're going to put him in group shows. We're going to name our place after him, as though it had been his studio".&lt;ref name=brad/&gt;

The gallery's business cards were created by poet and printmaker Robert Alexander. Alexander and [[Wallace Berman]] designed invitations to exhibitions.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Exhibitions==
On 21 October 1956, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art critic [[Jules Langsner]]  wrote, "For a glimpse of avant-garde art in Los Angeles, the place to go is Syndell Studios".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Langsner|first1=Jules|authorlink=Jules Langser|title=Association Opens Show of 'Human Figure in Art'|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 21, 1956|page=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibitions held at Syndell Studio included:

In 1955 Syndell Studio co-organised with Gallery 6, San Francisco, the exhibition ''Action'' of abstract painting, which was held at the merry-go-round building on [[Santa Monica Pier]].&lt;ref&gt;Peabody (2011), pp. 63-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndell also co-organised the follow-up ''Action2'' (''Action Squared'') exhibition, held in 1956 at Edward Kienholz's [[Now Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allan|first1=Ken|title=Creating an avant-garde in 1950s Los Angeles: Robert Alexander's hand-printed gallery brochure in the Archives of American Art|journal=Archives of American Art Journal|date=2002|volume=42|issue=3-4|pages=21–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Syndell Studio was featured in the Los Angeles All-City Outdoor Art Festival at [[Barnsdall Art Park|Barnsdall Park]].

[[File:Talisman de Charlemagne 6032.JPG|thumb|The reverse side of the talisman.]]
The '''Talisman of Charlemagne''' is a 9th-century [[Carolingian]] [[reliquary]] [[encolpion]] that may once have belonged to [[Charlemagne]] and is purported to contain a fragment of the [[True Cross]]. It is the only surviving piece of goldwork which can be connected with Charlemagne himself with some degree of probability, but the connection has been seriously questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Labusiak: "»Er schenkte der Kirche viele heilige Gefäße aus Gold und Silber.« Goldschmiedekunst in der Zeit Karls des Großen." in Peter van den Brink, Sarvenaz Ayooghi (ed.): ''Karl der Große – Charlemagne. Karls Kunst.'' Dresden 2014, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The talisman is now kept in [[Rheims]] in the [[Palace of Tau]] (inv.no. G 7).

== Description==
The 7.3 cm long medallion is one of the few surviving items of goldsmithery from the ninth century AD. It is not really a piece of religious artwork, but a reliquary for personal purposes.&lt;ref name="Imhof"&gt;Imhof, Winterer: ''Karl der Große. Leben und Wirkung, Kunst und Architektur.'' p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was set with two large [[sapphire]]s in the centre, with the supposed hair of Mary between them, but in 1804 they were replaced with a piece of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] glass.&lt;ref name="Imhof"/&gt; The talisman is covered in sumptuous gemstones and [[filigree]] work, but it lacks the figural depictions, coloured enamels, animal designs and interlace patterns which are common in older works.&lt;ref name="Imhof"/&gt; The work is thus dominated by the filigree work itself, along with pearls and jewels in box and palmette designs. Thus the arrow-shaped [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]] decorations between the filigree could recall motifs which were previously common.&lt;ref name="Imhof"/&gt; The shape of the amulet combines three different forms with their own meanings. Firstly, it mimicked the shape of the [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] pilgrims' ampules which had been particularly common in the west in the fifth and sixth centuries, and thereby indicated the origins of hair which it originally contained. Secondly, it uses four emeralds and a central stone to create the a cross, just like {{Interlanguage link multi|St Stephan's Purse|de|3=Stephansbursa}}. Finally, the magnificent front serves as a frame for the relic visible behind the translucent gemstone.&lt;ref name="Imhof"/&gt; It is likely that it was used to heal or protect a high ranking individual.&lt;ref&gt;Imhof, Winterer: ''Karl der Große. Leben und Wirkung, Kunst und Architektur.'' p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary significance ==
According to legend, the talisman was a gift from Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] to Charlemagne in 801. In fact, the reliquary appears to be a late work of Aachen in the time of Charlemagne, based on stylistic factors.&lt;ref name="Imhof"/&gt; It originally held hair purported to belong to the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;http://stoessel.wordpress.com/talisman-karls-des-grossen/&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne's pre-eminent theologian, [[Alcuin]] (735-804) wrote in a letter to Archbishop [[Æthelhard]] of Canterbury, that he was trying to stop the emerging custom of wearing reliquaries around the neck, since it was "better to imitate the example of the saints with the heart than to carry their bones around in little sacks... this is a Pharisee superstition."&lt;ref&gt;"''Melius est in corde sanctorum imitari exempla quam in sacculis portare ossa […] Haec est pharisaica superstitio''," ''Monumenta Alcuiniana'' p. 719 ([https://archive.org/stream/monumentaalcuin00wattgoog#page/n735/mode/1up Online]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent history ==
The talisman is meant to have been  found around Charlemagne's neck when his tomb in [[Aachen Cathedral]] was opened by [[Emperor Otto III]] in the year 1000 or when it was opened by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] on 8 January 1166. The truth of this story is not clear.&lt;ref name="CNDPTalCha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cndp.fr/crdp-reims/fileadmin/documents/preac/patrimoine_palais_tau/talisman_charlemagne.pdf|title=Le talisman de Charlemagne|website=Centre national de documentation pédagogique|access-date=3 September 2012}} (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Fernand|last1=de Mély|title=Le tombeau de Charlemagne à Aix-la-Chapelle|journal=Comptes-rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|volume=59|number=5|pages = 343-362|year=1915|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/crai_0065-0536_1915_num_59_5_73602}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would then have formed part of the Aachen cathedral treasury, but again there are many doubts about this because a medallion containing the hair of the Virgin Mary is not mentioned in the records until the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alphilrevues.ch/d/revue/1/6/29{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection to Charlemagne is mentioned for the first time in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;Blaise de Montesquiou-Fezensac, "Le Talisman de Charlemagne", Art de France. Revue annuelle de l’art ancien et moderne, II (1962), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1804, the Talisman was kept in the [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]], but then {{Interlanguage link multi|Marc-Antoine Berdolet|de}} the first [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Aachen|Bishop of Aachen]] gave it to the [[Empress Josephine]], wife of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], along with a bone fragment from Charlemagne's right arm, on the occasion of her visit to Aachen, during the procession of Corpus Christi on 9 December 1804 in order to thank Napoleon for returning the relics of the cathedral which had been confiscated during the [[French Revolution]]. She gave it to her daughter [[Hortense de Beauharnais|Hortense]], who passed it in turn to her son, [[Napoleon III]]. At the fall of the Second French Empire, Empress [[Eugénie de Montijo|Eugenie]] entrusted it to [[Henri Conneau]] who hid it in a wall of his house and transmitted it to her in England. In 1919 it passed from  to the Archbishop of Rheims, Cardinal [[Louis Luçon]], who placed it in the church treasury of the [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]]. The exchange of the hair of Mary for a piece of the True Cross may have taken place in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Minkenberg, Sisi Ben Kayed: ''Verlorene Schätze.

'''Thorsten Goldberg''' born 1960 in [[Dinslaken]] is a German [[multimedia]] artist.

== Life ==

From 1982 to 1991 Thorsten Goldberg studied sculpture at the [[State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart]] in the class of Inge Mahn. 
In 1991 he won the first prize of the Forum of Young Art for his photographic work, "Class of 97" with exhibition stations at Kunsthalle Kiel, Kunstverein Mannheim, [[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]], Württembergischer Kunstverein Stuttgart and Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden. 
Along with the screenwriter Wieland Bauder he created the fictional character Thomas Bauer for joint artistic performances. When Thomas Bauer received the scholarship for photography by the Berlin Senate in 1991, he then took part in the art exhibition “Art on a world scale” at the Kunsthalle Kiel in 1993. 
Since 1995 and in addition to photographs and video works Thorsten Goldberg has been creating site-specific works and public art. He realized numerous projects in public space throughout Germany, in Poland, Norway and Canada and taught at various academies. 2003 - 2008 he was Adjunct Professor for Art in Public Space at the Art Academy Linz/AT and 2007 - 2009 Professor (repress.) for arts and media at the Muthesius Art Academy Kiel/Germany.

As a member of different committees and advisory boards he is involved in the election and organisation of competitions for art in public. 
Thorsten Goldberg is Initiator and Co-Publisher of „Public Art Wiki“, a Germany-wide internet archive for art in public space in the German-speaking-area (http://www.publicartwiki.org)
He is also Co-Publisher of „Kunst in der Großsiedlung (art in the large-housing-area) Marzahn-Hellersdorf“ a printed documentation of more than 460 public works and author of several texts on public art.

Thorsten Goldberg lives in Berlin/Germany.

A '''vernacular''', or '''vernacular language''', is the [[language]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a language used in everyday life by the common people of a specific population. It is distinguished from a [[standard language|standard]], [[National language|national]] or [[Literary language|literary]] language or a ''[[lingua franca]]'', used to facilitate communication across a large area. It is usually [[Native language|native]], mostly [[Spoken language|spoken]] rather than written and usually [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|seen as of lower status]] than more standardized forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8L-SDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT559&amp;dq=vernacular+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV1Ly707jbAhVpLcAKHZmuA4IQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vernacular%20language&amp;f=false|title=The Study of Language 6th Edition|last=Yule|first=George|date=2016-10-27|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316776780|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a language, [[dialect]] or [[sociolect]].

Some linguists use "vernacular" and "[[nonstandard dialect]]" as [[synonym]]s.&lt;ref name="Wolfram" /&gt;
[[File:ScanianLaw B74.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The oldest known vernacular manuscript in [[Scanian dialect|Scanian]] (Danish, c. 1250). It deals with Scanian and Scanian [[Ecclesiastical Law]].]]
[[File:PalazzoTrinci012.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An [[allegory]] of philosophy and grammar, [[Trinci Palace]], Foligno, Italy, by [[Gentile da Fabriano]], who lived in the era of Italian language standardization.]]

== Etymology ==
Usage of the word "vernacular" is not recent. In 1688, James Howell wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning Italy, doubtless there were divers before the Latin did spread all over that Country; the [[Calabria|Calabrian]], and [[Apulia|Apulian]] spoke Greek, whereof some Relicks are [[Griko dialect|to be found to this day]]; but it was an adventitious, no Mother-Language to them: 'tis confess'd that [[Latium]] it self, and all the Territories about Rome, had the Latin for its maternal and common first '''vernacular''' Tongue; but [[Tuscany]] and [[Liguria]] had others quite discrepant, [[viz.]] the [[Etruscan language|Hetruscane]] and [[Messapian language|Mesapian]], whereof though there be some Records yet extant; yet there are none alive that can understand them: The [[Oscan language|Oscan]], the [[Sabine language|Sabin]] and Tusculan, are thought to be but Dialects to these.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, vernacular, mother language and dialect are already in use in a modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Epistolæ Ho-Elianæ: Familiar letters, domestic and forren |first=James |last=Howell |location=London |publisher=Thomas Grey |year=1688 |edition=6th |page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Merriam-Webster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=vernacular |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Online |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/VERNACULAR |accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "vernacular" was brought into the English language as early as 1601 from the Latin ''vernaculus'' ("native") which had been in figurative use in [[Classical Latin]] as "national" and "domestic", having originally been derived from ''vernus'' and ''verna'', a male or female slave respectively born in the house rather than abroad. The figurative meaning was broadened from the diminutive extended words ''vernaculus, vernacula''. [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], the classical Latin grammarian, used the term ''vocabula vernacula'', "termes de la langue nationale" or "vocabulary of the national language" as opposed to foreign words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=vernaculus |encyclopedia=Dictionnaire Illustré Latin Français |first=Felix |last=Gaffiot |publisher=Librairie Hachette |location=Paris |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts of the vernacular ==

===General linguistics===

====In contrast with lingua franca====
[[File:Dante 3 Luca.jpg|thumb|left|Allegory of [[Dante Alighieri]], champion of the use of vernacular Italian for literature rather than the lingua franca, Latin. Fresco by [[Luca Signorelli]] in the cappella di San Brizio dome, Orvieto.]]
[[File:Incunabula distribution by language.png|thumb|Ratio of books printed in the vernacular languages to those in Latin in the 15th century&lt;ref name="ISTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html |title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[Linguistics|general linguistics]], a vernacular is contrasted with a ''[[lingua franca]]'', a third-party language in which persons speaking different vernaculars not understood by each other may communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to sociolinguistics |first=Ronald |last=Wardhaugh |location=Malden, Mass.; Oxford |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |year=2006 |page=59 |quote=In 1953, UNESCO defined a lingua franca as 'a language which is used habitually by people whose mother tongues are different in order to facilitate communication between them.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Western Europe]] until the 17th century, most scholarly works had been written in [[Latin]], which was serving as a lingua franca. Works written in [[Romance language]]s are said to be in the vernacular. The ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'', the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'', and [[The Song of Roland]] are examples of early vernacular literature in Italian, Spanish, and French, respectively.

In Europe, Latin was used widely instead of vernacular languages in varying forms until c. 1701, in its latter stage as [[New Latin]].

In religion, [[Protestantism]] was a driving force in the use of the vernacular in Christian Europe, the [[Bible]] being translated from Latin into vernacular languages with such works as the Bible in Dutch: published in 1526 by [[Jacob van Liesvelt]]; Bible in French: published in 1528 by Jacques Lefevre d’Étaples (or Faber Stapulensis); German [[Luther Bible]] in 1534 ([[New Testament]] 1522); Bible in Spanish: published in Basel in 1569 by Casiodoro de Reina (Biblia del Oso); Bible in Czech: Bible of Kralice, printed between 1579 and 1593; Bible in English: [[King James Bible]], published in 1611; Bible in Slovene, published in 1584 by Jurij Dalmatin. In Catholicism, vernacular bibles were later provided, but Latin was used at [[Tridentine Mass]] until the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1965. Certain groups, notably [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s, continue to practice [[Latin Mass]].

In India, the 12th century [[Bhakti movement]] led to the translation of Sanskrit texts to the vernacular.

In science, an early user of the vernacular was [[Galileo]], writing in Italian c. 1600, though some of his works remained in Latin. A later example is [[Isaac Newton]], whose 1687 ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was in Latin, but whose 1704 ''[[Opticks]]'' was in English. Latin continues to be used in certain fields of science, notably [[binomial nomenclature]] in biology, while other fields such as mathematics use vernacular; see [[scientific nomenclature]] for details.

In diplomacy, French displaced Latin in Europe in the 1710s, due to the military power of [[Louis XIV of France]].

Certain languages have both a classical form and various vernacular forms, with two widely used examples being Arabic and Chinese: see [[Varieties of Arabic]] and [[Chinese language]]. In the 1920s, due to the [[May Fourth Movement]], [[Classical Chinese]] was replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]].

{{details|Vernacular literature}}

====As a low variant in diglossia====
The vernacular is also often contrasted with a [[liturgical language]], a specialized use of a former ''lingua franca''. For example, until the 1960s, [[Roman Rite]] Catholics held [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] in [[Latin]] rather than in vernaculars; to this day the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] holds [[liturgy|liturgies]] in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], not Arabic; the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] holds liturgies in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] though parts of Mass are read in [[Amharic]].

Similarly, in [[Hindu]] culture, traditionally religious or scholarly works were written in [[Sanskrit]] (long after its use as a spoken language) or in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in Tamil country. Sanskrit was a lingua franca among the non-Indo-European languages of the Indian subcontinent and became more of one as the spoken language, or [[prakrit]]s, began to diverge from it in different regions. With the rise of the [[bhakti movement]] from the 12th century onwards, religious works were created in the other languages: [[Hindi]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and many others. For example, the [[Ramayana]], one of Hinduism's sacred epics in Sanskrit, had vernacular versions such as ''[[Ranganadha Ramayanam]]'' composed in Telugu by [[Reddy dynasty|Gona Buddha Reddy]] in the 15th century; and ''[[Ramacharitamanasa]]'', a Hindi version of the Ramayana by the 16th-century poet [[Tulsidas]].

These circumstances are a contrast between a vernacular and language variant used by the same speakers. According to one school of linguistic thought, all such variants are examples of a linguistic phenomenon termed [[diglossia]] ("split tongue", on the model of the genetic anomaly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=diglossia |encyclopedia=Stedman's Medical Dictionary |year=1918 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In it, the language is bifurcated, i.e. the speaker learns two forms of the language and ordinarily uses one but under special circumstances the other. The one most frequently used is the low (L) variant, equivalent to the vernacular, while the special variant is the high (H). The concept was introduced to linguistics by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] (1959), but Ferguson explicitly excluded variants as divergent as dialects or different languages or as similar as styles or registers. H must not be a conversational form; Ferguson had in mind a literary language. For example, a lecture is delivered in a different variety than ordinary conversation. Ferguson's own example was classical and spoken Arabic, but the analogy between [[Vulgar Latin]] and [[Classical Latin]] is of the same type. Excluding the upper-class and lower-class register aspects of the two variants, Classical Latin was a literary language; the people spoke Vulgar Latin as a vernacular.

[[Joshua Fishman]] redefined the concept in 1964 to include everything Fergusen had excluded. Fishman allowed both different languages and dialects and also different styles and registers as the H variants. The essential contrast between them was that they be "functionally differentiated"; that is, H must be used for special purposes, such as a liturgical or sacred language. Fasold expanded the concept still further by proposing that multiple H exist in society from which the users can select for various purposes. The definition of an H is intermediate between Ferguson's and Fishman's. Realizing the inappropriateness of the term diglossia (only two) to his concept, he proposes the term broad diglossia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasold|1984|pp=34–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
Within [[sociolinguistics]], the term "vernacular" has been applied to several concepts. Context, therefore, is crucial to determining its intended sense.

====As an informal register====
In variation theory, pioneered by [[William Labov]], language is a large set of styles or [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] from which the speaker selects according to the social setting of the moment. The vernacular is "the least self-conscious style of people in a relaxed conversation", or "the most basic style"; that is, casual varieties used spontaneously rather than self-consciously, informal talk used in intimate situations. In other contexts the speaker does conscious work to select the appropriate variations. The one he can use without this effort is the first form of speech acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mesthrie|1999|pp=77–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a non-standard dialect====
In another theory, the vernacular is opposed to the standard. The non-standard varieties thus defined are dialects, which are to be identified as complexes of factors: "social class, region, ethnicity, situation, and so forth." Both the standard and the non-standard language have dialects, but in contrast to the standard, the non-standard have "socially disfavored" structures. The standard are primarily written (in traditional print media) but the non-standard are spoken. An example of a vernacular dialect is [[African American Vernacular English]].&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;{{cite book |title=American English: dialects and variation |first=Walt |last=Wolfram |first2=Natalie |last2=Schilling-Estes |pages=13–16 |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As an idealisation====
A vernacular is not a real language but is "an abstract set of norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lodge|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First vernacular grammar ==
Vernaculars acquired the status of [[official language]]s through [[Metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] publications. Between 1437 and 1586, the first [[grammar]] of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] were written, though not always immediately published. It is to be understood that the first vestiges of those languages preceded their standardization by up to several hundred years.

=== Dutch ===
In the 16th century, the "[[Chamber of rhetoric|rederijkerskamers]]", learned literary societies founded throughout [[Flanders]] and [[Holland]] from the 1420s onward, attempted to impose a Latin structure on Dutch, on the presumption that Latin grammar had a "universal character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noordegraaf|2000|p=894}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1559 [[John III van de Werve, Lord of Hovorst]] published his grammar ''Den schat der Duytsscher Talen'' in Dutch and so did [[Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert]] (''Eenen nieuwen ABC of Materi-boeck'') in 1564. The Latinizing tendency changed course with the joint publication in 1584 by De Eglantier, the rhetoric society of Amsterdam, of the first comprehensive Dutch grammar, ''Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst/ ófte Vant spellen ende eyghenscap des Nederduitschen taals''. [[Hendrick Laurenszoon Spieghel]] was a major contributor but others contributed as well.

=== English ===
{{details|History of English}}
[[Modern English]] is considered to have begun at a conventional date of about 1550, most notably at the end of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (for example, "bot", the footwear, more as in "boat" to "boot"){{clarify|date=April 2011}}. It was created by the infusion of [[Old French]] into [[Old English]] after the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066 AD and of Latin at the instigation of the clerical administration. While present-day English-speaking students may be able to read [[Middle English]] authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] with some schooling, [[Old English]] is much more difficult.

[[Middle English]] is known for its alternative spellings and pronunciations. The British Isles, although geographically limited, have always supported populations of widely variant dialects (as well as a few different languages). Being the language of a maritime power, English was of necessity formed from elements of many different languages. Standardization has been an ongoing issue. Even in the age of modern communications and mass media, according to one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Authority in language: investigating language prescription and standardisation |first=James |last=Milroy|first2=Lesley |last2=Milroy |page=29 |year=1985 |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "… although the Received Pronunciation of Standard English has been heard constantly on radio and then television for over 60 years, only 3 to 5% of the population of Britain actually speaks RP … new brands of English have been springing up even in recent times ...." What the vernacular would be in this case is a moot point: "… the standardisation of English has been in progress for many centuries."

Modern English came into being as the standard Middle English, i.e. as the preferred dialect of the monarch, court and administration. That dialect was East Midland, which had spread to [[London]] where the king resided and from which he ruled. It contained Danish forms not often used in the north or south, as the Danes had settled heavily in the midlands. Chaucer wrote in an early East Midland style, [[John Wycliffe]] translated the [[New Testament]] into it, and [[William Caxton]], the first English printer, wrote in it. Caxton is considered the first modern English author.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Champneys|1893|pp=269, 285–286, 301, 314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first printed book in England was Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', published by Caxton in 1476.

The first English grammars were written in [[Latin]], with some in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a general plea for mother-tongue education in England: ''The first part of the elementary'', published in 1582 by [[Richard Mulcaster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bullokar]] wrote the first English grammar to be written in English: ''Pamphlet for Grammar'', followed by ''Bref Grammar'', both in 1586. Previously he had written ''Booke at Large for the Amendment of Orthography for English Speech'' (1580) but his orthography was not generally accepted and was soon supplanted, and his grammar shared a similar fate. Other grammars in English followed rapidly: Paul Greaves' ''Grammatica Anglicana'', 1594; [[Alexander Hume]]'s ''Orthographie and Congruitie of the Britain Tongue'', 1617, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the succeeding decades many literary figures turned a hand to grammar in English: [[Alexander Gill]], [[Ben Jonson]], Joshua Poole, [[John Wallis]], Jeremiah Wharton, [[James Howell]], Thomas Lye, [[Christopher Cooper (grammarian)|Christopher Cooper]], [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily]], [[John Colet]] and so on, all leading to the massive dictionary of [[Samuel Johnson]].

=== French ===
{{details|Old French}}
French (as [[Old French]]) emerged as a [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] from [[Vulgar Latin]] during [[late antiquity]]. The written language is known from at least as early as the 9th century. That language contained many forms still identifiable as Latin. Interest in standardizing French began in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[Norman conquest of England]] and the Anglo-Norman domains in both northwestern France and Britain, English scholars retained an interest in the fate of French as well as of English. Some of the numerous 16th-century surviving grammars are:

* [[John Palsgrave]], ''L'esclarcissement de la langue francoyse'' (1530; in English).
* Louis Meigret, ''Tretté de la grammaire françoeze'' (1550).
* Robert Stephanus: ''Traicté de la grammaire françoise'' (1557).

=== German ===
{{details|History of German}}
The development of a standard German was impeded by political disunity and strong local traditions until the invention of printing made possible a "[[High German]]-based book language."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[literary language]] was not identical to any specific variety of German. The first grammar evolved from pedagogical works that also tried to create a uniform standard from the many regional dialects for various reasons. Religious leaders wished to create a sacred language for [[Protestantism]] that would be parallel to the use of Latin for the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Various administrations wished to create a civil service, or chancery, language that would be useful in more than one locality. And finally, nationalists wished to counter the spread of the French national language into German-speaking territories assisted by the efforts of the French Academy.

With so many linguists moving in the same direction a standard German (''hochdeutsche Schriftsprache'') did evolve without the assistance of a language academy. Its precise origin, the major constituents of its features, remains uncertainly known and debatable. Latin prevailed as a [[lingua franca]] until the 17th century, when grammarians began to debate the creation of an ideal language. Before 1550 as a conventional date "supraregional compromises" were used in printed works, such as the one published by Valentin Ickelsamer (''Ein Teutsche Grammatica'') 1534. Books published in one of these artificial variants began to increase in frequency replacing the Latin then in use. After 1550 the supraregional ideal broadened to a universal intent to create a national language from [[Early New High German]] by deliberately ignoring regional forms of speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Nils |last=Langer |contribution=On the Importance of Foreign Language Grammars for a History of Standard German |title=Standardization: studies from the Germanic languages |editor-first=Andrew Robert |editor-last=Linn |editor2-first=Nicola |editor2-last=McLelland |series=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 235 |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |year=2002 |pages=69–70 |location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; which practice was considered to be a form of purification parallel to the ideal of purifying religion in [[Protestantism]].

In 1617, the [[Fruitbearing Society]], a language club, was formed in [[Weimar]] in imitation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Italy. It was one of many such clubs; however, none became a national academy. In 1618–1619 Johannes Kromayer wrote the first all-German grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641 Justin Georg Schottel in ''teutsche Sprachkunst'' presented the standard language as an artificial one. By the time of his work of 1663, ''ausführliche Arbeit von der teutschen Haubt-Sprache'', the standard language was well established.

=== Irish ===
''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' is a grammar of the [[Irish language]] which is thought to date back as far as the 7th century: the earliest surviving manuscripts are 12th-century.

=== Italian ===
{{details|Italian language}}
Italian appears before standardization as the ''lingua Italica'' of [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] and the ''lingua vulgaris'' of subsequent medieval writers. Documents of mixed Latin and Italian are known from the 12th century, which appears to be the start of writing in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known grammar of a Romance language was a book written in manuscript form by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1437 and 1441 and entitled ''Grammatica della lingua toscana'', "Grammar of the Tuscan Language." In it Alberti sought to demonstrate that the vernacular – here Tuscan, known today as modern Italian – was every bit as structured as Latin. He did so by mapping vernacular structures onto Latin.

The book was never printed until 1908. It was not generally known, but it was known, as an inventory of the library of [[Lorenzo de'Medici]] lists it under the title ''Regule lingue florentine'' ("Rules of the Florentine language"). The only known manuscript copy, however, is included in the [[codex]], Reginense Latino 1370, located at Rome in the [[Vatican library]]. It is therefore called the ''Grammatichetta vaticana.''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=History of the Language Sciences / Histoire des sciences du langage / Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaften,  Part 1 |editor-first=Sylvain |editor-last=Auroux |editor2-first=E. F. K. |editor2-last=Koerner |editor3-first=Hans-Josef |editor3-last=Niederehe |editor4-first=Kees |editor4-last=Versteegh| display-editors = 3 |contribution=102. Early grammatical descriptions of Italian |first=Claudio |last=Marazzini |location=Berlin, New York |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |year=2000 |pages=742–749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More influential perhaps were the 1516 ''Regole grammaticali della volgar lingua'' of Giovanni Francesco Fortunio and the 1525 ''Prose della vulgar lingua'' of [[Pietro Bembo]]. In those works the authors strove to establish a dialect that would qualify for becoming the Italian national language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occitan ===
The very first grammar in a vernacular language in western Europe was published in [[Toulouse]] in 1327. Known as the ''[[Leys d'amor]]'' and written by Guilhèm Molinièr, an [[advocate]] of Toulouse, it was published in order to codify the use of the [[Occitan]] language in poetry competitions organized by the company of the [[Acadèmia dels Jòcs Florals|Gai Saber]] in both grammar and rherotical ways.

=== Spanish ===
{{details|History of Spanish}}
Spanish (more accurately, ''la lengua castellana'') has a development chronologically similar to that of Italian: some vocabulary in Isidore of Seville, traces afterward, writing from about the 12th century, standardization beginning in the 15th century, coincident with the rise of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] as an international power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Spanish grammar by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] (''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana|Tratado de gramática sobre la lengua Castellana]]'', 1492) was divided into parts for native and nonnative speakers, pursuing a different purpose in each:  Books 1–4 describe the [[Spanish language]] grammatically in order to facilitate the study of Latin for its Spanish speaking readers. Book 5 contains a phonetical and morphological overview of Spanish for nonnative speakers.

=== Welsh ===
The ''Grammar Books of the Master-poets'' ({{lang-cy|Gramadegau'r Penceirddiaid}}) are considered to have been composed in the early fourteenth century, and are present in manuscripts from soon after. These tractates draw on the traditions of the Latin grammars of Donatus and Priscianus and also on the teaching of the professional Welsh poets. The tradition of grammars of the [[Welsh Language]] developed from these through the Middle Ages and to the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia |editor-first=John |editor-last=Koch |contribution=Gramadegau'r Penceirddiaid |first=R. Geraint |last=Gruffudd |location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |pages=843–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First vernacular dictionaries ==
A dictionary is to be distinguished from a [[glossary]]. Although numerous glossaries publishing vernacular words had long been in existence, such as the [[Etymologiae]] of [[Isidore of Seville]], which listed many Spanish words, the first vernacular [[dictionaries]] emerged together with vernacular grammars.

=== Dutch ===
Glossaries in Dutch began about 1470 AD leading eventually to two [[Dutch dictionaries]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brachin|1985|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christophe Plantin]]: ''Thesaurus Theutonicae Linguae'', 1573
* [[Cornelis Kiliaan]]: ''Dictionarium Teutonico-Latinum'', 1574 (becoming ''Etymologicum'' with the 1599 3rd edition)

Shortly after (1579) the [[Southern Netherlands]] came under the dominion of Spain, then of Austria (1713) and of France (1794). The [[Congress of Vienna]] created the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 from which southern Netherlands (being Catholic) seceded in 1830 to form the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], which was confirmed in 1839 by the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brachin|1985|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this political instability no standard Dutch was defined (even though much in demand and recommended as an ideal) until after [[World War II]]. Currently the [[Dutch Language Union]], an international treaty organization founded in 1980, supports a standard Dutch in the Netherlands, while [[Afrikaans]] is regulated by [[Die Taalkommissie]] founded in 1909.

=== English ===
[[Standard English]] remains a quasi-fictional ideal, despite the numerous private organizations publishing prescriptive rules for it. No language academy was ever established or espoused by any government past or present in the English-speaking world. In practice the British monarchy and its administrations established an ideal of what good English should be considered to be, and this in turn was based on the teachings of the major universities, such as [[Cambridge University]] and [[Oxford University]], which relied on the scholars whom they hired. There is a general but far from uniform consensus among the leading scholars about what should or should not be said in standard English, but for every rule examples from famous English writers can be found that break it. Uniformity of spoken English never existed and does not exist now, but usages do exist, which must be learnt by the speakers, and do not conform to prescriptive rules.

Usages have been documented not by prescriptive grammars, which on the whole are less comprehensible to the general public, but by comprehensive dictionaries, often termed unabridged, which attempt to list all usages of words and the phrases in which they occur as well as the date of first use and the etymology where possible. These typically require many volumes, and yet not more so than the unabridged dictionaries of many languages.

Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries precede modern English and were in use in the earliest written English. The first monolingual dictionary was&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|1999|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Cawdrey]]'s ''Table Alphabeticall'' (1604) which was followed by [[Edward Phillips]]'s ''A New World of English Words'' (1658) and [[Nathaniel Bailey]]'s ''[[An Universal Etymological English Dictionary]]'' (1721). These dictionaries whetted the interest of the English-speaking public in greater and more prescriptive dictionaries until [[Samuel Johnson]] published ''Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language'' (1747), which would imitate the dictionary being produced by the French Academy. He had no problem acquiring the funding, but not as a prescriptive dictionary. This was to be a grand comprehensive dictionary of all English words at any period, ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755).

By 1858, the need for an update resulted in the first planning for a new comprehensive dictionary to document standard English, a term coined at that time by the planning committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|1999|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary, known as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', published its first fascicle in 1884. It attracted significant contributions from some singular minds, such as [[William Chester Minor]], a former army surgeon who had become criminally insane and made most of his contributions while incarcerated. Whether the OED is the long-desired standard English Dictionary is debatable, but its authority is taken seriously by the entire English-speaking world. Its staff is currently working on a third edition.

=== French ===
Surviving dictionaries are a century earlier than their grammars. The [[Académie française]] founded in 1635 was given the obligation of producing a standard dictionary. Some early dictionaries are:
* Louis Cruse, alias Garbin: ''Dictionaire latin-françois'', 1487
* [[Robert Estienne]], alias Robertus Stephanus: ''Dictionnaire françois–latin'', 1539
* Maurice de la Porte: ''Epitheta'', 1571
* [[Jean Nicot]]: ''Thresor de la langue fracoyse, tant ancienne que moderne'', 1606
* Pierre Richelet: ''Dictionnaire françois contenant les mots et les choses'', 1680
* [[Académie française]]: ''[[Dictionnaire de l’Académie française]]'', 1694 ''annis''.

=== German ===
[[High German]] dictionaries began in the 16th century and were at first multi-lingual. They were preceded by glossaries of German words and phrases on various specialized topics. Finally interest in developing a vernacular German grew to the point where Maaler could publish a work called by [[Jacob Grimm]] "the first truly German dictionary",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|pp=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Maaler's ''Die Teutsche Spraach: Dictionarium Germanico-latinum novum'' (1561).

It was followed along similar lines by Georg Heinisch: ''Teütsche Sprache und Weißheit'' (1616). After numerous dictionaries and glossaries of a less-than-comprehensive nature came a [[thesaurus]] that attempted to include all German, Kaspar Stieler's ''Der Teutschen Sprache Stammbaum und Fortwachs oder Teutschen Sprachschatz'' (1691), and finally the first codification of written German,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Christoph Adelung]]'s ''Versuch eines vollständigen grammatisch-kritischen Wörterbuches Der Hochdeutschen Mundart'' (1774–1786).[[Schiller]] called Adelung an ''Orakel'' and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] is said to have nailed a copy to his desk.

=== Italian ===
In the early 15th century a number of glossaries appeared, such as that of Lucillo Minerbi on [[Boccaccio]] in 1535, and those of Fabrizio Luna on [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], [[Petrarch|Petrarca]], Boccaccio and [[Dante]] in 1536. In the mid-16th the dictionaries began, as listed below. In 1582 the first language academy was formed, called Accademia della Crusca, "bran academy", which sifted language like grain. Once formed, its publications were standard-setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance and reform: the Italian contribution|first=Frances Amelia |last=Yates| page=18|volume=Volume 2|year=1983|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a derivative of ''[[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) "Assemblage Art". ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed. Retrieved February 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''collage''&lt;ref&gt;Collage, essay by Clement Greenberg, July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[decollage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See D-De, ArtLex Art Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is similar to the basic mixed-media collage idea of building up various levels of the piece for emphasis. Known in this medium as '''''projections''''', the artist tries in a variety of ways to create a visual image that causes the viewer to focus on certain areas of the art framework that would ordinarily be overlooked or relegated to the background rather than to randomly layer structure creating a whole image of the work.

==Origins==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}While the exact origins of VFDA are unknown, the first artwork of its nature began to appear around 2010 in the street art of various cities in Europe, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]]. This appears to have been a response to the expanding use of computer generation in art to both design and create mixed-media collage works that could be essentially pre-designed and mass-produced. Since that time, various artists have produced series of works-known as '''''ensembles'''''—that are individually unique and limited in scope. Common themes of these ensembles range widely from ideological ideas like bohemianism, libertine and socially relevant matters to historical perspective, such as the interpretation of various time periods and eras.

==Structure of the design==
The floor/design base of the piece is used to create a theme or story about the subject.  Sections of the work are then raised to provide emphasis and act as an accent to substantiate the message. VFDA is usually created in single pieces or via limited series depending upon the artist involved and is also generally confined to canvass or wooden framework. Larger scale pieces, such as architectural interpretations, are generally not considered part of this medium. Each VFDA piece is unique is not duplicated in any way with the exception of limited prints. While some artists offer limited prints of the original artwork, the number offered is very limited in scope.

==Background variations==
The backgrounds used in VFDA range widely from the use of true vintage pieces such as original period sheet music, fractional currency, foreign money or other items that set the time frame for the piece.  Each of the items used relate the overall, theme of the art. The background can also be structured in segmented form-through the use of '''linear script'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/linear|title=Linear - Definition of linear by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;—composed of simply drawn lines with little attempt at pictorial representation, '''mathematic symbolism'''—such as the use of angles and formulas and via '''free-form application'''—concepts chosen by the artist to represent the underlying theme in the work.

VFDA is based on the unique aspect of every piece being created by the artist. Materials used to emphasize the projections include wooden palates measured to the frame, various forms of corkboard, balsa wood and other materials that are hand-cut or machined by the artist to help raise the projections to the level desired. The use of preformed shapes, three-dimensional printing and advanced computer generation of any kind&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick Bloom, Susan (2006). ''Digital Collage and Painting: Using Photoshop and Painter to Create Fine Art''. Focal Press. {{ISBN|0-240-80705-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used to map the work or create the projections is not considered to be part of this art form because the work can be saved, duplicated and even mass-produced.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Manovich (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early female writers ==

''Cai'', loosely translated as "literary talent", is an attribute describing profound lyricism, deep intellectuality and analytic skill.&lt;ref name=lar&gt;Larson, W. (1998). Women and Writing in Modern China. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was acknowledged that both women and men possessed ''cai'', the phrase ''nuren wucai bian shi de'' 女人無才便是德 (for women, lack of literary talent is a virtue)&lt;ref name=lar/&gt; summarizes the dominant sentiment that the literary field was traditionally a domain for men.  Despite this belief, works authored by women play an integral part throughout Chinese history. There were a number of women writers prior to the 20th century who were respected by the intelligentsia of their era, even if much of their work was considered less important than men's work in general.&lt;ref name = chang&gt;Chang. K.S. &amp; Saussy. H. (Eds.). (1999). Women writers of traditional China: An anthology of poetry and criticism. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.  pp. 1–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Female writers helped to bring forth themes such as romance, marriage, gender roles and the politics surrounding women.

The [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Zhou dynasty|first women recorded]] in biography and bibliography were poets.&lt;ref name = chang/&gt; The aesthetic nature of poetry was highly regarded, while fiction was viewed as an avenue taken because of a failed career or commercial venture.&lt;ref name = chang/&gt; A marked increase in female literacy took place during the Late Imperial Era. One of the more notable poets of this time was [[Mao Xiuhui]], a 16th-century poet that used the plight of her husband's failed attempt at gaining a position as civil servant to write a poem that draws parallels between the male and female as they suffer hardships in the political and domestic arenas respectively. Other notable female poets in Chinese history were [[Gao Zhixian]], [[Xue Tao]], and [[Li Qingzhao]].

== 20th-century writers and feminism ==
The beginning of the century marked a period of growing unrest for women as the feminist movement took hold.  Women of this period were faced with the dilemma of protesting oppressive ideals stemming from Confucian ideology or remaining true to their family and maintaining peace and order. Literary discourse at the time was highly influenced by this social movement. Women writers of the time authored works reflecting the feminist sentiment and the issues that came with revolution.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;Schaeffer, Kay &amp; Xianlin, Song. (2007). Unruly Spaces: Gender, Women'’ Writing and Indigenous Feminism in China. Journal of Gender Studies, 16 (1), 17–30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Chang]], [[Lu Yin (writer)|Lu Yin]], [[Shi Pingmei]] and [[Ding Ling]], were four of the most influential feminist writers of the time.  In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]] gained favor with Chinese feminists looking to study gender relationships, thus becoming a topic of many feminist writers throughout the early and mid portions of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;

When Mao came to power in 1949, he addressed the issue of women's rights and tried to establish women's equality through the "iron girls" of national development ideal.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; Through this philosophy, long-standing practices such as [[foot binding]], [[prostitution]] and trafficking of women were abolished. Women were given the opportunity to own land, divorce, and join the military and other employment fields.&lt;ref name = Laurence&gt;Laurence, S. (2008.) Mao’s ghost. The Boston Phoenix. Retrieved from the web December 8, 2009. http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/66069-maos-ghost/.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of this ideology, however, did not liberate women; instead, it undermined the feminine voice by forcing women to take a male-oriented stance on public and domestic policy.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;   Literature authored during this time reflects the restrictive and masculine perspective of women writers during this period.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; This "[[Mulan]]ian" style of writing submerged true feminine identity, rendering the female perspective neglected and hidden in the male dominated political and aesthetic arenas.&lt;ref name=Jin&gt;Jinhua, Z. (2009). Women's Culture and Writing in the 1990s: Illusions and Breakout. (Y. Qinfa &amp; J. Shan, Trans.). About.com http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa101000a.htm. Retrieved November 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  There were some exceptions to this rule, such as [[Yuan Chiung-chiung]], who wrote about women’s issues and how much women could accomplish without men.

'''Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow''' (Traceability is Credibility) is an ongoing [[conceptual art]] work created by [[Bryan McCormack]], encompassing performance, [[social media]] installation art and drawings, on the subject of the [[European migrant crisis|European refugee crisis]].

== Development ==

[[File:Refugee Drawing Yesterday.jpg|thumb|''Yesterday'' drawing by an 18 year old Syrian boy currently living in Kara Tepe Refugee Camp, Lesbos Island, Greece]]

Throughout 2016 and part of 2017, McCormack visited squats and [[Syrian refugee camps|refugee camps]] across Europe. At each location he worked with refugees, asking them to produce three drawings: one of their life before (Yesterday), one of their current life (Today) and one of their life imagined in the future (Tomorrow). The results of these drawings have been shared through the project's social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.villamedici.it/fr/programme.../les...villa/.../les-jeudis-de-la-villa-3-novembre|title=www.villamedici.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/.../ruolo-dell-arte-contemporanea-nella-crisi|title=www.adnkronos.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artemagazine.it/.../2721-roma-villa-medici-gli-appuntamenti|title=www.artemagazine.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gossip.libero.it/search/bryan-mccormack|title=gossip.libero.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artribune.com/artista-mostre-biografia/bryan-mccormack/|title=www.artribune.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==

Several hundred of these refugee drawings along with video performance studies inspired by the drawings will be part of a multidisciplinary installation created by McCormack at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini during the 2017 [[Venice Biennale]]. This installation is in conjunction with a performance, curated by the artist and Dr. Henry Bell, with over forty students from [[Sheffield Hallam University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exibart.com/notizia.asp?IDNotizia=51263&amp;IDCategoria=204|title=COME PUÒ AGIRE L’ARTE CONTEMPORANEA NELLA CRISI EUROPEA DEI RIFUGIATI?
