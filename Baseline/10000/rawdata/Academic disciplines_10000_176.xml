The '''''ATLA Religion Database''''' ('''''ATLA RDB''''') is an index of [[academic journal]] articles in the area of [[religion]].&lt;ref name="Finding"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Golderman |first1=Gail |last2=Connolly |first2=Bruce |journal=[[Library Journal]] |title=Finding Religion |date=April 15, 2011 |volume=136 |issue=7 |pages=120–126.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is updated monthly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atla.com/about/pressroom/Pages/ATLA%20Announces%20Monthly%20Updates%20and%20Major%20Product%20Enhancements.aspx|title=ATLA Announces Monthly Updates and Major Product Enhancements|website=www.atla.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by the [[American Theological Library Association]] (ATLA). The database indexes articles, [[essay]]s, and [[book review]]s related to a wide range of scholarly fields related to religion. The database is available on a subscription basis through a database aggregator.

The total database includes over 2.1 million article citations from over 1,940+ journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atla.com/products/prodinfo/Pages/ATLA-RDB.aspx|title=ATLA Religion Database® (ATLA RDB®)|website=www.atla.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than a quarter of a million essay citations from more than 18,000 multi-author works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23358">The term '''abjection''' literally means "the state of being cast off." The term has been explored in [[post-structuralism]] as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular interpretations of abjection is [[Julia Kristeva]]'s (pursued particularly in her work ''[[Powers of Horror]]''). Kristeva describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences, or is confronted by (both mentally and as a body), what Kristeva terms one's "corporeal reality", or a breakdown in the distinction between what is [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and what is [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of abjection is best described as the process by which one separates one's sense of self from that which immediately threatens one's sense of life. Abjection prevents the absolute realization of existence, completing the course of biological, social, physical, and spiritual cycles. The best representation of this concept can be imagined as one's reaction to gazing at a human cadaver, or corpse, as a direct reminder of the inevitability of death.

The abject is, as such, the process that separates from one's environment what "is not me."

Kristeva's concept of abjection is utilized commonly to explain popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in [[misogyny]], [[misandry]], [[homophobia]], and [[genocide]]. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012) p. 92; Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary critical theory==
Drawing on the French tradition of interest in the monstrous (e.g., novelist [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]),&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Brereton, ''A Short History of French Literature'' (1954), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] as grounded in "filth" (e.g., psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]),&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] developed the idea of the abject as that which is rejected by/disturbs social reason{{snd}}the communal consensus that underpins a social order.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection'' (1982)m p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The "abject" exists accordingly somewhere between the concept of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] and the concept of the subject, representing [[taboo]] elements of the self barely separated off in a [[Liminality|liminal]] space.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Kristeva claims that within the boundaries of what one defines as subject{{snd}}a part of oneself{{snd}}and object{{snd}}something that exists independently of oneself{{snd}}there resides pieces that were once categorized as a part of oneself or one's identity that has since been rejected{{snd}}the abject.

It is important to note, however, that Kristeva created a distinction in the true meaning of abjection: it is not the lack of "cleanliness or health" that causes abjection, but that which disturbs identity, system, and order.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror", p. 4; Guberman, "Julia Kristeva Interviews", (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the abject is situated outside the [[symbolic order]], being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience, as with the repulsion presented by confrontation with filth, waste, or a corpse{{snd}}an object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/10269033/-Kristeva-Abjection-Short-Version Julia Kristeva, 'Approaching Abjection'].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sense of the abject complements the existence of the [[superego]]{{snd}}the representative of culture, of the symbolic order:&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; in Kristeva's aphorism, "To each ego its object, to each superego its abject".&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kristeva's psychoanalytic perspective, abjection is done to the part of ourselves that we exclude: the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Abjection occurs on the micro level of the speaking being, through their subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through "language as a common and universal law". We use [[ritual]]s, specifically those of defilement, to attempt to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic, paradoxically both excluding and renewing contact with the abject in the ritual act.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Creed, in Ken Gelder, ''The Horror Reader'' (2000), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of abjection is often coupled (and sometimes confused) with the idea of [[The Uncanny (Freud)|the uncanny]], the concept of something being "un-home-like", or foreign, yet familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being "foreign": a corpse, having fallen out of the symbolic order, creates abjection through its uncanniness&lt;ref&gt;Winifred Menninghaus, ''Disgust'' (2003), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}creates a [[cognitive dissonance]].

===Cases===
* Abjection is a major theme of the 1949 work ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'' (Journal du Voleur) by French author [[Jean Genet]], a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, wherein he claims as a criminal outcast to actively seek abjections as an [[existentialist]] form of 'sainthood'&lt;ref&gt;Gene A. Plunka, ''The Rites of Passage of Jean Genet'' (1992), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) has been analysed as an example of how in [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] monstrous representations of the female resonate with the abject archaic figure of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Creed]], ''The Monstrous Feminine'' (1993), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodily dismemberment, forcible impregnation, and the chameleon nature of the alien itself may all be seen as explorations of phantasies of the [[primal scene]], and of the encounter with the boundaryless nature of the original abject mother.&lt;ref&gt;Creed, p. 17 and p. 26–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1990s-era Australian literary genre [[grunge lit]] often focuses on young adult characters with "abject" bodies &lt;ref&gt;Gelder K. and Salzman P. ''After the celebration: Australian fiction 1989–2007''. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that are deteriorating and characters facing health problems. For example, the male and female lead characters in [[Andrew McGahan]]'s book ''[[Praise]]'', Gordon Buchanan and Cynthia Lamonde, both have diseased bodies, with Cynthia facing skin that breaks out in rashes. Karen Brooks states that Clare Mendes'  ''Drift Street'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "limnal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an abject human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "limnality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social critical theory==
"Abjection" is often used to describe the state of often-[[marginalized]] groups, such as women, unwed mothers, people of minority religious faiths, sex workers, convicts, poor and disabled people. From a deconstruction of sexual discourses and gender history Ian McCormick has outlined the recurring links between pleasurable transgressive desire, deviant categories of behaviour and responses to body fluids in 18th and 19th-century discussions of prostitution, sodomy, and masturbation (self-pollution, impurity, uncleanness).&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Outcasts''. 4 vols., edited with introductions by Ian McCormick (London and New York: Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salih|first1=Sara|title=Judth Butler|date=2002|page=63|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Salih-Butler-Performativity-Chapter_3.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term space of abjection is also used, referring to a space that abjected things or beings inhabit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===In organizational studies===
[[Organizational theory]] literature on abjection has attempted to illuminate various ways in which institutions come to silence, exclude or disavow feelings, practices, groups or discourses within the workplace. Studies have examined and demonstrated the manner in which people adopt roles, identities and discourses to avoid the consequences of social and organizational abjection.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny (2010); Bulter (2004); cited in Risque, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In such studies the focus is often placed upon a group of people within an organization or institution that fall outside of the norm, thus becoming what Kristeva terms "the one by whom the abject exists," or "the deject" people.&lt;ref&gt;"Powers of Horror", p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions and organizations typically rely on rituals and other structural practices to protect symbolic elements from the [[semiotic]], both in a grander organizational focus that emphasizes the role of policy-making, and in a smaller interpersonal level that emphasizes social rejection. Both the organizational and interpersonal levels produce a series of exclusionary practices that create a "zone of inhabitability" for staff perceived to be in opposition to the organizational norms.

One such method is that of "collective instruction," which refers to a strategy often used to defer, render abject and hide the inconvenient "dark side" of the organization, keeping it away from view through corporate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson, "Changing the memory of suffering: An organizational aesthetics on the dark side" (2014), p. 281–3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the process by which an acceptable, unified meaning is created{{snd}}for example, a corporation's or organization's [[mission statement]]. Through the controlled release of information and belief or reactionary statements, people are gradually exposed to a firm's persuasive interpretation of an event or circumstance, that could have been considered abject. This [[spin (public relations)|spun meaning]] developed by the firm becomes shared throughout a community. That event or circumstance comes to be interpreted and viewed in a singular way by many people, creating a unified, accepted meaning. The purpose such strategies serve is to identify and attempt to control the abject, as the abject ideas become ejected from each individual memory.

Organizations such as hospitals must negotiate the divide between the symbolic and the semiotic in a unique manner.&lt;ref&gt;Risq, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nurses, for example, are confronted with the abject in a more concrete, physical fashion due to their proximity to the ill, wounded and dying. They are faced with the reality of death and suffering in a way not typically experienced by hospital administrators and leaders. Nurses must learn to separate themselves and their emotional states from the circumstances of death, dying and suffering they are surrounded by. Very strict rituals and power structures are used in hospitals, which suggests that the dynamics of abjection have a role to play in understanding not only how anxiety becomes the work of the health team and the organization, but also how it is enacted at the level of hospital policy.

===In sociological studies===
The abject is a concept that is often used to describe bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one's identity they are cast out. Kristeva used this concept to analyze xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and was therefore the first to apply the abject to cultural analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Imogen Tyler&lt;ref&gt;"Revolting subjects: Social abjection and resistance in neoliberal Britain" (2013), p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had labelled particular groups of people{{snd}}mostly minority groups{{snd}}as revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion.

There has also been exploration done into the way people look at others whose bodies may look different from the norm due to illness, injury or birth defect. Researchers such as Frances&lt;ref&gt;"Damaged or unusual bodies: Staring, or seeing and feeling" (2014), p. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize the importance of the interpersonal consequences that result from this looking. A person with a disability, by being similar to us and also different, is the person by whom the abject exists and people who view this individual react to that abjection by either attempting to ignore and reject it, or by attempting to engage and immerse themselves in it. In this particular instance, Frances claims, the former manifests through the refusal to make eye contact or acknowledge the presence of the personal with a disability, while the latter manifests through intrusive staring. The interpersonal consequences that result from this are either that the person with a disability is denied and treated as an 'other'{{snd}}an object that can be ignored{{snd}}or that the individual is clearly identified and defined as a deject.

==In psychotherapy==
By bringing focus onto concepts such as abjection, psychotherapists may allow for the exploration of links between lived experience and cultural formations in the development of particular psychopathologies. Bruan Seu&lt;ref&gt;cited in Dryden, Ussher and Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014), p. 1343.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the critical importance of bringing together Foucauldian ideas of self-surveillance and positioning in discourse with a psychodynamic theorization in order to grasp the full significance of psychological impactors, such as shame.

Concerning psychopathologies such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), the role of the other{{snd}}actual, imagined or fantasized{{snd}}is central, and ambivalence about the body, inflated by shame, is the key to this dynamic. Parker&lt;ref&gt;"Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014), p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that individuals suffering from BDD are sensitive to the power, pleasure and pain of being looked at, as their objective sense of self dominates any subjective sense. The role of the other has become increasingly significant to developmental theories in contemporary psychoanalysis, and is very evident in body image as it is formed through identification, projection and introjection. Those individuals with BDD consider a part of their body unattractive or unwanted, and this belief is exacerbated by shame and the impression that others notice and negatively perceive the supposed physical flaw, which creates a cycle. Over time, the person with BDD begins to view that part of their body as being separate from themselves, a rogue body part{{snd}}it has been abjected. Consider also those who experience social anxiety, who experience the subjectification of being abject is a similar yet different way to those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Abject, here, refers to marginally objectionable material that does not quite belong in the greater society as a whole{{snd}}whether this not-belonging is real or imagined is irrelevant, only that it is perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; For those with social anxiety, it is their entire social self which is perceived to be the deject, straying away from normal social rituals and capabilities.

Studying abjection has proven to be suggestive and helpful for considering the dynamics of self and body hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, Ussher &amp; Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014); Parker, "Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014); Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This carries interesting implications for studying such disorders as separation anxiety, biologically centered phobias, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

==In art==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

The roots of abject art go back a long way. The Tate defines abject art as that which "explore themes that transgress and threaten our sense of cleanliness and propriety[,] particularly referencing the body and bodily functions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art |title=Abject Art |work=[[Tate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters expressed a fascination for blood long before the Renaissance but it was not until the [[Dada]] movement that the fascination with transgression and taboo made it possible for abject art, as a movement, to exist. It was influenced by [[Antonin Artaud]]'s ''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]''. The [[Whitney Museum]] in [[New York City]] identified abject art in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Hal. "Obscene, abject, traumatic." October (1996): 107–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kutzbach, Konstanze | author2=Mueller, Monika | title=The abject of desire : the aestheticization of the unaesthetic in contemporary literature and culture | publication-date=2007 | publisher=Rodopi | isbn=978-90-420-2264-5 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was preceded by the films and performances of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese actionists]], in particular, [[Hermann Nitsch]], whose interest in Schwitter's idea of a [[gesamtkunstwerk]] (total artwork) led to his setting up the radical theatre group, known as the [[Orgien-Mysterien-Theater]]. The group used animal carcasses and bloodshed in a ritualistic way. Nitsch served time in jail for blasphemy before being invited to New York in 1968 by Jonas Mekas. Nitsch organised a series of performances which influenced the radical New York art scene. Other members of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]], [[Gunter Brus]], who began as a painter, and [[Otto Muehl]] collaborated on performances. The performances of [[Gunter Brus]] involved publicly urinating, defecating and cutting himself with a razor blade. [[Rudolf Schwarzkogler]] is known for his photos dealing with the abject.  
In the late 1960s, [[performance art]] become popular in New York, including by [[Carolee Schneemann]]. [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Genesis P. Orridge]] and [[GG Allin]] did this type of art.

In the 1980s and 1990s, fascination with the ''[[Powers of Horror]]'', the title of a book by [[Julia Kristeva]], led to a second wave of radical performance artists working with bodily fluids including [[Ron Athey]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]] and [[Kira O' Reilly]]. Kristeva herself associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsis{{snd}}an impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror" (1982), p. 15; Spittle, "'Did this game scare you? Because it sure as hell scared me!' F.E.A.R., the abject and the uncanny" (2011); Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the abject became a theme of radical Chinese performance artists [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and [[Yang Zhichao]]. The abject also began to influence mainstream artists including [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Kiki Smith]] and [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] who were all included in the 1993 Whitney show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art "Abject Art"] Retrieved on 2010-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists working with abjection include New York photographers, [[Joel Peter Witkin]], whose book ''[[Love and Redemption]]'' and [[Andres Serrano]] whose piece entitled ''[[Piss Christ]]'' caused a scandal in 1989.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]], '''adaptation''' has three related meanings. Firstly, it is the dynamic evolutionary process that fits [[organism]]s to their environment, enhancing their [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]]. Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during that process. Thirdly, it is a [[phenotypic trait|phenotypic]] or '''adaptive trait''', with a functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has been [[evolution|evolved]] by [[natural selection]].

Organisms face a succession of environmental challenges as they grow, and show adaptive [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] as traits [[ontogeny|develop]] in response to the imposed conditions. This gives them resilience to varying environments.

==History ==
{{Main|History of evolutionary thought}}

Adaptation is an observable fact of life accepted by philosophers and natural historians from ancient times, independently of their views on [[evolution]], but their explanations differed. [[Empedocles]] did not believe that adaptation required a [[final cause]] (~ purpose), but thought that it "came about naturally, since such things survived." [[Aristotle]] did believe in final causes, but assumed that [[Aristotle's biology#Scale of being|species were fixed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2015 |isbn=978-1408836224 |pages=91–92, 273, 288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamarck's Two-Factor Theory.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|The second of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s two factors (the first being a complexifying force) was an adaptive force that causes animals with a given [[body plan]] to adapt to circumstances by [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], creating a diversity of [[species]] and [[genus|genera]].]]

In [[natural theology]], adaptation was interpreted as the work of a deity and as evidence for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|1989|pp=31–32, fn 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Paley]] believed that organisms were perfectly adapted to the lives they led, an argument that shadowed [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who had argued that God had brought about "[[best of all possible worlds|the best of all possible worlds]]." [[Voltaire]]'s Dr. Pangloss&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Voltaire |title=Candide |publisher=Cramer et al |date=1759}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a parody of this optimistic idea, and [[David Hume]] also argued against design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sober|1993|loc=chpt. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Natural theology#The Bridgewater Treatises|Bridgewater Treatises]]'' are a product of natural theology, though some of the authors managed to present their work in a fairly neutral manner. The series was lampooned by [[Robert Knox]], who held quasi-evolutionary views, as the ''Bilgewater Treatises''. [[Charles Darwin]] broke with the tradition by emphasising the flaws and limitations which occurred in the animal and plant worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=425&amp;itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=side 397: "Rudimentary, Atrophied, and Aborted Organs"]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed a tendency for organisms to become more complex, moving up a ladder of progress, plus "the influence of circumstances," usually expressed as ''use and disuse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Peter J. |title=Evolution The History of an Idea|date=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-06386-4 |page=86 |edition=Revised |origyear=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second, subsidiary element of his theory is what is now called [[Lamarckism]], a proto-evolutionary hypothesis of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], intended to explain adaptations by natural means.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the discussion in {{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=86–95}}: "Whatever the true nature of Lamarck's theory, it was his mechanism of adaptation that caught the attention of later naturalists." (p. 90)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other natural historians, such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], accepted adaptation, and some also accepted evolution, without voicing their opinions as to the mechanism. This illustrates the real merit of Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], and secondary figures such as [[Henry Walter Bates]], for putting forward a mechanism whose significance had only been glimpsed previously. A century later, experimental field studies and breeding experiments by people such as [[E. B. Ford]] and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] produced [[Evidence of common descent|evidence that natural selection]] was not only the 'engine' behind adaptation, but was a much stronger force than had previously been thought.&lt;ref name="Provine 1986"&gt;{{harvnb|Provine|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orr_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H. Allen |authorlink=H. Allen Orr |date=February 2005 |title=The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history |journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=119–127 |doi=10.1038/nrg1523 |pmid=15716908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General principles ==

{{Quotation|''The significance of an adaptation can only be understood in relation to the total biology of the species.''|[[Julian Huxley]]|''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|1942|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===What adaptation is===
Adaptation is primarily a process rather than a physical form or part of a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=483}}: "Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past, and became instead a continuing dynamic process."&lt;/ref&gt; An internal [[parasite]] (such as a [[liver fluke]]) can illustrate the distinction: such a parasite may have a very simple bodily structure, but nevertheless the organism is highly adapted to its specific environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]], which is often quite complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Price |1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a practical term, "adaptation" often refers to a ''product'': those features of a [[species]] which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function remains in doubt. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary ''process'', and ''adaptive trait'' for the bodily part or function (the product), one may distinguish the two different senses of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor1-last=Daintith |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Martin |editor2-first=Elizabeth A. |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Science |title=adaptation |origyear=First published 1984 as ''Concise Science Dictionary'' |edition=6th |year=2010 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |series=Oxford Paperback Reference |isbn=978-0-19-956146-9 |lccn=2010287468 |oclc=444383696 |page=13 |quote=Any change in the structure or functioning of successive generations of a population that makes it better suited to its environment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Bowler |2003 |p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Patterson |1999 |p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Williams |1966 |p=5}}: "Evolutionary adaptation is a phenomenon of pervasive importance in biology."&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the observed diversity of species, such as the different species of [[Darwin's finches]]. The other process is [[speciation]], in which new species arise, typically through [[reproductive isolation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Mayr |1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Mayr |1982 |pp=562–566}}&lt;/ref&gt; A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of [[cichlid]] [[fish]] in African lakes, where the question of reproductive isolation is complex.&lt;ref name="Salzburger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salzburger |first1=Walter |last2=Mack |first2=Tanja |last3=Verheyen |first3=Erik |last4=Meyer |first4=Axel |authorlink4=Axel Meyer |date=February 21, 2005 |title=Out of Tanganyika: Genesis, explosive speciation, key-innovations and phylogeography of the haplochromine cichlid fishes |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-5-17.pdf |journal=[[BMC Evolutionary Biology]] |location=London |publisher=[[BioMed Central]] |volume=5 |number=17 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-5-17 |pmc=554777 |pmid=15723698 |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kornfield"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kornfield |first1=Irv |last2=Smith |first2=Peter F. |date=November 2000 |title=African Cichlid Fishes: Model Systems for Evolutionary Biology |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=31 |pages=163–196 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation is not always a simple matter where the ideal phenotype evolves for a given external environment. An organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places ''constraints'' on the evolution of development, behaviour, and structure of organisms. The main constraint, over which there has been much debate, is the requirement that each [[Genetics |genetic]] and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. However, it is not clear what "relatively small" should mean, for example [[polyploid]]y in plants is a reasonably common large genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stebbins|1950|loc=chs. 8 and 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[endosymbiosis]] is a more dramatic example.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margulis|Fester|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All adaptations help organisms survive in their [[ecological niche]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hutchinson|1965}}. The niche is the central concept in evolutionary ecology; see especially part II: "The niche: an abstractly inhabited hypervolume." (pp. 26–78)&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or [[Physiology|physiological]]. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism, such as shape, body covering, armament, and [[comparative anatomy |internal organization]]. [[Ethology|Behavioural]] adaptations are inherited systems of behaviour, whether inherited in detail as [[instinct]]s, or as a [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] capacity for [[learning]]. Examples include [[Foraging |searching for food]], [[mating]], and [[Animal communication |vocalizations]]. Physiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions such as making [[venom]], secreting [[Snail slime |slime]], and [[phototropism]]), but also involve more general functions such as [[developmental biology |growth and development]], [[Thermoregulation |temperature regulation]], [[ions |ionic]] balance and other aspects of [[homeostasis]]. Adaptation affects all aspects of the life of an organism.

The following definitions are given by the evolutionary biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]:
:1. ''Adaptation'' is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its [[habitat]] or habitats.&lt;ref name="Dobzhansky T 1968"&gt;{{harvnb |Dobzhansky |1968 |pp=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wang |first1=G |title=Analysis of Complex Diseases: A Mathematical Perspective |publisher=Taylor Francis |year=2014 |chapter=Chapter 5.6—Zero Order Adaptivity |pages=69 |isbn=9781466572232 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=DmDSBQAAQBAJ |page=69}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change Impact on Livestock: Adaptation and Mitigation |publisher=Springer |editor1-last=Sejian |editor1-first=V. |editor2-last=Gaughan |editor2-first=J. |editor3-last=Baumgard |editor3-first=L. |editor4-last=Prasad |editor4-first=C. |year=2015 |pages=515 |isbn=9788132222651 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=D-G9BwAAQBAJ |page=515}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2. ''Adaptedness'' is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Dobzhansky |1970 |pp=4–6; 79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:3. An ''adaptive trait'' is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dobzhansky |first=Theodosius |authorlink=Theodosius Dobzhansky |date=March 1956 |title=Genetics of Natural Populations.

===What adaptation is not===
[[File:Tampering_W_Nature_Guacharacas.jpg|right|thumb|Some [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists]], such as [[bird]]s, have the flexibility to adapt to [[urban area]]s.]]

Adaptation differs from flexibility, [[acclimatization]], and [[learning]]. Flexibility deals with the relative capacity of an organism to maintain itself in different habitats: its degree of [[Generalist and specialist species|specialization]]. Acclimatization describes automatic [[physiology|physiological]] adjustments during life;&lt;ref name="Rymer2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rymer | first=Tasmin | last2=Pillay | first2=Neville | last3=Schradin | first3=Carsten | title=Extinction or Survival? Behavioral Flexibility in Response to Environmental Change in the African Striped Mouse Rhabdomys | journal=Sustainability | volume=5 | issue=1 | date=2013 | doi=10.3390/su5010163 | pages=163–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; learning means improvement in behavioral performance during life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross |first=Richard |title=Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour |edition=6th  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cle1Fcr_6_QC&amp;pg=PT335 |year=2012 |publisher=Hodder |isbn=978-1-4441-6436-7 |page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are preferred to adaptation for changes during life which are not inherited by the next generation.

Flexibility stems from [[phenotypic plasticity]], the ability of an organism with a given [[genotype]] to change its [[phenotype]] in response to changes in its [[habitat]], or to move to a different habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Price |first1=Trevor D. |last2=Qvarnström |first2=Anna |last3=Irwin |first3=Darren E. |date=July 2003 |title=The role of phenotypic plasticity in driving genetic evolution |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society B|Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=270 |issue=1523 |pages=1433–1440 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2372 |pmc=1691402 |pmid=12965006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Trevor D. |date=June 2006 |title=Phenotypic plasticity, sexual selection and the evolution of colour patterns |journal=[[The Journal of Experimental Biology]]  |volume=209 |issue=12 |pages=2368–2376 |doi=10.1242/jeb.02183 |pmid=16731813}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of flexibility is inherited, and varies between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot survive if its needs are not met. Many [[herbivore]]s are like this; extreme examples are [[koala]]s which depend on ''[[Eucalyptus]]'', and [[giant panda]]s which require [[bamboo]]. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive in many different conditions. Examples are humans, [[rat]]s, [[crab]]s and many carnivores. The ''tendency'' to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is inherited—it is an adaptation. Rather different is developmental flexibility: "An animal or plant is developmentally flexible if when it is raised in or transferred to new conditions, it changes in structure so that it is better fitted to survive in the new environment," writes [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[John Maynard Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maynard Smith|1993|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If humans move to a higher altitude, respiration and physical exertion become a problem, but after spending time in high altitude conditions they acclimatize to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen, such as by producing more [[red blood cell]]s. The ability to acclimatize is an adaptation, but the acclimatization itself is not. Fecundity goes down, but deaths from some tropical diseases also go down. Over a longer period of time, some people are better able to reproduce at high altitudes than others. They contribute more heavily to later generations, and gradually by natural selection the whole population becomes adapted to the new conditions. This has demonstrably occurred, as the observed performance of long-term communities at higher altitude is significantly better than the performance of new arrivals, even when the new arrivals have had time to acclimatize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Lorna G. |last2=Regensteiner |first2=Judith G. |date=October 1983 |title=Adaptation to High Altitude |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |volume=12 |pages=285–304 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.12.100183.001441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptedness and fitness ===
[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|In this sketch of a [[fitness landscape]], a population can evolve by following the arrows to the adaptive peak at point B, and the points A and C are local optima where a population could become trapped.]]
{{Main|Fitness (biology)|Fitness landscape}}

There is a relationship between adaptedness and the concept of fitness used in [[population genetics]]. Differences in fitness between [[genotype]]s predict the rate of evolution by natural selection. Natural selection changes the relative frequencies of alternative phenotypes, insofar as they are [[Heritability|heritable]].&lt;ref name="Endler 33"&gt;{{harvnb|Endler|1986|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MYk1XbelDssC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 33–51]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a phenotype with high adaptedness may not have high fitness. Dobzhansky mentioned the example of the [[Sequoia sempervirens|Californian redwood]], which is highly adapted, but a [[Relict (biology)|relict]] species in danger of [[extinction]].&lt;ref name="Dobzhansky T 1968" /&gt; [[Elliott Sober]] commented that adaptation was a retrospective concept since it implied something about the history of a trait, whereas fitness predicts a trait's future.&lt;ref name="Sober2"&gt;{{harvnb|Sober|1984|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Relative fitness. The average contribution to the next generation by a genotype or a class of genotypes, relative to the contributions of other genotypes in the population.&lt;ref name="Futuyma_Evolution"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|1986|p=552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also known as ''Darwinian fitness'', ''[[selection coefficient]]'', and other terms.
:2. Absolute fitness. The absolute contribution to the next generation by a genotype or a class of genotypes. Also known as the [[Malthusian growth model|Malthusian parameter]] when applied to the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Endler 33" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1930|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:3. Adaptedness. The extent to which a phenotype fits its local ecological niche. Researchers can sometimes test this through a [[Transplant experiment|reciprocal transplant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=de Villemereuil | first=P. | last2=Gaggiotti | first2=O. E. | last3=Mouterde | first3=M. | last4=Till-Bottraud | first4=I | title=Common garden experiments in the genomic era: new perspectives and opportunities | journal=Heredity | volume=116 | issue=3 | date=2015-10-21 | doi=10.1038/hdy.2015.93 | pages=249–254| pmc=4806574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sewall Wright]] proposed that populations occupy ''adaptive peaks'' on a fitness landscape. To evolve to another, higher peak, a population would first have to pass through a valley of maladaptive intermediate stages, and might be "trapped" on a peak that is not optimally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1932|pp=[http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf 356–366]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic basis===
A large diversity of genome [[DNA]]s in a species is the basis for adaptation and differentiation. A large population is needed to carry sufficient diversity. According to the misrepair-accumulation aging theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Wang |first1=Jicun |last2=Michelitsch |first2=Thomas M. |last3=Wunderlin |first3=Arne |last4=Mahadeva |first4=Ravi |eprint=0904.0575 |title=Aging as a consequence of misrepair—A novel theory of aging |class=q-bio.TO |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Wang-Michelitsch |first1=Jicun |last2=Michelitsch |first2=Thomas M. |eprint=1503.07163 |title=Aging as a process of accumulation of misrepairs |class=q-bio.TO |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The misrepair mechanism is important in maintaining a sufficient number of individuals in a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Wang-Michelitsch |first1=Jicun |last2=Michelitsch |first2=Thomas M. |eprint=1505.03900 |title=Misrepair mechanism: a mechanism essential for individual adaptation, species adaptation and species evolution |class=q-bio.TO |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; misrepair is a way of repair for increasing the surviving chance of an organism when it has severe injuries. Without misrepairs, no individual could survive to reproduction age. Thus misrepair mechanism is an essential mechanism for the survival of a species and for maintaining the number of individuals. Although individuals die from aging, genome DNAs are being recopied and transmitted by individuals generation by generation. In addition, the DNA misrepairs in germ cells contribute also to the diversity of genome DNAs.

===Changes in habitat ===
Before Darwin, adaptation was seen as a fixed relationship between an organism and its habitat. It was not appreciated that as the [[climate]] changed, so did the habitat; and as the habitat changed, so did the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]]. Also, habitats are subject to changes in their biota: for example, [[Invasive species|invasions]] of species from other areas. The relative numbers of species in a given habitat are always changing. Change is the rule, though much depends on the speed and degree of the change.
When the habitat changes, three main things may happen to a resident population: habitat tracking, genetic change or extinction. In fact, all three things may occur in sequence. Of these three effects only genetic change brings about adaptation.
When a habitat changes, the resident population typically moves to more suitable places; this is the typical response of flying [[insect]]s or oceanic organisms, which have wide (though not unlimited) opportunity for movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eldredge|1985|p=136: "Of glaciers and beetles"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This common response is called ''habitat tracking''. It is one explanation put forward for the periods of apparent stasis in the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] (the [[punctuated equilibrium]] theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eldredge|1995|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic change ===
Genetic change occurs in a population when natural selection and [[mutation]]s act on its [[genetic variability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hogan |first=C. Michael |editor-last=Monosson |editor-first=Emily |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]] |title=Mutation |url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/159530/ |accessdate=2015-08-18 |date=October 12, 2010 |publisher=Environmental Information Coalition, [[National Council for Science and the Environment]] |oclc=72808636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of [[Purine metabolism|purine nucleotide metabolism]], with previous metabolic pathways being part of the ancient [[RNA world]]. By this means, the population adapts genetically to its circumstances.&lt;ref name="Orr_2005" /&gt; Genetic changes may result in visible structures, or may adjust physiological activity in a way that suits the habitat.

Habitats and biota do frequently change. Therefore, it follows that the process of adaptation is never finally complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|pp=481–483}}: This sequence tells how Darwin's ideas on adaptation developed as he came to appreciate it as "a continuing dynamic process."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, it may happen that the environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings better and better. On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the environment occur relatively rapidly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic ''tracking process'', which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population back from the brink of [[extinction]] in a process called [[evolutionary rescue]]. It should be noted that adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sterelny|Griffiths|1999|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|Herron|2007|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leigh Van Valen]] thought that even in a stable environment, competing species constantly had to adapt to maintain their relative standing. This became known as the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], as seen in host-[[parasite]] interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501548 |last=Rabajante |first=J |title=Host-parasite Red Queen dynamics with phase-locked rare genotypes|journal=[[Science Advances]] |year=2016 |volume=2|pages=e1501548 |url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501548 |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2016SciA....2E1548R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Co-adaptation ===
{{main|Co-adaptation}}

[[File:Plumpollen0060.jpg|thumb|Pollinating insects are co-adapted with flowering plants.]]
In [[coevolution]], where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the life of another species, new or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of corresponding features in the other species. These [[co-adaptation]]al relationships are intrinsically dynamic, and may continue on a trajectory for millions of years, as has occurred in the relationship between [[flowering plant]]s and [[pollination|pollinating]] insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution |author=[[Douglas J.

=== Mimicry ===
{{main|Mimicry}}
[[File:Wasp mimicry.jpg|thumb|right|A and B show real [[wasps]]; the rest are [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]]: three [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]] and one [[beetle]].]]

Bates' work on Amazonian [[Butterfly|butterflies]] led him to develop the first scientific account of [[mimicry]], especially the kind of mimicry which bears his name: [[Batesian mimicry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|Ford|1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the mimicry by a palatable species of an unpalatable or noxious species, gaining a selective advantage. A common example seen in temperate gardens is the [[hoverfly]], many of which—though bearing no sting—mimic the warning coloration of [[hymenoptera]] ([[wasp]]s and [[bee]]s). Such mimicry does not need to be perfect to improve the survival of the palatable species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wickler|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bates, Wallace and [[Fritz Müller]] believed that Batesian and [[Müllerian mimicry]] provided [[coloration evidence for natural selection|evidence for the action of natural selection]], a view which is now standard amongst biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moon|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mallet |first=James |authorlink=James Mallet |date=November 2001 |title=The speciation revolution |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=887–888 |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00342.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade-offs ===

All adaptations have a downside: [[horse]] legs are great for running on grass, but they can't scratch their backs; [[mammal]]s' hair helps temperature, but offers a niche for [[Parasitism#Types|ectoparasites]]; the only flying [[penguin]]s do is under water. Adaptations serving different functions may be mutually destructive. Compromise and makeshift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacob |first=François |authorlink=François Jacob |date=June 10, 1977 |title=Evolution and Tinkering |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |volume=196 |issue=4295 |pages=1161–1166 |doi=10.1126/science.860134 |pmid=860134|bibcode=1977Sci...196.1161J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the antlers of the [[Irish elk]], (often supposed to be far too large; in [[deer]] antler size has an [[Allometry|allometric]] relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against [[Predation|predator]]s, and to score victories in the annual [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]]. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the [[last glacial period]] presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=June 1974 |title =The Origin and Function of 'Bizarre' Structures: Antler Size and Skull Size in the 'Irish Elk,' ''Megaloceros giganteus'' |journal=Evolution |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=191–220 |doi=10.2307/2407322 |jstor=2407322}}&lt;/ref&gt; As another example, [[camouflage]] to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid [[animal coloration|coloration]] is displayed at mating time.

Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as [[Caucasian salamander]] or [[Gold-striped salamander]] have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain [[Stream|brook]]s. Elongated body protects their [[larva]]e from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their [[fecundity]]. As a result, [[fire salamander]], less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarkhnishvili |first=David N. |year=1994 |title=Interdependences between Populational, Developmental and Morphological Features of the Caucasian salamander, ''Mertensiella caucasica'' |url=http://eprints.iliauni.edu.ge/usr/share/eprints3/data/814/1/Caucasian%20Salamander%20Ecological%20Constraints.pdf |journal=Mertensiella |volume=4 |pages=315–325 |accessdate=2015-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084347/http://eprints.iliauni.edu.ge/usr/share/eprints3/data/814/1/Caucasian%20Salamander%20Ecological%20Constraints.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pfau imponierend.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Indian peafowl|Indian peacock]]'s train&lt;br /&gt;in full display]]

The [[Peafowl|peacock]]'s ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources. Darwin's explanation of its advantage was in terms of [[sexual selection]]: "This depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in exclusive relation to reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=269&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=side 256]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called 'mate choice,' with an implication that the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has survival value.&lt;ref&gt;The case was treated by {{harvnb|Fisher|1930|pp=134–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition of sexual selection was for a long time in abeyance, but has been rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronin|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict between the size of the human [[Fetus|foetal]] brain at birth, (which cannot be larger than about 400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, else it will not get through the mother's [[pelvis]]) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. [[Neanderthal]]s had a similar problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenberg |first=Karen R. |year=1992 |title=The evolution of modern human childbirth |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons for the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]] |volume=35 |issue=Supplement S15 |pages=89–124 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330350605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedlander |first1=Nancy J. |last2=Jordan |first2=David K. |authorlink2=David K.

As another example, the long neck of a [[giraffe]] is a burden and a blessing. The neck of a giraffe can be up to {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This neck can be used for inter-species competition or for foraging on tall trees where shorter [[herbivore]]s cannot reach. However, as previously stated, there is always a trade-off. This long neck is heavy and it adds to the body mass of a giraffe, so the giraffe needs an abundance of nutrition to provide for this costly adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Altwegg |first1=Robert E. |last2=Simmons |first2=Res |title=Necks-for-sex or competing browsers?

===Pre-adaptation===

Pre-adaptation occurs when a population has characteristics which by chance are suited for a set of conditions not previously experienced. For example, the polyploid [[Spartina|cordgrass]] ''Spartina townsendii'' is better adapted than either of its parent species to their own habitat of saline marsh and mud-flats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huskins |first=C.

Pre-adaptation may arise because a natural population carries a huge quantity of genetic variability.&lt;ref name="Dobzhansky T 1981"&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] [[eukaryote]]s, this is a consequence of the system of [[sexual reproduction]], where mutant alleles get partially shielded, for example, by [[dominance (genetics)|genetic dominance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.

The first experimental evidence of the pre-adaptive nature of genetic variants in microorganisms was provided by [[Salvador Luria]] and [[Max Delbrück]] who developed the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment|Fluctuation Test]], a method to show the random fluctuation of pre-existing genetic changes that conferred resistance to [[bacteriophage]]s in ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref name="Luria 1943 491–511"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luria |first=S.

Features that now appear as adaptations sometimes arose by co-option of existing traits, evolved for some other purpose.

==Non-adaptive traits ==
{{main|Spandrel (biology)|Vestigiality}}

Some traits do not appear to be adaptive, that is, they have a neutral or deleterious effect on fitness in the current environment. Because genes have [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] effects, not all traits may be functional: they may be what [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] called [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrels]], features brought about by neighbouring adaptations, like the triangular areas under neighbouring arches in architecture which began as functionless features.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014&gt;[[Günter P. Wagner|Wagner, Günter P.]], ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation''.  Princeton University Press. 2014. Chapter 1: The Intellectual Challenge of Morphological Evolution: A Case for Variational Structuralism. Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarification needed|date=July 2018}}

Another possibility is that a trait may have been adaptive at some point in an organism's evolutionary history, but a change in habitats caused what used to be an adaptation to become unnecessary or even [[maladaptation|maladapted]]. Such adaptations are termed [[Vestigiality|vestigial]]. Many organisms have vestigial organs, which are the remnants of fully functional structures in their ancestors. As a result of changes in lifestyle the organs became redundant, and are either not functional or reduced in functionality. Since any structure represents some kind of cost to the general economy of the body, an advantage may accrue from their elimination once they are not functional. Examples: [[Wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]] in humans; the loss of pigment and functional [[eye]]s in cave fauna; the loss of structure in [[Intestinal parasite|endoparasites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrett|Gautrey|Herbert|Kohn|1987}}. Charles Darwin was the first to put forward such ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extinction and coextinction ==
{{Main|Extinction|Coextinction}}

If a population cannot move or change sufficiently to preserve its long-term viability, then obviously, it will become extinct, at least in that locale. The species may or may not survive in other locales. Species extinction occurs when the death rate over the entire species exceeds the birth rate for a long enough period for the species to disappear. It was an observation of Van Valen that groups of species tend to have a characteristic and fairly regular rate of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Valen |first=Leigh |authorlink=Leigh Van Valen |date=July 1973 |title=A New Evolutionary Law |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18310184/evolutionary-theory/vol-01/Vol.1%2CNo.1%2C1-30%2CL.%20Van%20Valen%2C%20A%20new%20evolutionary%20law..pdf |journal=Evolutionary Theory |volume=1 |pages=1–30 |access-date=2015-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222094258/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18310184/evolutionary-theory/vol-01/Vol.1%2CNo.1%2C1-30%2CL.%20Van%20Valen%2C%20A%20new%20evolutionary%20law..pdf |archive-date=2014-12-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as there is co-adaptation, there is also coextinction, the loss of a species due to the extinction of another with which it is coadapted, as with the extinction of a [[parasitism|parasitic]] insect following the loss of its host, or when a flowering plant loses its pollinator, or when a [[food chain]] is disrupted.&lt;ref name="Koh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koh |first1=Lian Pin |last2=Dunn |first2=Robert R. |authorlink2=Robert Dunn (biologist) |last3=Sodhi |first3=Navjot S. |last4=Colwell |first4=Robert K. |last5=Proctor |first5=Heather C. |last6=Smith |first6=Vincent S. |display-authors=3 |title=Species Coextinctions and the Biodiversity Crisis |date=September 2004 |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5690 |pages=1632–1634  |doi=10.1126/science.1101101 |pmid=15361627|bibcode=2004Sci...305.1632K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=84&amp;itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=side 57–58]}}.

==Philosophical issues==
{{main|Adaptationism|Teleology in biology}}

Adaptation raises [[Philosophy of biology|philosophical issues]] concerning how biologists speak of function and purpose, as this carries implications of evolutionary history – that a feature evolved by natural selection for a specific reason – and potentially of supernatural intervention – that features and organisms exist because of a deity's conscious intentions.&lt;ref name="Sober1"&gt;{{harvnb|Sober|1993|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1966|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle's biology|In his biology, Aristotle]] introduced [[teleology]] to describe the adaptedness of organisms, but without accepting the supernatural intention built into [[Plato]]'s thinking, which Aristotle rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagel |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Nagel |date=May 1977 |title=Goal-Directed Processes in Biology |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=261–279 |doi=10.2307/2025745 |jstor=2025745}} Teleology Revisisted: The Dewy Lectures 1977 (first lecture)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagel |first=Ernest |date=May 1977 |title=Functional Explanations in Biology |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=280–301 |doi=10.2307/2025746 |jstor=2025746}} Teleology Revisisted: The Dewy Lectures 1977 (second lecture)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern biologists continue to face the same difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pittendrigh|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1965|pp=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1988|loc=chpt. 3, "The Multiple Meanings of Teleological"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1966|loc="The Scientific Study of Adaptation"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monod|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Allaby |editor-first=Michael |editor-link=Michael Allaby |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Zoology |title=teleonomy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_UO957htTwC&amp;pg=PA530&amp;lpg=PA530 |accessdate=2015-08-24 |edition=Reissued with new cover and corrections |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |series=Oxford Paperback Reference |isbn=0-19-860758-X |oclc=444678726}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, adaptation is obviously purposeful: natural selection chooses what works and eliminates what does not.

[[File:Tate Modern viewed from Thames Pleasure Boat - geograph.org.uk - 307445.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the world's most successful examples of adaptive reuse of old buildings is the conversion of the [[Bankside Power Station]] in London for use as the [[Tate Gallery]]. Formerly off-limits to the general public, it now receives about five million visitors a year.]]
'''Adaptive reuse''' refers to the process of reusing an old site or building for a purpose other than which it was built or designed for. Along with [[brownfield]] reclamation, adaptive reuse is seen by many as a key factor in land conservation and the reduction of [[urban sprawl]]. However adaptive reuse can become controversial as there is sometimes a blurred line between [[renovation]], [[facadism]] and adaptive reuse. It can be regarded as a compromise between [[historic preservation]] and [[demolition]].

==Definition==
Adaptive reuse deals with the issues of conservation and heritage policies. Whilst old buildings become unsuitable for their programmatic requirements, as progress in technology, politics and economics moves faster than the built environment, adaptive reuse comes in as a sustainable option for the reclamation of sites. In many situations, the types of buildings most likely to become subjects of adaptive reuse include: industrial buildings, as cities become [[gentrified]] and the process of manufacture moves away from city; political buildings, such as palaces and buildings which cannot support current and future visitors of the site; and community buildings such as churches or schools where the use has changed over time.

Adaptive reuse is seen as an effective way of reducing urban sprawl and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim, M. 2002, ''Adaptive reuse'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1 Oct. 2011 &lt;http://www.archinode.com/lcaadapt.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  By reusing an existing structure within a site, the energy required to create these spaces is lessened, as is the material waste that comes from destroying old sites and rebuilding using new materials. Through adaptive reuse old, unoccupied buildings can become suitable sites for many different types of use.

==Factors affecting adaptive reuse==

===Criteria for adaptive reuse===
While the process of adaptive reuse is a decision often made purely by companies establishing a particular brand or presence, there are often criteria for deciding whether a building should be conserved and reused or just demolished for the area of land it occupies. Some of these determining criteria include:
* The societal value of a given site; that is, the importance to the community of the use of a site by community members or visitors.
* The potential for the reuse of a particular site; the physical damage sustained to the site and its support of future use, the character of the existing site in terms of the proposed reuse.
* The historical importance of the site; in terms of both the physicality of the street-scape and the area, as well as of the role of the site in the community's understanding of the past.
* The environmental conditions of the site; whether the site is suitable climatically or can support the proposed environmental work needed in the site.

===Economic considerations===
[[File:KelsoHome SE.jpg|thumb|The [[Kelso Home for Girls]] in Baltimore, Maryland was a typical candidate for adaptive reuse, but it was razed to accommodate parking for a new athletic facility when the cost of conversion was found to be too great]]There has been much debate on the economic possibilities and viability of adaptive reuse as different corporations and companies seek to find sustainable ways to approach their corporate or retail sites.&lt;ref&gt;Hyllegard, K., Paff Ogle, J., Dunbar, B. 2003 ‘Sustainability and Historic Preservation in Retail Design: Integrating Design into a Model of the REI Denver Decision-Making Process’ Journal of Interior Design Vol. 29, No.1&amp;2, pp. 32-49&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many outcomes that affect the economic return of adaptive reuse as an avenue to reuse of a given site. Factors such as the reuse of materials and resources as well as a lesser need to involve energy, both in terms of labor and machine powered, can effectively decrease the monetary funds needed for companies to establish sites. However, there can be hidden costs in reusing old buildings such as the unknown contamination of older sites, decay and disuse affecting the usability of a building, and the possible need for modification of an older building to fit current and future [[building codes]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"&gt;Shipley, R., Utz, S., Parsons, M. 2006 ‘Does Adaptive reuse Pay? A Study of the Business of Building Renovation in Ontario, Canada’, International Journal of Heritage Studies Vol. 12, No. 6, pp. 505–520&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic costs differ from project to project and some professionals go as far as to assert that new build is always more economical and renovation is universally more expensive,&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, L. 1983 ‘What Developers Think of Historic Preservation’ Urban Land Vol.42, pp. 8 – 11&lt;/ref&gt; due to their own involvement with adaptive reuse projects. Others claim that the return on investment is enhanced when using an older building because of the savings involved. One Canadian developer claims that reusing buildings generally represents a saving of between 10-12%&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"/&gt; over building new. In terms of profitability, there are also assertions that adaptive reuse projects often have an uncertainty to their profitably that newer developments lack. When looking for funding to build, these considerations must be addressed.

With many heritage sites on the agenda for government agencies, there are a number of financial incentives provided in order to increase the use of older sites in many countries.  In the provinces of Canada, some municipalities offer financial encouragement for heritage development such as, the [[City of Waterloo]] who waived the development charges for the [[Seagram]] Lofts that have been estimated to be around $700,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"/&gt; Governing bodies also benefit from the reuse of once abandoned sites as once occupied, they generate tax revenue and therefore often recover the initial investment.

===Advantages of adaptive reuse===
With the debate of adaptive reuse as a sustainable avenue in the development of key sites, there are many advantages to using certain sites for redevelopment. One of these advantages is the site's location. In many cases, historical sites are often located in the centers of large cities. Due to the spatial development of a given area, these buildings can often be [[heritage-listed]] and therefore sold as an entity, rather than just for the land that they occupy, which the new tenants then have to retrofit the building for their particular purpose. Older buildings also often have a specific period character through the detailing and joinery of their constructed eras that newer or reconstructed developments lack. In certain cases such as the hospitality industry, the grand character of a site can influence the feel of their building and are used for maximum potential to enhance the site's physical attractiveness to a client.

===Barriers to adaptive reuse===
As mentioned above, adaptive reuse sometimes isn’t the most viable option for all historic sites. For some sites that have been left alone to decay by neglect, the physical damage of the site can render the site unusable both in terms of the cost to repair the damage as well as unsafe by government standards. Adaptive reuse of sites contaminated by hazardous materials such as asbestos also require special precautions during construction, although these procedures are well-established.  See, for example, http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workerprotection/safetyhealth/sh56.shtm

==By location==

===Americas===

====Canada====
As a comparatively young country, adaptive reuse is not the norm in Canada, where redevelopment has typically meant demolition and building anew. Calgary and Edmonton are particularly known for their pro-demolition culture, but they are not unique in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willferguson.ca/articles/sandstonecity.html Will Ferguson – Sandstone City].

Epl.ca. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1990s, adaptive use has gained traction. The conversion of former railway-centred [[warehouse district]]s to residential and commercial uses has occurred in [[Old Canadian National rail yard|Edmonton]], [[Beltline, Calgary|Calgary]], [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|Saskatoon]], [[Regina's historic buildings and precincts|Regina]], and [[Exchange District|Winnipeg]].
[[File:Distillery 3.jpg|thumb|Toronto's Distillery District was a former whiskey distillery]]
In Toronto, the [[Distillery District]], a neighbourhood in the city's southeast side, was entirely adapted from the old [[Gooderham &amp; Worts]] [[distillery]]. Other prominent re-uses include the Candy Factory on Queen Street West and the Toy Factory, in the city's [[Liberty Village]] district, both designed by [[Quadrangle Architects]], a firm specializing in adaptive re-use in Toronto and elsewhere. Vancouver's [[Yaletown]], an upscale neighbourhood established in the 1990s, features warehouses and other small-industrial structures and spaces converted into apartments and offices for the gentrification of the area. Vancouver's [[Granville Island]] also demonstrates a successful mix of adaptive reuse as well as retention of traditional uses in the same district. Montreal's [[Griffintown]], [[Old Port of Montreal|Old Port]], and [[Lachine Canal]] areas all feature ex-industrial areas that have been reused or will do so in the future on current plans.

Other noted adaptive reuse projects in the 2010s have included the [[Laurentian School of Architecture]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], which is incorporating several historic buildings in the city's downtown core into its new campus, similar to the downtown campus of [[NSCAD University]] in Halifax, and Mill Square in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], an ongoing project to convert the derelict [[St. Mary's Paper]] mill into a mixed-use cultural and tourism hub.&lt;ref name=designers&gt;[http://www.northernontariobusiness.com/Regional-News/sault-ste-marie/2014/05/Designers-hired-for-Sault-redevelopment-project.aspx "Designers hired for Sault redevelopment project"]. ''[[Northern Ontario Business]]'', 15 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of former military bases in Canada, declared surplus in the 1990s, have also proven to be opportune for adaptive reuse. An example is the former [[CFB Cornwallis]] in rural Nova Scotia which was largely converted, without demolitions, into a [[business park]].

====United States====
[[File:BaltimorePowerPlant.JPG|thumb|[[Pratt Street Power Plant]] in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, converted into retail, restaurants, and offices.]]
[[File:Western Metal Supply Co..jpg|thumb|right|The Western Metal Building as seen during a game.]]
[[Ghirardelli Square]] in San Francisco was the first major adaptive reuse project in the United States, opening in 1964. Urban waterfronts, historically used as points for industrial production and transport, are now selling-points for home buyers and renters. In American city neighborhoods that have seen racial and ethnic demographic changes over the last century, some houses of worship have been converted for other religions, and some others have been converted into residences.

A large number of brick mill buildings in the Northeast United States have undergone [[mill conversion]] projects. In the United States, especially in the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwest]], [[loft]] housing is one prominent result of adaptive reuse projects. Formerly-[[industry|industrial]] areas such as the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]] in New York City, [[Callowhill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Callowhill]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]] in San Francisco are being transformed into residential neighborhoods through this process. This transformation is sometimes associated with [[gentrification]]. [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]] [[Pennsylvania]] is an example of a mile-long former [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]] terminal and headquarters being converted into a retail, office, hotel, and tourist destination. The [[Pratt Street Power Plant]] in Baltimore was converted to offices, retail, and restaurants. An example of adaptive reuse conversion to office space are [[The Hilliard Mills]]. The adaptive reuse of Empire Stores will transform seven abandoned coffee warehouse in [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] in New York City into office, retail, restaurant and a rooftop public park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=E99DF405-C29C-7CA2-F6F4E9B623E06B15 |title=Midtown Equities to Redevelop Empire Stores and St. Ann's Warehouse to Develop Tobacco Warehouse at Brooklyn Bridge Park |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 September 2013 |website=www.mikebloomberg.com |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211012140/http://mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=E99DF405-C29C-7CA2-F6F4E9B623E06B15 |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/nyregion/brooklyn-takes-another-pass-at-revitalizing-an-abandoned-waterfront-warehouse.html?_r=0 |title= Another Pass at Revitalizing Abandoned Warehouse Space on the Waterfront|last1= Dunlap |first1= David |date= 25 September 2013 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other museums adapted from old factories include "MassMOCA",  the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206090839/http://www.robertwilson.com/watermill/watermill.htm Watermill Center] in Long Island, New York, and The [[Dia Art Foundation]] Museum in upstate New York.

In [[San Diego, California]], the historic brick structure of the Western Metal Supply Co. building at 7th Avenue (between K and L Streets) was preserved and incorporated into the design of [[Petco Park]], the new [[baseball]]-only ballpark of the [[San Diego Padres]], and can be prominently seen in the left-field corner of that ballpark. It now houses the team's flagship gift shop, luxury rental suites, a restaurant and rooftop bleachers, and its southeast corner serves as the ballpark's left field foul pole.

===Australia===
In Australia, there have been a number of adaptive reuse projects as the main cities have turned from industrial areas into areas of high value and business areas. In Sydney, sites such as the old [[Sydney Mint]] have been renovated and adapted into inner-city headquarters for the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]]. The movement of the city from an industrial, working class area into a gentrified area with high house prices has helped a number of adaptive reuse sites to exist within such an area, the old [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] building has also been transformed from an old jail into a museum which documents and records the history of Australia's first settlers and convicts.

The industrial history of Australia has also been an influencing factor in determining the types of buildings and areas which have gone on to become adaptive reuse sites, especially in the realms of private residences and community based buildings. Some such sites include, [[Nonda Katsalidis]]’ Malthouse apartments in Richmond, a conversion of a former grain silo and the South Australian site of the Balhannah Mines which was adapted into a private residence and has received awards from the [[Housing Industry Association]] and the Design Institute of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004, "Adaptive reuse – Preserving our past", DEH, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;

In Adelaide four prominent, heritage listed 19th Century buildings in poor repair were restored, refurbished and given new roles by the South Australian Government during the [[Rann Government]] (2002 to 2011). The [[Torrens Building]] in Victoria Square, former headquarters of the Registrar-General, was restored and adapted to become the Australian campus for both Carnegie Mellon University and University College London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australia.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University]&lt;/ref&gt; The former Adelaide Stock Exchange building was purchased, restored and adapted to become the Science Exchange for the Royal Institution Australia and the Australian Science Media Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-14/iconic-buildings-of-adelaide-the-stock-exchange/7508792|title=Iconic buildings of Adelaide: Come inside the Stock Exchange |last=Williamson |first=Brett |publisher=891 ABC Adelaide |date=14 June 2016 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrens Parade Ground and building were restored for use as a headquarters for veterans' organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Documents, Department of Premier and Cabinet, July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly $50 million was committed to restore and adapt the large Glenside Psychiatric Hospital and precinct as the new Adelaide Studios of the South Australian Film Corporation opened by Premier Rann in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safilm.com.au South Australian Film Corporation ]&lt;/ref&gt; And the 62 hectare former Mitsubishi Motors plant is being adapted to become a clean manufacturing centre and education and training hub for Flinders University and TAFE.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald,28 May 2011.

===Europe===
[[File:Tate modern london 2001 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Bankside Power Station]] in London was converted for use as the [[Tate Gallery]]. Shown is the former [[turbine hall]], used to house exhibits.]]
[[File:5 Lodz 068.jpg|thumb|right|One of the entrances to Manufaktura in [[Łódź]], Poland]]
In Europe, the main forms of adaptive reuse have been around former palaces and unused residences of the different European royal families into publicly accessible galleries and museums. Many of the spaces have been restored with period finishes and display different collections of art, and design. In Paris, France, the most famous example of adaptive reuse is the [[Musée du Louvre]], a former palace built in the late 12th century under Philip II and opened to the public as a museum in 1793. Also, in London, England, the [[Queen's House]], a former royal residence built around 1614, has become part of the [[National Maritime Museum]] and houses the museum's fine art collection.

The [[Tate Modern]], also in London is another example of adaptive reuse in the European continent, unlike other adaptive reuse galleries in Europe, the Tate Modern takes full advantage of the site of the former [[Bankside Power Station]], which involved the refurbishment of the old, abandoned power station. The wide industrial space has proven to be a worthy backdrop to modern art, with the famous turbine hall hosting artists including [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Ai Weiwei]].

Other famous adaptive reuse sites in Europe include the [[Maastricht]] branch of the [[Selexyz]] chain in the Netherlands. This project received 2007 Lensvelt de Architect interior design award for its innovative reuse and is number one on ''[[The Guardian]]'''s worldwide top ten bookstores list.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, S. 2008, Top shelves, ''The Guardian'', London, UK viewed 1 October 2011&lt; https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/11/bestukbookshops&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Łódź]], Poland, the [[Izrael Poznański]] mills have been turned into the {{convert|69|ha|adj=on}} [[Manufaktura]] [[mixed-use development]], including a mall, 3 museums, multi-cinema and restaurants.

'''Bagan''' ({{MYname|MY=ပုဂံ|MLCTS=pu.gam}}, {{IPA-my|bəɡàɴ|IPA}}; formerly '''Pagan''') is an ancient city located in the [[Mandalay Region]] of [[Myanmar]]. From the 9th to 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the first kingdom that unified the regions that would later constitute modern Myanmar. During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries, over 10,000 [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples, [[pagoda]]s and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which the remains of over 2,200 temples and pagodas still survive to the present day.

The '''Bagan Archaeological Zone''' is a main attraction for [[Tourism in Burma|the country's nascent tourism industry]]. It is seen by many as equal in attraction to [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21578171-why-investors-still-need-proceed-caution-promiseand-pitfalls |title=Business: The promise—and the pitfalls |website=The Economist |date=25 May 2013 |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Bagan is the present-day [[Burmese dialects#Standard dialects|standard Burmese pronunciation]] of the Burmese word ''Pugan'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ပုဂံ}}), derived from [[Old Burmese]] ''Pukam'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ပုကမ်}}). Its classical [[Pali]] name is ''[[Arimaddana|Arimaddanapura]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|အရိမဒ္ဒနာပူရ}}, lit. "the City that Tramples on Enemies"). Its other names in Pali are in reference to its extreme dry zone climate: ''Tattadesa'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တတ္တဒေသ}}, "parched land"), and ''Tampadīpa'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တမ္ပဒီပ}}, "bronzed country").&lt;ref name="tt-117-118"&gt;Than Tun 1964: 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burmese chronicles]] also report other classical names of ''[[Thiri Pyissaya]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|သီရိပစ္စယာ}}; {{lang-pi|Siripaccaya}}) and ''[[Tampawaddy]]'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|တမ္ပဝတီ}}; {{lang-pi|Tampavatī}}).&lt;ref name="my-1-139-141"&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===9th to 13th centuries===
{{Main article|Early Pagan Kingdom|Pagan Kingdom}}
[[File:Bagan Sunset.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bagan's prosperous economy built over 10,000 temples between the 11th and 13th centuries.]]
[[File:Pagan Empire -- Sithu II.PNG|thumb|150px|Pagan Empire c. 1210]]

According to the [[Burmese chronicles]], Bagan was founded in the second century [[Anno Domini|AD]], and fortified in 849 AD by King [[Pyinbya]], 34th successor of the founder of early Bagan.&lt;ref name="geh-18"&gt;Harvey 1925: 18&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholarship however holds that Bagan was founded in the mid-to-late 9th century by the [[Bamar|Mranma]] (Burmans), who had recently entered the Irrawaddy valley from the [[Nanzhao Kingdom]]. It was among several competing [[Pyu city-states]] until the late 10th century when the Burman settlement grew in authority and grandeur.&lt;ref name="vbl-90-91"&gt;Lieberman 2003: 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1044 to 1287, Bagan was the capital as well as the political, economic and cultural nerve center of the [[Pagan Empire]]. Over the course of 250 years, Bagan's rulers and their wealthy subjects constructed over 10,000 religious monuments (approximately 1000 stupas, 10,000 small temples and 3000 monasteries)&lt;ref name="dms-216"&gt;Stadtner 2011: 216&lt;/ref&gt; in an area of {{convert|104|km2|sqmi}} in the Bagan plains. The prosperous city grew in size and grandeur, and became a cosmopolitan center for religious and secular studies, specializing in Pali scholarship in grammar and philosophical-psychological (''[[abhidhamma]]'') studies as well as works in a variety of languages on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], [[phonology]], grammar, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], medicine, and legal studies.&lt;ref name="vbl-115-116"&gt;Lieberman 2003: 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; The city attracted monks and students from as far as [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Khmer Empire]].

The culture of Bagan was dominated by religion. The religion of Bagan was fluid, syncretic and by later standards, unorthodox. It was largely a continuation of religious trends in the [[Pyu city-states|Pyu era]] where [[Theravada Buddhism]] co-existed with [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Tantric Buddhism]], various Hindu ([[Shaivism|Saivite]], and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishana]]) schools as well as native animist (''[[nat (spirit)|nat]]'') traditions. While the royal patronage of Theravada Buddhism since the mid-11th century had enabled the Buddhist school to gradually gain primacy, other traditions continued to thrive throughout the Pagan period to degrees later unseen.&lt;ref name="vbl-115-116"/&gt;

The Pagan Empire collapsed in 1287 due to repeated [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] (1277–1301). Recent research shows that Mongol armies may not have reached Bagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal.&lt;ref name="vbl-119-120"&gt;[[Victor Lieberman|Lieberman]] 2003: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; However, the damage had already been done. The city, once home to some 50,000 to 200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence. The city formally ceased to be the capital of Burma in December 1297 when the [[Myinsaing Kingdom]] became the new power in Upper Burma.&lt;ref name="mha-74"&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt-1959-119-120"&gt;Than Tun 1959: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

===14th to 19th centuries===
[[File:Hot air balloon over a pagoda in Bagan.jpg|thumb|A hot-air balloon flying over a pagoda in Bagan]]
Bagan survived into the 15th century as a human settlement,&lt;ref name="mat-1985-196-197"&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 196–197&lt;/ref&gt; and as a pilgrimage destination throughout the imperial period. A smaller number of "new and impressive" religious monuments still went up to the mid-15th century but afterward, new temple constructions slowed to a trickle with fewer than 200 temples built between the 15th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="dms-216"/&gt; The old capital remained a pilgrimage destination but pilgrimage was focused only on "a score or so" most prominent temples out of the thousands such as the [[Ananda Temple|Ananda]], the [[Shwezigon Pagoda|Shwezigon]], the [[Sulamani Temple|Sulamani]], the [[Htilominlo Temple|Htilominlo]], the [[Dhammayazika Pagoda|Dhammayazika]], and a few other temples along an ancient road. The rest—thousands of less famous, out-of-the-way temples—fell into disrepair, and most did not survive the test of time.&lt;ref name="dms-216"/&gt;

For the few dozen temples that were regularly patronized, the continued patronage meant regular upkeep as well as architectural additions donated by the devotees. Many temples were repainted with new frescoes on top of their original Pagan era ones, or fitted with new Buddha statutes. Then came a series of state-sponsored "systematic" renovations in the [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung period]] (1752–1885), which by and large were not true to the original designs—some finished with "a rude plastered surface, scratched without taste, art or result". The interiors of some temples were also whitewashed, such as the [[Thatbyinnyu Temple|Thatbyinnyu]] and the Ananda. Many painted inscriptions and even murals were added in this period.&lt;ref name="dms-217"&gt;Stadtner 2011: 217&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to present===
[[File:Pumpkin Pagoda -Bupaya Pagoda-, Pagan, Upper Burma.jpg|thumb|The original Bupaya seen here in 1868 was completely destroyed by the 1975 earthquake. A new pagoda in the original shape, but gilded, has been rebuilt.]]

Bagan, located in an active earthquake zone, had suffered from many earthquakes over the ages, with over 400 recorded earthquakes between 1904 and 1975.&lt;ref name="uc-28-ix"&gt;Unesco 1976: ix&lt;/ref&gt; A [[1975 Bagan earthquake|major earthquake]] occurred on 8 July 1975, reaching 8 [[Mercalli intensity scale|MM]] in Bagan and [[Myinkaba]], and 7 MM in [[Nyaung-U]].&lt;ref name="iy-ky"&gt;Ishizawa and Kono 1989: 114&lt;/ref&gt; The quake damaged many temples, in many cases, such as the [[Bupaya Pagoda|Bupaya]], severely and irreparably. Today, 2229 temples and pagodas remain.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-117"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these damaged pagodas underwent restorations in the 1990s by the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]], which sought to make Bagan an international tourist destination. However, the restoration efforts instead drew widespread condemnation from art historians and preservationists worldwide. Critics are aghast that the restorations paid little attention to original architectural styles, and used modern materials, and that the government has also established a [[golf course]], a paved highway, and built a 61-meter (200-foot) watchtower. Although the government believed that the ancient capital's hundreds of (unrestored) temples and large corpus of stone inscriptions were more than sufficient to win the designation of UNESCO World Heritage Site,&lt;ref name="unesco-whs"&gt;Unesco 1996&lt;/ref&gt; the city has not been so designated, allegedly mainly on account of the restorations.&lt;ref name=jbt&gt;Tourtellot 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagan today is a main tourist destination in the country's nascent tourism industry, which has long been the target of various boycott campaigns. The majority of over 300,000 international tourists to the country in 2011 are believed to have also visited Bagan.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Several Burmese publications note that the city's small tourism infrastructure will have to expand rapidly even to meet a modest pickup in tourism in the following years.

On 24 August 2016, a [[August 2016 Myanmar earthquake|major earthquake]] hit central Burma and again did major damage in Bagan; this time almost 400 temples were destroyed. The Sulamani and Myauk Guni (North Guni) were severely damaged. The Bagan Archaeological Department has started a survey and reconstruction effort with the help of UNESCO experts. Visitors are prohibited from entering 33 damaged temples.

==Geography==
[[File:Bagan temples map.png|thumb|Map of the Bagan area showing the locations of the temples, hotels and transportation hubs]]
The '''Bagan Archaeological Zone''', defined as the 13 x 8&amp;nbsp;km area centred around Old Bagan, consisting of [[Nyaung U]] in the north and New Bagan in the south,&lt;ref name="unesco-whs"/&gt; lies in the vast expanse of plains in Upper Burma on the bend of the [[Irrawaddy river]]. It is located {{convert|290|km|mi}} south-west of [[Mandalay]] and {{convert|700|km|mi}} north of [[Yangon]]. Its coordinates are 21°10' North and 94°52' East.

===Climate===
Bagan lies in the middle of the "dry zone" of Burma, the region roughly between [[Shwebo]] in the north and [[Pyay]] in the south. Unlike the coastal regions of the country, which receive annual monsoon rainfalls exceeding 2500 [[millimeter|mm]], the dry zone gets little precipitation as it is sheltered from the rain by the [[Rakhine Yoma]] mountain range in the west.

Available online climate sources report Bagan climate quite differently.

===Architecture===
Bagan stands out for not only the sheer number of religious edifices of Myanmar but also the magnificent architecture of the buildings, and their contribution to Burmese temple design. The artistry of the architecture of pagodas in Bagan proves the achievement of Myanmar craftsmen in handicrafts. The Bagan temple falls into one of two broad categories: the ''[[stupa]]''-style solid temple and the ''gu''-style ({{my|ဂူ}}) hollow temple.

====Stupas====
A ''stupa'', also called a pagoda, is a massive structure, typically with a relic chamber inside. The Bagan ''stupas'' or pagodas evolved from earlier Pyu designs, which in turn were based on the ''stupa'' designs of the Andhra region, particularly [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]] in present-day south-eastern India, and to a smaller extent to [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name="mat-2005-26-31"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 26–31&lt;/ref&gt; The Bagan-era stupas in turn were the prototypes for later Burmese stupas in terms of symbolism, form and design, building techniques and even materials.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-233-235"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 233–235&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

Originally, a Ceylonese ''stupa'' had a hemispheric body ({{lang-pi|anda}} "the egg"), on which a rectangular box surrounded by a stone [[balustrade]] (''harmika'') was set. Extending up from the top of the ''stupa'' was a shaft supporting several ceremonial umbrellas. The ''stupa'' is a representation of the [[Buddhist cosmology|Buddhist cosmos]]: its shape symbolizes [[Mount Meru]] while the umbrella mounted on the brickwork represents the world's axis.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 118–120&lt;/ref&gt; The brickwork pediment was often covered in stucco and decorated in relief. Pairs or series of ogres as guardian figures ('bilu') were a favourite theme in the Bagan period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Falconer, J.; Moore, E.; Tettoni, L. I. |title=Burmese design and architecture |year=2000 |publisher=Periplus |location=Hong Kong |isbn=9625938826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Indic design was gradually modified first by the [[Pyu people|Pyu]], and then by Burmans at Bagan where the ''stupa'' gradually developed a longer, cylindrical form. The earliest Bagan ''stupas'' such as the Bupaya (c. 9th century) were the direct descendants of the Pyu style at [[Sri Ksetra]]. By the 11th century, the ''stupa'' had developed into a more bell-shaped form in which the parasols morphed into a series of increasingly smaller rings placed on one top of the other, rising to a point. On top the rings, the new design replaced the ''harmika'' with a lotus bud. The lotus bud design then evolved into the "banana bud", which forms the extended apex of most Burmese pagodas. Three or four rectangular terraces served as the base for a pagoda, often with a gallery of terra-cotta tiles depicting Buddhist ''[[jataka]]'' stories. The [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and the [[Shwesandaw Pagoda (Bagan)|Shwesandaw Pagoda]] are the earliest examples of this type.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt; Examples of the trend toward a more bell-shaped design gradually gained primacy as seen in the [[Dhammayazika Pagoda]] (late 12th century) and the [[Mingalazedi Pagoda]] (late 13th century).&lt;ref name="mat-2005-210-213"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 210–213&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hollow temples====
{{double image|right|Gawdawpalin Temple Bagan Myanmar.jpg|131|Dhammayangyi Paya, Bagan, Myanmar.jpg|120|"One-face"-style [[Gawdawpalin Temple]] (left) and "four-face" [[Dhammayangyi Temple]]}}

In contrast to the ''stupas'', the hollow ''gu''-style temple is a structure used for meditation, devotional worship of the Buddha and other Buddhist rituals. The ''gu'' temples come in two basic styles: "one-face" design and "four-face" design—essentially one main entrance and four main entrances. Other styles such as five-face and hybrids also exist. The one-face style grew out of 2nd century [[Beikthano]], and the four-face out of 7th century Sri Ksetra. The temples, whose main features were the pointed arches and the vaulted chamber, became larger and grander in the Bagan period.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-224-225"&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

====Innovations====
Although the Burmese temple designs evolved from Indic, Pyu (and possibly Mon) styles, the techniques of vaulting seem to have developed in Bagan itself. The earliest vaulted temples in Bagan date to the 11th century, while the vaulting did not become widespread in India until the late 12th century. The masonry of the buildings shows "an astonishing degree of perfection", where many of the immense structures survived the 1975 earthquake more or less intact.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt; (Unfortunately, the vaulting techniques of the Bagan era were lost in the later periods. Only much smaller ''gu'' style temples were built after Bagan. In the 18th century, for example, King [[Bodawpaya]] attempted to build the [[Mingun Pagoda]], in the form of spacious vaulted chambered temple but failed as craftsmen and masons of the later era had lost the knowledge of vaulting and keystone arching to reproduce the spacious interior space of the Bagan hollow temples.&lt;ref name="mat-2005-233-235"/&gt;)

Another architectural innovation originated in Bagan is the Buddhist temple with a pentagonal floor plan. This design grew out of hybrid (between one-face and four-face designs) designs. The idea was to include the veneration of the [[Maitreya Buddha]], the future and fifth Buddha of this era, in addition to the four who had already appeared. The Dhammayazika and the [[Ngamyethna Pagoda]] are examples of the pentagonal design.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-118-120"/&gt;

===Museums===
[[File:Bagan Palace.JPG|thumb|Old palace site in Old Bagan. A new completely conjectural palace has been reconstructed since 2003.]]
* The Bagan Archaeological Museum: The only museum in the Bagan Archaeological Zone, itself a field museum a millennium old. The three-story museum houses a number of rare Bagan period objects including the original [[Myazedi inscription]]s, the [[Rosetta stone]] of Burma.
* Anawrahta's Palace: It was rebuilt in 2003 based on the extant foundations at the old palace site.&lt;ref name=moc&gt;Ministry of Culture&lt;/ref&gt; But the palace above the foundation is completely conjectural.

==Transport==
[[File:Nyaung U Airport.JPG|thumb|left|[[Nyaung U Airport]] is the gateway to the Bagan region]]

Bagan is accessible by air, rail, bus, car and river boat.

===Air===
Most international tourists fly to the city. The [[Nyaung U Airport]] is the gateway to the Bagan region. Several domestic airlines have regular flights to [[Yangon]], which take about 80 minutes to cover the 600 kilometres. Flights to [[Mandalay]] take approximately 30 minutes and to [[Heho]] about 40 minutes.&lt;ref name="bagantravel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-bagan.com/getting-there.html |title=Getting to Bagan Myanmar |website=Visit Bagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is located on the outskirts of [[Nyaung U]] and it takes about 20 minutes by taxi to reach Bagan.

===Rail===
The city is on a spur from the Yangon-Mandalay rail line. [[Myanmar Railways]] operates a daily overnight train service each way between [[Yangon]] and Bagan (Train Nos 61 &amp; 62), which takes at least 18 hours. The trains have a sleeper car and also 1st Class and Ordinary Class seating.&lt;ref name="trainmyanmar"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seat61.com/Burma.htm#Yangon-Bagan |title=Train Travel in Myanmar |website=The man in seat 61...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between [[Mandalay]] and Bagan there are two daily services each way (Train Nos 117,118,119 &amp; 120) that take at least 8 hours. The trains have 1st Class and Ordinary Class seating.&lt;ref name="trainmyanmar" /&gt;

===Buses and cars===
Overnight buses and cars also operate to and from [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] taking approximately 9 and 6 hours respectively.&lt;ref name="bagantravel" /&gt;

===Boat===
An 'express' ferry service runs between Bagan and [[Mandalay]]. Following the Irrawaddy river the fastest ferry takes around 9 hours to travel the 170 kilometres. The service runs daily during peak periods and slower sailings with overnight stops are also available.

==Economy==
[[File:Bagan-Lacquerware-Factory-Workers.JPG|thumb|Workers at a lacquerware factory]]

Bagan's economy is based mainly on [[tourism]]. Because of boycotts against the previous military government, the Bagan region's tourism infrastructure is still quite modest by international standards. The city has a few international standard hotels and many family-run guesthouses. Bagan is also the center of Burmese [[lacquerware]] industry, which to a large degree depends on tourist demand. Much of the lacquerware is destined for souvenir shops in Yangon, and to the world markets. Moreover, the lacquerware-making process itself has become a tourist draw.

==Demographics==
The population of Bagan in its heyday is estimated anywhere between 50,000&lt;ref name="geh-78"&gt;Harvey 1925: 78&lt;/ref&gt; to 200,000 people.&lt;ref name="hk-ab-115"&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 115&lt;/ref&gt; Until the advent of tourism industry in the 1990s, only a few villagers lived in Old Bagan. The rise of tourism has attracted a sizable population to the area. Because Old Bagan is now off limits to permanent dwellings, much of the population reside in either New Bagan, south of Old Bagan, or Nyaung-U, north of Old Bagan. The majority of native residents are [[Bamar people|Bamar]].

==Administration==
The Bagan archaeological zone is part of [[Nyaung-U District]], [[Mandalay Region]].

'''Biological engineering''', or '''bioengineering'''/'''bio-engineering''', is the application of principles of biology and the tools of engineering to create usable, tangible, economically viable products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological engineering|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-1-62968-526-7|location=Gale Virtual Reference Library|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biological engineering employs knowledge and expertise from a number of pure and applied sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Basics of Bioengineering Education|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=9783642149979|location=26Th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference, College Park, Maryland|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as mass and heat transfer, kinetics, biocatalysts, biomechanics, [[bioinformatics]], separation and purification processes, bioreactor design, surface science, fluid mechanics, [[thermodynamics]], and polymer science. It is used in the design of medical devices, diagnostic equipment, biocompatible materials, renewable bioenergy, ecological engineering, agricultural engineering, and other areas that improve the living standards of societies. Examples of bioengineering research include bacteria engineered to produce chemicals, new [[medical imaging]] technology, portable and [[rapid diagnostic test|rapid]] disease diagnostic devices, [[prosthesis|prosthetics]], [[biopharmaceutical]]s, and [[tissue engineering|tissue-engineered organ]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/about-us/what-is-bioengineering|title=What is Bioengineering?|website=bioeng.berkeley.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Bioengineering is overlaps substantially with [[biotechnology]] and the [[biomedical sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tanmoyray.com/blog/biotech-life-sciences/biotechnology-vs-biomedical-science-vs-biomedical-engineering-bioengineering/|title=Biotechnology vs Biomedical Science vs Biomedical Engineering (Bioengineering)|date=2018-07-19|work=Tanmoy Ray|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a way analogous to how various other forms of engineering and technology relate to various other sciences (for example, [[aerospace engineering]] and other [[outline of space technology|space technology]] to [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] and [[astrophysics]]).

In general, biological engineers (or ''biomedical engineers'') attempt to either mimic biological systems to create products or modify and control biological systems so that they can replace, augment, sustain, or predict chemical and mechanical processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasotti|first=Lorenzo|last2=Zucca|first2=Susanna|date=2014-08-03|title=Advances and Computational Tools towards Predictable Design in Biological Engineering|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2014/369681/|journal=Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine|volume=2014|pages=1–16|doi=10.1155/2014/369681|pmc=4137594|pmid=25161694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioengineers can apply their expertise to other applications of engineering and [[biotechnology]], including genetic modification of plants and microorganisms, bioprocess engineering, and biocatalysis.

==History==
Biological engineering is a science-based discipline founded upon the biological sciences in the same way that [[chemical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biological Engineering|publisher = |year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-62968-526-7|location = Gale Virtual Reference Library|pages = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be based upon chemistry, electricity and magnetism, and classical mechanics, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Cuello"&gt;Cuello JC, Engineering to biology and biology to engineering, The bi-directional connection between engineering and biology in biological engineering design, Int J Engng Ed 2005, 21, 1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Before WWII, biological engineering had just begun being recognized as a branch of engineering, and was a very new concept to people. Post-WWII, it started to grow more rapidly, partially due to the term "bioengineering" being coined by British scientist and broadcaster [[Heinz Wolff]] in 1954 at the National Institute for Medical Research. Wolff graduated that same year and became the director of the Division of Biological Engineering at the university. This was the first time Bioengineering was recognized as its own branch at a university. Electrical engineering is considered to pioneer this engineering sector due to its work with medical devices and machinery during this time&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical &amp; biological engineering|date=1966-1976|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=Oxford ; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;.When engineers and life scientists started working together, they recognized the problem that the engineers didn't know enough about the actual biology behind their work. To resolve this problem, engineers who wanted to get into biological engineering devoted more of their time and studies to the details and processes that go into fields such as biology, psychology, and medicine&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naik|first1=edited by Ganesh R.|title=Applied biological engineering : principles and practice|date=2012|publisher=InTech|location=Rijeka|isbn=9789535104124}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The term biological engineering may also be applied to environmental modifications such as surface soil protection, slope stabilization, watercourse and shoreline protection, windbreaks, vegetation barriers including noise barriers and visual screens, and the ecological enhancement of an area. Because other engineering disciplines also address [[Life|living organisms]], the term biological engineering can be applied more broadly to include [[agricultural engineering]]. 

The first biological engineering program was created at [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1966, making it the first biological engineering curriculum in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=199|title=Founder of UCSD Bioengineering Program |date=1 Mar 2004|publisher=jacobsschool.ucsd.edu|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent programs have been launched at [[MIT]]&lt;ref name="MIT-Dept"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/be/index.shtml|title=MIT, Department of Biological Engineering|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Utah State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.be.usu.edu/|title=Utah State University, Department of Biological Engineering|date=|publisher=be.usu.edu|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many old agricultural engineering departments in universities over the world have re-branded themselves as ''[[agricultural engineering|agricultural]] and biological engineering'' or ''agricultural and [[biosystems engineering]],'' due to biological engineering as a whole being a rapidly developing field with fluid categorization. According to Professor Doug Lauffenburger of MIT,&lt;ref name="MIT-Dept" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://be.mit.edu/directory/douglas-a-lauffenburger|title=MIT Directory, Doug Lauffenburger|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; biological engineering has a broad base which applies engineering principles to an enormous range of size and complexities of systems. These systems range from the molecular level ([[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[microbiology]], [[pharmacology]], [[protein]] chemistry, [[cell biology|cytology]], [[immunology]], [[neurobiology]] and [[neuroscience]]) to cellular and tissue-based systems (including devices and sensors), to whole macroscopic organisms (plants, animals), and can even range up to entire ecosystems.

== Education ==
The average length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is signified as a [[bachelor of engineering]] ([[B.S.]] in engineering). Fundamental courses include thermodynamics, bio-mechanics, biology, genetic engineering, fluid and mechanical dynamics, kinetics, electronics, and materials properties.&lt;ref name="Linsenmeier"&gt;Linsenmeier RA, [http://www.vanth.org/curriculum/def_bme_curr.pdf Defining the Undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Curriculum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson and Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson AT, Phillips WM|year=|title=Philosophical foundations of biological engineering|url=|journal=[[Journal of Engineering Education]]|volume=1995|issue=84|pages=311–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering]] (AIMBE) is made up of 1,500 members. Their main goal is to educate the public about the value biological engineering has in our world, as well as invest in research and other programs to advance the field. They give out awards to those dedicated to innovation in the field, and awards of achievement in the field. (They do not have a direct contribution to biological engineering, they more recognize those who do and encourage the public to continue that forward movement.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIMBE About Page|url=http://www.aimbe.org/about-aimbe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Institute of Biological Engineering]] (IBE) is a non-profit organization, they run on donations alone. They aim to encourage the public to learn and to continue advancements in biological engineering. (Like AIMBE, they don't do research directly, they do however offer scholarships to students who show promise in the field).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibe.org|title=Institute of Biological Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boaz Cohen''' (1899–1968) was a leading American scholar of [[Talmud]], a legal decisor ([[posek]]), and a professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

==Biography==
Cohen was born and educated in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].  He was ordained as a [[rabbi]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS) in 1924.  Following his ordination, he was appointed Assistant Librarian of JTS.  In 1925, he was appointed an instructor of [[Talmud]], and went on to serve on the JTS faculty for four decades.  In 1927, he received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"Boaz Cohen (1899-1968)," by Elias J. Bickerman and Edward M. Gershfield, ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research,'' Vol. 37, (1969), pp. xxix&lt;/ref&gt;  During his career he published extensively on the Talmud and [[Jewish law]], while also authoring many comparative studies between Jewish law and other legal systems.  Many of those studies were published in a collection titled ''Jewish and Roman Law'' (New York, 1966).

Cohen also served as Chair of the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|Committee on Jewish Law]] of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], and he issued thousands of legal rulings.&lt;ref&gt;"Boaz Cohen (1899-1968)," by Elias J. Bickerman and Edward M. Gershfield, ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research,'' Vol. 37, (1969), pp. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], a '''conjunction''' occurs when two [[astronomical object]]s or [[spacecraft]] have either the same [[right ascension]] or the same [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]], usually as observed from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[astronomical symbol]] for conjunction is ☌ (in [[Unicode]] U+260C) and handwritten [[File:Astronomical conjunction symbol.png|20px]]. The conjunction symbol is not used in modern astronomy. It continues to be used in [[Astrological symbols#Aspects|astrology]].

When two objects always appear close to the [[ecliptic]]—such as two [[planet]]s, the [[Moon]] and a planet, or the [[Sun]] and a planet—this fact implies an apparent close approach between the objects as seen on the sky. A related word, ''[[appulse]]'', is the minimum apparent separation on the sky of two astronomical objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjunctions involve either two objects in the [[Solar System]] or one object in the Solar System and a more distant object, such as a [[star]]. A conjunction is an apparent phenomenon caused by the observer's [[perspective (visual)|perspective]]: the two objects involved are not actually close to one another in [[space]]. Conjunctions between two bright objects close to the ecliptic, such as two bright planets, can be seen with the [[naked eye]].

==Passing close==
[[File:Planetary Conjunction over Paranal.jpg|thumb|A conjunction of Mars and Jupiter in the morning of 1 May 2011, when, about an hour before sunrise, five of our Solar System's eight planets and the Moon could be seen from [[Cerro Paranal]], Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planetary Conjunction over Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1118a/|work=ESO Picture of the Week|publisher=ESO|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

More generally, in the particular case of two [[planet]]s, it means that they merely have the same [[right ascension]] (and hence the same [[hour angle]]). This is called conjunction in right ascension. However, there is also the term conjunction in ecliptic longitude. At such conjunction both objects have the same ecliptic longitude. Conjunction in right ascension and conjunction in ecliptic longitude do not normally take place at the same time, but in most cases nearly at the same time. However, at [[triple conjunction]]s, it is possible that a conjunction only in right ascension (or ecliptic length) occurs. At the time of conjunction&amp;nbsp;– it does not matter if in right ascension or in ecliptic longitude&amp;nbsp;– the involved planets are close together upon the [[celestial sphere]]. In the vast majority of such cases, one of the planets will appear to pass north or south of the other.

==Passing closer==
[[File:ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) observatory at Paranal.jpg|thumb|In the night sky over [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) observatory at [[Paranal Observatory|Paranal]], the [[Moon]] shines along with two bright companions: [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].]]
However, if two celestial bodies attain the same [[declination]] at the time of a conjunction in [[right ascension]] (or the same ecliptic latitude at a conjunction in ecliptic longitude), the one that is closer to the Earth will pass in front of the other. In such a case, a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] takes place. If one object moves into the shadow of another, the event is an [[eclipse]]. For example, if the Moon passes into the shadow of Earth and disappears from view, this event is called a [[lunar eclipse]]. If the visible disk of the nearer object is considerably smaller than that of the farther object, the event is called a [[Astronomical transit|transit]]. When Mercury passes in front of the Sun, it is a [[transit of Mercury]], and when Venus passes in front of the Sun, it is a [[transit of Venus]]. When the nearer object appears larger than the farther one, it will completely obscure its smaller companion; this is called an [[occultation]]. An example of an occultation is when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, causing the Sun to disappear either entirely or partially. This phenomenon is commonly known as a [[solar eclipse]]. Occultations in which the larger body is neither the Sun nor the Moon are very rare. More frequent, however, is an occultation of a planet by the [[Moon]]. Several such events are visible every year from various places on Earth.

==Position of the observer==
A conjunction, as a phenomenon of perspective, is an event that involves two astronomical bodies seen by an observer on the Earth. Times and details depend only very slightly on the observer's location on the Earth's surface, with the differences being greatest for conjunctions involving the Moon because of its relative closeness, but even for the Moon the time of a conjunction never differs by more than a few hours.

==Superior and inferior==
As seen from a planet that is [[inferior and superior planets|superior]], if an [[inferior and superior planets|inferior]] planet is on the opposite side of the Sun, it is in '''superior conjunction''' with the Sun. An '''inferior conjunction''' occurs when the two planets lie in a [[line (mathematics)|line]] on the same side of the [[Sun]]. In an inferior conjunction, the superior planet is "in [[astronomical opposition|opposition]]" to the Sun as seen from the inferior planet.
&lt;div style="float:left"&gt;[[File:Positional astronomy.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
The terms "inferior conjunction" and "superior conjunction" are used in particular for the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], which are [[inferior and superior planets|inferior planets]] as seen from the Earth. However, this definition can be applied to any pair of planets, as seen from the one farther from the Sun.

A planet (or [[asteroid]] or [[comet]]) is simply said to be in conjunction, when it is in conjunction with the [[Sun]], as seen from the Earth. The [[Moon]] is in conjunction with the Sun at [[New moon|New Moon]].

==Quasiconjunction==
In a quasiconjunction, a planet in [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]]&amp;nbsp;— always either [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] or [[Venus]], from the point of view of [[the Earth]]&amp;nbsp;— will "drop back" in right ascension until it almost allows another planet to overtake it, but then the former planet will resume its forward motion and thereafter appear to draw away from it again. This will occur in the morning sky, before dawn. The reverse may happen in the evening sky after dusk, with Mercury or Venus entering retrograde motion just as it is about to overtake another planet (often Mercury ''and'' Venus are ''both'' of the planets involved, and when this situation arises they may remain in very close visual proximity for several days or even longer). The quasiconjunction is reckoned as occurring at the time the distance in right ascension between the two planets is smallest, even though, when declination is taken into account, they may appear closer together shortly before or after this.

==Notable conjunctions==

===1899===
In early December 1899 the Sun and the naked-eye planets appeared to lie within a band 35 degrees wide along the ecliptic as seen from the Earth. As a consequence, over the period 1–4 December 1899, the Moon reached conjunction with, in order, Jupiter, Uranus, the Sun, Mercury, Mars, Saturn and Venus. Most of these conjunctions were not visible because of the glare of the Sun.

===1962===
Over the period 4–6 February 1962, in a rare series of events, Mercury and Venus reached conjunction as observed from the Earth, followed by Venus and Jupiter, then by Mars and Saturn. Conjunctions took place between the Moon and, in turn, Mars, Saturn, the Sun, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter. Mercury also reached inferior conjunction with the Sun. The conjunction between the Moon and the Sun at [[new Moon]] produced a total solar eclipse visible in Indonesia and the Pacific Ocean,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
when these five naked-eye planets were visible in the vicinity of the Sun in the sky.

===1987===
[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] separately reached conjunction with each other, and each separately with the Sun, within a 7-day period in August 1987 as seen from the Earth. The Moon also reached conjunction with each of these bodies on 24 August. However, none of these conjunctions were observable due to the glare of the Sun.&lt;ref name="meeus_astrontables1983" /&gt;

===2000===
In May 2000, in a very rare event, several planets lay in the vicinity of the Sun in the sky as seen from the Earth, and a series of conjunctions took place. Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn each reached conjunction with the Sun in the period 8–10 May. These three planets in turn were in conjunction with each other and with Venus over a period of a few weeks. However, most of these conjunctions were not visible from the Earth because of the glare from the Sun.&lt;ref name="meeus_astrontables1983" /&gt; NASA referred to May 5 as the date of the conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Planetary Alignment of 5 May 2000|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/alignment.html|publisher=National Space Science Data Center - NASA|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002===
Venus, Mars and Saturn appeared close together in the evening sky in early May 2002, with a conjunction of Mars and Saturn occurring on 4 May. This was followed by a conjunction of Venus and Saturn on 7 May, and another of Venus and Mars on 10 May when their angular separation was only 18 arcminutes. A series of conjunctions between the Moon and, in order, Saturn, Mars and Venus took place on 14 May, although it was not possible to observe all these in darkness from any single location on the Earth.&lt;ref name="meeus_astrontables1983" &gt;

===2013===

At the end of May, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]] went through a series of conjunctions only a few days apart.

===2015===

June 30 - [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]] come close together in a planetary conjunction; they came approximately 1/3 a degree apart. The conjunction had been nicknamed the "Star of Bethlehem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150629-spot-venus-jupiter-conjunction-sky/|title=Venus and Jupiter Get Bright and Tight in This Week's Sky|author=|date=29 June 2015|website=nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Venus-Jupiter Conjunction of June 30, 2015.jpg|thumb|Venus-Jupiter Conjunction of June 30, 2015]]

===2016===

On the morning of January 9, [[Venus]] and [[Saturn]] came together in a conjunction&lt;ref&gt;https://lightworkers.org/page/218837/earthsky-news-jan-8-awesome-venussaturn-conjunction-and-more-for-january-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] were in conjunction, followed by a conjunction of [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]], meaning that the three planets were very close together in the evening sky.

===2017===

On the morning of November 13, [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]] were in conjunction, meaning that they appeared close together in the morning sky.

===2018===

The '''DSSAM Model''' (Dynamic Stream Simulation and Assessment Model) is a [[computer simulation]] developed for the [[Truckee River]] to analyze [[water pollution|water quality]] impacts from [[land use]] and [[wastewater]] management decisions in the Truckee River Basin. This area includes the cities of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Sparks, Nevada]] as well as the [[Lake Tahoe]] Basin. The model is historically and alternatively called the ''Earth Metrics Truckee River Model''.  Since original development in 1984-1986 under contract to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA),&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. ''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; the model has been refined and successive versions have been dubbed DSSAM II and DSSAM III.  This [[hydrology transport model]] is based upon a pollutant loading metric called ''[[Total maximum daily load]] (TMDL).'' The success of this flagship model contributed to the Agency’s broadened commitment to the use of the underlying TMDL protocol in its national policy for management of most river systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=April 1991 |title=Guidance for Water Quality-Based Decisions: The TMDL Process |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=00001KIO.TXT |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 440/4-91-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truckee River has a length of over {{convert|115|mi|km}} and drains an area of approximately 3120 square miles,&lt;ref&gt; John Warwick, ''Truckee River spill model,'' University of Nevada-Reno (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; not counting the extent of its [[Lake Tahoe]] sub-basin. The DSSAM model establishes numerous stations along the entire river extent as well as a considerable number of monitoring points inside the  [[Great Basin]]'s [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], the receiving waters of this closed hydrological system.  Although the region is sparsely populated, it is important because Lake Tahoe is visited by 20 million persons per annum and Truckee River water quality affects at least two endangered species: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]] and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]].

==Development history==
[[File:Pyramid Lake sat.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite photo of  [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], September 1994]]
Impetus to derive a quantitative prediction model arose from a trend of historically decreasing river flow rates coupled with jurisdictional and tribal conflicts over water rights as well as concern for river biota.  When expansion of the Reno-Sparks Wastewater Treatment Plant was proposed, the EPA decided to fund a large scale research effort to create  simulation software and a parallel program to collect field data in the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake.  For river stations water quality measurements were made in the [[benthic zone]] as well as the topic zone; in the case of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]] boats were used to collect grab samples at varying depths and locations.  Earth Metrics conducted the software development for the first generation [[computer model]] and collected field data on water quality and flow rates in the Truckee River.  After model calibration, runs were made to evaluate impacts of alternative land use controls and discharge parameters for treated [[effluent]]. 

The DSSAM Model is constructed to allow dynamic decay of most pollutants; for example, total nitrogen and phosphorus are allowed to be consumed by benthic [[alga]]e in each time step, and the algal communities are given a separate population dynamic in each river reach (e.g.metabolic rate based upon river temperature).  Sources throughout the watershed include non-point agricultural and urban stormwater as well as a multiplicity of point source discharges of treated municipal wastewater effluent.

Subsequent to the first generation of DSSAM  model development, calibration and application, later refinements were made.  These augmentations to model functionality focussed on increased flexibility in modeling the [[diel]] cycle and also allowed inclusion of analyzing particulate nitrogen and phosphorus.  In developing DSSAM III several changes in the model operation and scope were performed.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, J.T., C.L. Caupp, and H.M. Runke, '' Evaluation of water quality using DSSAM III under various conditions of nutrient loadings from municipal wastewater and agricultural sources: Truckee River, Nevada''.. Bureau of Water Quality Planning, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Carson City, Nevada (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cui-ui spawn (USFWS).jpg|thumb|right|[[spawn (biology)|Spawning]] [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]]]] --&gt;
Numerous different uses of the model have been made including (a)analysis of public policies for urban [[stormwater]] runoff, (b) researching agricultural methods for [[surface runoff]] minimization, (c) innovative solutions for non-point source control and d)engineering aspects of treated wastewater discharge.  Regarding stormwater runoff in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], the specific elements within a new [[xeriscape]] ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model.  For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of adverse impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two [[endangered species]] found in the [[Truckee River]] and [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]] (endangered 1967) and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] (threatened 1970).  When the model is used for [[surface runoff]] reaching a stream, this pollutant input can be viewed as a [[line source]] (e.g., a continuous linear source of pollution entering the waterway).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1315">'''Ecorys''' is one of the oldest economic research and consulting companies in Europe. Its history dates back to 1929, when a group of businessmen from Rotterdam established the Foundation [[NEI: The Netherlands Economic Institute]]. The goal of the Foundation NEI was to stimulate the collection and the analysis of economic data. One of its first directors (1935-1968) was Professor [[Jan Tinbergen]], who was awarded the first [[Nobel Prize for Economics]] for his work in 1969. In 1999, NEI was split into a company, focusing on economic research &amp; consultancy, and a foundation with the aim to foster economic research. The company merged with Kolpron Consultants (established in 1979).

In 2000 Ecorys&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecorys.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was created through the merger of the Dutch company NEI Kolpron with ECOTEC Research and Consulting, a UK-based company specializing in social policy. Ecorys internationalized further and today has offices in many European countries as well as in Russia, Turkey and India. It has close to 500 employees.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/company/ecorys?trk=top_nav_home&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FOSS Movement in India''' refers to the campaign across the country during the 1990s and 2000s in particular, to promote Free and Open Source Software. It was marked by the existence of many [[Indian Linux User Groups]] (ILUGs) groups and [[Free Software User Groups]] (FSUGs) in different cities, town and other areas.

The prominent members of the campaign include the late [[Atul Chitnis]], Prof [[Nagarjuna G.]] and others.

==Timeline of the campaign==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Date !! Event
|-
| 1990s || Computer magazines like [[PC-Quest]] boost interest in [[FOSS]] (or [[Linux]]) by regularly writing articles, and sharing software on CDs and DVDs from this field. Among the early writers are the late [[Atul Chitnis]]. 
|-
| 1993-94 || The [[not-for-profit]]/[[NGO]] [[Centre for Education and Documentation]], based at Bombay (now Mumbai) and Bangalore (now Bengaluru) promotes the use of [[FOSS]] (or [[Linux]], as it was then widely called) among the non-profit and alternate journalist community, through installing it on their computers, in its rather early shape. CED also used some [[FOSS]] tools while granting early access to non-profits to their email systems at ILBOM and ILBAN (IndiaLink) service. 
|-
| 1997 || '''[[Linux India]]''', a loose network of mailing lists is founded around this time by Arun Sharma and [[Karra Dakshinamurthy]] to help propagate and learn the [[GNU/Linux]] operating system and associated tools. In the early days, the electronic mailing lists were under the adminship of [[Sudhakar Chandrasekharan]] ''aka'' [[Thaths]].
|-
| 2013 || '''October:''' Free Software Foundation (India) responds to the proposed Government of India framework. Urges government to recognise citizens as primary stakeholders; seeks replacement of "OSS" with "FLOSS"; and other concerns over the total cost of ownership, bidding to create FLOSS solutions, licenses, recommended stacks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSF India's Response to the Proposed Framework by Govt of India|url=http://fsf.org.in/fsf-indias-response-to-the-proposed-framework-by|website=fsf.org.in|publisher=Free Software Foundation (India)|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3615">The '''Ford 9-inch''' is an automobile axle manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company]]. It is known as one of the most popular axles in automotive history. It was introduced in 1957 model year cars and ended production in 1986, having been phased out in favor of the [[Ford 8.8 axle|Ford 8.8 inch axle]].  However, aftermarket companies still produce the 9-inch design. It is a [[axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|semi-floating]] drop-out axle and had a [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] up to {{convert|3600|lb|kg|-1|abbr=on}}.

One of the features which distinguishes this axle from other high-performance or heavy-duty domestic [[solid axle]]s is that unlike other axle designs, access to the [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gears]] is not through the rear center cover; rather, in the Ford 9 inch, the rear cover is welded to the axle housing, and access to internals is obtained by removing the center cover on the [[pinion]] (front) side of the axle through which the [[driveshaft]] yoke connects, with the differential assembly coming out of the axle as a unit attached to the cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supermotors.net/clubs/.../registry/media/747500_1 ford-9-inch-diagram.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwheeler.com/techarticles/drivetrain/129_0204_ford_9_inch_axle/photo_05.html Ford 9Inch Axle Height]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kevinstang.com/Ninecase.htm Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Although this requires disconnecting the driveshaft to access the internal gearset, it offers the advantage of being able to disassemble and reassemble the differential gears and adjust clearances conveniently on the benchtop, rather than with the restricted access of working within the axle housing under the car.

== General specifications ==

* Ring gear measures 9.00"
* Factory nodular center sections are usually marked with an "N". 
* Factory center section's biggest flaw is the pinion bearing pilot support, which are prone to cracking due to the nature of the pinion gear/crown gear relationship. 
* Factory center sections carry two (2) different bearing dimensions (3.0625" and 3.250").
* Factory axle shaft and differential spline count is 28 and 31, although aftermarket axles with 35 and 40 spline count are readily available from reputable manufacturers.
* Wide variety of axle bearing flanges were fabricated.
* Although most factory assemblies carried drum brakes, there were units which were fitted with disk brakes (Thunderbird, etc.).
* Factory axle (wheel) bearings are retained via a press-on collar, and not an internal c-clip inside the differential.
* Axles are straight, and not tapered (which can be cut and resplined, if so needed).

In [[astrobiology]] and [[astrophysics|planetary astrophysics]], the '''galactic habitable zone''' is the region of a [[galaxy]] in which [[life]] might most likely develop. More specifically, the concept of a galactic habitable zone incorporates various factors, such as [[metallicity]] and the rate of major catastrophes such as [[supernovae]], to calculate which regions of the galaxy are more likely to form [[terrestrial planet]]s, initially develop simple life, and provide a suitable environment for this life to evolve and advance.&lt;ref name=gowanlock-2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gowanlock | first1 = M.

From the 1970s, planetary scientists and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life, including the impact that a nearby [[supernova]] may have on life's development.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6617|arxiv=astro-ph/0103165|title=The Galactic Habitable Zone: Galactic Chemical Evolution|date=2001|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Guillermo|last2=Brownlee|first2=Donald|last3=Peter|first3=Ward|journal=Icarus|volume=152|pages=185|bibcode = 2001Icar..152..185G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, [[Jim Clarke (computer scientist)|Jim Clarke]] proposed that the apparent lack of [[extraterrestrial civilization]]s in the Milky Way could be explained by [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert]]-type outbursts from an [[active galactic nucleus]], with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy.&lt;ref name=clarke-1981&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = J.

The idea of a galactic habitable zone was further developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] of the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6617|arxiv=astro-ph/0103165|title=The Galactic Habitable Zone: Galactic Chemical Evolution|date=2001|last1=Gonzalez|first1=G|journal=Icarus|volume=152|pages=185|bibcode = 2001Icar..152..185G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Charles H.

Gibson | title=The Galactic Habitable Zone and the Age Distribution of Complex Life in the Milky Way | journal=Science|date=January 2004| volume=303 |issue=5654 | pages=59–62 | doi=10.1126/science.1092322 | pmid=14704421|arxiv = astro-ph/0401024 |bibcode = 2004Sci...303...59L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near the [[galactic halo]] would lack the heavier elements required to produce [[planetary habitability|habitable]] [[terrestrial planet]]s, thus creating an outward limit to the size of the galactic habitable zone.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; Being too close to the galactic center, however, would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive [[comet]]ary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's [[Oort cloud]]. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic habitable zone, located just outside the [[galactic bulge]].&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt;

==Considerations==
In order to identify a location in the galaxy as being a part of the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, the presence or absence of an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby [[supernovae]] that can threaten the existence of life, the [[metallicity]] of that location, and other factors.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.

===Chemical evolution===
[[File:Starpop.svg|thumb|The metallicity of the thin galactic disk is far greater than that of the outlying galactic halo.|400px]]One of the most basic requirements for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a [[terrestrial planet]] of sufficient mass to sustain it. Various elements, such as [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], and others, are required to produce habitable planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt;

One important elemental ratio is that of [Fe/[[hydrogen|H]]], one of the factors determining the propensity of a region of the galaxy to produce terrestrial planets. The [[galactic bulge]], the region of the galaxy closest to the galactic center, has an [Fe/H] distribution peaking at −0.2 [[decimal exponent|decimal exponent unit]]s (dex) relative to the [[Sun]]'s ratio; the [[thin disk]], where the [[Sun]] is located, has an average metallicity of −0.02 dex at the orbital distance of the Sun around the galactic center, reducing by 0.07 dex for every additional [[kiloparsec]] of orbital distance. The extended [[thick disk]] has an average [Fe/H] of −0.6 dex, while the [[galactic halo|halo]], the region farthest from the galactic center, has the lowest [Fe/H] distribution peak, at around −1.5 dex.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; In addition, ratios such as [C/O], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [S/Fe] may be relevant to the ability of a region of a galaxy to form habitable terrestrial planets, and of these [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] are slowly reducing over time, meaning that future terrestrial planets are more likely to possess larger iron cores.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt;

In addition to specific amounts of the various stable elements that comprise a terrestrial planet's mass, an abundance of [[radionuclide]]s such as [[potassium-40|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;]][[potassium|K]], [[uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;]][[uranium|U]], [[uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;]]U, and [[thorium-232|&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;]][[thorium|Th]] is required in order to heat the planet's interior and power life-sustaining processes such as [[plate tectonic]]s, [[volcanism]], and a [[geomagnetic dynamo]].&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; The [U/H] and [Th/H] ratios are dependent on the [Fe/H] ratio; however, a general function for the abundance of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K cannot be created with existing data.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt;

Even on a habitable planet with enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required in order to produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone.&lt;ref name=blair-2008 /&gt; A 2008 study by [[Samantha Blair]] and colleagues attempted to determine the outer edge of the galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing [[formaldehyde]] and [[carbon monoxide]] emissions from various [[giant molecular cloud]]s scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.

While high metallicity is beneficial for the creation of terrestrial [[extrasolar planets]], an excess amount can be harmful for life. Excess metallicity may lead to the formation of a large number of [[gas giant]]s in a given system, which may subsequently migrate from beyond the system's [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]] and become [[hot Jupiter]]s, disturbing planets that would otherwise have been located in the system's circumstellar habitable zone.&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lineweaver | first1 = C. H. | last2 = Fenner | first2 = Y. | last3 = Gibson | first3 = B. K. | doi = 10.1126/science.1092322 | title = The Galactic Habitable Zone and the Age Distribution of Complex Life in the Milky Way | journal = Science | volume = 303 | issue = 5654 | pages = 59–62 | year = 2004 | pmid =  14704421| pmc = |arxiv = astro-ph/0401024 |bibcode = 2004Sci...303...59L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was found that the [[Goldilocks principle]] applies to metallicity as well; low-metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial-mass planets at all, while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop, disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability of terrestrial planets in the system.

===Catastrophic events===
[[File:Crab Nebula.jpg|thumb|250px|The impact of supernovae on the extent of the galactic habitable zone has been extensively studied.]]
As well as being located in a region of the galaxy that is chemically advantageous for the development of life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets.&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004 /&gt; Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation,&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.

In addition to supernovae, [[gamma-ray burst]]s,&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007 /&gt; excessive amounts of radiation, gravitational perturbations&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004 /&gt; and various other events have been proposed to affect the distribution of life within the galaxy. These include, controversially, such proposals as "galactic tides" with the potential to induce cometary impacts or even [[cold dark matter|cold]] bodies of [[dark matter]]&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vukotic | first1 = B. | last2 = Cirkovic | first2 = M.

===Galactic morphology===
Various morphological features of galaxies can affect their potential for habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's [[Oort cloud]], sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in.&lt;ref name=mullen-2001&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/news_stories/news_detail.cfm?ID=157 |title=Galactic Habitable Zones |work=NAI Features Archive |date=May 18, 2001 |agency=Nasa Astrobiology Institute |accessdate=May 9, 2013 |author=Mullen, Leslie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409002532/http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/news_stories/news_detail.cfm?ID=157 |archivedate=April 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life.&lt;ref name=mullen-2001 /&gt; Considering these factors, the [[Sun]] is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, in addition to being outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the [[corotation radius]], maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.&lt;ref name=mullen-2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sundin-2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sundin | first1 = M. | title = The galactic habitable zone in barred galaxies | doi = 10.1017/S1473550406003065 | journal = International Journal of Astrobiology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 325 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2006IJAsB...5..325S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiral arms also have the ability to cause climatic changes on a planet. Passing through the dense molecular clouds of galactic spiral arms, [[stellar wind]]s may be pushed back to the point that a reflective hydrogen layer accumulates in an orbiting planet's atmosphere, perhaps leading to a [[snowball Earth]] scenario.&lt;ref name=newscientist /&gt;&lt;ref name=pavlov-2005&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004GL021890/abstract|doi=10.1029/2004GL021890|title=Passing through a giant molecular cloud: "Snowball" glaciations produced by interstellar dust|date=2005|last1=Pavlov|first1=Alexander A.|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=32|issue=3|bibcode = 2005GeoRL..32.3705P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[barred spiral galaxy|galactic bar]] also has the potential to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there.&lt;ref name=sundin-2006 /&gt; High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.&lt;ref name=sundin-2006 /&gt;

==Boundaries==
[[File:Milky Way galactic habitable zone.gif|thumb|left|The galactic habitable zone is often viewed as an annulus 4–10 kpc from the galactic center, shown in green here, though recent research has called this into question.]]
Early research on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely stating that the zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability would be more likely in the galaxy's thin disk.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; However, later research conducted in 2004 by Lineweaver and colleagues did create boundaries for this annulus, in the case of the Milky Way ranging from 4 kpc to 10 kpc from the galactic center.

The Lineweaver team also analyzed the evolution of the galactic habitable zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a time window of about two billion years in order to have habitable planets.&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004 /&gt; Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets, with the potential to destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar habitable zone.&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004 /&gt; Simulations conducted in 2005 at the [[University of Washington]], however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.&lt;ref name=raymond-2005&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103505000965|title=The formation and habitability of terrestrial planets in the presence of close-in giant planets|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.03.008|date=2005|last1=Raymond|first1=Sean N.|last2=Quinn|first2=Thomas|last3=Lunine|first3=Jonathan I.|journal=Icarus|volume=177|pages=256|arxiv = astro-ph/0407620 |bibcode = 2005Icar..177..256R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study by [[Milan Ćirković]] and colleagues extended the notion of a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying [[secular phenomena|secular evolution]] of galactic dynamics.&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007 /&gt; The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a [[punctuated equilibrium]] in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others.&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007 /&gt; Based on the results of [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s on a [[toy model]] of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007 /&gt;

Subsequent studies saw more fundamental revision of the old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by [[Nikos Prantzos]] revealed that, while the probability of a planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there.&lt;ref name=prantzos-2008 /&gt; The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the [[galactic plane]], and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the [[tidal locking]] of [[red dwarf]] planets as precluding the development of complex life.&lt;ref name=gowanlock-2011 /&gt;

==Criticism==
The idea of the galactic habitable zone has been criticized by Nikos Prantzos, on the grounds that the parameters to create it are impossible to define even approximately, and that thus the galactic habitable zone may merely be a useful conceptual tool to enable a better understanding of the distribution of life, rather than an end to itself.&lt;ref name=prantzos-2008 /&gt; For these reasons, Prantzos has suggested that the entire galaxy may be habitable, rather than habitability being restricted to a specific region in space and time.&lt;ref name=prantzos-2008 /&gt; In addition, stars "riding" the galaxy's spiral arms may move tens of thousands of light years from their original orbits, thus supporting the notion that there may not be one specific galactic habitable zone.&lt;ref name=roskar /&gt;&lt;ref name=newswise /&gt;&lt;ref name=newscientist /&gt; A Monte Carlo simulation, improving on the mechanisms used by  Ćirković in 2006, was conducted in 2010 by [[Duncan Forgan]]  of [[Royal Observatory Edinburgh]]. The data collected from the experiments support Prantzos's notion that there is no solidly defined galactic habitable zone, indicating the possibility of hundreds of [[extraterrestrial civilization]]s in the Milky Way, though further data will be required in order for a definitive determination to be made.&lt;ref name=forgan-2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Forgan | first1 = D.

The term "geopiety" comes from a combination of the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''geo'', for earth, and the [[Latin language|Latin]] root "[[Pietas (virtue)|pietas]]". As Wright explained when coining the term, geopiety is meant to refer to "emotional piety aroused by awareness of terrestrial diversity of the kind of which geography is also a form of awareness".&lt;ref name=w251&gt;Wright, 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of geopiety can be found in the works of American preacher [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]:
{{quote|He that is traveling up a very high mountain, if he goes on climbing, will at length get to that height and eminence as at last not only to have his prospect vastly large, but he will get above clouds and winds, and where he will enjoy a perpetual serenity and calm.

That high towers or other high places are commonly smitten with thunder, and mountainous places more subject to terrible thunder and lightning, shows how that pride and self-exaltation does particularly excite God's wrath.&lt;ref name=w251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7194">'''Goal programming''' is a branch of [[multiobjective optimization]], which in turn is a branch of [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA). This is an optimization programme. It can be thought of as an extension or generalisation of [[linear programming]] to handle multiple, normally conflicting objective measures. Each of these measures is given a goal or target value to be achieved. Unwanted deviations from this set of target values are then minimised in an achievement function. This can be a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] or a [[weighted sum]] dependent on the goal programming variant used. As satisfaction of the target is deemed to satisfy the decision maker(s), an underlying [[satisficing]] philosophy is assumed. Goal programming is used to perform three types of analysis:
# Determine the required resources to achieve a desired set of objectives.
# Determine the degree of attainment of the goals with the available resources.
# Providing the best satisfying solution under a varying amount of resources and priorities of the goals.

== History ==
Goal programming was first used by Charnes, [[William W. Cooper|Cooper]] and Ferguson in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;A Charnes, [[William W. Cooper|WW Cooper]], R Ferguson (1955) Optimal estimation of executive compensation by linear programming, Management Science, 1, 138-151.&lt;/ref&gt; although the actual name first appeared in a 1961 text by Charnes and Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;A Charnes, WW Cooper (1961) Management models and industrial applications of linear programming, Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Seminal works by Lee,&lt;ref&gt;SM Lee (1972) Goal programming for decision analysis, Auerback, Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt; Ignizio,&lt;ref name= "IG"&gt;JP Ignizio (1976) Goal programming and extensions, Lexington Books, Lexington, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignizio and Cavalier,&lt;ref&gt;JP Ignizio, TM Cavalier (1994) Linear programming, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Carlos Romero López|Romero]] &lt;ref name= "Rom"&gt;C Romero (1991) Handbook of critical issues in goal programming, Pergamon Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; followed. Schniederjans gives in a bibliography of a large number of pre-1995 articles relating to goal programming,&lt;ref&gt;MJ Scniederjans (1995) Goal programming methodology and applications, Kluwer publishers, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jones and Tamiz give an annotated bibliography of the period 1990-2000.&lt;ref name= "DFJ"&gt;DF Jones, M Tamiz (2002) Goal programming in the period 1990-2000, in Multiple Criteria Optimization: State of the art annotated bibliographic surveys, M. Ehrgott and X.Gandibleux (Eds.), 129-170. Kluwer&lt;/ref&gt; A recent textbook by Jones and Tamiz .&lt;ref name="JT"&gt;Jones DF, Tamiz M (2010) Practical Goal Programming, Springer Books.&lt;/ref&gt; gives a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in goal programming.

The first engineering application of goal programming, due to Ignizio in 1962, was the design and placement of the antennas employed on the second stage of the [[Saturn V]]. This was used to launch the Apollo space capsule that landed the first men on the moon.

== Variants ==
The initial goal programming formulations ordered the unwanted deviations into a number of priority levels, with the minimisation of a deviation in a  higher priority level being infinitely more important than any deviations in lower priority levels. This is known as ''[[lexicographic]]'' or pre-emptive goal programming. Ignizio&lt;ref name= "IG"/&gt; gives an algorithm showing how a lexicographic goal programme can be solved as a series of linear programmes. Lexicographic goal programming is used when there exists a clear priority ordering amongst the goals to be achieved.

If the decision maker is more interested in direct comparisons of the objectives then ''weighted'' or non-pre-emptive goal programming should be used. In this case all the unwanted deviations  are multiplied by weights, reflecting their relative importance, and added together as a single sum to form the achievement function. Deviations measured in different units cannot be summed directly due to the phenomenon of [[unit commensurability|incommensurability]].

Hence each unwanted deviation is multiplied by a normalisation constant to allow direct comparison. Popular choices for normalisation constants are the goal target value of the corresponding objective (hence turning all deviations into percentages) or the range of the corresponding objective (between the best and the worst possible values, hence mapping all deviations onto a zero-one range).&lt;ref name= "Rom"/&gt; For decision makers more interested in obtaining a balance between the competing objectives, ''Chebyshev'' goal programming is used. Introduced by Flavell in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;RB Flavell (1976) A new goal programming formulation, Omega, 4, 731-732.&lt;/ref&gt; this variant seeks to minimise the maximum unwanted deviation, rather than the sum of deviations. This utilises the [[Chebyshev distance]] metric.

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
A major strength of goal programming is its simplicity and ease of use. This accounts for the large number of goal programming applications in many and diverse fields. Linear goal programmes can be solved using linear programming software as either a single linear programme, or in the case of the lexicographic variant, a series of connected linear programmes. 
 
Goal programming can hence handle relatively large numbers of variables, constraints and objectives. A debated weakness is the ability of goal programming to produce solutions that are not [[Pareto efficient]]. This violates a fundamental concept of [[decision theory]], that no rational decision maker will knowingly choose a solution that is not Pareto efficient. However, techniques are available&lt;ref name= "Rom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EL Hannan (1980) Non-dominance in goal programming, INFOR, 18, 300-309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Tamiz, SK Mirrazavi, DF Jones (1999) Extensions of Pareto efficiency analysis to integer goal programming, Omega, 27, 179-188.&lt;/ref&gt; to detect when this occurs and project the solution onto the Pareto efficient solution in an appropriate manner.

The setting of appropriate weights in the goal programming model is another area that has caused debate, with some authors&lt;ref&gt;SI Gass (1987) A process for determining priorities and weights for large scale linear goal programmes, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 37, 779-785.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting the use of the [[analytic hierarchy process]] or interactive methods&lt;ref&gt;BJ White (1996) Developing Products and Their Rhetoric from a Single Hierarchical Model, 1996 Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Society for Technical Communication, 43, 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt; for this purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">The '''Harris–Benedict equation''' (also called the '''Harris-Benedict principle''') is a method used to estimate an individual's [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR).

The estimated BMR value may be multiplied by a number that corresponds to the individual's activity level; the resulting number is the approximate daily [[kilocalorie]] intake to maintain current [[body weight]].

The Harris–Benedict equation may be used to assist weight loss — by reducing kilocalorie intake number below the estimated maintenance intake of the equation.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The Harris–Benedict equations revised by Roza and Shizgal in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roza AM, Shizgal HM |title=The Harris Benedict equation reevaluated: resting energy requirements and the body cell mass |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=168–82 |year=1984 |pmid=6741850 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6741850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

| BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years) 
|-
| Women
| BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × weight in kg) + (3.098 × height in cm) - (4.330 × age in years)

The 95% confidence range for men is ±213.0 kcal/day, and ±201.0 kcal/day for women.

While the original paper does not attempt to translate BMR into [[Energy_homeostasis#Expenditure|total energy expenditure]] (TEE), a BMR result may be multiplied by a factor that approximates an individual's [[physical activity level]] (PAL) to estimate their TEE. The following table enables approximation of an individual's daily TEE based on some example lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=FAO|author2=WHO|author3=UNU|title=Human energy requirements: Energy Requirement of Adults|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5686e/y5686e07.htm#bm07.2|website=www.fao.org|accessdate=11 February 2018|language=English|date=24 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Harris–Benedict equation sprang from a study by [[James Arthur Harris]] and [[Francis Gano Benedict]], which was published in 1919 by the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]] in the [[monograph]] [https://archive.org/details/biometricstudyof00harruoft A Biometric Study Of Basal Metabolism In Man].  A 1984 [[Basal metabolic rate|revision]] improved its accuracy. Mifflin et al. published an equation more predictive for modern lifestyles in 1990.&lt;ref name=pmid2305711/&gt; Later work produced BMR estimators that accounted for lean body mass.

==Issues in dietary use==
As the BMR equations do not attempt to take into account body composition, identical results can be calculated for a very muscular person, and a very fat person, who are both the same height, weight, age and gender. As muscle and fat require differing amounts of calories to maintain, the TEE estimates will not be accurate for such cases.

The paper behind the latest update (Mifflin et al) to the BMR formula states all participants in their study fall within the 'normal' and 'overweight' [[body mass index]] (BMI) categories, and so the results also do not necessarily apply to those in the 'underweight' or 'obese' BMI categories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26894">The '''Hurufiyya movement''' ({{lang-ar|حروفية}} ''hurufiyya'', adjective form ''hurufi'' literal meaning "letters" [of the alphabet]) was an aesthetic movement that emerged in the late twentieth century amongst [[Arabian]] and North African artists, who used their understanding of traditional [[Islamic calligraphy]], within the precepts of [[modern art]]. By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a Pan-Arab visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the [[Hurufi]], an approach of [[Sufism]] which emerged in the late 14th–early 15th century. Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab art world in the 20th-century. 

==Definition==
The term, ''hurifiyya'' is derived from the Arabic term, ''harf'' which means letter (as in a letter of the alphabet). When the term is used to describe an contemporary art movement, it explicitly references a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term is charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The hurufiyya art movement (also known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement''&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Letrism movement''&lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic element within an artwork, typically an abstract work.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:] ;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The pan-Arab hurufiyya art movement is distinct from the [[Letterist International]] which had an Algerian section founded in [[Chlef]] in 1953 by [[Hadj Mohamed Dahou]]. 

The term, ''hurufiyya'' has become somewhat controversial and has been rejected by a number of scholars, including [[Wijdan Ali]], Nada Shabout and Karen  Dabrowska. An alternative term, ''al-Madrassa al-Khattiya Fil-Fann'' [Calligraphic School of Art] has been proposed to describe the experimental use of calligraphy in modern Arabic art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80; Shabout, N., "Huroufiyah" in: ''Routledge Encyclopedia Of Modern Art,'' Routledge, 2016,  DOI: 10.4324/9781135000356-REM176-1; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history and philosophy==
[[File:Amir Khusraw Dihlavi - An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth,'' page from a Sufi manuscript, 13th century. Sufi art served as part of the inspiration for the al-hurufiyya movement.]]
Traditional hurufi art was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined calligraphy to devotional works and prohibited the representation of humans in manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt; Schimmel,  A., ''Calligraphy and Islamic Culture,'' London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Practising calligraphers trained with a master for many years in order to learn both the technique and the rules governing calligraphy. Contemporary hurufiyya artists broke free from these rules, allowing Arabic letters to be deconstructed, altered and included in abstract artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  

The use of traditional Arabic elements, notably, calligraphy, in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists working in this area, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyya to develop in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, [https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006 DOI:]; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, the movement was known as the ''Old Khartoum School'',&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed a distinctive character in which both African motifs and calligraphy were combined, while media such as leather and wood replaced canvas to provide a distinct African style.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299; Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Morocco, the movement was accompanied by the replacement of traditional media for oils; artists favoured traditional dyes such as henna, and embraced weaving, jewellery and tattoo as well as including traditional Berber motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, it was generally known as the ''al-hurufiyyah'' movement, while in Iran, the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that [[Madiha Omar]], who was active in the US and Baghdad from the mid-1940s, was the pioneer of the movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context in the 1940s and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars have suggested that she was a ''precursor'' to Hurufiyya&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Madiha Omar," [Biographical Notes], [https://www.meemartgallery.com/art_resources.php?id=89 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet other scholars have suggested that the hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa, in the area around Sudan, with the work of [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]],&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:];Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; who initially explored Coptic manuscripts,  a step that led him to experiment with Arabic calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that by the early 1950s, a number of artists in different countries were experimenting with works based on calligraphy, including the Iraqi painter and sculptor, [[Jamil Hamoudi]] who experimented with the graphic possibilities of using Arabic characters, as early as 1947;&lt;ref&gt;Inati, S.C., ''Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics,'' Humanity Books, 2003, p.76; Beaugé, F. and Clément, J-F., ''L'image dans le Monde Arabé,''CNRS Éditions, 1995, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian painters, Nasser Assar (b. 1928) ([[:fr:Nasser Assar]]) and [[Hossein Zenderoudi]], who won a prize at the 1958 Paris Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:]; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The common theme amongst hurufiyya artists is that they all tapped into the beauty and mysticism of Arabic calligraphy, but used it in a modern, abstract sense. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyya artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards a broader aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented an affiliation with an Arab identity in the post-colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian, Christiane Treichl, explains how calligraphy is used in contemporary art:&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
: "They deconstruct writing, exploit the letter and turn it into an indexical sign of calligraphy, tradition and cultural heritage. As the sign is purely aesthetic, and only linguistic in its cultural association, it opens hitherto untravelled avenues for interpretation, and attracts different audiences, yet still maintains a link to the respective artist's own culture... Hurufiyya artists do away with the signifying function of language. The characters become pure signs, and temporarily emptied of their referential meaning, they become available for new meanings."  

The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters, but also included important ceramicists such as the Jordanian, [[Mahmoud Taha]], who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship,&lt;ref&gt;Asfour, M., "A Window on Contemporary Arab Art," NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and sculptors, such as the Qatari, [[Yousef Ahmad]]&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Yousef Ahdmad," [Biographical Notes], [http://www.animagallery.com/artists/yousef-ahmad/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iraqi sculptors, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. Nor, was the movement organised along formal lines across the Arab-speaking nations. In some Arab nations, hurufiyya artists formed formal groups or societies, such as Iraq's ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the [[One Dimension Group]])" which published a manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;"Shaker Hassan Al Said," Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; while in other nations artists working independently in the same city had no knowledge of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-66; Dadi, I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly. '' Vol. 109, No. 3, 2010, pp 555-576, DOI: 10.1215/00382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab world in the 20th-century. &lt;ref name="Dagher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dagher|first1=Charles|last2=Mahmoud|first2=Samir|title=Arabic Hurufiyya: Art and Identity|date=2016|publisher=Skira Editore|location=Milan|isbn=978-8857231518}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' while acknowledging its importance in terms of encouraging Arab nationalism, describes hurufiyya as neither "a movement nor a school." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of hurufiyya===
[[File:نصب أشعار بغداد.jpg|thumb|''[[Ashaar Baghdad (monument)|Ashaar Baghdad]]'' (Baghdad's poetry) by [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. In this fountain, Arabic words taken from a poem by Mustafa Jamal El Din have been squeezed together to form the oval shape in an example of Asbract calligraphy.]]

Art historians have identified three generations of hurufiyya artists: &lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''First generation'': The pioneers, who inspired by the independence of their nations, searched for a new aesthetic language that would allow them to express their nationalism. These artists rejected European techniques and media, turning to indigenous media and introducing Arabic calligraphy into their art. For this group of artists, Arabic letters are a central feature of the artwork. First generation artists include: the Jordanian artist, [[Wijdan Ali|Princess Wijdan Ali]], the Sudanese artist, [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]]; the Iraqi artists, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said|Shakkir Hassan Al Sa'id]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]] and [[Jawad Saleem]]; the Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]] and the Egyptian artist, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926).  

: ''Second generation'': Artists, most of whom live in exile, but reference their traditions, culture and language in their artworks. The artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is typical of this generation.

: ''Third generation'':  Contemporary artists who have absorbed international aesthetics, and who employ Arabic and Persian script occasionally. They deconstruct the letters, and use them in a purely abstract and decorative manner. The work of [[Golnaz Fathi]] and [[Lalla Essaydi]] is representative of the third generation.

==Types of hurufiyya art==
Hurufiyya art involved a very diverse range of "explorations into the abstract, graphic, and aesthetic properties of Arabic letters." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians, including Wijdan Ali and Shirbil Daghir, have attempted to develop a way of classifying different types of hurufiyya art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, pp 79-85&lt;/ref&gt; Ali identifies the following, which she describes as ''schools'' within the ''movement'': &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165; It should be noted that Daghir uses a different classification, not canvassed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Pure calligraphy
: Artworks in which calligraphy forms both the background and the foreground. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
; Neoclassical
: Works that adhere to the rules of 13th-century calligraphy. An example of this is the work of [[Khairat Al-Saleh]] (b. 1940) &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dia-Al-Azzawi-Portrait-Picture.jpg|thumb|Artist, Dia-Al-Azzawi, exhibits the style of the Calligraphy Combinations School of Hurufiyya art]]
; Modern classical
: Works that blend pure calligraphy with other motifs, such as repeating geometric patterns. Ahmad Moustaffa (b. 1943) is representative of this style&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165-66&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Calligraffiti]]  
: Artwork, employing script, but which follows no rules and where artists require no formal training. Calligraffiti artists employ their own ordinary handwriting within a modern composition. Artists may reshape letters, or simply invent new letters that reference traditional Arabic scripts. Artists that belong to this school include: Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]]; Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi artist and intellectual. [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167-69&lt;/ref&gt;
; Freeform calligraphy
: Artworks that balance classical styles with calligraffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
; Abstract calligraphy
: Art that deconstructs letters and includes them as a graphic element in an abstract artwork. In this style of art, letters may be legible, illegible or may use pseudo-script. Rafa al-Naisiri (b. 1940) and [[Mahmoud Hammad]] (1923-1988) are notable examples of this style of artist.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Calligraphy Combinations
: Artworks that use any combination of calligraphy styles, often employing marginal calligraphy or unconscious calligraphy. Artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is a representative of this style.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Japan-Netherlands Institute'''|日蘭学会}} is a [[research institute]] founded in 1975 to carry out research on historical [[Rangaku|Dutch-Japanese relations]] and to foster and promote modern academic and cultural exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jni.or.jp/intro_e.html About us], Japan-Netherlands Institute&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, they received the [[Japan Foundation|Japan Foundation's]] special prize for contributions to cultural exchange and mutual understanding between Japan and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/about/award/index.html Awards and Special Prizes], index of past recipients, The Japan Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
;Intercultural-academic exchange
In 1986, the Japan-Netherlands Institute began a program to enable Dutch students and researchers to carry out an integral part of their research in Japan.&lt;ref name="Exchange"&gt;[http://www.jni.or.jp/exchange_e.html Academic Cooperation and Exchange], Japanese-Netherland Institute, 28 Feb. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1994 the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] began supporting the institute eventually leading to its Japan Prizewinners Program(JPP) from 1995-2008 wherein Dutch students were selected to study Modern Japan for a year before being sent to Japan to study and carry out their research plans.&lt;ref name="Exchange"/&gt; 210 students ultimately passed through the JPP before its conclusion in 2008.&lt;ref name="Exchange"/&gt; Study abroad programs are still supported by the institute however.&lt;ref name="Exchange"/&gt;

In addition to their exchange programs, the Japan-Netherlands Institute holds symposiums on a wide range of topics, organizes lectures at their site or at Japanese universities by prominent Dutch scientists, publishes notices of the findings of young Japanese and Dutch scholars, and offers aide and assistance to Japanese and Dutch scholars within either country.&lt;ref name="Exchange"/&gt;

;Research
Research on Dutch-Japanese studies is both supported and carried out by the institute, and forms the basis for a majority of their publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jni.or.jp/history_e.html Research], Japanese-Netherland Institute, 28 Feb. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Current projects include:
*-Translation of the diaries from the Dutch trading factory at [[Dejima]] 1800-1860. Ten volumes have been published thus far.
*-Compiling and chronicling entries from the Dutch diaries.
*-Inventory of Dutch books in Japanese libraries of the Edo period.

JMMS was founded by [[Joseph Gelfer]] who remains the executive editor.

==Overview==

JMMS seeks to be as inclusive as possible in its area of enquiry. Papers address the full spectrum of [[masculinities]] and sexualities, particularly those which are seldom heard. Similarly, JMMS addresses not only [[monotheistic]] religions and spiritualities but also Eastern, [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]], [[new religious movements]] and other spiritualities which resist categorization. JMMS papers address historical and contemporary phenomena as well as speculative essays about future spiritualities.

The first issue of JMMS featured, published in January 2007, an editorial by Joseph Gelfer; research notes of Yvonne Maria Werner and Anna Prestjan; articles by Roland Boer, Frank A. Salamone, David Shneer, Juan M. Marin and Rini Bhattacharya Mehta; and book reviews by Joseph Gelfer, James Bryant, Wisam Mansour, Sophie Smith, Katharina von Kellenbach and Nathan Abrams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume1/number1 Volume 1, Number 1: Table of Contents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628105537/http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume1/number1 |date=2013-06-28 }} JMMS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of JMMS are included in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080719204549/http://www.informit.com.au/humanitiessocialsciencecollection.html Informit e-Library], an Australasian online scholarly research repository; as well as [[EBSCO Industries|EBSCO]], and [[Gale (publisher)| Gale Cengage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4249">A '''Maclaurin spheroid''' is an oblate [[spheroid]] which arises when a self-gravitating fluid body of uniform density rotates with a constant angular velocity. This spheroid is named after the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[mathematician]] [[Colin Maclaurin]], who formulated it for the shape of [[Earth]] in 1742.&lt;ref&gt;Maclaurin, Colin. A Treatise of Fluxions: In Two Books. 1. Vol. 1. Ruddimans, 1742.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact the figure of the Earth is far less oblate than this, since the Earth is not homogeneous, but has a dense iron core. The Maclaurin spheroid is considered to be the simplest model of rotating ellipsoidal figures in equilibrium since it assumes uniform density.

==Maclaurin formula==
[[File:Maclaurin spheroid.svg|thumb|Angular velocity for Maclaurin spheroid]]
For [[oblate spheroid|spheroid]] with semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Maclaurin's formula&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan. Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium. Vol. 10. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\pi G\rho} = \frac{2\sqrt{1-e^2}}{e^3}(3-2e^2) \sin^{-1}e - \frac{6}{e^2}(1-e^2), \quad e^2 = 1-\frac{c^2}{a^2}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity of meridional cross-sections of the spheriod, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gravitational constant]]. The formula predicts two possible types of equilibrium figures when &lt;math&gt;\Omega\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, one is a sphere (&lt;math&gt;e\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;) and the other is a flattened spheroid (&lt;math&gt;e\rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;). The maximum angular velocity occurs at eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e=0.92996&lt;/math&gt; and its value is &lt;math&gt;\Omega^2/(\pi G\rho)=0.449331&lt;/math&gt;, so that above this speed, no equilibrium figures exist. The angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{\sqrt{GM^3\bar{a}}} = \frac{\sqrt 3}{5} \left(\frac{a}{\bar{a}}\right)^2 \sqrt{\frac{\Omega^2}{\pi G\rho}} \ , \quad \bar{a} = (a^2c)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the spheroid and &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''mean radius'', the radius of a sphere of the same volume as the spheroid.

==Stability==

For a Maclaurin spheroid of eccentricity greater than 0.812670,&lt;ref name="PoissonAndWill"/&gt; a [[Jacobi ellipsoid]] of the same angular momentum has lower total energy.  If such a spheroid is composed of a viscous fluid, and if it suffers a perturbation which breaks its rotational symmetry, then it will gradually elongate into the Jacobi ellipsoidal form, while dissipating its excess energy as heat.  This is termed ''secular instability''.  However, for a similar spheroid composed of an inviscid fluid, the perturbation will merely result in an undamped oscillation.  This is described as ''dynamic'' (or ''ordinary'') ''stability''.

A Maclaurin spheroid of eccentricity greater than 0.952887&lt;ref name="PoissonAndWill"/&gt; is dynamically unstable.  Even if it is composed of an inviscid fluid and has no means of losing energy, a suitable perturbation will grow (at least initially) exponentially.  Dynamic instability implies secular instability (and secular stability implies dynamic stability).&lt;ref name="Lyttleton1953"/&gt;

'''Macrophilia''' is a fascination with or a [[sexual fantasy]] involving giants, more commonly expressed as [[giantess]]es (female giants).&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/inside-world-macrophilia-sexual-fetish-celebrates-everything-big | title=Inside The World Of ‘Macrophilia,’ the Sexual Fetish That Celebrates Everything Big | work=[[AlterNet]] | date=November 6, 2014 | accessdate=October 2, 2015 | author=Weisman, Carrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201504/big-love|title=Big Love|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically a male fantasy, with the male playing the "smaller" part—entering, being dominated, or  [[Vorarephilia|being eaten]] by the larger woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Weirdly Beloved: Tales of Strange Bedfellows, Odd Couplings, and Love Gone Bad | first=Cynthia | last=Ceilán | publisher=Globe Pequot | year=2008 | isbn=1-59921-403-2 | pages=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others involve partners who naturally have a significant difference in size.

==Interest==
{{Further|Sexual fetishism}}

Although macrophilia literally translates to simply a "lover of large,"&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; in the context of a sexual fantasy, it is used to mean someone who is attracted to beings larger than themselves. Generally, the interest differs between people, and  depends on gender and sexual orientation. They often enjoy feeling small and being abused, degraded, dominated, or eaten,&lt;ref name="O'Neill-PalmBeach"/&gt; and they may also view female giants as being powerful and dominating.

Commenting on why there are not as many female macrophiles, psychologist [[Helen Friedman]] theorized that because women in most societies already view men as dominant and powerful, there is no need for them to fantasize about it.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; Women that take on the roles of the giantess within this fetish often find the practice to be empowering and enjoy being worshipped.&lt;ref name="O'Neill-PalmBeach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt;

The roots of macrophilia may lie in sexual arousal in childhood and early adolescence which is accidentally associated with giants, according to [[Mark D. Griffiths|Dr. Mark Griffiths]]'s speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monk|first1=Felicity|title=The Men Who Want to Have Sex with Actual Giants|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/macrophilia-fetish-the-men-who-want-to-have-sex-with-actual-giants|accessdate=12 November 2016|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and experience==
The internet has played an important role in helping to develop the fetish.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; The pornography site [[Pornhub]]'s 2015 annual report showed that compared to 2014, the biggest increasing of sex tape was giantess, which had a 1091 percent gain in searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lehmiller|first1=Justin|title=GIANTESS WOMEN ARE THE NEW BIG THING IN PORN|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/giantess-porn|accessdate=26 January 2016|publisher=Playboy|date=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also existed an exhibit at the [[Museum of Sex]] titled "Kink: Geography of the Erotic Imagination" which explored many different fantasies, including macrophilia.&lt;ref name="nerve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="camp"/&gt;

Online content creators also developed homemade media that helped grow the fetish's reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://contemporaryqueer.com/2015/06/gay-macrophilia-sexual-fetish/|title=Gay Macrophilia: A Sexual Fantasy of Great Proportions {{!}} Contemporary Queer|date=2015-06-29|work=Contemporary Queer|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to generating content across websites, some content creators even branded themselves in ways that helped them generate a following and gain revenue for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://contemporaryqueer.com/2015/07/microphile-drevon-the-colossus-interview/|title=Interview with Microphile Erotic Artist Drevon the Colossus {{!}} Contemporary Queer|date=2015-07-13|work=Contemporary Queer|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After data was gathered from 4,814,732 videos on clips4sale, an established porn site, it was found that "giantess" was the 34th most popular category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2015/apr/30/porn-data-visualising-fetish-space|title=Porn data: visualising fetish space|last=Robbins|first=Martin|date=2015-04-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A way to experience the fetish in real life is with extraordinarily tall women who can schedule private sessions with macrophiles to engage in non-sexual interaction such as: trampling, lifting and carrying, foot worshiping, [[Sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] and domination.&lt;ref name="O'Neill-PalmBeach"/&gt;

'''Measurement category''' is a method of classification by the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)&lt;ref&gt;http://assets.fluke.com/Appnotes/2042049_w.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Live wire (electricity)|live electric circuits]] used in measurement and testing of installations and equipment, usually in the relation within a building (residential or industrial).

The categories take into account the total continuous energy available at the given point of circuit, and the occurrence of [[overvoltage|impulse voltages]]. The energy can be limited by [[circuit breaker]]s or [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]], and the impulse voltages by the nominal level of voltage.

== Measurement categories ==
Measuring circuits are subjected to WORKING VOLTAGES and transient stresses from the circuit to
which they are connected during measurement or test. When the measuring circuit is used to
measure MAINS, the transient stresses can be estimated by the location within the installation at
which the measurement is performed. When the measuring circuit is used to measure any other
electrical signal, the transient stresses must be considered by the user to assure that they do not exceed the capabilities of the measuring equipment. In this standard, circuits are divided into the following measurement categories:&lt;ref name="61010-1" /&gt;

=== CAT I ===
Category I is for measurements performed on circuits not directly connected to MAINS.  

Examples are measurements on circuits not derived from MAINS, and specially protected (internal) MAINS-derived circuits.  In the latter case, transient stresses are variable; for that reason IEC 61010-1-5.4.1(g) requires that the transient withstand capability of the equipment is made known to the user.&lt;ref name="61010-1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Safety Requirements for Electrical Equipment for Measurement, Control, and Laboratory Use--Part1: General Requirements|journal=ANSI/ISA|date=2004|volume=61010-1 (82.02.01)|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CAT II ===
Measurement category II is for measurements performed on circuits directly connected to the low
voltage installation.

Examples are measurements on household appliances, portable tools and similar equipment.&lt;ref name="61010-1" /&gt;

=== CAT III ===
Measurement category III is for measurements performed in the building installation.

Examples are measurements on distribution boards, circuit-breakers, wiring, including cables, bus-bars, junction boxes, switches, socket-outlets in the fixed installation, and equipment for industrial. &lt;ref name="61010-1" /&gt;

=== CAT IV ===
Measurement category IV is for measurements performed at the source of the low-voltage
installation.

Examples are electricity meters and measurements on primary overcurrent protection devices and ripple control units.&lt;ref name="61010-1" /&gt;

== Clearances ==
The value of clearance relates to the electrical insulation, and the possibility of arc flash between two electrically energised parts (or between live and grounded parts). Higher voltages require higher clearances. For [[double insulation]] the clearances must be doubled.

The required values can vary from 0.04 mm for single insulation CAT II, 50 V, to 28 mm for double insulation CAT IV, 1000 V.
The exact values are defined in the international standards. Such standards should be followed rigorously during the design process of the appropriate equipment.

== Impulse withstand voltages ==
Similarly to the clearances the value of required impulse withstand voltage varies from 500 V (CAT II, 50 V), to 12,000 V (CAT IV, 1000 V):

The '''missing baryon problem''' was a problem related to the fact that the observed amount of [[baryon|baryonic matter]] did not match theoretical predictions. The density of baryons can be constrained according to [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] and the [[cosmic microwave background]]. The best current data, observed by the [[Planck spacecraft]] in 2015, yielded a density about 4.85% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="Planck15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ade et al.|first1=P.A.R.|title=Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters|journal=Astron. Astrophys.|date=2015|volume=594|page=A13|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201525830|bibcode=2016A&amp;A...594A..13P|arxiv = 1502.01589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, directly adding up all the known baryonic matter produces a baryonic density slightly less than half of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://archive.stsci.edu/hut/astro2/astro2_science/starburst.html|title="The Case of the "Missing Baryons""|author=Henry C. Ferguson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missing baryon problem is distinct from the [[dark matter]] problem, which is mainly non-baryonic in nature. There is also much more dark matter in the universe than there are missing baryons.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lambda-CDM model]]. Baryons make up only ~5% of the universe, while dark matter makes up 26.8%.&lt;/ref&gt;

The missing baryon problem was proclaimed solved in October 2017, with the missing baryons located in the [[Warm–hot intergalactic medium|warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM)]] (hot intergalactic gas).&lt;ref name="New Scientist"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2149742-half-the-universes-missing-matter-has-just-been-finally-found/|title=Half the universe’s missing matter has just been finally found|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical predictions==
The density of baryonic matter can be obtained indirectly from two independent methods.

* The theory of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts the observed [[abundance of the chemical elements]]. If there are more baryons, then there should also be more helium, lithium and heavier elements synthesized during the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;Achim Weiss, "[http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements]" in: Einstein Online Vol. 2 (2006), 1017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raine |first=D. |last2=Thomas |first2=T. |date=2001 |title=An Introduction to the Science of Cosmology |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/55748578/An-Introduction-to-the-Science-of-Cosmology |page=30 |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]] |isbn=0-7503-0405-7 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530073650/http://www.scribd.com/doc/55748578/An-Introduction-to-the-Science-of-Cosmology |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]].
* Detailed analysis of the small irregularities (anisotropies) in the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), especially the second peak. The details are technical, but are based on the fact that baryonic matter interacts with photons and therefore leaves a visible imprint on the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=L. |last=Canetti |first2=M. |last2=Drewes |first3=M. |last3=Shaposhnikov |title=Matter and Antimatter in the Universe |journal=New J. Phys. |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=095012 |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/9/095012 |arxiv = 1204.4186 |bibcode = 2012NJPh...14i5012C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMB constraint (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_b h^2 = 0.02230 \pm 0.00014&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref name="Planck15" /&gt; is much more precise than the BBN constraint (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_b h^2 = 0.023 \pm 0.002&lt;/math&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/lecturenotes/Mike_Anderson_on_missing_baryons.pdf|title=Missing Baryons|author=Mike Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1412.1408|last1=Fields|first1=Brian D|title=Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis|journal=Chinese Physics C|volume=38|issue=9|pages=339–344|last2=Molaro|first2=Paolo|last3=Sarkar|first3=Subir|year=2014|doi=10.1088/1674-1137/38/9/090001|bibcode=2014ChPhC..38i0001O}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the two are in agreement.

==Observations==
The density of baryonic matter can be obtained directly by summing up all the known baryonic matter. This is highly nontrivial, since although luminous matter such as stars and galaxies are easily summed, baryonic matter can also exist in highly non-luminous form, such as [[black holes]], [[planets]], and highly diffuse [[interstellar gas]]. Nonetheless it can still be done, using techniques such as:

* Sufficient diffuse, baryonic gas or dust would be visible when backlit by stars. The resulting spectra can be used to infer the mass between the star and the observer (us).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lyman-alpha forest]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gravitational microlensing]]. If a planet or other dark object moves between the observer and a faraway source, the image of the source is distorted. The mass of the dark object can be inferred based on the amount of distortion.

Prior to 2017, the result came to about 70% of the theoretical predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1112.2706 |bibcode=2012ApJ...759...23S |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/759/1/23 |title=The Baryon Census in a Multiphase Intergalactic Medium: 30% of the Baryons May Still be Missing|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=759 |pages=23 |year=2012 |last1=Shull |first1=J. Michael |last2=Smith |first2=Britton D |last3=Danforth |first3=Charles W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
The missing baryon problem was proclaimed solved in 2017, when two groups of scientists working independently found the missing baryons in intergalactic matter. The missing baryons had been postulated to exist as hot strands between galaxy pairs. Because the strands are so diffuse, and because they are not hot enough to emit X-rays, they are difficult to detect. The groups used the [[Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect]] to measure the density of the strands. If there are baryons present, light from the cosmic microwave background should scatter off them, losing some energy. These show up as very dim patches in the CMB. The patches are too dim to see directly, but when overlaid with the visible galaxy distribution, become detectable. The density of the strands comes up to about 30% of the baryonic density, the exact amount needed to solve the problem.&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1709.05024|last1=Tanimura|first1=Hideki|title=A Search for Warm/Hot Gas Filaments Between Pairs of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies|last2=Hinshaw|first2=Gary|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian G|author4=Ludovic Van Waerbeke|last5=Ma|first5=Yin-Zhe|last6=Mead|first6=Alexander|last7=Hojjati|first7=Alireza|last8=Tröster|first8=Tilman|class=astro-ph.CO|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1709.10378|author1=Anna de Graaff|title=Missing baryons in the cosmic web revealed by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect|last2=Cai|first2=Yan-Chuan|last3=Heymans|first3=Catherine|last4=Peacock|first4=John A|class=astro-ph.CO|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicastro|first=F.|last2=Kaastra|first2=J.|last3=Krongold|first3=Y.|last4=Borgani|first4=S.|last5=Branchini|first5=E.|last6=Cen|first6=R.|last7=Dadina|first7=M.|last8=Danforth|first8=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5975">'''Nanophytoplankton''' are particularly small [[phytoplankton]] with sizes between 2 and 20&amp;nbsp;µm. They are the [[autotrophic]] part of [[nanoplankton]]. Like other phytoplankton, nanophytoplankton are microscopic organisms that obtain energy through the process of photosynthesis and must therefore live in the upper sunlit layer of ocean or other bodies of water. These microscopic free-floating organisms, including [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]], fix large amounts of [[carbon]] which would otherwise be released as [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/phytoplankton phytoplankton] Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanophytoplankton in the ecosystem==
Phytoplankton form the beginning of the food chain for aquatic animals.  [[Zooplankton]] and [[krill]] feed on nanophytoplankton, which are then eaten by whales, seals, birds, fish, squid, and other organisms.&lt;ref name = "four"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s735612.htm|title=News in Science - Phytoplankton implicated in global warming - 27/11/2002|author=|date=|website=www.abc.net.au|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
Populations are low in the winter, when nutrients are high, and then the populations increase as the nanophytoplankton consume nearly all of the nutrients, reach their [[carrying capacity]], and decline in number at the end of the summer, beginning the cycle again in the winter.  However, nanophytoplankton have different seasonal cycles depending on which oceanic biome of the world they live in.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "five"&gt;Stonehouse, B. ''Polar Ecology''. New York: Chapman and Hall, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrient uptake==
Phytoplanktons’ density (1.02 g/cm^3) is higher than that of sea water (1.00 g/cm^3).  Therefore, they sink in the ocean, unless there is an upward movement of water.  However, nanophytoplankton, with as small as a 1&amp;nbsp;µm radius, can swim in the ocean, but at a very slow rate, like “a human swimming in molasses.”  In either case, movement of water past the organism is created, allowing it to grab nutrients passing by.  To supply nutrients through their boundary layer, nanophytoplankton employ diffusion more effectively than swimming, however.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "five"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann, K. H. and Lazier, J.R.N. ''Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems III''. Australia: Blackwell Publishing, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antarctic nanophytoplankton==
In the [[Southern Ocean]] in the Antarctic zone, nanophytoplankton are the most abundant type of plankton in terms of number, but not volume.  Antarctic marine flora consists almost entirely of algae, with phytoplankton, and therefore nanophytoplankton, being the most numerous type, as having great importance.  Nanophytoplankton growth has been seen in pack-ice, covering nearly 73% of the Southern Ocean by the end of the winter.  They even grow on icebergs.  Nanophytoplankton production is affected by light intensity and duration, ice, surface water stability, and currents.  Also, availability of silicates, a nutrient for the organism, can affect photosynthetic efficiency and cell composition.&lt;ref&gt;Laws, R. M. ''Antarctic Ecology''. Orlando: Academic Press Inc., 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanophytoplankton also require vitamins.  They thrive in areas of shallow water where there is upwelling and mixing.  Although optimal growth for the species occurs in water 5-7&amp;nbsp;°C, growth still occurs in Antarctic waters, which can reach as low as -2&amp;nbsp;°C.  Limitation of light intensity and duration is another factor for survival.  In Antarctica, the sun’s lower position above the horizon reduces light due to increased reflection, and the stormy seas reduce transmission of light due to bubble formations.  However, some Antarctic nanophytoplankton seem to be adapted to low light levels.  Most phytoplankton exist in warmer, equatorial waters.  For example, in the northwestern [[Philippine Sea]], the average number of nanophytoplankton was 1x10^4/l.  It is the nanophytoplankton in particular that seem to survive better under the conditions provided by the oceans of the Antarctic.  A physiological change in the cells must have occurred to allow this phenomenon.  Low [[salinity]] is desirable for survival, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Waldo and Llano, George. ''Biology of the Antarctic Seas XI''. Washington D.C.: American Geophysical Union, 1971.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on global warming==
Continued global warming will significantly alter the food chain on Earth.  With nanophytoplankton and phytoplankton at the base of the food chain, their decreased productivity from increased [[Ultraviolet|UV-B]] radiation from ozone depletion will provide less food for krill and subsequent organisms in the food chain.  Antarctica has experienced up to 50% [[ozone depletion]], harming nanophytoplankton located here the most.  Through carbon fixation, nanophytoplankton absorb carbon from the atmosphere, and with depleting populations, more carbon is left in the air, contributing to more global warming and ozone depletion.  The cycle then continues.  However, some scientists believe that existence of nanophytoplankton contributes to further progression of global warming, because they absorb the sun’s radiation that would otherwise be reflected back into space.  Despite the controversy, it is evident that nanophytoplankton, albeit their minimal size and apparent irrelevance because they are hardly visible, are an integral part of sustaining life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ess-home.com/news/global-warming/ozone-depletion.asp|title=Global Warming and Ozone Depletion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=ess-home.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Human Genome Research Institute''' ('''NHGRI''') is an Institute of the [[National Institutes of Health]], located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].

NHGRI began as the Office of Human Genome Research in The Office of the Director in 1988. This Office transitioned to the '''National Center for Human Genome Research''' (NCHGR), in 1989 to carry out the role of the NIH in the [[International Human Genome Project]] (HGP). The HGP was developed in collaboration with the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) and began in 1990 to map the [[human genome]]. In 1993, NCHGR expanded its role on the NIH campus by establishing the [[Division of Intramural Research]] (DIR) to apply genome technologies to the study of specific diseases. In 1996, the [[Center for Inherited Disease Research]] (CIDR) was also established (co-funded by eight NIH institutes and centers) to study the genetic components of complex disorders.

In 1997 the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) renamed NCHGR the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), officially elevating it to the status of research institute - one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the NIH.

The Institute has successfully accomplished determination of the [[human genome]] in April 2003.

== NHGRI Organizational Structure ==
NHGRI is organized into seven divisions and the Office of the Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10000968/organization/|title=Organization|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of these divisions support extramural research (the grant-giving side), one coordinates the intramural (on-campus) research arm of the institute, one deals with administration, management, and budget, and one serves as the public-facing side of the institute housing the communications, policy, and education teams. 

==Events in NHGRI history==
{{main|List of events in NHGRI history}}

* November 17, 2009 - NIH Appoints [[Eric D. Green]], M.D., Ph.D. to be Director of The National Human Genome Research Institute. It is the first time an institute director has risen to lead the entire NIH and subsequently picked his own successor.

== CEER Centers ==
In 1990 as part of the [[Human Genome Project]], the NHGRI dedicated 5% of its annual budget to explore the ethical, legal, and social implications of genomic research. This program’s current priorities focus on the ethical applications of genomics to as it applies to communities, families, and individuals in areas such as healthcare, research, defense, intellectual property, regulation, policy, and larger social issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genome.gov/elsi/#al-1&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004 the ELSI program established several Centers for Excellence in ELSI research (CEER). It was funded with substantial contributions from the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]]. CEER centers have a common focus on the ethical, social, and legal implications resulting from the advances in genomic research.&lt;ref&gt;http://depts.washington.edu/cghe/CGHE-CEER&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial centers were&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genome.gov/12512375&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[Case Western Reserve]] University's Center for Genetic Research Ethics and Law; Eric Juengst, Ph.D., $5.3 million
* The [[Duke University|Duke]] Center for the Study of Public Genomics; Robert Cook-Deegan, M.D., $4.8 million
* [[Stanford University]] School of Medicine's Center for Integration of Research on Genetics and Ethics; Mildred Cho, Ph.D., $3.8 million
* [[University of Washington]]'s Center for Genomics and Healthcare Equality; Wylie Burke, M.D., Ph.D., $4.7 million
This center is focused on equitable distribution and use of translational genome research in underserved and marginalized communities. CGHE has several cores working to address different lenses of health disparities, genomic research, and outreach education. These cores include the Partnership core, the Genome Sciences core, the Healthcare Decision-making core and the Indigenous Genomics Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;http://depts.washington.edu/cghe/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
The NHGRI is publicly funded. In support of moving to a translational model, the NHGRI published their funding mechanisms for ELSI research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NHGRI|first=NIH|title=Concept Clearance|url=http://www.genome.gov/Pages/About/NACHGR/February2012AgendaDocuments/CONCEPT_CLEARANCE_CEERs.pdf|work=NHGRI CEER|publisher=NHGRI|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neutrino Array Radio Calibration (NARC)''' experiment is the successor to the [[Radio Ice Cerenkov Experiment|Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment (RICE)]] which will serve as a testbed for future development of an eventual large-scale neutrino radio-detection array. NARC involves detecting ultra high energy electron [[neutrino]]s through their interactions with ice molecules in the Antarctic icecap, based on the principle of [[Coherence (physics)|radio coherence]]. Experimentally, the goal is to detect and measure long-wavelength (radiofrequency) pulses resulting from this interaction.

{{Other uses}}
The phrase "'''not even wrong'''" describes an argument or explanation that purports to be scientific but is based on invalid reasoning or speculative premises that can neither be proven correct nor [[falsifiability|falsified]]. Hence, it refers to statements that cannot be discussed in a rigorous, [[scientific method|scientific sense]].&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt; For a meaningful discussion on whether a certain statement is true or false, the statement must satisfy the criterion called "falsifiability"—the inherent possibility for the statement to be tested and found false. In this sense, the phrase "not even wrong" is synonymous to "nonfalsifiable".&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt;

The phrase is generally attributed to  [[theoretical physicist]] [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was known for his colorful objections to incorrect or careless thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shermer M |authorlink = Michael Shermer | title = Wronger Than Wrong | journal = Scientific American | year = 2006 | pages =  | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810231612/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=wronger-than-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNAPngEACAAJ |title=Atom and Archetype: The Pauli/Jung Letters, 1932–1958 |last=Jung |first=C.

Peierls remarks that quite a few [[Apocrypha#Metaphorical usage|apocryphal stories]] of this kind have been circulated and mentions that he listed only the ones personally vouched for by him. He also quotes another example when Pauli replied to [[Lev Landau]], "What you said was so confused that one could not tell whether it was nonsense or not."&lt;ref name=peierls /&gt;

The phrase is often used to describe [[pseudoscience]] or bad science and is considered derogatory.&lt;ref name=Bukerman&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1573072,00.html |title = Not even wrong |publisher = The Guardian |date = September 19, 2005 |author = Oliver Burkeman |authorlink = Oliver Burkeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positive political theory''' or '''explanatory political theory''' is the study of [[politics]] using formal methods such as [[social choice theory]],  [[game theory]], and [[statistical analysis]]. In particular, social choice theoretic methods are often used to describe and (axiomatically) analyze the performance of rules or institutions.  The outcomes of the rules or institutions described are then analyzed by game theory, where the individuals/parties/nations involved in a given interaction are modeled as ''rational'' agents playing a game, guided by self-interest.  
Based on this assumption, the outcome of the interactions can be predicted as an equilibrium of the game.

The founder of the field was [[William H. Riker]]. In his book ''[[The Theory of Political Coalitions]]'' (1962), he applied the principles of [[game theory]] to the study of politics.

'''Process engineering''' focuses on the design, operation, control, optimization and intensification of chemical, physical, and biological processes. Process engineering encompasses a vast range of industries, such as [[Agricultural Engineering|agriculture]], [[Automotive Engineering|automotive]], [[Biotechnology|biotechnical]], [[Chemical Engineering|chemical]], [[Food Engineering|food]],  [[Materials Science|material development]], [[Mining Engineering|mining]], [[Nuclear Engineering|nuclear]], [[Petroleum_ Industry|petrochemical]], [[Process chemistry|pharmaceutical]], and [[Computer Programming|software development]]. The application of systematic computer-based methods to process engineering is "process systems engineering".

== Overview ==

Process engineering involves the utilization of multiple tools and methods. Depending on the exact nature of the system, processes need to be simulated and modeled using mathematics and computer science. Principles in thermodynamics are applied for systems requiring that energy in the system be considered. Disciplines within the field of mechanics need to be applied in the presence of fluids or porous and dispersed media. Materials engineering principles also need to be applied, when relevant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Regardless of the exact tools required, process engineering often requires the use of a [[process flow diagram]] (PFD) where [[material flow]] paths, storage equipment (such as tanks and silos), transformations (such as [[Distillation column|distillation columns]], receiver/head tanks, mixing, separations, pumping, etc.) and [[Flow measurement|flowrates]] are specified, as well as a list of all pipes and conveyors and their contents, material properties such as [[density]], [[viscosity]], [[particle-size distribution]], flowrates, pressures, temperatures, and materials of construction for the piping and [[Unit operation|unit operations]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The process flow diagram is then used to develop a [[piping and instrumentation diagram]] (P&amp;ID) which graphically displays the actual process occurring.  P&amp;ID are meant to be more complex and specific than a PFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hardhatengineer.com/how-to-read-pid-pefs-drawings/|title=Learn How to Read P&amp;ID Drawings - A Complete Guide|website=hardhatengineer.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The P&amp;ID is then used as a basis of design for developing the "system operation guide" or "[[Functional specification|functional design specification]]" which outlines the operation of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scottmanning.com/content/functional-design-specification/|title=Functional Design Specification|date=2006-04-02|work=Historian on the Warpath|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the P&amp;ID, a proposed layout (general arrangement) of the process can be shown from an overhead view ([[plot plan]]) and a side view (elevation), and other engineering disciplines are involved such as [[civil engineer]]s for site work (earth moving), foundation design, concrete slab design work, structural steel to support the equipment, etc.). All previous work is directed toward defining the scope of the project, then developing a cost estimate to get the design installed, and a schedule to communicate the timing needs for engineering, procurement, fabrication, installation, commissioning, startup, and ongoing production of the process.

Depending on the needed accuracy of the cost estimate and schedule that is required, several iterations of designs are generally provided to customers or stakeholders who feed back their requirements. The process engineer incorporates these additional instructions (scope revisions) into the overall design and additional cost estimates, and schedules are developed for funding approval. Following funding approval, the project is executed via [[project management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/637120594|title=Modelling and management of engineering processes|date=2010|publisher=Springer|others=Heisig, Peter, 1962-, Clarkson, John, 1961-, Vajna, S.

==Areas of focus in process engineering==

Process engineering activities can be divided into the following disciplines:&lt;ref name="cmu"&gt;[http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/Papers/GrossmannWestChall.pdf Research Challenges in Process Systems Engineering] by Ignacio E. Grossmann and Arthur W. Westerberg, Department of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of process engineering ==
The term ''process'', as it relates to industry and production, dates back to the 18th Century.  During this time period, demands for various products began to drastically increase, and process engineers were required to optimize the process in which these products were created.  &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830512387|title=Process engineering and industrial management|date=2012|publisher=ISTE Ltd.|others=Dal Pont, Jean-Pierre.|isbn=9781118562130|location=London|oclc=830512387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By 1980, the concept of process engineering emerged from the fact that chemical engineering techniques and practices were being used in a variety of industries.  By this time, process engineering had been defined as "the set of knowledge necessary to design, analyze, develop, construct, and operate, in an optimal way, the processes in which the material changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830512387|title=Process engineering and industrial management|date=2012|publisher=ISTE Ltd.|others=Dal Pont, Jean-Pierre.|isbn=9781118562130|location=London|oclc=830512387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 20th Century, process engineering had expanded from chemical engineering-based technologies to other applications, including metallurgical engineering, agricultural engineering, and product engineering.  

==History of process systems engineering==
Process systems engineering (PSE) is a relatively young area in [[chemical engineering]]. The first time that this term was used was in a special volume of the [[AIChE]] Symposium Series in 1961. However, it was not until 1982 when the first international symposium on this topic took place in Kyoto, Japan, that the term PSE started to become widely accepted.

The first textbook in the area was ''Strategy of Process Engineering'' by [[Dale F. Rudd]] and Charles C. Watson (Wiley, 1968). The Computing and Systems Technology (CAST) Division, Area 10 of AIChE, was founded in 1977 and currently{{When|date=January 2017}} has about 1200 members. CAST has four sections: Process Design, Process Control, Process Operations, and Applied Mathematics.

The first journal devoted to PSE was ''Computers and Chemical Engineering'', which appeared in 1977. The Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD) conference in 1980 in Henniker was one of the first meetings in a series on that topic in the PSE area. It is now accompanied by the successful series on Control (CPC), Operations (FOCAPO), and the world-wide series titled Process Systems Engineering. The CACHE Corporation (Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering), which organizes these conferences, was initially launched by academics in 1970, motivated by the introduction of [[process simulation]] in the chemical engineering curriculum.

[[Roger W.H. Sargent]] from [[Imperial College]] was one of the pioneers in the area. PSE is an active area of research in many other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Korea, and China.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15386">'''Pseudoenzymes''' are variants of [[enzyme]]s (usually [[protein]]s) that are catalytically deficient (usually inactive), meaning that they perform little or no [[enzyme catalysis]]. They are believed to be represented in all major [[Protein family|enzyme families]] in the [[kingdoms of life]]. Pseudoenzymes are becoming increasingly important to analyse, especially as the [[bioinformatic]] analysis of [[genome]]s reveals their ubiquity. Their important regulatory and sometimes disease-associated functions in metabolic and [[signalling pathway]]s are also shedding new light on the non-catalytic functions of active enzymes ([[Protein moonlighting]]), and are suggesting new ways to target and interpret cellular signalling mechanisms using [[small molecule]]s and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eyers PA, Murphy JM | title = The evolving world of pseudoenzymes: proteins, prejudice and zombies | journal = BMC Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 98 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27835992 | pmc = 5106787 | doi = 10.1186/s12915-016-0322-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most intensively analyzed, and certainly the best understood pseudoenzymes in terms of cellular signalling functions are probably the [[pseudokinase]]s, the pseudoproteases and the pseudophosphatases.

==Structures and roles==
The difference between enzymatically active and inactive [[Sequence homology|homologues]] has been noted (and in some cases, understood when comparing catalytically active and inactive proteins residing in recognisable families) for some time at the sequence level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Todd AE, Orengo CA, Thornton JM | title = Sequence and structural differences between enzyme and nonenzyme homologs | journal = Structure | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 1435–51 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12377129 | doi = 10.1016/s0969-2126(02)00861-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some pseudoenzymes have also been referred to as 'prozymes' when they were analysed in [[protozoan parasite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willert EK, Fitzpatrick R, Phillips MA | title = Allosteric regulation of an essential trypanosome polyamine biosynthetic enzyme by a catalytically dead homolog | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 20 | pages = 8275–80 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17485680 | pmc = 1895940 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0701111104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best studied pseudoenzymes reside amongst various key signalling superfamilies of enzymes, such as the [[protease]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adrain C, Freeman M | title = New lives for old: evolution of pseudoenzyme function illustrated by iRhoms | journal = Nature Reviews.

{{merge|Gracility|date=April 2018}}
In [[biology]], '''robustness''' is used to describe a species with a [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] based on strength and a heavy build. The alternative morphology is the [[Gracility|gracile]] body type. 

For example, comparing similar species, [[rat]]s have robust body types while [[Mouse|mice]] are gracile. Male and female members of the same species may display [[sexual dimorphism]] and have robust and gracile morphologies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} 

The terms "robust" vs. "gracile" are used relatively in the context of [[human evolution]], to distinguish:
*"robust" vs. "gracile" [[australopithecines]], see ''[[Paranthropus]]''
*"robust" [[archaic humans]] vs. "gracile" [[anatomically modern humans]]
*"robust" [[early modern humans]]  ([[Cro-Magnon]]) vs. "gracile" [[Epipaleolithic]] humans ([[Combe-Capelle]])

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}
[[File:Single Point of Failure.png|200px|right|thumb|In this diagram the [[router (computing)|router]] is a single point of failure for the communication network between computers]]
A '''single point of failure''' ('''SPOF''') is a part of a system that, if it [[failure|fails]], will [[Cascading failure|stop the entire system from working]].&lt;ref&gt;1:  
Designing Large-scale LANs – Page 31, K. Dooley, O'Reilly, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of [[high availability]] or [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system.

==Overview==
Systems can be made robust by adding [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] in all potential SPOFs. For instance, the owner of a small [[tree care]] company may only own one [[woodchipper]]. If the chipper breaks, he may be unable to complete his current job and may have to cancel future jobs until he can obtain a replacement.

Redundancy can be achieved at various levels. For instance, the owner of the tree care company may have [[spare part]]s ready for the repair of the wood chipper, in case it fails. At a higher level, he may have a second wood chipper that he can bring to the job site. Finally, at the highest level, he may have enough equipment available to completely replace everything at the work site in the case of multiple failures.

The assessment of a potential SPOF involves identifying the critical components of a complex system that would provoke a total systems failure in case of [[wikt:malfunction|malfunction]]. Highly [[reliability engineering|reliable system]]s should not rely on any such individual component.

&lt;gallery class="center" widths=320 heights=200&gt;
File:Spof_simple.svg|Possible SPOFs in a simple setup.
File:Spof_redundancy.svg|Using redundancy to avoid some SPOFs.
File:Spof_complex.svg|Completely redundant system without SPOFs.(Note: Assumes Generator and Grid sources are each rated at N, Each UPS is rated at N and "A/C" and "Electrical" are in themselves completely fault tolerant systems.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Computing==
{{main|Fault-tolerant computer system}}
In computing, redundancy can be achieved at the internal component level, at the system level (multiple machines), or site level (replication).

One would normally deploy a load balancer to ensure high availability for a server cluster at the system level.

In a high-availability [[Server (computing)|server]] [[Computer cluster|cluster]], each individual server may attain internal component redundancy by having multiple power supplies, hard drives, and other components. System level redundancy could be obtained by having spare servers waiting to take on the work of another server if it fails.

Since a data center is often a support center for other operations such as business logic, it represents a potential SPOF in itself. Thus, at the site level, the entire cluster may be replicated at another location, where it can be accessed in case the primary location becomes unavailable. This is typically addressed as part of an IT disaster recovery (resiliency) program.

[[Paul Baran]] and [[Donald Davies]] developed [[packet switching]], a key part of "survivable communications networks".
Such networks{{snd}} including [[ARPANET]] and the [[Internet]]{{snd}} are designed to have no single point of failure.
Multiple paths between any two points on the network allow those points to continue communicating with each other, the packets [[dynamic routing|"routing around" damage]], even after any single failure of any one particular path or any one intermediate node.

Network protocols used to prevent SPOF:
* [[Intermediate System to Intermediate System]]
* [[Open Shortest Path First]]
* [[Shortest Path Bridging]]

=== Software engineering ===
In [[software engineering]], a '''bottleneck''' occurs when the capacity of an [[software application|application]] or a computer system is severely limited by a single component. The bottleneck has lowest throughput of all parts of the transaction path.

=== Performance engineering ===
Tracking down bottlenecks (sometimes known as "'''hot spots'''" - sections of the code that execute most frequently - i.e. have the highest execution count) is called [[Profiling (computer programming)|performance analysis]]. Reduction is usually achieved with the help of specialized tools, known as [[Profiling (computer programming)|performance analyzers]] or [[Profiler (computer science)|profilers]]. The objective being to make those particular sections of code perform as fast as possible to improve overall [[algorithmic efficiency]].

=== Computer security ===
A mistake in just one component can compromise the entire system.

==Other fields==
The concept of a single point of failure has also been applied to fields outside of engineering, computers, and networking, such as corporate [[supply chain]] management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary S. Lynch|title=Single Point of Failure: The 10 Essential Laws of Supply Chain Risk Management|isbn=978-0-470-42496-4|publisher=Wiley|date=Oct 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transportation management.&lt;ref name=crucialstuck&gt;[http://wnpr.org/post/crucial-century-old-and-sometimes-stuck-connecticut-bridge-key-northeast-corridor "Crucial, Century-Old, And Sometimes Stuck: Connecticut Bridge Is Key To Northeast Corridor"]. [[Connecticut Public Radio]], August 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design structures that create single points of failure include [[bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]]s and [[series circuit]]s (in contrast to [[parallel circuit]]s).

In transportation, some noted recent examples of the concept's recent application have included the [[Nipigon River Bridge]] in Canada, where a partial bridge failure in January 2016 entirely severed road traffic between [[Eastern Canada]] and [[Western Canada]] for several days because it is located along a portion of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] where there is no alternate [[detour]] route for vehicles to take;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnews.ca/news/2447050/the-nipigon-river-bridge-and-other-trans-canada-bottlenecks/ "The Nipigon River Bridge and other Trans-Canada bottlenecks"]. [[Global News]], January 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norwalk River Railroad Bridge]] in [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Connecticut]], an aging [[swing bridge]] that sometimes gets stuck when opening or closing, disrupting rail traffic on the [[Northeast Corridor]] line.&lt;ref name=crucialstuck/&gt;

The concept of a single point of failure has also been applied to the fields of intelligence. [[Edward Snowden]] talked of the dangers of being what he described as "the single point of failure" – the sole repository of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11185627/Edward-Snowden-the-true-story-behind-his-NSA-leaks.html|title=Edward Snowden: the true story behind his NSA leaks|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clare College, Cambridge, July 2010 (16).JPG|thumb|Clare College, University of Cambridge a regular venue for the Social Stratification Seminars.]]
The '''Social Stratification Research Seminar (UK)''' is an annual research colloquium for original, empirically informed [[Sociology|sociological]] presentations on [[social stratification]]. The Social Stratification Research Seminars have been running almost every autumn since 1968. The seminars have mainly been hosted at the [[University of Cambridge]] and were often organised by the [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/social-science-research-group Social Science Research Group (formerly the Sociological Research Group)]. The seminars have also been held at the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff (]]2003-5), the [[University of Edinburgh]] (2014, 2017), the [[University of Milan]] (2015), the [[University of Stirling]] (2007, 2011) and [[Utrecht University]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/stratif/conf_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The original movers and shakers behind the seminar were three distinguished British scholars working in the field of social stratification - [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/professor-robert-martin-bob-blackburn Professor Robert (Bob) Blackburn],  [https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/about/people/fellows-profiles/professor-ken-prandy Professor Ken Prandy,] and Professor Alexander (Sandy) Stewart. Since the early part of this [[Year 2000|millennium]] the seminar has been organised by [https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/255764 Professor Paul Lambert], who is Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Stirling]] and a longstanding fan of [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion F.C]]. The annual call for papers is usually issued in the spring and the seminar is usually held on two consecutive days in the early September. Proposals for papers for presentations are invited from any area of research into social stratification and social inequality.  The organizers do not usually limit the number of delegates attending. There are no parallel sessions and therefore there is an upper limit on the number of paper presentations that can be accommodated.

A salient feature of the Social Stratification Research Seminars has been how to appropriately measure social stratification in contemporary societies. An approach that has been developed by researchers who are regular contributors to the seminars are Social Interaction and Stratification Scales.&lt;ref&gt;See Stewart, A., PRANDY, K. and Blackburn, R.M., 1973. Measuring the class structure. ''Nature'', ''245''(5426), p.415.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is the foundation of the [http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/ CAMSIS Project] which is an internationally comparative assessment of the structures of social interaction and stratification across a number of countries.

A number of prominent research publications contain work that was developed and showcased at the seminars. These works include an edited volume entitled [https://www.routledge.com/Social-Stratification-Trends-and-Processes/Connelly-Gayle-Lambert/p/book/9781409430964 ''Social stratification:Trends and processes'']&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, P., Connelly, M.R., Blackburn, R.M. and Gayle, V. eds., 2013. ''Social stratification: Trends and processes''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd..&lt;/ref&gt;'','' and special issues of the journal ''[https://rsa.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/11/2-3?nav=tocList Contemporary Social Science]'' and the [https://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ijssp/28/7%2F8 ''International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy''] [https://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ijssp/28/5%2F6].

Notable sociological scholars in the field of social stratification who have attended the Social Stratification Research Seminars include [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=-abxxmUAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate Professor Harry Ganzeboom], [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=gscMj2wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra Dr Wendy Bottero], [https://www.ncl.ac.uk/gps/staff/profile/geoffpayne.html#publications Professor Geoff Payne], [https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/Administration-Services/The-President-s-Office/Institutional-Development/Sustainability/Research/Social-Sciences.html Professor Max Bergman], and [http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/profile.aspx?KeyValue=l.platt@lse.ac.uk Professor Lucinda Platt]. The meeting is also attended by early career researchers such as [https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/266076 Jennifer Ferguson].

'''''The Profits of Religion: An Essay in Economic Interpretation''''' is a nonfiction book, first published in 1917, by the American novelist and [[muck-raking]] journalist [[Upton Sinclair]]. It is a snapshot of the religious movements in the U.S. before its entry into [[World War I]].

The book is the first of the “Dead Hand” series: six books Sinclair wrote on American [[institution]]s. The series also includes ''[[The Brass Check]]'' (journalism), [[The Goose-step (book)|''The Goose-step'']] (higher education), ''The Goslings'' (elementary and high school education), ''[[Mammonart]]'' (art) and ''Money Writes!'' (literature). The term “Dead Hand” ironically refers to Adam Smith’s concept that allowing an "invisible hand" of individual self-interest to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole.

In this book, Sinclair attacks institutionalized religion as a “source of income to parasites, and the natural ally of every form of oppression and exploitation.”

==Overview==
Most [[clergy]]men are hypocrites, but they are not entirely to blame. Like other men, they are victimized by “the competitive wage-system, which presents them with the alternative to swindle or to starve.”

Sinclair savages the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] establishment for transforming the [[proletarian]] [[Jesus]] into a defender of wealth and privilege, and for a long history of alliance with political power in England and the United States.

Turning to the “nonconforming” [[Protestant]] sects, adherents of "The Church of the Merchants" are focused on achieving prosperity within the existing economic system. So are the devotees of the mostly [[California]]-based ‘new religions’ or ‘cults’, including [[New Thought]].

Sinclair wants to rescue the true message of Jesus, the friend of the poor and brother of all men.

== Style ==
The writing is fluent, vivid and personal. At the same time, almost every paragraph is built upon evidence that includes historic and contemporary quotations, articles, events, and anecdotes. It is not meant to be objective, but to present a compelling case. It reads like the exhaustive oral argument of a very able prosecuting attorney.

== Divisions of the book ==
Note: The chapters of Book Six are listed to give a flavor of Sinclair's writing style.
* Book One: The Church of the Conquerors (Priesthoods living off the wealth produced by workers)
* Book Two: The Church of Good Society ([[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopal]])
* Book Three: The Church of the Servant Girls ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]])
* Book Four: The Church of the Slavers (how institutionalized religion, particularly in Germany, oppresses the people)
* Book Five: The Church of the Merchants (nonconformist [[Protestantism|Protestant]])
* Book Six: The Church of the Quacks
** Tabula Rasa
** The Book of [[Mormonism|Mormon]]
** [[Holy Roller|Holy Rolling]]
** Bible Prophecy
** [[Koreshanity]]
** [[Mazdaznan]]
** Black Magic
** Mental Malpractice
** [[Christian Science|Science and Wealth]]
** New Nonsense
** "Dollars Want Me!"
** Spiritual Financiering
** The Graft of Grace
* Book Seven: The Church of the Social Revolution (based on Jesus the proletarian and brother of all humankind)

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing several of the Dead Hand series, a contemporary critic wrote, "These great pamphlets…are storehouses of laborious research. They are indispensable to any student of present American life. I have heard Upton Sinclair charged with reckless, inaccurate and indiscreet use of his material. I am glad to say here that in my own experience I have found him scrupulously anxious, at whatever trouble to himself, to report the exact facts and to weigh carefully his judgments upon them. Why, then, have not these books the authority which they should have?…His explanation is oversimplified; he tends to see his facts in the light of a single motive." &lt;ref name="Lovett"&gt;[[Robert Morss Lovett|Lovett, Robert Morss]], "Upton Sinclair," ''The English Journal'' 17 (9) (Nov., 1928), 706–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Brass Check'' (1919), Sinclair wrote, "''The Profits of Religion'' was practically boycotted by the capitalist press of America. Just one newspaper, the ''Chicago Daily News'', reviewed it—or rather allowed me space in which to review it myself. Just one religious publication, the ''Churchman,'' took the trouble to ridicule it at length. Half a dozen others sneered at it in brief paragraphs, and half a dozen newspapers did the same, and that was all the publicity the book got, except in the radical press."

Universalism, in [[human geography]], signals the position that ideas of development produced in Western social sciences hold for all times and places.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. (2000) Universalism, in R. Johnston, D. Gregory, G. Pratt and M. Wats(eds), “The Dictionary of Human Geography". Oxford: Blackwell, 869-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Universalist thinking began in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when philosophers decided on "truths" that could explain occurrences rationally and accurately. [[Development geography]], human geography and other disciplines seek to find and critique universal "truths". Critics suggest that Universalism has created a world knowledge hierarchy placing Western Europe, North America and the rest of the "developed" world at the top, as the centre of knowledge, and placing the rest of the globe below, as ignorant and needing to be educated. The hierarchy reiterates the [[core-periphery]] notion, examining it in terms of knowledge differentials across space.

==Origins==
As intellectuals began to question traditional understandings of the world and think on a global scale, new "truths" were created to help explain the world as placeless, free of cultural specificity, abstract and apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, V.L., "Making Development Geography". London: Hodder Arnold&lt;/ref&gt;   They began to manifest themselves in development policies, political apparatuses, and other institutions. In the late 19th and 20th century, [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote that "the truths of [modern] science are independent of any local context", echoing the Enlightenment's philosophies and assuming an isotropic globe, thus allowing homogeneity to overtake difference.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim E., "Selected Writings".Cambridge: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of security and superiority was wielded as the world was now understood, which allowed for the continued teaching of and reliance upon universal "truths".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One can see how saying that all knowledge is geographically located is widely taken as a way of saying that the knowledge in question is not authentically true at all.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, T.  ''The View From Nowhere''. Oxford: University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Global diffusion==
As universal "truth" claims gained acceptance among Western intellectuals, they began an important transition into the school system.  [[Michel Foucault]] describes the 17th- and-18th century school systems as being important because of highly complex systems of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault Michel, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977". New York: Pantheon Books, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; As "truth" claims were taught to children, they became embedded within societal and political apparatuses. Once cemented within such institutions, they were able to flourish and remain.

Through the imperialist expansion by the west and the successive [[colonisation]] around the globe, supposed universal "truths" began to diffuse across borders, space and place.  Once colonies were set up and dominant hegemons were in place the processes of the west began to be the processes of the world and the necessary steps to [[modernisation]].

==Changing truths==
The realization that the truths may not be universal across different spaces was an important factor in the 1970s, when questions arose of nationally varying styles of science. By the mid-1980s, geographical sensibility towards science increased, seeking to show that locality and spatial situation needed to be remembered to understand how scientific knowledge was made, became credible and flowed globally.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, S. ''Placing the View from Nowhere: Historical and Sociological Problems in the Location of Science''. Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; It has been with that new situational approach to knowledge formation that allowed geographers to begin analyses of [[epistemology]] with relation to place and confront "truth" formation with a more culturally ecological ([[cultural ecology]]) approach.

==Foucaulta  truths==
Important to universalism in geography is understanding how knowledge becomes accepted as truth. Foucault discusses truth in terms of "societal regimes of truth" and explains that truths are made up by societies by selecting "the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true" and creating and controlling "the mechanisms that enable us to distinguish between true and false statements".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault Michel, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977". New York: Pantheon Books, 131&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on about the relationship between truth and systems of power and how they produce and maintain such regimes of truth.

The '''veneration of the dead''', including one's [[ancestors]], is based on love and respect for the deceased. In some cultures, it is related to [[belief]]s that the dead have a [[afterlife|continued existence]], and may possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living. Some groups venerate their direct, familial ancestors. Certain sects and religions, in particular the [[Roman Catholic Church]], venerate [[saint]]s as [[Intercession|intercessors with God]], as well as pray for [[Soul|departed souls]] in [[Purgatory]].

In [[Culture of Europe|Europe]], [[Culture of Asia|Asia]], and [[Oceania]], and in some [[Culture of Africa|African]] and [[Afro-American religion|Afro-diasporic]] cultures, the goal of ancestor [[veneration]] is to ensure the ancestors' continued well-being and positive disposition towards the living, and sometimes to ask for special favours or assistance. The social or non-religious function of ancestor veneration is to cultivate [[kinship]] values, such as [[filial piety]], family loyalty, and continuity of the [[Kinship#Descent and the family|family lineage]]. Ancestor veneration occurs in societies with every degree of social, political, and technological complexity, and it remains an important component of various [[religious]] practices in modern times.

==Overview==
Ancestor reverence is not the same as the [[worship]] of a [[deity]] or deities. In some Afro-diasporic cultures, ancestors are seen as being able to intercede on behalf of the living, often as messengers between humans and the gods. As spirits who were once human themselves, they are seen as being better able to understand human needs than would a divine being. In other cultures, the purpose of ancestor veneration is not to ask for favors but to do one's filial duty. Some cultures believe that their ancestors actually need to be provided for by their descendants, and their practices include offerings of food and other provisions. Others do not believe that the ancestors are even aware of what their descendants do for them, but that the expression of [[filial piety]] is what is important.

Most cultures who practice ancestor veneration do not call it "ancestor worship". In [[English language|English]], the word ''worship'' usually refers to the reverent love and [[Loyalty|devotion]] accorded a deity (god) or [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/worship |title=worship |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/learner/worship |title=worship |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/worship |title=worship |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other cultures, this act of worship does not confer any belief that the departed ancestors have become some kind of deity. Rather, the act is a way to respect, honor and look after ancestors in their afterlives as well as seek their guidance for their living descendants. In this regard, many cultures and religions have similar practices. Some may visit the graves of their parents or other ancestors, leave flowers and pray to them in order to honor and remember them, while also asking their ancestors to continue to look after them. However, this would not be considered as worshipping them since the term ''worship'' shows no such meaning.

In that sense the phrase ''ancestor veneration'' may convey a more accurate sense of what practitioners, such as the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and other [[Buddhism|Buddhist-influenced]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian-influenced]] societies, as well as the African and European cultures see themselves as doing. This is consistent with the meaning of the word ''[[veneration]]'' in English, that is great respect or reverence caused by the dignity, wisdom, or dedication of a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/venerate |title=venerate |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/veneration |title=veneration |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/veneration |title=veneration |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no generally accepted theory concerning the origins of ancestor veneration, this social phenomenon appears in some form in all human cultures documented so far. David-Barrett and Carney claim that ancestor veneration might have served a group coordination role during [[human evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it was the mechanism that led to religious representation fostering [[group cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modes of Religiosity.

==Ancient Egypt==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

Although some historians claim that ancient Egyptian society was a "death cult" because of its elaborate tombs and [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|mummification rituals]], it was the opposite.  The philosophy that "this world is but a [[vale of tears]]" and that to die and be with God is a better existence than an earthly one was relatively unknown among the ancient Egyptians.  This was not to say that they were unacquainted with the harshness of life; rather, their ethos included a sense of continuity between this life and the next.  The Egyptian people loved the culture, customs and religion of their daily lives so much that they wanted to continue them in the next—although some might hope for a better station in the Beautiful West (Egyptian afterlife).

[[Tomb]]s were housing in the Hereafter and so they were carefully constructed and decorated, just as homes for the living were.  Mummification was a way to preserve the corpse so the ''[[Ka (Egyptian soul)|ka]]'' (soul) of the deceased could return to receive offerings of the things s/he enjoyed while alive.  If mummification was not affordable, a "ka-statue" in the likeness of the deceased was carved for this purpose.  The Blessed Dead were collectively called the ''[[akh]]u'', or "shining ones" (singular: ''akh'').  They were described as "shining as gold in the belly of Nut" (Gr. [[Nuit]]) and were indeed depicted as golden stars on the roofs of many tombs and temples.

The process by which a ''ka'' became an ''akh'' was not automatic upon death; it involved a 70-day journey through the ''[[duat]]'', or Otherworld, which led to [[Divine judgment|judgment]] before Wesir (Gr. [[Osiris]]), Lord of the Dead where the ''ka’''s heart would be weighed on a scale against the Feather of [[Ma’at]] (representing Truth).  However, if the ''ka'' was not properly prepared, this journey could be fraught with dangerous pitfalls and strange demons; hence some of the earliest religious texts discovered, such as the [[Papyrus of Ani]] (commonly known as [[The Book of the Dead]]) and the [[Pyramid Texts]] were actually written as guides to help the deceased successfully navigate the ''duat''.

If the heart was in balance with the Feather of Ma'at, the ''ka'' passed judgment and was granted access to the Beautiful West as an ''akh'' who was ''ma’a heru'' ("true of voice") to dwell among the gods and other ''akhu''.  At this point only was the ''ka'' deemed worthy to be venerated by the living through rites and offerings.  Those who became lost in the ''duat'' or deliberately tried to avoid judgment became the unfortunate (and sometimes dangerous) ''mutu'', the Restless Dead.  For the few whose truly evil hearts outweighed the Feather, the goddess [[Ammit]] waited patiently behind Wesir’s judgment seat to consume them. She was a composite creature resembling three of the deadliest animals in Egypt: the crocodile, the hippopotamus and the lion. Being fed to Ammit was to be consigned to the Eternal Void, to be "unmade" as a ''ka''.

Besides being eaten by Ammit, the worst fate a ''ka'' could suffer after physical death was to be forgotten.  For this reason, ancestor veneration in [[ancient Egypt]] was an important rite of remembrance in order to keep the ''ka'' "alive" in this life as well as in the next.  Royals, nobles and the wealthy made contracts with their local [[priest]]s to perform prayers and give offerings at their tombs.  In return, the priests were allowed to keep a portion of the offerings as payment for services rendered.  Some [[Maat#Maat in Funerary Texts (The Book of Coming Forth by Day and on tomb inscriptions)|tomb inscriptions]] even invited passers-by to speak aloud the names of the deceased within (which also helped to perpetuate their memory), and to offer water, prayers or other things if they so desired.  In the private homes of the less wealthy, niches were carved into the walls for the purpose of housing images of familial ''akhu'' and to serve as altars of veneration.

Many of these same religious beliefs and ancestor veneration practices are still carried on today in the religion of [[Kemetic Orthodoxy]].

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]], like many Mediterranean societies, regarded the bodies of the dead as polluting.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, "Religious ''koine'' and Religious Dissent," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; During Rome's Classical period, the body was most often cremated, and the ashes placed in a tomb outside the city walls. Much of the month of February was devoted to purifications, propitiation, and veneration of the dead, especially at the nine-day [[Roman festivals|festival]] of the [[Parentalia]] during which a family honored its ancestors. The family visited the cemetery and shared cake and wine, both in the form of offerings to the dead and as a meal among themselves. The Parentalia drew to a close on February 21 with the more somber [[Feralia]], a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the [[Manes]], the potentially malevolent spirits of the dead who required propitiation.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, "Religious ''Koine''," p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|inscriptional phrases]] on Latin epitaphs is ''Dis Manibus'', abbreviated ''D.M,'' "for the Manes gods", which appears even on [[:File:Stele Licinia Amias Terme 67646.jpg|some Christian tombstone]]s. The [[Caristia]] on February 22 was a celebration of the family line as it continued into the present.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908),  p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[nobiles|noble Roman family]] displayed ancestral images (''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'') in the tablinium of their home ''([[domus]])''. Some sources indicate these [[Roman portraiture|portraits]] were [[Roman sculpture|busts]], while others suggest that [[death mask|funeral masks]] were also displayed. The masks, probably modeled of wax from the face of the deceased, were part of the funeral procession when an elite Roman died. Professional mourners wore the masks and regalia of the dead person's ancestors as the body was carried from the home, through the streets, and to its final resting place.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Lewis, "Imperial Autobiography, Augustus to Hadrian," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.34.1 (1993), p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

==West and Southeast African cultures==
Ancestor veneration is prevalent throughout Africa, and serves as the basis of many religions. It is often augmented by a belief in a supreme being, but prayers and/or sacrifices are usually offered to the ancestors who may ascend to becoming a kind of minor deities themselves. Ancestor veneration remains among many Africans, sometimes practiced alongside the later adopted religions of Christianity (as in Nigeria among the [[Igbo people]]), and Islam (among the different [[Mandé]] peoples and the [[Bamum people|Bamum]]) in much of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hNKkzt1ovEC&amp;pg=PA412 |chapter=Ancestors as Elders in Africa |author=Igor Kopytoff |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation |editor=[[Roy Richard Grinker]], Christopher Burghard Steiner |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-55786-686-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/fdtl/ancestors/fortes2.html Some reflections on ancestor workship in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425103859/http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/Fdtl/Ancestors/fortes2.html |date=2009-04-25 }}, Meyer Fortes, ''African Systems of Thought'', pages 122-142, [[University of Kent]].&lt;/ref&gt; In orthodox [[Serer religion]], the [[pangool]] is venerated by the [[Serer people]].

The [[Serer people|Seereer people]] of Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania who adhere to the tenets of [[Serer religion|A ƭat Roog]] (Seereer religion) believe in the veneration of the [[pangool]] (ancient Seereer saints and/or ancestral spirits). There are various types of pangool (singular: ''fangol''), each with its own means of veneration.

===Madagascar===
[[File:Famadihana reburial razana ancestor Madagascar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Famadihana]] reburial ceremony]]
Veneration of ancestors is prevalent throughout the island of [[Madagascar]]. Approximately half of the country's population of 20 million currently practice traditional religion,&lt;ref name=BGNote&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of African Affairs |title=Background Note: Madagascar |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=3 May 2011 |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61Be3ZCkK?url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |archivedate=24 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which tends to emphasize links between the living and the ''razana'' (ancestors). The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the ''[[famadihana]]'', whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere.  Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a [[hiragasy]] troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.&lt;ref name=famadihana&gt;{{cite news|last=Bearak |first=Barry |title=Dead Join the Living in a Family Celebration |newspaper=New York Times |page=A7 |date=5 September 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/world/africa/06madagascar.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64fFKK5JL?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/world/africa/06madagascar.html |archivedate=13 January 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Veneration of ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'', taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of [[zebu]] is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. Small, everyday gestures of respect include throwing the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to give the ancestors their due share.&lt;ref name=Bradtbeliefs&gt;Bradt (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Burning-money-and-yuanbao-at-the-cemetery-3249.JPG|thumb|right|Burning offerings]]
Ancestral veneration in some cultures (such as [[Culture of China|Chinese]]) (敬祖, [[pinyin]]: ''jìngzǔ''), as well as ancestor worship (拜祖, [[pinyin]]: ''bàizǔ''), seeks to honor and reminiscence the actions of the deceased; the ultimate homage to the dead. The importance of paying respect to parents (and elders) lies with the fact that all physical bodily aspects of one's being were created by one's parents, who continued to tend to one's well-being until one is on firm footings. The respect and the homage to parents, is to return this gracious deed to them in life and after, the ultimate homage. The [[Shi (personator)|''shi'']] (尸; "corpse, personator") was a [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045&amp;nbsp;BCE-256&amp;nbsp;BCE) sacrificial representative of a dead relative. During a ''shi'' ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey spiritual messages.

Sacrifices are sometimes made to altars as food for the deceased. This falls under the modes of communication with the [[Chinese spiritual world concepts]]. Some of the veneration includes visiting the deceased at their graves, and making or [[Papier-mache offering shops in Hong Kong|buying offerings]] for the deceased in the [[Chinese New Year|Spring]], [[Double Ninth Festival|Autumn]], and [[Ghost Festival]]s. Due to the hardships of the late 19th- and 20th-century China, when meat and poultry were difficult to come by, sumptuous feasts are still offered in some Asian countries as a practice to the spirits or ancestors. However, in the orthodox [[Taoist]] and Buddhist rituals, only vegetarian food would suffice.

For those with deceased in the afterlife or [[diyu|hell]], elaborate or even creative offerings, such as [[domestic worker|servants]], [[refrigerator]]s, [[house]]s, [[car]], paper money and [[shoe]]s are provided so that the deceased will be able to have these items after they have died. Often, paper versions of these objects are burned for the same purpose. Originally, real-life objects were buried with the dead. In time these goods were replaced by full size clay models which in turn were replaced by scale models, and in time today's paper offerings (including paper servants).

In [[Korea]], ancestor veneration is referred to by the generic term ''[[Jongmyo jerye|jerye]]'' (hangul: 제례; hanja: {{linktext|祭|禮}}) or ''[[jesa]]'' (hangul: 제사; hanja: {{linktext|祭|祀}}). Notable examples of ''jerye'' include ''[[Munmyo]] jerye'' and ''[[Jongmyo]] jerye'', which are performed periodically each year for venerated Confucian scholars and kings of ancient times, respectively. The ceremony held on the [[Death anniversary|anniversary]] of a family member's death is called ''charye'' (차례). It is still practiced today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VDRAah_jogMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ancestor+worship&amp;sig=7awb9V-xHxY2WXWXzxZG2vDmJf4 ''Ancestor Worship and Korean Society,'']  Roger Janelli, Dawnhee Janelli, [[Stanford University Press]], 1992. {{ISBN|0-8047-2158-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Catholics, Buddhists and nonbelievers practice ancestral rites, although Protestants do not.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Chang-Won|title=Cultural Blending in Korean Death Rites|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|date=10 June 2010|pages=12–13|isbn=978-1-4411-1749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic ban on ancestral rituals was lifted in 1939, when the [[Catholic Church]] formally recognized ancestral rites as a civil practice.&lt;ref name="park"/&gt;

Ancestral rites are typically divided into three categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bae|first=Choon Sup|date=August 2007|title=The Challenge of Ancestor Worship in Korea|publisher=University of Pretoria|url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05272008-141650/unrestricted/03chapter4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
[[File:Vietnamese Ancestors Altar.jpg|thumb|right|A Vietnamese altar for ancestors. Note smaller Buddhist altar set higher in the upper corner]]
[[File:Cung tat nien.jpg|thumb|An old man in traditional dress on the occasion of New Year offering]]
Ancestor veneration is one of the most unifying aspects of [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnamese culture]], as practically all Vietnamese, regardless of religious affiliation ([[Buddhist]] or [[Catholic]]) have an ancestor altar in their home or business.

In Vietnam, traditionally people did not celebrate birthdays (before Western influence), but the [[death anniversary]] of one's loved one was always an important occasion. Besides an essential gathering of family members for a banquet in memory of the deceased, incense sticks are burned along with [[Hell bank note|hell notes]], and great platters of food are made as offerings on the ancestor altar, which usually has pictures or plaques with the names of the deceased. In case of missing persons believed dead their family, a [[Wind tomb]] is made, an empty tomb to venerate their dead.

These offerings and practices are done frequently during important traditional or religious celebrations, the starting of a new business, or even when a family member needs guidance or counsel and is a hallmark of the emphasis Vietnamese culture places on filial duty.

A significant distinguishing feature of Vietnamese ancestor veneration is that women have traditionally been allowed to participate and co-officiate ancestral rites, unlike in Chinese Confucian doctrine, which allows only male descendants to perform such rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rambo|first=A.

==South and Southeast Asian cultures==

===Burma (Myanmar)===
Ancestor worship is no longer present in modern-day Burma (except within some ethnic minority communities), but remnants of it still exist, such as worship of [[Bo Bo Gyi]] (literally "great grandfather"), as well as of other guardian spirits such as [[nat (spirit)|nats]], all of which may be vestiges of historic ancestor worship.&lt;ref name="sad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Burma at the turn of the twenty-first century |last=Sadan |first=Mandy |editor=Monique Skidmore |year=2005 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Hawaii |isbn=978-0-8248-2897-4 |pages=90–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestor worship was present in the royal court in pre-colonial Burma. During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], solid [[gold]] images of deceased kings and their consorts were worshiped three times a year by the royal family, during the Burmese New Year (''[[Thingyan]]''), at the beginning and at the end of the [[Vassa|Buddhist lent]].&lt;ref name="harv"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=G. E.|title=History of Burma|publisher=Longmans|year=1925|pages=327–328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images were stored in the treasury and worshiped at the Zetawunzaung ({{my|ဇေတဝန်ဆောင်}}, "Hall of Ancestors"), along with a book of odes.&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt;

Some scholars attribute the disappearance of ancestor worship to the influence of [[Buddhist]] doctrines of [[anicca]] and [[anatta]], impermanence and rejection of a 'self'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spiro|first=Melford E.|title=Burmese Supernaturalism|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1978|pages=69–70|isbn=978-1-56000-882-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestors are acknowledged and honoured in [[Indian Subcontinent]] among [[Hindus]]. When a person dies, the family observes a thirteen-day mourning period, generally called ''[[śrāddha]]''. A year thence, they observe the ritual of Tarpan, in which the family makes offerings to the deceased. During these rituals, the family prepares the food items that the deceased liked and offers food to the deceased. They offer this food to crows as well on certain days as it is believed that the soul comes in the form of a bird to taste it. They are also obliged to offer ''śrāddha'', a small feast of specific preparations, to eligible [[Bramhins]]. Only after these rituals are the family members allowed to eat. It is believed that this reminds the ancestor's spirits that they are not forgotten and are loved, so it brings them peace. On Shradh days, people pray that the souls of ancestors be appeased, forget any animosity and find peace.

Each year, on the particular date (as per the [[Hindu calendar]]) when the person had died, the family members repeat this ritual.

Apart from this, there is also a fortnight-long duration each year called ''[[Pitru Paksha]]'' ("fortnight of ancestors"), when the family remembers all its ancestors and offers "Tarpan" to them. This period falls just before the [[Navratri]] or [[Durga Puja]] falling in the month of [[Ashwin]].

Me-Dam-Me-Phi &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me-Dam-Me-Phi&lt;/ref&gt; is celebrated by the Ahom people on 31 January every year in memory of the departed. It is the manifestation of the concept of ancestor worship that the Ahoms share with other peoples originating from the Tai-Shan stock. It is a festival to show respect to the departed ancestors and remember their contribution to society.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia ancestor worship has been a tradition of some of the indigenous people. [[Podom]] of the [[Toba Batak people|Toba Batak]], [[Waruga]] of the [[Minahasa]]ns and the coffins of the [[Karo people (Indonesia)]] are a few examples of the forms the veneration takes.

[[File:Anitos of Northern tribes (c. 1900, Philippines).jpg|thumb|Various [[Igorot]] ''[[bulul]]'' depicting ''[[anito]]'' or ancestor spirits (c. 1900)]]
In the [[animistic]] [[Indigenous religious beliefs of the Philippines|indigenous religions]] of the precolonial [[Philippines]], ancestor spirits were one of the two major types of spirits (''[[anito]]'') with whom [[babaylan|shamans]] communicate. Ancestor spirits were known as ''umalagad'' (lit. "guardian" or "caretaker"). They can be the spirits of actual ancestors or generalized guardian spirits of a family. Ancient Filipinos believed that upon death, the soul of a person travels (usually by boat) to a [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soul"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/|title=The Soul According to the Ethnolinguistic Groups of the Philippines|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be multiple locations in the spirit world, varying in different ethnic groups. Which place souls end up in depends on how they died, the age at death, or conduct of the person when they were alive. There was no concept of heaven or hell prior to the introduction of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]; rather, the spirit world is usually depicted as an [[underworld]] that is a mirror image of the material ("upper") world. Souls reunite with deceased relatives in the underworld and lead normal lives in the underworld as they did in the material world. In some cases, the souls of evil people undergo penance and cleansing before they are granted entrance into a particular spirit realm. Souls would eventually [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]] after a period of time in the spirit world.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="under"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/how-to-travel-the-underworld-of-philippine-mythology/|title=How to Travel the Underworld of Philippine Mythology|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K.

Souls in the spirit world still retain a degree of influence in the material world, and vice versa. ''[[Anito|Paganito]]'' rituals may be used to invoke good ancestor spirits for protection, intercession, or advice. Vengeful spirits of the dead can manifest as apparitions or ghosts (''mantiw'') and cause harm to living people. ''Paganito'' can be used to appease or banish them.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halili"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Christine N.

These were carved by the community upon a person's death. Every household had a ''taotao'' stored in a shelf in the corner of the house.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

The predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] Filipino people still hold ancestors in particular esteem&amp;mdash;though without the formality common to their neighbours&amp;mdash;despite having been Christianised since coming into contact with Spanish missionaries in 1521. In the present day, ancestor veneration is expressed in having photographs of the dead by the home altar, a common fixture in many Filipino Christian homes. Candles are often kept burning before the photographs, which are sometimes decorated with garlands of fresh [[Jasminum sambac|sampaguita]], the national flower. Ancestors, particularly dead parents, are still regarded as psychopomps, as a dying person is said to be brought to the afterlife ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''sundô'', "fetch") by the spirits of dead relatives. It is said that when the dying call out the names of deceased loved ones, they can see the spirits of those particular people waiting at the foot of the deathbed.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Filipino Catholic and [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente|Aglipayan]] veneration of the dead finds its greatest expression in the Philippines is the Hallowmas season between 31 October and 2 November, variously called ''Undás'' (based on the word for "[the] first", the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''andas'' or possibly ''honra''), ''Todos los Santos'' (literally "[[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]"), and sometimes ''Áraw ng mga Patáy'' (lit. "Day of the Dead"), which refers to the following solemnity of [[All Souls' Day]]. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead, cleaning and repairing their tombs. Common offerings are prayers, flowers, candles, and even food, while many also spend the remainder of the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the graveyard, playing games and music or singing.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[Chinese Filipinos]], meanwhile, have the most apparent and distinct customs related to ancestor veneration, carried over from traditional Chinese religion and most often melded with their current Catholic faith. Many still burn incense and [[joss paper|kim]] at family tombs and before photos at home, while they incorporate Chinese practises into Masses held during the All Souls' Day period.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, making offerings to one's ancestors is conducted on the sixth day after death as a part of traditional Sri Lankan funeral rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=MDO_7BncqKwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Studying Buddhism in Practice|first=John S.|last=Harding|date=17 June 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thailand ===

{{anchor|faun phii}}In rural northern [[Thailand]], a religious ceremony honoring ancestral spirits known as ''faun phii'' ("spirit dance" or "ghost dance") takes place. It includes offerings for ancestors with spirit mediums sword fighting, spirit-possessed dancing, and spirit mediums [[cock fighting]] in a spiritual [[Cockfight (Sacred)|cockfight]].&lt;ref&gt;Marti Patel, "[http://sanuksanuk.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/trance-dancing-and-spirit-possession-in-northern-thailand/ Trance Dancing and Spirit Possession in Northern Thailand]", 19 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==European cultures==
[[Image:Spanish Cemetery.jpg|right|thumb|A scenic [[cemetery]] in rural [[Spain]].]]

In Catholic countries in Europe (continued later with the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church in England]]), November 1 ([[All Saints' Day]]), became known and is still known as the day to honor those who have died, and who have been deemed official saints by the Church. November 2, ([[All Souls Day]]), or "The Day of the Dead", is the day when all of the faithful dead are remembered. On that day, families go to cemeteries to light candles for their dead relatives, leave them flowers, and often to picnic. The evening before All Saints'—"All Hallows Eve" or "Hallowe'en"—is unofficially the Catholic day to remember the realities of Hell, to mourn the souls lost to evil, and to remember ways to avoid Hell {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. It is commonly celebrated in the United States and parts of the United Kingdom in a spirit of light-hearted horror and fear, which is marked by the recounting of [[ghost stories]], [[bonfire]]s, wearing [[Halloween costume|costumes]], carving [[jack-o'-lanterns]], and "[[trick-or-treating]]" (going door to door and begging for candy).

===Brythonic Celtic cultures===

In [[Cornwall]] and [[Wales]], the autumn ancestor festivals occur around Nov. 1. In Cornwall the festival is known as ''[[Allantide|Kalan Gwav]]'', and in Wales as ''[[Calan Gaeaf]].''&lt;ref name=Davies1&gt;Davies, John; Jenkins, Nigel (2008). The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1953-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The festivals bear some similarities to the better-known Gaelic festival of [[Samhain]], from which modern [[Halloween]] is derived.&lt;ref name=Davies1 /&gt;

===Gaelic Celtic cultures===

During ''[[Samhain]]'', November 1 in [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], the dead are thought to return to the world of the living, and offerings of [[food]] and [[light]] are left for them.&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;McNeill, F. Marian (1961, 1990) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol. 3. William MacLellan, Glasgow {{ISBN|0-948474-04-1}} pp.11-46&lt;/ref&gt; On the festival day, ancient people would extinguish the hearth fires in their homes, participate in a community bonfire festival, and then carry a flame home from the communal fire and use it light their home fires anew.&lt;ref name="O'Driscoll"&gt;O'Driscoll, Robert (ed.)

(ed) ''Manx Ballads &amp; Music'' (1896) G &amp; R Johnson, Douglas.&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

Native cultures of the original inhabitants of North America honored the dead with various traditional ceremonies, including food offerings and prayers.

In the United States and Canada, flowers, wreaths, grave decorations and sometimes candles or even small pebbles are put on graves year-round as a way to honor the dead. In the United States, many people honor deceased loved ones who were in the military on [[Memorial Day|Decoration Day also known as Memorial Day]]. Times like Easter, Christmas, [[Candlemas]], and [[All Souls' Day]] are also special days in which the relatives and friends of the deceased gather to honor them with flowers and candles. In the [[Catholic Church]], one's local parish church often offers prayers for the dead on their death anniversary or on special days like [[All Souls' Day]].

Another important holiday in the United States, [[Memorial Day]], is a Federal holiday for remembering the men and women who served in the nation's military that are now deceased; particularly those who died  in war or during active service. In the 147 [[United States National Cemetery System|national cemeteries]], like [[Arlington National Cemetery|Arlington]] and [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Gettysburg]], it is common for volunteers to place small [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] at each grave. Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday in May, allotting for a 3 day weekend in which many memorial services and parades take place not only across the country, but in 26 [[American Battle Monuments Commission|American cemeteries on foreign soil]]; in the countries of France, Belgium, United Kingdom. Philippines, Panama, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, and Tunisia. It is also common practice among veterans to memorialize fallen service members on the dates of their death. That practice is also common in other countries when remembering Americans who died in battles to liberate their towns in the [[World war|World Wars]]. One example of this is on 16 August (1944) [[Welborn Griffith|Colonel Griffith]], died of wounds from enemy action sustained in [[Lèves]], the same day he is credited with saving [[Chartres Cathedral]] from destruction.

Many [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] celebrate ''[[Dia de los Muertos]]'' (Day of the Dead) on or around All Saints' Day (November 1), this being a mix of a native [[Mesoamerican]] celebration and an imported European holiday. ''[[Ofrenda]]s'' (altars) are set up, with ''[[calavera]]s'' (sugar skulls), photographs of departed loved ones, marigold flowers, candles, and more.

In Judaism, when a grave site is visited, a small pebble is placed on the headstone. While there is no clear answer as to why, this custom of leaving pebbles may date back to biblical days when individuals were buried under piles of stones. Today, they are left as tokens that people have been there to visit and to remember.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orchadash-tucson.org/rabbi-mourning-customs.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721132054/http://www.orchadash-tucson.org/rabbi-mourning-customs.html |date=July 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans of various religions and cultures may build a shrine in their home dedicated to loved ones who have died, with pictures of their ancestors, flowers and mementos. Increasingly, many roadside shrines may be seen for deceased relatives who died in car accidents or were killed on that spot, sometimes financed by the state or province as these markers serve as potent reminders to drive cautiously in hazardous areas. The [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., is particularly known for the leaving of offerings to the deceased; items left are collected by the [[National Park Service]] and archived. Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] [[Baptism for the dead#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|perform posthumous baptisms]] and other rituals for their dead ancestors, along with those of other families, with the permission of their descendants.

==Islam==
Islam has a complex and mixed view on the idea of grave shrines and ancestor worship.  The graves of many early Islamic figures are holy sites for Muslims, including [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Mohammed]], [[Imam Ali Mosque|Ali]], and a [[Al-Baqi'|cemetery]] with many companions and early caliphs.  Many other mausoleums are major architectural, political, and cultural sites, including the [[Mazar-e-Quaid|National Mausoleum]] in Pakistan and the [[Taj Mahal]] in India. However, the religious movement of [[Wahhabism]] views this veneration of graves as a form of [[shirk (Islam)|idolatry]].  Followers of this movement have destroyed many gravesite shrines, including in [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia#Destroyed sites|Saudi Arabia]] and in territory controlled by the [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL#Mosques and shrines|Islamic State]].

'''Viral dynamics''' is a field of [[applied mathematics]] concerned with describing the progression of viral infections within a host organism.&lt;ref name="VDbook" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Nowak |first1=Martin |last2=May |first2=Robert |date=2001 |title=Virus Dynamics: mathematical principles of immunology and virology | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Kixhc3IiCy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=virus+dynamics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9yXeVIHfH4a8yQTipIGYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=virus%20dynamics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs a family of [[mathematical model]]s that describe changes over time in the populations of cells targeted by the virus and the [[viral load]]. These equations may also track competition between different viral strains and the influence of immune responses. The original viral dynamics models were inspired by compartmental [[epidemic model]]s (e.g. the SI model), with which they continue to share many common mathematical features, such as the concept of the [[basic reproduction number|basic reproductive ratio]] (''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). The major distinction between these fields is in the scale at which the models operate: while epidemiological models track the spread of infection between individuals within a population (i.e. "between host"), viral dynamics models track the spread of infection between cells within an individual (i.e. "within host"). Analyses employing viral dynamic models have been used extensively to study [[HIV]],&lt;ref name="VDbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perelson|first1=Alan S|last2=Ribeiro|first2=Ruy M|title=Modeling the within-host dynamics of HIV infection|journal=BMC Biology|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|page=96|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-11-96|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/11/96/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hepatitis B virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=MA|last2=Bonhoeffer|first2=S|last3=Hill|first3=AM|last4=Boehme|first4=R|last5=Thomas|first5=HC|last6=McDade|first6=H|title=Viral dynamics in hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1996|volume=93|pages=4398–4402| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/93/9/4398.short|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.9.4398|pmc=39549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciupe|first1=SM|last2=Ribeiro|first2=RM|last3=Nelson|first3=PW|last4=Perelson|first4=AS|title=Modeling the mechanisms of acute hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=2007|volume=247|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.02.017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519307000938|pmc=1994818}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hepatitis C virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=A|last2=Lam|first2=NP|last3=Dahari|first3=H|last4=Gretch|first4=DR|last5=Wiley|first5=TE|last6=Layden|first6=TJ|last7=Perelson|first7=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Dynamics in Vivo and the Antiviral Efficacy of Interferon-α Therapy|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=282|issue=5386|pages=103–107|doi=10.1126/science.282.5386.103|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5386/103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chatterjee|first1=A|last2=Smith|first2=PF|last3=Perelson|first3=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Kinetics: The Past, Present, and Future|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|date=2013|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.cld.2012.09.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089326112000992|pmc=3584572}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other infections

'''Water resource policy''' encompasses the policy-making processes that affect the collection, preparation, use and disposal of water to support human uses and protect [[environmental quality]].

Water policy addresses provision, use, disposal and sustainability decisions. Provision includes identification, access, preparation for use and distribution. Uses include direct human consumption, agriculture, industry and ecosystem protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ecolex.org/ecolex/ledge/view/RecordDetails;document_Law%20on%20Water%20Resources%20Development%20(Law%20No.%2011%20of%201974)..html?DIDPFDSIjsessionid=7DA28E1500FB24F295BD6F41E7070924?id=LEX-FAOC001336&amp;index=documents|title= Law on Water Resources Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy must set the rules for how water is allocated to the different uses. Disposal involves [[wastewater treatment]] and stormwater/flood management. Sustainability addresses issues such as aquifer depletion, reservoir management and mineral buildup.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Supply isn't just about water production, it is also about distribution infrastructure."&lt;ref name=Takadu/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second dimension of issues addresses how policies are created, executed and amended. Since water resources often cross political boundaries, water policies must often be negotiated among multiple political entities (nations, states, etc.) Commentators such as Halcrow project [[resource war]]s as demand continues to increase.&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;{{rp|27}}

Policy makers typically adopt a set of best management practices BMPs to govern water management. BMPs cover everything from dam construction to wastewater treatment protocols.

Water resource policies may encompass &lt;blockquote&gt;"regions, catchments, shared or transboundary water resources, and inter-basin transfers. Policy leads management practices, but best management practices are identified, evaluated, modified and disseminated by policy making bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gwptoolbox.org/index.php?option=com_tool&amp;id=1|title= IWRM Toolbox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Water resource policy issues are receiving increased attention&lt;ref name=Halcrow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurewecreate.com/includes/0614Global+Water+Security+PSC+19+Oct+rev1.pdf|title=Global Citizenship - Dow|website=www.futurewecreate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as water shortages are believed to be at crisis levels in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.gwp.org/Global/The%20Challenge/Resource%20material/IWRM%20at%20a%20glance.pdf|title= Integrated Water Resources Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regional crises have the potential worldwide implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.voanews.com/content/fight-for-water-hits-crisis-levels-worldwide-118423974/136882.html|title= Fight for Water Hits Crisis Levels Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnc-cc-eeaa-eg.com/Pics/dwnld396.pdf|title=GLOBAL WATER OUTLOOK TO 2025|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations such as the Global Water Policy Project have sprung up to promote awareness and prod governments and NGOs into heightened awareness of the problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.globalwaterpolicy.org|title= Global Water Policy Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global water resource policy objectives ==

According to the World Water Assessment Programme, a UN-sanctioned Task Force, the objectives for global water resource policies include developing a standardized method for monitoring water sector progress and performance, improving reporting and identifying priority actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwater.org/downloads/TFIMR_FinalReport.pdf|title=Monitoring progress in the water sector: A selected set of indicators }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all nations conflict between users are expected to intensify, complicating policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/natres/water/2001/1001fpol.htm|title=Dehydrating Conflict|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.globalpolicy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional participants ==

=== Multilateral ===
{{Main article|UN-Water}}

The 1977 Mar del Plata United Nations Conference on Water was the first intergovernmental water conference, leading to the 1980 Declaration of the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id=92|title= Giving an audible voice to water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Environmental Program]] hosts water resource policy-making agencies and disseminating BMPs worldwide. This role has been enhanced by various policy directives and other initiatives:

* UN General Assembly Resolution 3436 (XXX) Agenda 21
* 1997 Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP and
* 2000 Malmö Ministerial Declaration adopted at the First Global Ministerial Environment Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.unep.org/law/|title=  Division of Environmental Law and Conventions}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2002 Earth Summit 2015 safe drinking water targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/globalassess/en/ |title=Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 Report |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2007 World Bank report series on Environment and Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWAT/Resources/Env_Flows_Water_v1.pdf|title=World Bank-Series on Environment and Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in 2009 reported on Environmental Flows in Water Resources Policies, Plans, and Projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWAT/Resources/Env_Flows_Water_v1.pdf|title=Environmental Flows in Water Resources Policies, Plans, and Projects-World Bank-Series on Environment and Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilateral ===

Treaties between nations may enumerate policies, rights and responsibilities. For instance, a treaty between Poland and Germany, "An Agreement to establish cooperation on water resources management" provides:

* supply of drinking water of good quality,
* protection of surface water,
* supply of water to agriculture,
* fight against water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.ecolex.org/ecolex/ledge/view/RecordDetails;document_Agreement%20between%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany%20and%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland%20on%20cooperation%20on%20water%20resource%20management.html|title= Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Poland on cooperation on water resource management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permanent Court of International Justice adjudicates disputes between nations, including water rights litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecolex.org/server2.php/libcat/docs/TRE/Full/Other/TRE-151959.doc|title=Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Poland on cooperation on water resource management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NGOs ===

Some non-governmental organizations have consultative status at the UN. One such group is the [[World Water Council]], an "international multi-stakeholder platform" established in 1996 to act "at all levels, including the highest decision-making level...[in] protection, development, planning, management and use of water in all its dimensions...for the benefit of all life on earth." It was an outgrowth of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Dublin and at the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]]. The Council is based in Marseilles.&lt;ref name="WWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/about-us/vision-mission-strategy/ |title=Vision, Mission, Strategy |publisher=World Water Council |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its multi-stakeholder basis as due to the fact that "authority for managing the world's fresh water resources is fragmented amongst the world's nations, hundreds of thousands of local governments, and countless non-governmental and private organizations, as well as a large number of international bodies."

In 1994, the [[International Water Resources Association]] (IWRA) organized a special session on the topic in its Eighth World Water Congress held in Cairo in November 1994, leading to creation of the World Water Council.&lt;ref name="WWC"/&gt;

=== Business water resource policy initiatives ===

The [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] engages stakeholders in H2OScenarios&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTk5Nzc|title=H2OScenarios|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that consider various alternative policies and their effects.

In June 2011 in Geneva, the Future of Water Virtual Conference addressed water resource sustainability. Issues raised included: water infrastructure monitoring,&lt;ref name=Takadu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurewecreate.com/includes/0615Water_Price_Innovation_Scarcity_TaKaDu.pdf|title=Global Citizenship - Dow|website=www.futurewecreate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; global water security, potential resource wars, interaction between water, energy, food and economic activity, the "true value" of "distribution portions of available water" and a putative "investment gap" in water infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.futurewecreate.com/|title= The Future of Science Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was asserted that climate change will affect scarcity of water but the water security presentation emphasized that a combined effect with population growth "could be devastating".&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt; Identified corporate water related risks include physical supply, regulatory and product reputation.&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;{{rp|23}}

This forum indicated policy concerns with:

* trade barriers
* price supports
* treatment of water as a [[free good]] creates underpricing of 98% of water&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;{{rp|2}}
* need to intensify debate
* need to harmonize public/private sectors&lt;ref name=Halcrow/&gt;{{rp|28}}

== Structural constraints on policy makers ==

Policies are implemented by organizational entities created by government exercise of state power. However, all such entities are subject to constraints upon their autonomy.&lt;ref name="Poulantzas1978"&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicos Ar |last=Poulantzas|title=Political Power and Social Classes|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EI9LcAAACAAJ}}|year=1978|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-8052-7050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisdictional issues ===

Subject matter and geographic jurisdiction are distinguishable.&lt;ref name="Black1999"&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry Campbell |last=Black|title=Black's Law Dictionary|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wKcCngEACAAJ}}|year=1999|publisher=West Group|isbn=978-0-314-22864-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jurisdiction of any water agency is limited by political boundaries and by enabling legislation.

In some cases, limits target specific types of uses (wilderness, agricultural, urban-residential, urban-commercial, etc.)

A second part of jurisdictional limitation governs the subject matter that the agency controls, such as flood control, water supply and sanitation, etc.

In many locations, agencies may face unclear or overlapping authority, increasing conflicts and delaying conflict resolution. For instance, recent changes in California law intended to reduce air quality problems from shipping have been interfered with by Federal legal changes intended to reduce the cost of shipping.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santabarbaraindependent.com {{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== California water regulatory bodies ====

* Coastal Conservancy
* Department of Fish &amp; Game
* Department of Water Resources
* Environmental Resources Evaluation System (CERES)
* Ocean and Coastal Environmental Access Network (OCEAN)
* Resources Agency Wetlands Information System
* State Water Resources Control Board&lt;ref name="swrcb"&gt;State Water Resources Control Board ''Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California'' (1974) State of California&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hans Middendorp|title=Dr. Ir. Hans Middendorp Auteur Hans Middendorp - Nietbangvoorwater.info ®|url=https://nietbangvoorwater.info/|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=Niet bang voor water|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public Health Departments 
* Water districts

==== Typical information access issue ====

As reported by the non-partisan [[Civil Society Institute]], a 2005 US Congressional study on water supply was suppressed and became the target of a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/062311release.cfm |title=Foia Lawsuit Targets U.S. Department Of Energy For Withholding 'Water Energy Roadmap' Ordered By Congress |publisher=Civilsocietyinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Flood control ===

Water can produce a natural disaster in the form of [[tsunami]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[rogue wave]]s and [[storm surge]]. Land-based floods can originate from bursting dams, rivers overflowing their banks or levee failure.

==== Multi-jurisdictional issues ====

One jurisdiction's projects may cause problems in other jurisdictions. For instance, [[Monterey County, California]] controls a body of water that acts as a reservoir for [[San Luis Obispo County]]. The specific responsibilities for managing the resource must therefore be negotiated.

=== Freshwater ===

==== Surface and groundwater ====

Surface water and groundwater can be studied and managed as separate resources as a single resource in multiple forms.&lt;ref name="circ1139"&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS). Denver, CO. [http://pubs.water.usgs.gov/circ1139/ "Ground Water and Surface Water: A Single Resource."] USGS Circular 1139. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisdictions typically distinguish three recognized groundwater classifications: subterranean streams, underflow of surface waters, and percolating groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/nstc/WaterLaws/california.html |accessdate=June 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051911/http://www.blm.gov/nstc/WaterLaws/california.html |archivedate=June 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Constituencies ====

Drinking water and water for utilitarian uses such as washing, crop cultivation and manufacture is competed for by various constituencies:

* Residential
* Agriculture. "Many rural people practice subsistence rain fed agriculture as a basic livelihood strategy, and as such are vulnerable to the effects of drought or flood that can diminish or destroy a harvest. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=16th Conference on Climate Variability and Change |title=Evaluation of the Use of Forecast Interpretations information|first=Diego H. |last=Pedreros |location=[[University of California Santa Barbara]] |url=https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2005/techprogram/paper_87610.htm}} {{cite web |first1= A. |last1=Bonilla |first2=P. |last2=Ramirez |first3=C. |last3=Funk |first4=G. |last4=Husak |first5=J. |last6=Michaelsen |first7=L. |last7=Aguilar |title=Climate Predictions on Seasonal and Interannual Time Scales: |url=https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2005/techprogram/session_17755.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Construction
* Industrial
* Municipal or institutional activities

=== Seawater ===

[[Seawater]] resources are important for ethical-aesthetic reasons, recreation, tourism, maintenance of fisheries. The sea is a venue for shipping and for oil and mineral extraction that creates a need for regulatory policy. A variety of issues confronts policy makers.

==== Pollution ====

[[Ballast water]], fuel/oil leaks and trash originating from ships foul harbors, reefs and estuaries. Ballast water may contain toxins, invasive plants, animals, viruses, and bacteria.

Oil rigs and undersea mineral extraction can create problems that affect shorelines, marine life, fisheries and human safety. Decommissioning of such operations has another set of issues. [[Rigs-to-reefs]] is a proposal for using obsolete oil rigs as substrate for [[coral reef]]s that has failed to reach consensus.

=== Surface water (runoff) and wastewater discharge ===

Regulatory bodies address piped waste water discharges to surface water that include riparian and ocean ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/waterboards_map.shtml|title= State and Regional Water Boards}}&lt;/ref&gt; These review bodies are charged with protecting wilderness ecology, wildlife habitat, drinking water, agricultural irrigation and fisheries. Stormwater discharge can carry fertilizer residue and bacterial contamination from domestic and wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/ciwqs/who_is_regulated.shtml|title= Whom We Regulate}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have the authority to make orders which are binding upon private actors such as international corporations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_17612147|title= Water quality board orders Shell to clean soil at Carousel tract in Carson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not hesitate to exercise the police powers of the state.  Water agencies have statutory mandate which in many hurisdictions is resilient to pressure from constituents and lawmakers in which they on occasion stand their ground despite heated opposition from agricultural interests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.montereyherald.com/local/ci_18314090?nclick_check=1|title=  California water rules rile farmers}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Boards enjoy strong support from environmental concerns such as Greenpeace,Heal the Ocean and Channelkeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.facebook.com/notes/heal-the-ocean/hilary-spoke-to-regional-water-quality-control-board-today/10150089482817928|title=  Hilary Spoke To Regional Water Quality Control Board Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water quality issues or sanitation concerns reuse or water recycling and pollution control which in turn breaks out into stormwater and wastewater.

=== Stormwater runoff ===

Surface runoff is water that flows when heavy rains do not infiltrate soil; excess water from rain, meltwater, or other sources flowing over the land.  This is a major component of the water cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Horton, ''The Horton Papers'' (1933)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hyp.5740 | title=Robert E. Horton's perceptual model of infiltration processes | journal=Hydrological Processes | date=2004 | volume=18 | issue=17 | pages=3447–3460 | first=Keith | last=Beven}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff that occurs on surfaces before reaching a [[Channel (geography)|channel]] is also called a [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]]. When runoff flows along the ground, it can pick up [[Soil contamination|soil contaminants]] including, but not limited to petroleum, pesticides, or fertilizers that become [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] or nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref name="DavisMasten2013"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mackenzie |last1=Davis|first2=Susan |last2=Masten|title=Principles of Environmental Engineering Science: Third Edition|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mXQgAAAAQBAJ}}|date=22 February 2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=978-0-07-749219-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/instream_flows/docs/not_wdm070111.pdf |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232426/http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/instream_flows/docs/not_wdm070111.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wastewater ===
{{Main article|Wastewater}}

Wastewater is water that has been discharged from human use. The primary discharges flow from the following sources:

* residences
* commercial properties
* industry
* agriculture

[[Sewage]] is technically wastewater contaminated with fecal and similar animal waste byproducts, but is frequently used as a synonym for wastewater. Origination includes [[cesspool]] and sewage outfall pipes.

Water treatment is subject to the same overlapping jurisdictional constraints which affect other aspects of water policy.&lt;ref name="Poulantzas1978"/&gt; For instance, levels of [[chloramine]]s with their resulting toxic [[trihalomethane]] by-product are subject to Federal guidelines even though water management implementing those policy constraints are carried out by local water boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccwa.com/chloramines.htm |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125234751/http://www.ccwa.com/chloramines.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
