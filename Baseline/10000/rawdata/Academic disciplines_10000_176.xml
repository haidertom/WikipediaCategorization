'''''A Time for Singing''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]], lyrics by [[Gerald Freedman]] and John Morris, and a book by Freedman and Morris. The work was based on [[Richard Llewellyn]]'s novel of a Welsh mining village, ''[[How Green Was My Valley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gilvey, John Anthony. ''Before the Parade Passes By: Gower Champion and the Glorious American Musical.'' Page 155. St. Martin's Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The show takes place in the memory of Protestant minister David Griffith, recalling conflict within the Morgan family over the possible formation of a miners' union within the village, and the romance between Griffith himself and Angharad of the Morgans, who ultimately marries the mine owner instead.
The show starred [[Ivor Emmanuel]] (as David Griffith), [[Tessie O'Shea]], [[Shani Wallis]] and [[Laurence Naismith]]. 

The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production began a series of ten previews at [[The Broadway Theatre]] on May 12, 1966, and opened officially on May 21, 1966, running for a total of only 41 performances. It closed on June 25, 1966.

An [[Alexander H. Cohen]] production, it has been called "probably the best musical he ever produced."&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum"/&gt; Cohen used an "extravagant publicity machine" to bring attention to the show, with the first 100 ticket buyers receiving "folding chairs and a picnic lunch catered by the Brasserie restaurant."&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum"/&gt; 
Ken Mandelbaum argued that ''A Time for Singing'' pointed the way to later grand musicals like ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' and ''[[Grand Hotel (musical)|Grand Hotel]]'' in both its staging and its music, which was "richer and more serious" than other shows of the period, with a "cinematic fluidity and continuous movement" that later became common in 1980s musicals.&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum"&gt;Mandelbaum, Ken. ''Not Since Carrie: Forty Years of Broadway Musical Flops.'' Pages 298-299. St. Martin's Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatre Historian [[Gerald Bordman]], however, acknowledged the musical's "fine choral singing" but stated that 
the music the singers were given was drab and did little to enhance the grim story of the Morgan family's tribulations".&lt;ref&gt;Bordman, Gerald (2001). ''American Musical Theater: A Chronicle''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513074-X}}, p. 705&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bing Crosby]] recorded two songs from ''A Time for Singing'' for [[Reprise Records]] on May 9, 1966, with the [[John_Keating_(musician)|Johnny Keating]] Orchestra and Chorus: "Far From Home" and "How Green Was My Valley." They were released as a single.&lt;ref name="Crosby"&gt;Bing Crosby Discography. http://www.jazzdiscography.com/Artists/Crosby/crosby1c.html&lt;/ref&gt; Stereo versions of the songs were released in 2010.&lt;ref name="Crosby2"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/So-Rare-Treasures-Crosby-Archive/dp/B003FXXNTE&lt;/ref&gt; A remastered CD of the original Broadway cast recording was issued in a limited edition by producer Bruce Kimmel on his Kritzerland label on April 3, 2013.

&lt;/ref&gt; on affective haptics and real-time communication system with rich emotional and haptic channels. Driven by the motivation to enhance social interactivity and emotionally immersive experience of users of real-time messaging, virtual, augmented realities, the idea of reinforcing (intensifying) own feelings and reproducing (simulating) the emotions felt by the partner was proposed.
Four basic haptic (tactile) channels governing our emotions can be distinguished: (1) physiological changes (e.g., heart beat rate, body temperature, etc.), (2) physical stimulation (e.g., tickling), (3) social touch (e.g., hug, handshake), (4) emotional haptic design (e.g., shape of device, material, texture).

&lt;/ref&gt; the conscious experience of emotion occurs after the cortex receives signals about changes in physiological state. Researchers argued that feelings are preceded by certain physiological changes. Thus, when we see a venomous snake, we feel fear, because our cortex has received signals about our racing heart, knocking knees, etc. Damasio&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes primary and secondary emotions. Both involve changes in bodily states, but the secondary emotions are evoked by thoughts. Recent empirical studies support non-cognitive theories of nature of emotions. It was proven that we can easily evoke our emotions by something as simple as changing facial expression (e.g., smile brings on a feeling of happiness).&lt;ref&gt;

== Sense of touch in affective haptics ==

Human emotions can be easily evoked by different cues, and the sense of touch is one of the most emotionally charged channels. Affective haptic devices produce different senses of touch including kinesthetic and coetaneous channels. Kinesthetic stimulations, which are produced by forces exerted on the body, are sensed by mechanoreceptors in the tendons and muscles. On the other hand, mechanoreceptors in the skin layers are responsible for the perception of cutaneous stimulation. Different types of tactile corpuscles allow us sensing thermal property of the object, pressure, vibration frequency, and stimuli location.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Of the forms of physical contact, hugging is particularly emotionally charged; it conveys warmth, love, and affiliation. Recently, researchers have made several attempts to create a hugging device providing some sense of physical co-presence over a distance.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; key feature is that it physically reproduces the human-hug pattern, generating pressure simultaneously on each user’s chest and back. The idea to realistically reproduce hugging is in integration of active-haptic device HaptiHug and pseudo-haptic touch simulated by hugging animation. Thus, high immersion into the physical contact of partners while hugging is achieved.

=== Intimate touch ===
Affection goes further than hugging alone. People in long distance relationships are faced with a lack of physical intimacy on a day-to-day basis. Haptic technology allows for kinesthetic and tactile interface design. The field of digital co-presence envelops Teledildonics as well. The Kiiroo SVir is a good example of an Adult CyberToy that incorporates tactile input, by means of a surface that is touch capacitive, and an inside that is kinesthetic in nature. 12 rings contract, pulse and vibrate according to the movements one's partner makes in real time. The SVir mimics the actual motion of its OPue counterpart and is also compatible with other SVir models.
The SVir enables women to have intercourse with their partner through use of the OPue interactive vibrator no matter how great the distance that separates the couple.

=== Implicit emotion elicitation ===
Different types of devices can be used to produce the physiological changes. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The heart imitator HaptiHeart&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; produces special heartbeat patterns according to emotion to be conveyed or elicited (sadness is associated with slightly intense heartbeat, anger with quick and violent heartbeat, fear with intense heart rate). False heart beat feedback can be directly interpreted as a real heart beat, so it can change the emotional perception. HaptiButterfly&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; reproduces “butterflies in your stomach” (the fluttery or tickling feeling felt by people experiencing love) through arrays of vibration motors attached to the user’s abdomen. HaptiShiver&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “shivers up and down your spine” through a row of vibration motors. HaptiTemper&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “chills up and down your spine” through both cold airflow from a fan and the cold side of a Peltier element. HaptiTemper is also intended for simulation of warmth on the human skin to evoke either pleasant feeling or aggression

=== Explicit emotion elicitation ===
HaptiTickler&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; directly evokes joy by tickling the user’s ribs. It includes four vibration motors reproducing stimuli similar to human finger movements

=== Affective (emotional) haptic design. ===
Recent findings show that attractive things make people feel good, which in turn makes them think more creatively.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of emotional haptic design was proposed.&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; The core idea is to make user to feel an affinity for the device through:
* appealing shapes evoking the desire to touch and haptically explore them,
* material pleasurable to touch, and
* the anticipation of the pleasure of wearing the device.

=== Affective computing ===
[[Affective computing]] can be used to measure and to recognize emotional information in systems and devises employing affective haptics. Emotional information is extracted by using such techniques as speech recognition, natural language processing, facial expression detection, and measurement of physiological data.

== Potential applications ==
[[Image:iFeelIM.png|thumb|400px | The iFeel_IM! architecture]]
Possible applications are as follows:
* treating depression and anxiety (problematic emotional states),
* controlling and modulating moods on the basis of physiological signals,
* affective and collaborative games,
* psychological testing,
* assistive technology and augmentative communication systems for children with autism.
Affective Haptics is in the vanguard of emotional telepresence,&lt;ref&gt;

== Application examples ==
[[Image:EmoHeart.png|thumb|EmoHeart object on the avatars’ chest vividly and expressively represents the communicated emotions]]
The philosophy behind the iFeel_IM! (intelligent system for Feeling enhancement powered by affect sensitive Instant Messenger) is “I feel [therefore] I am!”. In the iFeel_IM! system, great importance is placed on the automatic sensing of emotions conveyed through textual messages in 3D virtual world Second Life (artificial intelligence), the visualization of the detected emotions by avatars in virtual environment, enhancement of user’s affective state, and reproduction of feeling of social touch (e.g., hug) by means of haptic stimulation in a real world. The control of the conversation is implemented through the Second Life object called EmoHeart&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; developed two tactile systems (i.e. mobile phone based and chair based) which could render human facial expression for visually impaired persons. These systems conveyed human emotions to visually impaired persons using vibrotactile stimuli.

To produce movie-specific tactile stimuli influencing the viewer’s emotions to the viewer’s body, the wearable tactile jacket was developed by Philips researchers.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Alluvium''' (from the [[Latin]] ''alluvius'', from ''alluere'', "to wash against") is loose, unconsolidated (not cemented together into a solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]]) [[soil]] or [[sediment]] that has been [[Erosion|eroded]], reshaped by water in some form, and redeposited in a non-[[marine (ocean)|marine]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110501155938/http://www.geotech.org/survey/geotech/dictiona.html Glossary of Geological Terms]. Geotech.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/dictionary/glossary-a.shtml Geology Dictionary – Alluvial, Aquiclude, Arkose]. Geology.Com. Retrieved on 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Alluvium is typically made up of a variety of materials, including fine particles of [[silt]] and [[clay]] and larger particles of [[sand]] and [[gravel]].  When this loose alluvial material is deposited or cemented into a [[Lithology|lithological]] unit, or [[Lithification|lithified]], it is called an '''alluvial deposit'''.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Chisholm, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The term "alluvium" is not typically used in situations where the formation of the sediment can clearly be attributed to another geologic process that is well described.  This includes (but is not limited to): lake sediments ([[Lake|lacustrine]]), river sediments ([[fluvial]]), or glacially-derived sediments ([[glacial till]]).  Sediments that are formed or deposited in a perennial stream or [[river]] are typically not referred to as alluvial.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Age==
Most alluvium is geologically [[Quaternary]] in age, and is often referred to as "cover" because these sediments obscure the underlying [[bedrock]].  Most sedimentary material that fills a [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] ("basin fill") that is not lithified is typically lumped together as "alluvial".&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Alluvium of [[Pliocene]] age occurs, for example, in parts of Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ames | first = Dan | contribution = Formation of the Soils | year = 1998 | title = Soil Survey of Jerome County and Part of Twin Falls County, Idaho | pages = 238 | publisher = Natural Resources Conservation Service, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] | contribution-url = https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MANUSCRIPTS/idaho/ID704/0/id704_text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alluvium of late [[Miocene]] age occurs, for example, in the valley of the [[San Joaquin River]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1197/report.pdf | title=Amount and Timing of Late Cenozoic Uplift and Tilt of the Central Sierra Nevada, California—Evidence from the Upper San Joaquin River Basin (USGS Professional Paper 1197) | publisher=[[USGS]] | author=Huber, N. King | year=1981 | location=Washington D.C. | pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ores==
Alluvium can contain valuable [[ore]]s such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]] and a wide variety of [[gemstone]]s. Such a concentration of valuable ores is termed a [[placer deposit]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

[[Christianity]] has not generally practised [[aniconism]], or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images, but has had an [[Christian art|active tradition of making and venerating images]] of [[God in Christianity|God]] and other religious figures. However, there are periods of aniconism in [[History of Christianity|Christian history]], notably during the controversy of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] of the 8th century, and following the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century, when [[Calvinism]] in particular rejected all images in churches, and this practice continues today in Reformed (Calvinist) churches, as well as some forms of [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christianity]]. The [[Catholic Church]] has always defended the use of sacred images in churches, shrines, and homes, encouraging their [[dulia|veneration]] but condemning anyone who would [[latria|worship]] them as if they were gods themselves. 

The use of religious icons and images continues to be advocated at the highest level by religious leaders of major Christian denominations such as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Catholicism|Catholics]].&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCGB2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilliams83/&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnPaulAudience/&gt; The veneration of icons is also a key element of the [[doxology]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=webster231/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casiday447/&gt; The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church accept the church council which condemned iconoclasm and mandated the use of sacred images, the icons of saints, and the crucifix in churches, public shrines, and in homes. The explanation of the consistency of sacred images with the Christian religion was largely based on the arguments of [[St. John Damascene]].

Christian aniconism has only very rarely covered general secular images, unlike [[aniconism in Islam]]; [[Anabaptist]] groups such as the [[Amish]] are rare exceptions.

==Early Christianity==
{{more information|Depiction of Jesus}}
Several voices in [[Early Christianity]] expressed "grave reservations about the dangers of images",&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"&gt;Freedberg, 176&lt;/ref&gt; though contextualizing these remarks has often been the source of fierce controversy, as the same texts were brought out at intervals in succeeding centuries. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] described the mentions of Christian views on Christian images before the mid-6th century as "scattered and spotty",&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and of an earlier period wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is a striking fact that when painting and sculpture first began to infiltrate Christian assembly rooms and cemeteries they did so practically unheeded by either opponents of or apologists for Christianity—engaged though these were in passionate disputes over idols and idolatry. No literary statement from the period prior to the year 300 would make one suspect the existence of any Christian images other than the most laconic and hieroglyphic of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

— and yet from [[archaeology]] it is clear that the use of quite complex figurative Christian images was widespread by that date. There are mentions of images of [[Jesus]] from the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] onwards. The [[Catacombs of Rome]] contain the earliest images, mostly painted, but also including [[relief]]s carved on [[sarcophagi]], dating from the end of the 2nd century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus is often represented by [[pictogram]] symbols, though he is also portrayed. In the [[Dura-Europos church]], of about 230-256, which of the very early churches surviving is in the best condition, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the [[Good Shepherd]].&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, ''Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine'', p. 134, Mercer University Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Protestant position on the history of images in places of worship however is expressed by Phillip Schaff, &lt;blockquote&gt;'Yet previous to the time of Constantine we find no trace of an image of Christ properly speaking except among the Gnostic Carpocratians and in the case of the heathen emperor Alexander Severus who adorned his domestic chapel as a sort of pantheistic Pantheon with representatives of all religions. The above mentioned idea of the uncomely personal appearance of Jesus the entire silence of the Gospels about it and the Old Testament prohibition of images restrained the church from making either pictures or statues of Christ until the Nicene age when a great reaction in this respect took place though not without energetic and long continued opposition.&lt;ref name= "schaff"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Schaff | first = Phillip | title = History of the Christian Church | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | location = Massachusetts | page = 381 | date = 2006 | url = 
https://books.google.com/books?id=NV8sAAAAYAAJ | isbn = 9781565631960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Corby Finney's analysis of Early Christian writing and material remains distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting Early Christians on the issue: "first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen". These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that "overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined", so placing less emphasis on the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish background]] of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii-xii, viii and xi quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Images were also associated with the [[idolatry]] of the pagan [[Ancient Roman religion]] and other cults and religions around them,&lt;ref&gt;Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, et al. "Iconoclasm." In [[Grove Art Online]]. Oxford Art Online, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T039783 subscription required] (accessed April 26, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and much early Christian polemic was devoted to attacking paganism for idolatry. In the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] the issues are discussed in the [[Letters of St. Paul]] and a [[Idolatry and Christianity|prohibition of idolatry]] is included in the [[Apostolic Decree]]. The objections to "decorative and symbolic devices, narrative and didactic images", a description that encompasses much though not all of the earliest Christian art, were much less, as these were not plausibly capable of "idolatric abuse"; according to Kitzinger, "much of the art of the Roman catacombs betrays a studied attempt to avoid any suspicion or encouragement of idolatric practices".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jocelyn Toynbee]] agrees:"In two-dimensional, applied art of this kind there was never any danger of idolatry in the sense of actual worship of cult-images and votive pictures".&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 294-295; see also Jensen, 13-19 on the types of early images.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century there are increased, if scattered, expressions of opposition to images. At the Spanish non-ecumenical [[Synod of Elvira]] (c. 305) bishops concluded, "Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration", the earliest such prohibition known.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 36, http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/elvira.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eusebius]] (died 339) wrote a letter to [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]] (Emperor Constantine's sister) saying "To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error";&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251], p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; though this did not stop her decorating [[Santa Constanza|her mausoleum]] with such images. By the end of the century Bishop [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (died 403) "seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 92&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote an appeal to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394) in which he recounted how he tore apart a curtain hanging on the doors of the church decorated with an image of 'Christ or one of the saints' and admonished the other bishop that such images are "opposed&amp;nbsp;... to our religion", while also replacing the curtain with another expensively embroidered one.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 9, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001051.htm letter 51]&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers cited in later controversies were [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Lactantius]], although evidence of opposition to images by church leaders is often also evidence of their usage in the church.&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the question of images caused a tension in the early church between a theologically-trained clerical elite and the broad mass of followers of the church, and perhaps especially women; the letter of Eusebius being a leading piece of evidence cited here. However other scholars, including Finney and Toynbee,&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii-xii; Toynbee, 295&lt;/ref&gt; dispute this reading of the documentary evidence, pointing out that the physical evidence of sites such as the [[Catacomb of Callistus]] suggests that "church authorities at least tolerated if not approved both the decoration and the content of the iconography on its own property over a fairly long period of time".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that the use of images was regarded as especially characteristic of heretics. [[Irenaeus]], (c. 130–202) in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (1:25;6) says scornfully of the Gnostic [[Carpocratians]], "They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles [pagans]". Irenaeus does not speak critically of icons or portraits in a general sense, only of certain gnostic sectarians use of icons. On the other hand, by the 8th century there is evidence that opposition to images was associated with what was by then the largely vanished heresy of [[Arianism]], though the historical evidence for this now appears slender,&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251]&lt;/ref&gt; and important early figurative mosaics in Italy were created under Arian rule.

==After Constantine==
However, as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles with traditions of religious images, and especially after the conversion of Constantine (c. 312), the legalization of Christianity, and, later that century, the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, many new people came into the new large public churches, which began to be decorated with images that certainly drew in part on imperial and pagan imagery: "The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], The Early Church (The Penguin History of the Church, 1993), 283; Hurlbut, J. L. The Story of the Christian Church. Zondervan, 1967, p.62; Loverance, Rowena (2007). Christian Art. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 117. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02479-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility that Christian art was a movement from below, disapproved of by the clerical hierarchy, vanishes in the large churches built with imperial patronage at the urging of that hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest literary evidence of ''[[proskynesis]]'' before images comes from the first half of the 6th century;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94&lt;/ref&gt; it had already been common before the cross by the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 90&lt;/ref&gt;  The lighting of candles before images, and leaving lit candles and lamps (going beyond what might merely be necessary to actually see them) is mentioned in 6th century sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justinian to the Iconoclastic period==
The period after the reign of [[Justinian]] (527-565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 85-87; 95-115&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kitzinger, "during the late sixth and seventh centuries devotional practices in front of images became elaborate, common, and intense".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it was in this period that images seem to have become common in Christian homes, and "Once admitted to that sphere their use and abuse was beyond control".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 98&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary mentions of Christian images greatly increase, in the accounts of pilgrims to the [[Holy Land]], in works of history, and in popular accounts of the lives of saints; at the same time some of these begin to mention acts of iconoclasm against images. The legendary nature of much of the last two types of material is clear, but the stories remain evidence of practices around images and beliefs as to what images were capable of.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

It is this period that the attribution to individual images of the potential to achieve, channel or display various forms of spiritual grace or divine power becomes a regular motif in literature. In the many miracle stories, there is a "tendency to break down the barrier between image and prototype", so that "the image acts or behaves as the subject itself is expected to act or behave. It makes known its wishes&amp;nbsp;... It enacts evangelical teachings,&amp;nbsp;... When attacked it bleeds,&amp;nbsp;... [and] In some cases it defends itself against infidels with physical force&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Images make promises, and demand that promises made by others are kept, are immune to attack, and most commonly of all, images bestow "some kind of material benefit upon&amp;nbsp;... votaries".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous example of this is the role ascribed to the [[Image of Edessa]] (or Mandylion) in the failure of the Persian siege of the city in 544. The image is not mentioned in the account of [[Procopius]], writing soon after the event, but first appears as the agent of the failure in the history of [[Evagrius Scholasticus]] of about 593.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;  Though most often images are described as acting through some kind of intermediary, sometimes direct physical contact produces the benefit, as with a dry well that refilled when an icon was lowered in the bucket, or medical benefit ascribed to drinking some ground-up plaster from a fresco in water.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 105-107 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century [[Julian of Atramytion]] objected to sculpture, but not paintings, which is effectively the Orthodox position to the present day, except for small works.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94-95 (with long note); Freedberg, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Byzantine iconoclasm ==
[[File:Irenekirken.jpg|thumb|A simple cross replaced a mosaic figure during the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], [[Hagia Irene]] Church in Istanbul]]
{{Main article|Byzantine iconoclasm}}

There were two periods of [[iconoclasm]], or image destruction, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the mid eighth and early ninth centuries. The arguments of the Iconoclasts remain rather obscure, as almost all their writings were [[book burning |destroyed]] after the "[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]". The simple belief that images were idolatrous appears to have been their main motive; reference was made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], and aniconic statements by the [[Church Fathers]], some of which may now be lost. One theological issue revolved around the two natures of [[Jesus]]. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be [[Nestorianism]], and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was [[Monophysitism]], all icons were thus heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96, 106-118, 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Cyril, "Historical Introduction," in Bryer &amp; Herrin, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–6, "Chronology", pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179, "Anthology of Texts in Translation", pp.&amp;nbsp;180–186&lt;/ref&gt;

The political aspects of the conflicts are complex, involving with the relationship between the Byzantine Emperors, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] councils, and the Pope. There has been much scholarly discussion over the possible influence on the Iconoclasts of the [[aniconism in Islam]], the century-old  religion which had inflicted devastating defeats on Byzantium in the decades preceding. Most scholars reject direct religious influence, though many feel the feeling of crisis produced by defeats at the hands of Islam contributed to the Iconoclast movement. Both the cross and secular two-dimensional images continued to be acceptable, indeed were used to replace religious imagery in the two best-known examples. The defeat of Byzantine Iconoclasm was so emphatic that the issue has never arisen again in Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;98–106, 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Iconoclasm==
Figurative [[monumental sculpture]] was still avoided in the [[Western Christianity|West]] until the time of [[Charlemagne]] around 800; the [[Franks]] had no association of sculpture with cult images and a life-size [[crucifix]] (with "corpus") known to have been in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen]] was probably a pivotal work, opening the way to the free general use of large sculpture. This was contemporary with the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (see below). Religious sculpture, especially if large and free-standing, has always been extremely rare in [[Eastern Christianity]]. The Western church was anxious to distinguish its use of images from idolatry, and set out its theological position in the Carolingian [[Libri Carolini]], in similar but slightly different terms to those set out by the Eastern church after the episode of Iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33, 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}; Schiller, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In his travels through the [[Auvergne]] between 1007 and 1020 the cleric Bernard of Angers was initially disapproving of the large crucifixes with a sculpted three-dimensional ''corpus'', and other religious statues that he saw, but he came to accept them.  The [[Gero Cross]], the earliest life-size crucifix image to survive, probably dates to around 960.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;  

===God the Father===
The depiction of [[God the Father in Western art|God the Father in art]] long remained unacceptable; he was typically only shown with the features of Jesus, which had become fairly standardized by the 6th century, in scenes such as the [[Garden of Eden]]. The rationale for this was the doctrine of the pre-existing Christ or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', which holds that Christ has existed from the beginning of time. Very simply put, as a member of the [[Holy Trinity]] of three persons in one God, representations of God could be achieved by depicting Jesus as ''Logos'', except in the few cases where both Jesus and God the Father needed to be shown separately, as in scenes of the [[Baptism of Jesus]]. Alternatively God the Father was represented only by the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], which probably reached [[Christian art]] from [[Hellenistic Judaism]], as it is prominent in the wall paintings of the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] in [[Syria]]. Depictions of God the Father, essentially as the [[Old Testament]] [[Ancient of Days]], only became common in the West from about 1200 onwards, and remain controversial in Eastern Orthodoxy, still being prohibited by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] for example (where images of the Ancient of Days, also banned, are held to represent Christ). Free-standing monumental sculpture is also avoided by the Orthodox churches, and reliefs are much rarer, especially large ones. On the other hand, [[icon]]s have a slightly different theological position in Orthodoxy and play a more significant part in religious life than in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], let alone the Protestant churches.

===Bernard of Clairvaux===
[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090–1153) was an influential [[Cistercian]] monk who famously wrote against the excessive use of imagery in a monastic context, and was largely responsible for the unornamented style of [[Cistercian architecture]]. However his attack concentrated on what he saw as frivolous non-religious elements in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] religious art of his day, which he said distracted monks from their religious life.&lt;ref&gt;"But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness? Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books."{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was prepared to sacrifice religious imagery also, both to save money and avoid "distractions of the senses",&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"/&gt;

==Among Nestorians==
In the [[Church of the East]], also known as the Nestorian church, opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the [[rise of Islam]] in the region, where it forbade any type of depictions of Saints and [[biblical prophets]]. As such, the Church was forced to get rid of their icons.&lt;ref name="Nestorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=21-05-027-f|title=The Shadow of Nestorius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|The Reformation and art}}

Opposition to religious imagery was a feature of proto-Protestant movements such as the [[Lollards]] in England.

The [[Reformation]] produced two main branches of Protestant Christianity; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith. Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

On the contrary, at the time of the Reformation, [[Calvinist]]s preached in violent terms the rejection of what they perceived as idolatrous Catholic practices such as religious pictures, statues, or relics of saints, as well as against the [[Lutheran]] retention of [[sacred art]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Karlstadt]] was the earliest extreme iconoclast, to be followed by [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]]. The Reformed (Calvinist) churches (including the Anglican, [[Puritan]]/[[Congregational]] and [[Reformed Baptist]] Churches) completely prohibited the display of religious images. Reformed theologians such as [[Francis Turretin]], [[Theodore Beza]], [[Westminster divines|the Divines of the Westminster Assembly]], and later [[Robert Dabney]] and [[John Murray (theologian)|John Murray]],&lt;ref name="the-highway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-highway.com/pictures_Murray.html |title= Murray on pictures of Christ |publisher=the-highway.com|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  explicitly reject the depiction of Christ, citing arguments drawn from the second commandment, as well as writings of the early church, using the same texts and arguments as Byzantine iconoclasts.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 165(quoted)-166, 167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The Calvinist [[Westminster Larger Catechism]] of 1647 asks in Question 109, 'What are the sins forbidden in the second commandment?
Answer: The sins forbidden in the second commandment are, all devising, counseling, commanding, using, and anywise approving, any religious worship not instituted by God himself; tolerating a false religion; the making any representation of God, of all or of any of the three persons, either inwardly in our mind, or outwardly in any kind of image or likeness of any creature'.

{{cquote| Romanists make images of God the Father, painting him in their church windows as an old man; and an image of Christ on the crucifix; and, because it is against the letter of this commandment, they sacrilegiously blot it out of their catechism, and divide the tenth commandment into two.

Apart from official destruction of art, there were outbreaks of violent Calvinist [[iconoclasm]] such as the [[Beeldenstorm]] in the [[Low Countries]] in 1566. During this time, [[Anglicanism]], falling with the broader Reformed tradition, also removed most religious images and symbols from churches and discouraged their private use. [[Elizabeth I of England]] was one of many Anglicans to exhibit somewhat contradictory attitudes, both ordering a [[crucifix]] for her chapel when they were against a law she had approved, and objecting forcefully when the [[Dean of St Paul's]] put in the royal pew a service book with "[[woodcut|cuts]] resembling angels and saints, nay, grosser absurdities, pictures resembling the Holy [[Trinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 175&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Reformed churches are now considerably more relaxed over the use of religious art and symbols than they were in the Reformation period, though many denominations avoid images in churches, and in the Anglican Church matters such as the use of altar crosses and crucifixes can arouse strong feelings. However while portraits of saints were destroyed, portraits of contemporary individuals, including church leaders, were not considered problematic, and exist in large numbers. Reformed Christians did not object to small religious images, typically of episodes from the [[New Testament]], in the form of [[old master print|prints]], and Bible illustrations or picture books, especially those intended for children, were and continue to be widely used in Protestantism,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inventing the Holy Land: American Protestant Pilgrimage to Palestine, 1865–1941|author=Rogers, S.S.|date=2011|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739148440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeMlQ4xgB60C|page=24|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so that in the 17th century, even "the ordinary Puritan enjoyed a Bible with pictures".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=From Sacred to Secular: Visual Images in Early American Publications|author=Lacey, B.E.|date=2007|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=9780874139617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VXsjvrmMvAC|page=17|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faced with the Protestant challenge to imagery, then far more virulent than it usually is today, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] reacted by quietly removing some types of medieval imagery that could not be justified theologically, but otherwise by strengthening its commitment to the use of art and images to promote the Christian message, though tightening up on the detailed content of imagery, which was brought under stricter control by the church.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 176-177&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtual end of the production of religious painting in Reformed parts of Europe had the effect of diverting artistic production into secular subjects, especially in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century. While Catholic Europe was still producing [[Baroque]] altarpieces in large numbers, the Netherlands produced genre scenes, very often of ungodly behavior, still lifes, portraits and landscapes. Moralistic messages were often attached to these, though the subject matter often fights somewhat with them. Protestant religious art, mainly in the form of illustrations of biblical events, continued in [[printmaking]] and book illustrations, for example in the [[etching]]s of [[Rembrandt]], who also painted biblical subjects. In the early stages of the Reformation, Protestant propagandists made vigorous use of images satirizing their opponents.

Calvinist aniconism, especially in printed material, and stained glass, can generally be said to have weakened in force, although the range and context of images used are much more restricted than in Catholicism, Lutheranism, or parts of Anglicanism, the latter of which also incorporated many high church practices after the [[Oxford Movement]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The theory of a '''biotic pump''' pertains to the importance of forests in the [[water cycle]], specifically, in determining the levels of rainfall a region will receive. It states that an increased amount of evaporation or [[transpiration]] will cause a reduction in atmospheric pressure as clouds form, which will subsequently cause moist air to be drawn to regions where evaporation is at its highest. In a desert this will correspond to the sea whereas in a forest, moist air from the sea will be drawn inland. The theory predicts two different types of coast to contentinental rainfall patterns, first in a forested area one can expect no decrease in rainfall as one moves inland in contrast to a deforested region where one observes an exponential decrease in annual rainfall. Whereas it is true current global climate models fit these patterns as well, it is argued this is due to [[parametrization]] and not the veracity of the theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheil|first=Douglas|last2=Murdiyarso|first2=Daniel|date=2009-04-01|title=How Forests Attract Rain: An Examination of a New Hypothesis|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/59/4/341/346941|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=59|issue=4|pages=341–347|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.4.12|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blue economy''' is a term in [[economics]] relating to the exploitation and preservation of the marine environment. Its scope of interpretation varies among organizations.

==Definitions==
According to the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Blue Economy?|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/infographic/2017/06/06/blue-economy|website=THE WORLD BANK|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the blue economy is the "sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem."

[[European Commission]] defines it as "All economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts. It covers a wide range of interlinked established and emerging sectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=The 2018 Annual Economic Report on EU Blue Economy|url=https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-annual-economic-report-on-blue-economy_en.pdf|journal=European Union|volume=|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] considers it "an emerging concept which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or 'blue' resources."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/blue-economy|title=Blue economy {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first=Site designed and built by Hydrant|website=thecommonwealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation International]] adds that "blue economy also includes economic benefits that may not be marketed, such as carbon storage, coastal protection, cultural values and biodiversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.conservation.org/2018/03/what-on-earth-is-the-blue-economy/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwl9zdBRDgARIsAL5Nyn3xGXHsApcgFjjO6CvN0Zg602NYYuJw2LPvqa_nDpKKxPtNDJWQxLYaAvSLEALw_wcB|title=What on Earth is the ‘blue economy’? – Human Nature - Conservation...|last=Bertazzo|first=Sophie|date=2018-03-07|work=Human Nature – Conservation International Blog|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Center for the Blue Economy]] says "it is now a widely used term around the world with three related but distinct meanings- the overall contribution of the oceans to economies, the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, and the ocean economy as a growth opportunity for both developed and developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/center-blue-economy/about/history|title=Our History and Methodology|website=Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World Wildlife Fund]] begins its report&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/15_1471_blue_economy_6_pages_final.pdf|title=Principles for a Sustainable BLUE ECONOMY|last=|first=|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|year=|isbn=|location=|page=2|pages=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Principles for a Sustainable BLUE ECONOMY'' with two senses given to this term: "For some, blue economy means the use of the sea and its resources for sustainable economic development. For others, it simply refers to any economic activity in the maritime sector, whether sustainable or not."

As the WWF reveals in its purpose of the report, there is still no widely accepted definition of the term blue economy despite increasing high-level adoption of it as a concept and as a goal of policy-making and investment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Related terms ==

=== Ocean economy ===
A related term of blue economy is ocean economy and we see some organizations using the two terms interchangeably. However, these two terms represent different concepts. Ocean economy simply deals with the use of ocean resources and is strictly aimed at empowering the economic system of ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.examrace.com/Current-Affairs/NEWS-Blue-Economy-Versus-Ocean-Economy.htm|title=Blue Economy versus Ocean Economy- Translation in Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Sindhi, Sindhi, Tamil, Telgu - Examrace|last=Examrace|website=www.examrace.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue economy goes beyond viewing the ocean economy solely as a mechanism for economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It focuses on the sustainability of ocean for economic growth. Therefore, blue economy encompasses ecological aspects of the ocean along with economic aspects.

=== Green economy ===
The [[green economy]] is defined as an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. It is closely related with [[ecological economics]]. Therefore, blue economy is a part of green economy.  During Rio+20 Summit in June 2012, Pacific small island developing states stated that, for them, "a green economy was in fact a blue economy".&lt;ref name="Really"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/homepage.cfm?249111/What-a-blue-economy-really-is|title=What a 'blue economy' really is – WWF’s perspective|date=10 July 2015|website=WWF|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blue growth ===
A related term is blue growth, which means "support to the growth of the maritime sector in a sustainable way."&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=BLUE GROWTH|url=http://ec.europa.eu/assets/mare/infographics/|website=Mare|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is adopted by the European Union as an integrated maritime policy to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/blue_growth_en|title=Blue growth - Maritime Affairs - European Commission|last=Anonymous|date=2016-09-28|website=Maritime Affairs - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential==
On top of the traditional ocean activities such as fisheries, tourism and maritime transport, blue economy entails emerging industries including renewable energy, aquaculture, seabed extractive activities and marine biotechnology and bioprospecting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=The Potential of the Blue Economy : Increasing Long-term Benefits of the Sustainable Use of Marine Resources for Small Island Developing States and Coastal Least Developed Countries|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26843/115545.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=World Bank|volume=|pages=ix|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue economy also attempts to embrace ocean ecosystem services that are not captured by the market but provide significant contribution to economic and human activity. They include carbon sequestration, coastal protection, waste disposal, and the existence of biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The 2015 WWF briefing puts the value of key ocean assets over US$24 trillion.&lt;ref name="Really" /&gt; Fisheries are now overexploited, but there is still plenty of room for aquaculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fujita|first1=Rod|title=FAO Reports 87% of the World’s Fisheries are Overexploited or Fully Exploited|url=http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2012/07/11/fao-reports-87-of-the-worlds-fisheries-are-overexploited-or-fully-exploited/|website=FAO|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offshore wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind EUROPE|last2=BVGassociates|title=Unleashing Europe’s offshore wind potential|date=June 2017|location=Brussels, Belgium|page=16|url=https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/Unleashing-Europes-offshore-wind-potential.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector with the supply of 58 percent of fish to global markets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Aquaculture is vital to food security of the poorest countries especially. Only in the [[European Union]] the blue economy employed 3,362,510 people in 2014.&lt;ref name="Commission" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
The World Bank specifies three challenges that limit the potential to develop a blue economy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Current economic trends that have been rapidly degrading ocean resources.
# The lack of investment in human capital for employment and development in innovative blue economy sectors.
# Inadequate care for marine resources and ecosystem services of the oceans.

The '''circulation of elite''' is a theory of [[regime change]] described by Italian [[social scientist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923).

Changes of regime, [[revolution]]s, and so on occur not when rulers are overthrown from below, but when one [[elite]] replaces another. The role of ordinary people in such transformation is not that of initiators or principal actors, but as followers and supporters of one elite or another.

==Assumptions==
It is a basic [[axiom]] for Pareto that people are unequal physically, as well as intellectually and morally. In [[society]] as a whole, and in any of its particular strata and groupings, some people are more gifted than others. Those who are most capable in any particular grouping are the elite.

The term elite has no moral or honorific connotations in Pareto's usage. It denotes simply "a class of the people who have the highest indices in their branch of activity." Pareto argues that "It will help if we further divide that [elite] class into two classes: a [[governing elite]], comprising individuals who directly or indirectly play some considerable part in [[government]], and a non-governing elite, comprising the rest." His main discussion focuses on the governing elite.

==Ambiguity==
There is a basic [[ambiguity]] in Pareto's treatment of the notion of the elite. In some passages, as in the one quoted above, it would appear that those occupying elite positions are, by definition, the most qualified. But there are many other passages where Pareto asserts that people are assigned elite positions by virtue of being so labeled. That is, men assigned elite positions may not have the requisite capabilities, while others not so labeled may have them.

It would seem that Pareto believed that only in perfectly [[Open society|open societies]], those with perfect [[social mobility]], would elite position correlate fully with superior capacity. Only under such conditions would the governing elite, for example, consist of the people most capable of governing. The actual social fact is that obstacles such as [[inherited wealth]], family connections, and the like prevent the free circulation of individuals through the ranks of society, so that those wearing an elite label and those possessing highest capacity tend to diverge to greater or lesser degrees.

==Social mobility==
Given the likelihood of divergencies between ascribed elite position and actual achievement and capacity, Pareto is a passionate advocate of maximum social mobility and of [[career]]s open to all. He saw the danger that elite positions that were once occupied by men of real [[Aptitude|talent]] would in the course of time be preempted by men devoid of such talent.

When governing or nongoverning elites attempt to close themselves to the influx of newer and more capable elements from the underlying population, when the circulation of elites is impeded, [[social equilibrium]] is upset and the [[social order]] will decay. Pareto argued that if the governing elite does not "find ways to assimilate the exceptional individuals who come to the front in the subject classes," an imbalance is created in the [[body politic]] and the body social until this condition is rectified, either through a new opening of channels of mobility or through [[violent overthrow]] of an old ineffectual governing elite by a new one that is capable of governing.

==Governing elite==
Pareto introduced a social taxonomy that included six classes, Class I through Class VI.  Class I corresponds to the adventurous "foxes" in [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], and Class II to the conservative "lions," particularly in the governing elite.

Not only are [[intelligence]] and [[aptitude]]s unequally distributed among the members of society, but the residues as well. Under ordinary circumstances, the "conservative" residues of Class II preponderate in the masses and thus make them submissive. The governing elite, however, if it is to be effective, must consist of individuals who have a strong mixture of both Class I and Class II elements.

The ideal governing class contains a judicious mixture of lions and foxes, of men capable of decisive and forceful action and of others who are imaginative, innovative, and unscrupulous. When imperfections in the circulation of governing elites prevent the attainment of such judicious mixtures among the governing, regimes either degenerate into hidebound and ossified bureaucracies incapable of renewal and adaptation, or into weak regimes of squabbling [[lawyer]]s and [[rhetorician]]s incapable of decisive and forceful action. When this happens, the governed will succeed in overthrowing their rulers and new elites will institute a more effective regime.

==Speculators==
What applies to political regimes applies to the economic realm as well. In this field, "[[speculator]]s" are akin to the foxes and "[[rentier capitalism|rentiers]]" to the lions. Speculators and rentiers do not only have different interests but they reflect different temperaments and different residues. Neither is very good at using force, but they both otherwise fall roughly into the same dichotomous classes that explain political fluctuations.

In the speculator group Class I residues predominate, in the rentier group, Class II residues. . . . The two groups perform functions of differing utility in society. The [speculator] group is primarily responsible for change, for economic and social progress. The [rentier] group, instead, is a powerful element in stability, and in many cases counteracts the dangers attending the adventurous capers of the [speculators]. A society in which the [rentiers] almost exclusively predominate remains stationary and, as it were, crystallized. A society in which [the speculators] predominate lacks stability, lives in a state of shaky equilibrium that may be upset by a slight accident from within or from without.

Like in the governing elite where things work best when both residues of Class I and Class II are represented, so in the economic order maximum effectiveness is attained when both rentiers and speculators are present, each providing a balance by checking the excesses of the other. Pareto implies throughout that a judicious mixture in top elites of men with Class I and Class II residues makes for the most stable economic structure, as well as for the most enduring [[political structure]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20415">[[Image:Gebel el-Arak knife mp3h8791.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]].  The reverse of the handle shows a [[Master of Animals]] motif: two confronted lions, flanking a central figure (note confronted dogs and other animals below)]]
'''Confronted animals''', or '''confronted-animal''' as an [[adjective]], where two animals face each other in a [[symmetry|symmetrical]] pose, is an ancient bilateral [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in [[art]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] studied in [[archaeology]] and [[art history]]. The "anti-confronted animals" is the opposing motif, with the animals back to back.

Bilateral symmetry is a dominant aspect of our world and strong representation of it with matching figures often creates a balance that is appealing in artwork.

In ancient art, confronted-animal motifs often involve the [[Master of Animals]], a central human figure between two confronted animals, often grasping them, and are probably part of a unified [[sociology|socio-]][[culture|cultural]] motif. A related motif in ancient art is known as the [[Mistress of Animals]].

It is thought that the [[iconography]] sometimes has [[ritual]] and religious associations; for example, the Lion Gate of [[Mycenae]] has a column between the protective, surmounted and confronted lionesses standing with two feet on the ground and two on the same base on which the column rests. The column is thought to represent a goddess, abstracted to avoid [[taboo]]ed direct representation.  Alternatively, the column has also been interpreted as symbolizing the entrance to the palace.  The lions are thus guarding the entrance to the palace and the walled fortification simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/4306/1/The_Lion_Gate_Relief.pdf|title=The Lion Gate Relief at Mycenae Reconsidered (PDF)|last=Shaw|first=Maria C.|date=1986|website=TSpace (University of Toronto), Archaeological Society of Athens, Greece|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif called the [[Tree of Life]], where two confronted animals graze on a shrub or tree, is also very ancient.

==Gebel el-Arak Knife==

The reverse side of the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] handle, displayed at the top of the article, shows two powerful confronted lions, separated by a figure who is grasping them. Of note, the knob on the reverse shows the top end of the hole for a cord or rope, on the suspension [[lug (knob)|lug]]; this knife may have been worn around the neck ceremonially.

==Examples from archaeology==

===Cylinder seals===

[[Image:Uruk3000BCE.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Cylinder seal]] of [[Uruk]] displaying a confronted-lioness motif sometimes described as a ''"[[serpopard]]"'' - 3000 BC - [[Louvre]]]]
Examples of confronted animals exist on [[Cylinder seal]]s from [[Mesopotamia]]. [[deity|Deities]], or [[hero]]es grasping lionesses, cattle, [[griffin]]s, or other, imaginary creatures are sometimes found.

Many cylinder seals involving confronted [[goat]]s surrounding a central [[Tree of life]] on a 'cone' or 'mountain' platform share one common theme. Others may be thought of as deities holding the animals under their control.

Because cylinder seals are numerous and also come from [[prehistory|pre-historical]] periods, back to the [[4th millennium BC|fourth]] or [[5th millennium BC]], themes are varied. Another Tree of life type of confronted animals cylinder seal has a "hero grasping water buffalo" and a "bull-man grasping lions", each between the animals; again, the central figure is the "Tree-of-Life" that often is interpreted as representing a goddess.

===Confronted snakes===
[[Image:Snake Goddess Crete 1600BC.jpg|thumb|Figure from [[Crete]], holding confronted snakes, dated 1600 BC. ]]
Confronted [[serpent (symbolism)|snake]]s are frequent images in many cultures from ancient times to historical periods. Often associated with religious ceremonies and deities, perhaps the most familiar figure known popularly from ancient times is the deity or priestess of Crete depicted holding up two confronted snakes on either side of her.

A [[chlorite]] vessel [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/wright/Fall03/ChloriteVase2.jpg] from the area of contemporary [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] is displayed at this link. It depicts three pairs of confronted animals. Two confronted [[snakes]] are being held in the hands of the central figure; below the snake-pair are a pair of ''anti-confronted-lionesses'' (although they turn their heads to face each other their hind quarters are closely confronted), recumbent. The third similar pair of animals on this item are two anti-confronted bovines with a human or deity between also. Two tumbling lions and other animals are depicted to the right.

===Narmer Palette===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|thumb|left|Narmer Palette with confronted lionesses, displayed in iconographic [[register (sculpture)|register]]s - ''Ancient Egypt c. 3,000 BC'']]
The [[Narmer Palette]], used to mix cosmetics in the receptacle on one side, has two confronted [[Felidae|felines]], sometimes called [[serpopard]]s (because of their exaggerated long necks which look snakelike to some researchers) forming the receptacle. Close examination of the animals with the exaggerated, long necks supports identification as [[lion]]esses. The entire theme of the Narmer Palette, is about the [[pharaoh]] of the newly unified [[Ancient Egypt]] represented in two scenes, (palette ''obverse'', palette ''reverse''). On one side the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Upper Egypt]] and on the other, the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Lower Egypt]]. Thus, it is thought that the lionesses with their intertwining necks are representing two kingdoms, once separate, but now unified under one pharaoh. The lioness [[Bastet|Bast]] had been the protective deity of one kingdom and the lioness [[Sekhmet]] of the other kingdom, equally important deities in each of the early [[Egyptian pantheon]]s. Respectively, they were the special protectors of the pharaoh in each kingdom, who persisted as deities throughout the long history of unified [[Ancient Egypt]]. Eventually their roles diverged, however, with one becoming less of the protector and warrior deity and assigned other roles. Typically, many similar deities in the two kingdoms soon were merged, so the retention of both is thought to be the result of the long and strong tradition of each.

Examples of other confronted animals exist on many [[cosmetic palette]]s of Ancient Egypt that have been discovered.  One palette has confronted-[[hippopotamus]]es; others include giraffes, geese, and other animals familiar to the Egyptians. Bilaterally depicted [[palm tree]]s also are known as well on palettes.

===Mycenae Lion Gate===
[[Image:Mycenae lion gate detail dsc06384.jpg|thumb|225px|The Mycenae "Lion Gate" (detail) with two [[lion]]esses or lions that flank a central column|alt=]]
The gate to the citadel of [[Mycenae]] is shown to the right. It crowned the major entrance gateway to the ancient citadel that was the centre of the culture, [[Mycenaean Greece]], that predated that of [[Greece]], and is a well-known example of two confronted lionesses. Debate exists in research of this image, questioning whether these are leopards or lionesses confronted with a column between them that represents the deity, but the characteristic tufts at the end of the tails confirm the species. Many images of lioness related deities are depicted with heavier manes than typical for lionesses, but that may have been the result of attempts to interpretation of the species or, unfamiliarity with the atypical [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] differences within this feline species.  Alternatively, George Mylonas believed lions were depicted, not lionesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mycenae and the Mycenaean Age|last=Mylonas|first=George|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0691035239|location=|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek herald's staffs (kerykeia)===

In ancient Greece, heralds functioning as private messengers or public criers were referred to as ''kerykes''. The ''keryx'' has functions in political, military, judicional and religious matters. He was identified by his attribute, the herald's staff or ''kerykeion'', in Latin ''caduceus''. The attribute also offered him protection. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, also carries a ''kerykeion''. Kerykeia were often donated to temples by private persons and on state occasions. They are also found in herald's graves, and identify the profession of the buried person.

{{Main|Tomb of the Leopards}}
Confronted leopards appear in a tomb found in Tarchuna ([[Tarquinia]]), or Tarchna Tarchnal, the chief of the [[Etruscan cities|twelve cities]] of [[Etruria]], a district in what is described as the [[Etruscan civilization]] that existed in Italy from 1200 BC through the 100 BC. It appears in the earliest history of [[Rome]], which was dominated by it until early in the 330s BC. This mural features confronted [[leopard]]s providing protection for a banquet in the afterlife. Frequently felines, lionesses and leopards such as these are confronted with a tree, shrub, or column between them in murals from this culture. The Etruscans are thought to have migrated from the area of Troy,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} through Greece where they absorbed many cultural elements, to Italy where they founded their culture in prehistoric times.

In Europe, confronted animals are an important motif in [[animal style]], or [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] decoration, [[Insular art]], and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]. In these contexts there may be little or nothing between the two animals, and the emphasis is on the pair themselves.  Human figures are often treated in the same way, often mixed in with animals in decorative schemes - [[Archery|archer]]s were especially popular in the Romanesque period.

The early [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[ship burial]] found in contemporary Great Britain at [[Sutton Hoo]], from the seventh century AD, contains famous examples of [[Migration Period art]].  The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid]] has three stylized confronted-animal pairs; the two side pairs, left and right, are identical, and have the animals in the person's clutched grasp. The central confronted animals are even more complex in theme.

Opposed animals are used in [[Insular art]], the style of which is derived from a mixture of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and northern European design traditions. Confronted animals, or animals intertwined in very intricate patterns, often depicted grabbing at each other to form the "gripping beast" pattern, are a main feature of some periods of [[Viking art]]. So intertwined are the animals, they are dissolved into pure ornament, and the individuals are barely discernable from each other.  Confronted animals are also frequently seen in European [[Romanesque art]], for example as decorative patterns in [[Romanesque architecture]].

[[Supporters (heraldry)|Supporters]] in [[heraldry]], not always a matched pair, continue the theme.

===Asian art===

====Luristan bronzes, Anatolian "animal" carpets====
{{See also|Early Anatolian Animal carpets|Luristan bronze}}

Confronted-animal motifs are found extensively in Asian art and in textiles, including [[Oriental rug|rug]]s, across [[Eurasia]].

Few examples still exist of a special type of Oriental [[Oriental rug|carpet]], termed "animal carpets" because their main feature are confronted animals. Dated to the 13th–16th century, they represent carpets woven during the transition period between the late [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] and the early [[Ottoman empire]]. Parallels were shown between the "opposed animal" and "latch-hook" motifs from woven pile rugs and the [[Lorestān bronze]]s.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[Early Iron Age]] [[bronze]] artifacts of various individual forms which have been recovered from [[Lorestān Province|Lorestān]] and [[Kermanshah]] areas in west-central [[Iran]].

Carpet fragments discovered in [[Konya]] and [[Beyşehir]] in Turkey, and [[Fustat|Fostat]] in Egypt were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R.

A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between phoenix and dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet now displayed at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin, and radiocarbon dated to the mid 15th century. The Chinese motif was probably introduced into Islamic art by the Mongols during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="Dragon and Phoenix carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon and Phoenix Carpet|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;34;de|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another animal carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt;

Since 1988, seven more carpets of the animal type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large confronted animals, each with a smaller animal inside. An almost complete animal carpet is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]].

"Animal carpets" were also depicted in Italian paintings of the 14th and 15th century, and thus represent the earliest Oriental carpets shown in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].

===Native North American Art===
[[File:Powhatan's mantle, lithography 1888.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Powhatan's Mantle]]
"Powhatan's Mantle" is a cloak of [[deerskin]], which originally belonged to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] of high social status. Its decoration consists of shell beadwork, depicting a central standing human figure flanked by two upright, opposed quadrupeds and surrounded by 34 discs. The two animals resemble one another in terms of their overall outline, but their tails and paws differ. The left-hand animal has a long tail and round paws with five articulated digits. The right-hand animal has a shorter tail, and its legs end in cloven hoofs. Historically, this artwork was believed to have belonged [[Powhatan]], who was the [[paramount chief]] of [[Tsenacommacah]], an [[Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom|alliance]] of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] [[Virginia Indians]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] at the time English settlers landed at [[History of the Jamestown Settlement (1607–1699)|Jamestown]] in 1607. "Powhatan's Mantle" is one of the earliest North American artifacts to be collected by Europeans that still survives today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/amulets/tradescant/tradescant07-13.html "Powhatan's Mantle"] at the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]]''' has been considered as a dominant paradigm, or research programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Imre |last=Lakatos |chapter=Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes |editor1-first=Imre |editor1-last=Lakatos |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Musgrave |title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |volume=4 |series=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&amp;pg=PA91 |date=2 September 1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09623-2 |pages=91–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of '''[[science education]]'''. The term constructivism is widely used in many fields, and not always with quite the same intention. This entry offers an account of how constructivism is most commonly understood in science education.

==Description==
Science Education is now an established field within Education, and worldwide has its own journals, conferences, university departments and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter J. |last=Fensham |title=The Evolution of Science Education as a Field of Research: Defining an Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE9WVALhQTAC |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-1468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a diverse field, a major influence on its development was research considered to be undertaken from a constructivist perspective on learning, and supporting approaches to teaching that themselves became labelled constructivist. Thus, this constructivism was largely of a psychological flavour, often drawing on the work of [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Child's Conception Of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWZIOL0NDLwC |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-5951-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Principles of Genetic Epistemology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-avb4T8ksC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-16890-8 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ausubel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ausubel, D.P. |title=Educational Psychology: A cognitive view |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |location=New York |year=1968 |isbn=978-0030696404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert M. Gagné]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gagné, R.M. |title=The Conditions of Learning |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |year=1970 |isbn=978-0039100698 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerome Bruner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerome S. |last=Bruner |title=The Process of Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iaq5R8vPujAC |year=1977 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-71001-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; One influential group of science education researchers were also heavily influenced by [[George Kelly (psychologist)]]'s [[Personal Construct Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Kelly |title=A Theory of Personality: The Psychology of Personality Constructs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sp5iH1deNNEC |year=1963 |publisher=W.W. Norton |isbn=978-0-393-00152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Lev Vygotsky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Thought and Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkz7stcdbKgC |year=1986 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-72010-6 |origyear=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L.

These workers from psychology informed the first generation of science education researchers. Active research groups developed in centres like the [[University of Waikato]] (Aotearoa/New Zealand), [[University of Leeds]] (UK) and [[University of Surrey]] (UK), with a strong interest in students' ideas in science (formed before, or during instruction) as these were recognised as being highly influential on future learning, and so whether canonical scientific would be learnt. This work, sometimes labelled the 'alternative conceptions movement' was motivated by a series of influential publications on children's ideas in science and their implications for learning (and so for how teaching should be planned to take them into account). Whilst a range of influential papers could be cited it has been suggested that a number of seminar contributions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Easley, J. |title=Pupils and paradigms: a review of literature related to concept development in adolescent science students |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=5 |pages=61–84 |year=1978 |doi=10.1080/03057267808559857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Erickson, G. |title=Theories-in-action: some theoretical and empirical issues in the study of students' conceptual frameworks in science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=37–60 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Watts, D.M. |title=Concepts, misconceptions and alternative conceptions: changing perspectives in science education |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=61–98 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Osborne, R.J. |author3=Fensham, P.J. |title=Children's science and its consequences for teaching |journal=Science Education |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=623–633 |year=1982 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730660412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osborne, R.J. |author2=Wittrock, M.C. |title=Learning Science: a generative process |journal=Science Education |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=489–508 |year=1983 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730670406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect set out the commitments, or 'hard core' of a constructivist research programme into the learning and teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taber, K.S. |title=Beyond Constructivism: the Progressive Research Programme into Learning Science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=125–184 |year=2006 |doi=10.1080/03057260608560222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taber09&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith S. |last=Taber |title=Progressing Science Education: Constructing the Scientific Research Programme Into the Contingent Nature of Learning Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96tslSL3UfwC |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective was also the focus of a number of books aimed at the science education community - researchers and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Driver, R. |title=The Pupil as Scientist? |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1983 |isbn=978-0335101788 |oclc=10585522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Guesne, E. |author3=Tiberghien, A. |title=Children's Ideas in Science |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1985 |isbn=978-0335150403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul J. |last1=Black |first2=Arthur M. |last2=Lucas |title=Children's Informal Ideas in Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlxS0fBb5woC |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-00539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These papers presented learning as process of personal sense making, and an iterative matter such that what is learnt was channelled by existing knowledge and understanding (whether canonical or alternative), and teaching as needing to take learners' existing ideas into account in teaching. The research programme soon amounted to thousands of studies on aspects of students' (of different ages and educational levels, from different countries) thinking and learning in science topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Duit, R. |title=Bibliography—STCSE (Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education) |year=2009 |publisher=Kiel:IPN—Leibniz Institute for Science Education |url=http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There have been a wide range of criticisms of constructivist work in science, including strong criticism from philosophical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthews, M.R. |title=Discontent With Constructivism |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=24 |pages=165–172 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/03057269408560045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scerri, E.R. |title=Philosophical confusion in chemical education research |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=468–474 |year=2003 |doi=10.1021/ed080p468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms have done little to stem the influence of the perspective, perhaps because they tend not to refer to the core tenets of constructivism as an approach based on learning theory and research from cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt;

==Alternative conceptions and conceptual frameworks in science education==
Learners' ideas in science have been variously labelled as [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Alternative%20conception.html alternative conceptions], alternative conceptual frameworks, preconceptions, [[scientific misconceptions]], naive theories etc. Although some scholars have attempted to distinguish between these terms, there is no consensual usage and often these terms are in effect synonymous.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt; It has been found that some alternative conceptions are very common, although others appear quite idiosyncratic. Some seem to be readily overcome in teaching, but others have proved to be tenacious and to offer a challenge to effective instruction. Sometimes it is considered important to distinguish fully developed conceptions (i.e., explicit ways of understanding aspects of the natural work that are readily verbalised) from more 'primitive' features of cognition acting at a tacit level, such as the so-called phenomenology primitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=diSessa, A.A. |title=Towards an epistemology of physics |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=10 |issue=2–3 |pages=105–225 |year=1993 |doi=10.1080/07370008.1985.9649008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'knowledge-in-pieces' perspective suggests the latter act as resources for new learning which have potential to support the development of either alternative or canonical knowledge according to how teachers proceed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.P. |author2=diSessa, A.A. |author3=Roschelle, J. |title=Misconceptions reconceived: a constructivist analysis of knowledge in transition |journal=The Journal of the Learning Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=115–163 |year=1993 |doi=10.1207/s15327809jls0302_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas alternative conceptions (or misconceptions) tend to be seen as learning impediments to be overcome. What research has shown is the prevalence among learners at all levels of alternative ways to thinking about just about all [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Science%20Topics.html science topics], and a key feature of guidance to teachers is to elicit students' ideas as part of the teaching process. The success of constructivism is that this is now largely taken-for-granted in science teaching and has become part of standard teaching guidance in many contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Key Stage 3 National Strategy. (2002). Framework for teaching science: years 7, 8 and 9. London: Department for Education and Skills.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously there was a strong focus on the abstract nature of concepts to be learnt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shayer, M. |author2=Adey, P. |title=Towards a Science of Science Teaching: Cognitive development and curriculum demand |publisher=Heinemann Educational Books |location=Oxford |year=1981 |isbn=978-0435578251 |oclc=7759952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but little awareness that often the teacher was not seeking to replace ignorance with knowledge, but rather to modify and develop learners existing thinking which was often at odds with the target knowledge set out in the curriculum.

===Constructivist science teaching===
Constructivism is seen as an educational theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taber, K.S. |chapter=Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction |chapterurl=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html |editor=J.

{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Curriculum studies''' ('''CS''') is a concentration within curriculum and instruction concerned with understanding [[curriculum|curricula]] as an active force of human educational experience.

==Overview==
Specific questions related to curriculum studies include the following: 
*What should be taught in [[school]]s? 
*Why should it be taught? To whom should it be taught? 
*What does it mean to be an educated person?

Components of CS also investigate the relationship between [[curriculum theory]] and educational practice and the relationship between school programs and the contours of the [[society]] and [[culture]] in which schools are located. There are [[#University programs|programs in the field of curriculum studies]] in several Colleges of Education around the world. Curriculum studies was also the first subdivision of the [[American Educational Research Association]], known as Division B.

Important CS books include ''The Curriculum: Perspective, Paradigm, and Possibility'' by William Schubert (New York: Macmillan, 1986; and ''Understanding Curriculum'' by [[William Pinar]], et al. (New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 1995).

Curriculum studies emerged as a distinctive field in the late 1960s and early 1970s from educationists focused on curriculum development. The shift from developing and evaluating curriculum to understanding curriculum is known as the "Reconceptualization" of the curriculum field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacheco|first1=Jose, Augusto|title=Curriculum studies: What is the field today?|journal=Journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Curriculum Studies|date=2012|volume=8|pages=18|url=https://www.uwstout.edu/soe/jaaacs/upload/v8_What_Is_The_Field_Today.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A branch of curriculum studies that investigates how society transmits culture from generation to generation has been tagged with the term "[[hidden curriculum]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Mark, K|title=Curriculum theory and practice|url=http://infed.org/mobi/curriculum-theory-and-practice/|website=infed.org|publisher=The Encyclopaedia of Informal Education|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though much of what is studied is hiding in plain sight.  For instance, one of the 19th century founders of the discipline of [[sociology]], [[Émile Durkheim]], observed that more is taught and learned in schools than specified in the established curriculum of textbooks and teacher manuals.  In ''Moral Education'' Durkheim wrote:

:"In fact, there is a whole system of rules in the school that predetermine the child's conduct.  He must come to class regularly, he must arrive at a specified time and with an appropriate bearing and attitude.  He must not disrupt things in class.  He must have learned his lessons, done his homework, and have done so reasonably well, etc.  There are, therefore, a host of obligations that the child is required to shoulder.  Together they constitute the discipline of the school.  It is through the practice of school discipline that we can inculcate the spirit of discipline in the child. (Durkheim, Émile (1961 [1925]). ''Moral Education''. New York, The Free Press.p.&amp;nbsp;148)"

[[Phillip W. Jackson]] (1968) may have coined the term "hidden curriculum" in his book ''Life in Classrooms''.  He argued that [[primary school]] emphasized specific skills: learning to wait quietly, exercising restraint, trying, completing work, keeping busy, cooperating, showing allegiance to both teachers and peers, being neat and punctual, and so on (Jackson, Philip (1968). ''Life in Classrooms''.). The [[Structural functionalism|structural functional]] sociologist [[Robert Dreeben]] (1968 ''On What is Learned in School'') similarly concluded that the curriculum of schooling taught students to "form transient social relationships, submerge much of their personal identity, and accept the legitimacy of categorical treatment".  Dreeben argued that formal schooling indirectly conveyed to students values such as independence and achievement, essential for their later membership in society. 
 
Since then, curriculum studies researchers ranging across the spectrum of paradigms&amp;mdash;from conservative structural-[[Structural functionalism|functionalists]], to neo-[[Marxist]]s to narrative- and arts-based researchers&amp;mdash;have examined formal curricula, experienced curricula, and hidden curricula.  Progressive researchers like Paul Willis (1977, ''Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''), Jean Anyon  (1980, "Social Class and the Hidden Curriculum of Work". ''Journal of Education'' 162), and [[Annette Lareau]] (1989. ''Home Advantage: Social Class, and Parental Intervention in Elementary Education'') have examined the ways that hidden and overt curricula reproduce [[social class]] position.  Narrative and arts-based researchers like Thomas Barone (2001, ''Touching Eternity: The Enduring Outcomes of Teaching'') have inquired about the long-term effects of curricula on student lives.

Critical theorists like [[Henry Giroux]] (1983 "Theories of Reproduction and Resistance in the New Sociology of Education: A critical analysis." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 53) began to examine the roles of students and teachers in resisting curricula both official and hidden.  So-called "resistance theorists" conceptualized students and teachers as active agents working to subvert, reject, or change curricula.  They noted that "curriculum" was not a unified structure but incoherent conflicting and contradictory messages. Other researchers have examined the interactions between racial and [[ethnic]] cultures and the dominant curricula of the school. For instance the anthropologist John Ogbu examined curricula established by [[African American]] students ([[Signithia Fordham]] and John Ogbu 1986 "Black Students' School Success: Coping with the Burden of 'Acting White.' ''The Urban Review'' 18).   [[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] like Daniel Solórzano examined how racial attitudes constitute another "hidden" curriculum in teacher education programs (1997, Images and Words that Wound: Critical Race Theory and Racial Stereotyping, and Teacher Education, ''Teacher Education Quarterly'', 24). Additionally, Judith Stacey proposed in the 1960s schools conveyed a hidden curriculum that perpetuated the "sexist beliefs, attitudes, and values" of the time period (1974 "And Jill Came Tumbling After Sexism in American Education").&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, Judith, et al. (eds.) (1974). And Jill Came Tumbling After: Sexism in American Education. New York: Dell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in curriculum studies is thus cross disciplinary and of increasing importance to [[educational research]] and to the [[philosophy of education]].

Development before birth, including [[gametogenesis]], [[embryogenesis]], and [[fetal development]], is the process of body development from the [[gamete]]s are formed to eventually combine into a [[zygote]] to when the fully developed organism exits the [[uterus]]. Epigenetic processes are vital to fetal development due to the need to differentiate from a single cell to a variety of cell types that are arranged in such a way to produce cohesive tissues, organs, and systems.

[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic]] modifications such as [[methylation]] of CpGs (a dinucleotide composed of a 2'-deoxycytosine and a 2' deoxyguanosine) and [[histone]] tail modifications allow [[Regulation of gene expression|activation or repression]] of certain [[Gene|genes]] within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], in order to create cell memory either in favor of using a gene or not using a gene. These modifications can either originate from the parental [[DNA]], or can be added to the gene by various [[Protein|proteins]] and can contribute to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Processes that alter the epigenetic profile of a gene include production of activating or repressing [[Protein complex|protein complexes]], usage of [[Non-coding RNA|non-coding RNAs]] to guide proteins capable of modification, and the proliferation of a signal by having protein complexes attract either another protein complex or more DNA in order to modify other locations in the gene.

==Epigenetic Definitions==

[[Gene expression]] refers to the [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] of a gene but the [[RNA]] produced does not necessarily have to encode a protein product.  Transcription may produce so called noncoding RNA products such as [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]] and [[regulatory RNA]].  Repression may refer to the decrease in transcription of a gene or inhibition of a protein.  Proteins are often inhibited by binding the active site or causing a [[conformational change]] so that the active site can no longer bind. By making these alterations, proteins, like [[Transcription factor|transcription factors]], may bind DNA less or some protein may be inhibited so that it becomes a block in a [[signaling cascade]] and certain genes will then not be induced to be expressed. Repression can occur pre- or post-transcriptionally. [[Methylation|Methylating]] the DNA or the modifying the histones that the DNA wraps around is one example that commonly leads to repression.  Pre-transcriptional repression can also occur by altering the proteins that allow transcription to occur, namely the [[polymerase]] complex.  Proteins can sit on the DNA strand and serve as a kind of block to polymerase proteins, halting them from transcribing.  Post-transcriptional repression generally refers to the degradation of the RNA product or binding the RNA with proteins so that it cannot be translated or carry out its function.

[[DNA methylation]] in humans and most other mammals refers to the methylation of a CpG. Methylation of these [[Cytosine|cytosines]] are common in DNA, and in sufficient numbers can prevent proteins from attaching to the DNA by obscuring the domain binding site's matching DNA to the protein. Regions in which cytosines prior to [[Guanine|guanines]] are clustered and highly unmethylated are called [[Cpg islands|CpG islands]], and often serve as [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], or transcription start sites.

Histone modifications are modifications made to the [[amino acid]] residues in the tails of the histones that either restrict the histone's ability to bind to DNA or boost the histone's ability to bind to DNA. Histone modifications also act as sites for proteins to attach, which then further alter the gene's expression. Two common histone modifications are [[acetylation]] and methylation. Acetylation is when a protein adds an [[acetyl group]] to a [[lysine]] in a histone tail in order to restrict the ability of the histone to bind to DNA. This acetylation is commonly found on lysine 9 of histone 3, notated as H3K9ac. This results in the DNA being more open to transcription, due to the decreased binding to the histone. Methylation, meanwhile, is when a protein adds a methyl group to a lysine in a histone tail, although more than one methyl group can be added at a time. Two sites for histone methylation are common in current studies: trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 ([[H3K4me3]]), which causes activation, and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3, which causes repression (H3K27me3).

Cis acting elements refer to mechanisms that act on the same [[chromosome]] they come from, usually either in the same region from which they were produced or a region very close to this origin region. For example, a long non-coding RNA that is produced at one location silences the same or a different location on the same chromosome. Trans acting elements, however, are gene products from one location that act on a different chromosome, either the other in a chromosomal pair, or on a different chromosome from a separate chromosome pair. An example of this is a long non coding RNA from Hox gene C silences Hox gene D on a different chromosome, from a different chromosomal pair.

==Hox Gene Regulation==

[[Hox gene|Hox genes]] are genes in humans that regulate body plan development. Humans have four sets of Hox genes, numbering 39 genes altogether, all of which aid in the differentiation of cells by location. Hox genes are activated early in the [[Human embryogenesis|development of the embryo]], in order to plan the development of the differing structures of the body. They also show colinearity with the body plan, meaning that the order of the Hox genes is similar to the expression levels of the Hox genes on the anterior-posterior axis. This colinearity allows for a spatial and temporal activation of genes in order to produce a proper body structure.&lt;ref name="farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu"&gt;Rinn, John L. et al. (2007), [http://farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/publications/2007/Rinn.pdf "Functional Demarcation of Active and Silent Chromatin Domains in Human Hox Loci by Noncoding RNAs."] Cell. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.022.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hox genes are regulated using a variety of epigenetic mechanisms, including the use of [[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNAs]] such as [[HOTAIR]], the [[Trithorax-group proteins|Trithorax]] (TrxG) group of proteins, and the [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb]] (PcG) group of proteins.

===PcG and TrxG Genes' Role in Hox Gene Regulation===

The PcG and TrxG genes that produce protein complexes responsible for continuing the activation and the repression patterns in the Hox genes initially formed by the maternal factors. PcG genes are responsible for repressing [[chromatin]] in Hox clusters meant to be inactivated in the differentiated cell. PcG proteins repress genes by forming polycomb repressive complexes, such as [[PRC1]] and [[PRC2]]. PRC2 complexes repress by trimethylating histone 3 at lysine 27 through histone [[methyltransferases]] [[EZH2|Ezh2]] and [[EZH1|Ezh1]]. PRC2 is rectruited by many elements, including CpG islands.&lt;ref name="farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; PRC1, meanwhile, [[ubiquitinates]] H2AK119 using Ring1A/B's [[E3 ligase]] activity, causing stalling of [[RNA polymerase II]]. Furthermore, Ring1B, a member of the PRC1 complex, also represses Hox genes with Me118, Mph2, and RYBP by compacting the chromatin into higher-order structures.&lt;ref&gt;Eskeland, R. et al. (2010), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132514/#R48 "Ring1B Compacts Chromatin Structure and Represses Gene Expression Independent of Histone Ubiquitination."] Molecular Cell. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2010.02.032&lt;/ref&gt; TrxG genes, meanwhile, are responsible for activating genes by trimethylating lysine 4 of the histone H3 tail. Genes with similar transcriptional marks tend to cluster together in distinct structures. In bivalent domains, both of these marks are present, indicating genes that are silenced but can be rapidly activated when necessary.&lt;ref name="farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;

===The Role of ncRNAs in Hox Gene Regulation===

231 ncRNAs are present in the four Hox [[Gene cassette|gene cassettes]]. Similarly to the Hox protein-coding genes, the ncRNAs show differential expression according to the cell's location on the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal axes. These lncRNAs can act either on the set of genes which they are present in, or can act on a separate gene set within the Hox genes.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wang, Kevin C. et al. (2011) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670758/ "Long Noncoding RNA Programs Active Chromatin Domain to Coordinate Homeotic Gene Activation."] Nature. doi: 10.1038/nature09819&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HOTTIP]] is a long non-coding RNA that assists in regulating the HoxA genes. It is produced from the 5' end of the HoxA gene cassette, and activates HoxA genes. Loops within the chromosome bring HOTTIP closer to its targets; this allows HOTTIP to bind to [[WDR5]]/MLL protein complexes to aid in trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

HOTAIR is a long non-coding RNA that assists in regulating the HoxD genes. It is produced in the HoxC cassette, near the divide between expressed and unexpressed genes, and represses HoxD genes. HOTAIR acts by attaching to [[SUZ12|Suz12]] in the PRC2 complex, and then guides this complex to the genes to be repressed. PRC2 then trimethylates the lysine 27 of histone 3, repressing the gene of interest.&lt;ref name="farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;

==Barr body formation==
In female humans, [[Barr body|Barr bodies]] are defined as the condensed and inactivated [[X chromosome|X-chromosome]] that is found in every cell of the adult.  Because females have two nearly identical X chromosomes, one of them must be silenced so that the expression levels of the genes on the X-chromosome are of the proper dosage. Thus, males and females have the same level of X-chromosome expression, despite being born with one X for males and two for females. This is also why individuals with [[Klinefelter syndrome]], a disease in which more than two sex chromosomes are present in the body, have fewer symptoms than individuals with other types of [[aneuploidy]], which are often fatal before birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klinefelter-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20033637 "Klinefelter Syndrome."] - Mayo Clinic. N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of Xist===

[[X-inactivation|Inactivation]] of one of the X chromosomes is initiated by a long non coding RNA called [[XIST|Xist]]. This lncRNA is expressed on the same chromosome it represses, known as working in cis.  Recent research has shown that a repeat element in the RNA of Xist causes PRC2 to bind to the RNA. Another part of the RNA binds to the X-chromosome positioning PRC2 such that it can methylate various regions on the X-chromosome. This methylation causes other factors like [[Histone deacetylase|histone deacetylases]] (HDACs) to bind to the chromosome and propagate [[heterochromatin]] formation, even into active gene regions. This heterochromatin greatly reduces, if not completely silences gene expression of the Barr body. Xist will be continuously created to maintain a condensed and silenced Barr body.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Engreitz, J.M. et al. (2013), [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6147/1237973 "The Xist lncRNA Exploits Three-Dimensional Genome Architecture to Spread Across the X Chromosome."] Science. doi: 10.1126/science.1237973&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random early X-chromosome inactivation===

In embryonic development, when the zygote is still composed of just a few cells, each cell of the zygote will randomly chose an X-chromosome to condense and silence. From then on, the [[Daughter cell|daughter cells]] of that cell will always silence the same X-chromosome as the parent cell it propagated from. This creates what is known as the “mosaic effect,” in which differential X-chromosome expression creates differing [[Genotype|genotypes]] throughout a single organism. This may or may not be evident in females, depending on how the genes of the X-chromosomes affect [[phenotype]]. If the [[Allele|alleles]] for a gene are identical on both X-chromosomes, then you will see no difference between the cells that chose one X over the other. If the alleles are different for, say, fur color, then you may see patches of one color and patches of the other color. In [[Calico cat|calico cats]] the mosaic pattern of X inactivation is easily seen because a gene affecting coat color is carried on the X, resulting in patches of color on the coat. The mosaic pattern of X inactivation may also determine how penetrant a disease is, if the disease allele is present on one X-chromosome and not the other. The organism may have few cells in which the diseased allele has not been condensed, leading to little expression of the disease allele. This is referred to as skewed X-chromosome inactivation.

==Imprinting==
[[Genomic imprinting|Imprinting]] is defined as the differential expression of paternal and maternal alleles of a gene, due to epigenetic marks introduced onto the chromosome during the production of [[egg]] and [[sperm]]. These marks usually lead to differential expression of the specific sets of genes from the maternal and paternal chromosomes. Imprinting is carried out through many epigenetic mechanisms like methylation, histone modifications, rearrangement of higher order chromatin structure, non-coding RNAs, and interfering RNAs.

===Goals and Functions of Imprinting===

A single evolutionary purpose of imprinting is still unknown, since the mechanisms and effects seem to be so diverse. One hypothesis states that imprinting occurs in order to carry out the evolutionary goal of the parent, that being the differential partition of resources. The male seeks to provide maximum resources for his offspring so that his genes may be passed on successfully to the next generation, whereas the female must partition resources between all her offspring, and so must limit resources given.&lt;ref&gt;Barlowl, D., Barolomei, M. (2014), [http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/6/2/a018382.full "Genomic Imprinting in Mammals."] Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a018382&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hypothesis states that imprinting may help protect the female from ovarian [[trophoblastic disease]] and [[parthenogenesis]]. Trophoblastic disease occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg with no nucleus and a cancer-like mass forms in the [[placenta]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Jeffrey L., M.D. [http://www.womenscancercenter.com/info/types/mole.html "Trophoblastic Disease."] Women's Cancer Center: Ovarian Cancer. N.p., 2007. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Parthenogenesis occurs when an unfertilized egg develops into a fully functional organism that is genetically identical to the parent, who is female in the case of animals or both sexes, in the case of plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Parthenogenesis/ "Parthenogenesis."] Bio-Medicine. N.p., 2012. Web. 09 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not occur naturally in mammals.  In most animals, especially mammals, uniparental inheritance of chromosomes is often lethal or results in developmental abnormalities, sometimes physically but often cognitively. Other hypotheses point to the function of imprinting as a way of establishing the proper amount of expression or functional [[Ploidy|haploidy]], much like silencing the extra X-chromosome in females (see section on Barr bodies). Imprinting may help in the differentiation of cells by silencing [[pluripotency]] genes or other developmental genes. Supporting this hypothesis, imprinted genes have been shown to differ in their expression between tissue types in the same organism, pointing to divergent outcomes as a result of developmental events during embryogenesis. Regardless of whether there is a single purpose for imprinting, numerous studies have shown that a normal and functional organism cannot be made without the various imprinting mechanisms.

===Igf2 and H19===

In mammals, imprinted genes are often clustered in the genome, probably because they share transcriptional regulators or regulatory regions that impact the expression of multiple genes. It is easier for a lncRNA to silence multiple genes if they are closer together, making silencing more efficient. In some cases, when a gene is transcribed it overlaps another region nearby or opposite (antisense) to it, often silencing it. In the case of the Ifg2 and [[H19 (gene)|H19]] genes, [[CTCF]], a transcriptional repressor protein, is involved. CTCF binds to the unmethylated maternal ICR region but not the methylated paternal ICR region. ICR is a shared control region of Ifg2 and H19 that, when deleted, results in the loss of imprinting of these genes. CTCF then binds another region of the chromosome, creating a loop where Igf2 is blocked from transcription, but H19 is not, resulting in the maternal chromosome expressing H19 but not Igf2. CTCF has been shown to directly interact with Suz12, a subunit of PRC2, in order to silence the Ifg2 promoter region through hypermethylation. Conversely, the paternal H19 promoter is highly methylated during embryogenesis so that Ifg2 will not be silenced. Should CTCF fail to bind, H19 on the maternal chromosome has reduced expression and Igf2 is not silenced properly, resulting in biallelic expression. Mice have homologues of these genes, but silence them in a different way, where biallelic expression occurs and then [[antisense RNA]] is used to silence one of the genes.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Hallgrimsson, Benedikt, Ph.D.; Hall, Brian K., Ph.D.. Epigenetics: Linking Genotype and Phenotype in Development and Evolution. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011. Ebook Library. Web. 09 May. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igf2r and Airn===

Airn is an lncRNA used to silence Igf2r and other surrounding genes. In the mechanism to silence Igf2r, the transcription of the lncRNA Airn silences the expression of Igf2r, as opposed to an active repression mechanism. Airn is the antisense gene of Ifg2r, so if Airn is being transcribed, the transcriptional machinery may cover a part of or the entire promoter region of Igf2r, so RNA polymerase cannot bind to the promoter region of Igf2r in order to initiate transcription.  This mechanism is very efficient in that Igf2r is silenced by transcription of Airn, while the RNA product silences other genes near Igf2r.  The imprinting mechanisms described above work on the chromosome that the Airn lncRNA is produced, but there are many other imprinted genes that work to silence genes on other chromosomes or to silence the similar allele(s) on the opposing chromosome of the same pair. Some imprinted genes code for regulatory RNA elements such as lncRNA, [[small nucleolar RNA]], and [[MicroRNA|micro RNA]], so the expression of these genes results in the silencing of some other gene.

From these examples, researchers have seen similar patterns in [[developmental genetics]]. It is imperative that many genes are silenced at the right time so that cells can maintain their identity and expressional integrity. Failure to do so often leads to symptoms such as cognitive abnormalities, if not fatality.&lt;ref&gt;Latos, P.A. et al. (2012), [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1469.full?sid=e463183f-a61a-4825-a712-4b7ace47b7a5 "Airn Transcriptional Overlap, but not its lncRNA products, induces imprinted Ifg2r silencing."] Science. doi: 10.1126/science.1228110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of PRC2==
PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) is a complex of proteins that repress chromatin by histone methylation and by working to recruit other proteins that help further the repression of chromatin. The structure of this complex and group of mechanisms used by this complex are highly conserved across various [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] species. Very few species have duplicates of these complexes in the genome beyond PRC1 and PRC2.&lt;ref&gt;Mozgova, I., Köhler, C. and Hennig, L. (2015), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25687468 "Keeping the gate closed: functions of the polycomb repressive complex PRC2 in development."] The Plant Journal. doi: 10.1111/tpj.12828&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components and Repressive Functions===

PRC2 is a multi-protein complex composed of four major subunits (E2H1/2, SUZ12, EED, and RbAp46/48) and three variable subunits ([[AEBP2]], [[JARID2]], and PCLs).  The three variable subunits are used for catalysis of enzymatic reactions or binding to specific regions, not for repression of genes or chromatin. Similar to a [[zinc finger]], AEBP2 docks onto the major grooves of DNA to assist in binding.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio, C. et al. (2012), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3482686/ "Molecular architecture of human polycomb repressive complex 2."] eLife doi: 10.7554/eLife.00005&lt;/ref&gt; PRC2 is usually recruited by other proteins or lncRNa and then catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 tails (H3K27me3. This methylation is thought to cause repression by steric hindrance of RNA polymerase II. Even though the polymerase is not prevented from binding, the polymerase, after beginning transcription, will pause at H3K27me3 marks. The short transcript produced by the pausing of the polymerase often recruits regulatory complexes, like PRC2. Thus, PRC2 represses by two mechanisms: by directly altering the structure of the chromatin through methylation or by binding of transcripts.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Differential Behavior Due to Phosphorylation===

PRC2 has been shown in many experiments to be necessary for the proper [[Organogenesis|formation of organs]], starting with the maintenance of cellular differentiation and silencing of pluripotency genes.  The exact mechanism in early embryogenesis that induces cells to differentiate is still unclear, but this mechanism has been closely linked to [[protein kinase A]] (PKA). Since the PRC2 complex has sites able to be phosphorylated and has differentiated behavior based on the level of phosphorylation, a logical hypothesis can be made that PKA affects PRC2 behavior and may phosphorylate PRC2, activating the protein and starting the methylation cascade that silences genes.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamizu, K. et al. (2012), [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590912001154 "Protein Kinase A Determines Timing of Early Differentiation through Epigenetic Regulation with G9a."] Cell Stem Cell. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2012.02.022&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Cell Differentiation===

Experimentally, PRC2 has been shown to be highly enriched at the Hox genes and near developmental gene regulators, resulting in their methylation. Some time after the second or third cleavage event, PRC2 begins to bind to these developmental genes, even though they have the markers for highly active genes like H3K9me3. This has been described as the “leaking” of PRC2 binding. Variable binding will cause some genes to be silenced before others, causing differentiation, but this is likely regulated by the organism. What causes the specificity of cell differentiation is still unknown but some hypotheses say it largely has to do with the cell environment and the “awareness” of the cells to each other, considering all cells in this stage contain identical genomes at this point. The maintained cell lines after this differentiation event are largely dependent on PRC2. Without it, pluripotency genes will still be active, causing the cells to be unstable and reversion back to a [[stem cell]]-like stage where the cell would have to undergo differentiation again in order to return to its normal state. Properly differentiated cells have silenced pluripotency genes.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Margueron, R., Reinberg, D. (2011) [http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA247530231&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=txshracd2598&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=10e5be1f5ca2336527e2f163605143c6 "The Polycomb complex PRC2 and its mark in life."] Nature doi: 10.1038/nature09784&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binding Specificity Due to Recruitment by lncRNA===

Although PRC2 seems to have a very simple mechanism and works on many genes and chromosomes across the genome, it often has very specific binding regions and has been observed to localize to specific genes to cause their repression. Recent research shows that it probably does this through the binding of long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Xist and Hox genes have both been studied extensively and display this mechanism very well. The lncRNA that the complex binds does not necessarily need to hybridize to the target region in order to silence it, as evidenced by the PRC2-lncRNA complex working on regions other than the region from which this complex was produced. However, the three-dimensional configuration of the RNA often gives the complex specific localization to regions where the RNA is created to bind.

===Maintenance of Chromosome Condensation===

PRC2 is also highly associated with [[Intergenic region|intergenic regions]], subtelomeric regions, and long-terminal repeat [[transposons]]. PRC2 acts to create heterochromatin in these regions through similar mechanisms to the mechanism used to repress genes. Heterochromatin formation is imperative in these regions in order to regulate gene expression, maintain chromatin shape, prevent degradation of the chromosome, and reduce the event of transposon “hopping” or spontaneous recombination.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Thus, PRC2 is not only essential to the initiation of differentiation in development, but also for maintaining heterochromatin in all cell stages and for silencing genes and chromosome regions that would undo the cell differentiation that had already occurred or negatively affect the survival of the cell or the organism as a whole.

==Role of lncRNAs==

Long non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs, are RNA transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II that are not translated but participate in the regulation of gene expression. Long non-coding RNAs are used in various epigenetic processes in development, including the regulation of Hox genes, as well as in the creation of Barr bodies.

===lncRNAs in Hox Gene Regulation===

In Hox genes, long non-coding RNAs allow for communication between different Hox genes and different sets of Hox genes in order to coordinate body plan in the cell. One example of a long non-coding RNA that coordinates between Hox gene sets is HOTAIR, which is an RNA transcript produced in the HoxC cassette that represses transcription of a large number of genes in the HoxD cassette. Thus, HOTAIR regulates the HoxD genes from the HoxC genes in order to coordinate transcription of the Hox genes.&lt;ref&gt;Rinn, John L. et al. (2007), [http://farnham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/publications/2007/Rinn.pdf "Functional Demarcation of Active and Silent Chromatin Domains in Human Hox Loci by Noncoding RNAs."] Cell. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.022&lt;/ref&gt;

===lncRNAs in Barr Body Creation===

In human cells with more than one X chromosome, two long non-coding RNAs are produced: [[Tsix]] is produced by one X chromosome, and Xist is produced by all of the other X chromosomes. Tsix is a long non-coding RNA that prevents repression of an X chromosome, while Xist is a long non-coding RNA that acts to repress and condense an entire X chromosome. The actions of Xist serve to create a Barr body in the cell.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===lncRNAs in Paraspeckle Formation===

Neat1 is an lncRNA which assists in forming the structure of nuclear structures known as [[Paraspeckle|paraspeckles]]: nuclear bodies which contain RNA-binding proteins.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Nakagawa, S. et al. (2014), [http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/23/4618.long "The lncRNA Neat1 is required for corpus luteum formation and the establishment of pregnancy in a subpopulation of mice."] Development. doi: 10.1242/dev.110544&lt;/ref&gt; They control gene expression in the nucleus by retaining RNA in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] that would otherwise alter gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, A.H., Lamond, A.I. (2010), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2890200 "Paraspeckles."] Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a000687&lt;/ref&gt; Paraspeckles form a significant portion of the [[corpus luteum]] of the [[ovary]]; in [[NEAT1|Neat1]] impaired mice, corpus luteum formation is highly dysfunctional, causing ovarian defects and lowered [[progesterone]] levels resulting in a lack of pregnancy in Neat1 deficient mice. Neat1 assists in regulation of luteal genes by preventing the protein [[SFPQ|Sfpq]] from inhibiting [[NR5A1|Nr5a1]] and Sp1, allowing luteal genes to be regularly transcribed. Neat1 is regulated by histone deacetylases.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

===lncRNAs in Neuronal Differentiation===

[[Evf-2|Evf2]] is a lncRNA that acts in [[forebrain]] neuronal differentiation during embryonic development.  Evf2 is transcribed from an ultraconserved region, or a region that is very highly conserved among most [[vertebrate]] species, within the region from [[DLX5|Dlx5]] to [[DLX6|Dlx6]]. This region is a target for SHH, a highly important regulator of [[central nervous system]] development. Evf2, when transcribed, recruits Dlx and [[MECP2|Mecp2]] through cis and trans-acting mechanisms to the Dlx5/6 region in the ventral forebrain, causing [[GABAergic]] interneurons in the [[hippocampus]] to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;Feng, Jianchi, Chunming Bi, Brian S. Clark, Rina Mady, Palak Shah, and Jhumku D. Kohtz. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1475760/ "The Evf-2 Noncoding RNA Is Transcribed from the Dlx-5/6 Ultraconserved Region and Functions as a Dlx-2 Transcriptional Coactivator."] Genes &amp; Development. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Evf2 acts by forming a complex with [[DLX4|Dlx4]] that increases Dlx4 transcription activation ability and stability.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Roberts T.C., Morris, K.V., and Wood, M.J.A. (2014), [http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1652/20130507 "The role of long non-coding RNAs in neurodevelopment, brain function and neurological disease."] Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. doi: 10.1098/rstb.2013.0507&lt;/ref&gt;

Malat1, another neurological lncRNA, causes increased synaptic function and greater amounts of dendrite development. Increases of Malat1 increase neuronal density, while decreases of Malat1 decrease neuronal density. Malat1 acts by regulating the expression levels of Nlgn1 and SynCAM1 which are important genes in synapse formation.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

===lncRNAs in Igf2r Regulation===

The lncRNA Airn is an lncRNA that regulates Igf2r expression. Igf2r is a gene which expresses a receptor for [[insulin-like growth factor 2]], and assists in [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] enzyme transport, activation of [[Growth factor|growth factors]], and degradation of insulin-like growth factor 2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3482 "Genes and Mapped Phenotypes."] National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; This lncRNA is an RNA modified by imprinting, leading to Airn expression in the paternal allele, but not in the maternal allele. Airn acts by cis-acting silencing of the Igf2r region through overlapping the Igf2r gene through the antisense transcript encoded by Airn. Airn is silenced in the maternal allele through Igf2r transcription. In the brain, however, Igf2r alleles are both expressed due to Airn mediation being repressed in neuronal cells.&lt;ref&gt;Guibert, S., Weber, M. (2013), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587238 "Functions of DNA Methylation and Hydroxymethylation in Mammalian Development. Epigenetics and Development."] doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-416027-9.00002-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of BRD4==

Bromodomain protein 4, or [[BRD4]], is a protein which binds to acetylated tails of histones H3 and H4 to aid active gene transcription by decompaction using the [[bromodomain]] with the assistance of the acetylated K5 on H4. BRD4 is a member of the BET protein family, which includes other bromodomain-containing proteins and their homologues in other species. BRD4 is a protein which functions in both gene activation and repression in [[cell cycle]] control and [[DNA replication]]. BRD4 functions by binding to the acetylated tails and then attaching to other proteins, allowing those proteins to 
either activate or repress the histones next to BRD4.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, S.Y., Chiang, C.M. (2007), [http://m.jbc.org/content/282/18/13141.full "The Double Bromodomain-containing Chromatin Adaptor Brd4 and Transcriptional Regulation."] The Journal of Biological Chemistry. doi: 10.1074/jbc.R700001200&lt;/ref&gt;

BRD4 aids in early cell development by activating pluripotent genes through interacting with [[Oct-4|Oct4]] and recruiting [[P-TEFb]] (positive transcription elongation factor). By occupying pluripotent genes and X-chromosome inactivation lncRNAs in their regulatory regions, BRD4 enhances activation of these DNA regions. BRD4 enhances this activation by recruiting P-TEFb; if either BRD4 or P-TEFb is not functional, pluripotent gene transcription is blocked, and the cell differentiates into a neuroectodermal cell.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Wu, T. et al. (2015), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375790 "The BET Family Member BRD4 Interacts with OCT4 and Regulates Pluripotency Gene Expression."] Stem Cell Reports. doi: 10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.01.012&lt;/ref&gt;

BRD4 can act as epigenetic bookmarking throughout the cell cycle, including after transcription, due to its association with P-TEFb, allowing BRD4 to enhance RNAPII.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

BRD4 also assists in the hyperacetylation of histones in the [[Pronucleus|sperm nucleus]]. Histone hyperacetylation, the addition of acetyl groups to lysines on the amino tails of histones in an amount much larger than normal, is believed to assist in histone removal from the sperm nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J.M. et al. (2015), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25691659 "Characterization of BRD4 during Mammalian Postmeiotic Sperm Development.] Molecular and Cellular Biology. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01328-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethelwyn Manning (23 November 1885 – 1 June 1972) was the second Chief Librarian of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]]. During [[World War II]], she assisted the Committee of the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) on Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas, later known as the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA).

==Education==

Manning graduated from [[Smith College]] in 1908 and the school of Library Science at [[Simmons College]] in 1911. She also studied at the Training School for Children's Librarians at the [[Carnegie Library]], Pittsburgh.

==Career==

Manning began her career as a Children's Librarian at the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] in 1909. She subsequently held positions in the public libraries of [[Burlington, Iowa]], [[Cedar Rapids]], Iowa, and [[Milton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iowa Library Quarterly'' (1912). Volume 6, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, she was appointed Head Cataloger of the [[Amherst College]] Library in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal'' (1917). Volume 42 (February), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1924, Manning was appointed the second Chief Librarian of the Frick Art Reference Library, a research institute dedicated to promoting the study of art history and related subjects that had been founded four years earlier by [[Helen Clay Frick]] as a memorial to her father, the collector [[Henry Clay Frick]].&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Katharine McCook (1979). ''The Story of the Frick Art Reference Library: The Early Years''. New York: The Library, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Manning worked at the Frick Art Reference Library for twenty-four years, overseeing the institution's transfer from its original location in a two and one-half story building at 6 East 71st Street to its present thirteen story building located at 10 East 71st Street.&lt;ref&gt;Knox (1979), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, when the Committee of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS) on Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas was in residence at the Library, she worked alongside art historians on the Committee to prepare maps detailing the location of art treasures and landmarks in war zones and in danger of Nazi plundering. Manning was also instrumental in developing the institution's collection of study photographs of works of art, acquiring thousands of reproductions from European photographers and hiring photographers in the United States to travel through the country and photograph inaccessible paintings in private collections.&lt;ref&gt; Knox (1979), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting collection, which presently comprises more than one million images, documents the Western artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt; Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive: Holdings (2015). http://www.frick.org/research/photoarchive/holdings.

The '''Federal University of Agriculture, [[Abeokuta]]''', [[Ogun State]], or '''FUNAAB''', ([http://www.unaab.edu.ng FUNAAB]) was established on 1st of January, 1988 by the Federal Government when four universities of technology, earlier merged in 1984, were demerged. This led to the creation of the first two universities of agriculture in Abeokuta and [[Makurdi]].

On the same date, Professor Nurudeen Olorun-Nimbe Adedipe was appointed the pioneer Vice-Chancellor of the university.  Professor Adedipe officially assumed duty on 28th of January, 1988. For many years the date which Professor Adedipe assumed duty was wrongly adopted as the foundation day.  Following a revisit to the instrument setting up the university, a council decision at its 53rd statutory meeting in June 2010 reverted the foundation date to 1st, January 1988 as prescribed by the law which established the university.

Prior to the emergence of [http://www.unaab.edu.ng FUNAAB], the Federal Government had established [[Federal Government of Nigeria|Federal]] [[University]] of [[Technology]], [[Abeokuta]] (FUTAB) in 1983. Then, in 1984, it was merged with the University of Lagos and had its name changed to the College of Science and Technology, Abeokuta (COSTAB), before the demerger of January, 1988.

The university started off from the old campus of [[Abeokuta Grammar School]], Isale-Igbein near the city centre. It completed its movement to its permanent site along Alabata Road in 1997.

At the initial stage, five colleges were introduced in the university in October 1988 as follows:
*    College of Agricultural Management, [[Rural development]] and Communication Studies (COLAMRUCS), which name was later changed to COLAMRUD (College Of Agriculture Management and Rural Development)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110907150444/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colanim.html College of Animal Science and Livestock Production] (COLANIM)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110902141612/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colerm.html College of Environmental Resources Management] (COLERM)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110908052118/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colnas.html College of Natural Sciences] (COLNAS)

College of Natural Science was reformed and redrafted into 2 colleges which are College of Physical Sciences (COLPHYS) and College of Biological Science (COLBIOS)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110909005025/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colplant.html College of Plant Science and Crop Production] (COLPLANT)

Two additional Colleges, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110904022211/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/coleng.html College of Engineering] (COLENG) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006174137/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colvet.html College of Veterinary Medicine] (COLVET) were introduced in March, 2002. During the 2008/2009 session, the College of Agricultural Management, Rural Development and Communication Studies was split into two, with two new colleges emerging as follows:
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110908070629/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colfhec.html College of Food Science and Human Ecology] (COLFHEC)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110909033604/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/c.html College of Agricultural Management and Rural Development] (COLAMRUD)
The newest college is [https://web.archive.org/web/20121123192138/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colleges/management-sciences-.html College of Management Sciences] (COLMAS)

The university is one of the three universities of agriculture in [[Nigeria]], the other being in [[Makurdi]] (Benue State) and [[Umudike]] (Abia State). The university started at its mini-campus in Isale-Igbein in the heart of [[Abeokuta]], the capital of [[Ogun State]]. In December 1997, it moved to its permanent site on a 10,000-hectare campus which is located next to the Ogun-Oshun River Basin Development Authority on the Abeokuta-Ibadan road in the North Eastern end of the city, 15&amp;nbsp;km from Abeokuta City Centre.

==Governing council==
The first council was constituted on 18 May 1989 under the chairmanship of Alhaji Muhammadu Jega, former Head of Service and Secretary to the Sokoto State Government. On 1 September 1990, the council was reconstituted with some changes for five years with Alhaji Muhammadu Jega retained as Chairman. The second governing council was constituted in 2000 for five years, with Alhaji Sanni Bagiwa Idris as Chairman. The third council came on board in 2005 and was dissolved in November, 2007 by the Federal Government. Elder Brigadier General (Rtd.) Bassey Asuquo, a one-time Military Administrator of Kogi, Edo and Delta States respectively, was the Chairman. The fourth council was constituted in January 2009 with Mr. Raphael Oluwole Osayameh as Chairman and immediate past Pro-Chancellor.  Chief Lawrence Ayinde Osayemi was Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council. Senator Adeseye Ogunlewe Kingsley, a one time Minister of works and Service of the Federation, a former Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is the immediate Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council. Presently, Dr. (Barr.) Aboki Zhawa, an astute administrator, a legal luminary, educationalist and politician is the Pro-Chancellor and the Chairman of the Governing Council.

==Chancellors==

==Academic Planning Unit==
The Academic Planning Unit is the quality control unit of the university and the link between the university and the National Universities Commission. It is at the centre of all planning activities of the University. The unit is headed by a Director, Professor M.A. Waheed, a Principal Planning Officer, Mr. O.O. Bamgbose and other Planning Officers (Mrs. A.A. Akintunde, Mr. A.O. Kuforiji and Mr. S.A. Dada).

==Library==
‘Nimbe Adedipe Library' was named in honour of the first Vice-Chancellor of the University, Professor Nurudeen Olorunnimbe Adedipe. The library building can accommodate 1000 users at a time.  The total collection of books at present is 54,000 titles.

The library started its automation programme in 1994 when it acquired through a [[World Bank Project]], an IBM personal computer and the [[TINLIB]] library software designed for four work stations. This was later upgraded to ten work stations. The library has since migrated from the DOS based TINLIB software to a more versatile windows based [[GLAS]] (Graphical Library Automated System) software with the capability to operate 50 work stations within the library. OPAC is fully functional making it possible to catalogue books on line and for library clients to access such books immediately.

'''George Herbert Mead''' (February 27, 1863 – April 26, 1931) was an [[Americans|American]] [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]] and [[psychologist]], primarily affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]], where he was one of several distinguished [[pragmatism|pragmatist]]s. He is regarded as one of the founders of [[symbolic interactionism]] and of what has come to be referred to as the Chicago sociological tradition.

== Biography ==
Mead was born February 27, 1863 in [[South Hadley]], Massachusetts. He was raised in a Protestant, middle-class family comprising his father, Hiram Mead, his mother, Elizabeth Storrs (Billings) Mead, and his sister Alice. His father was a former [[Congregationalist]] Pastor from a lineage of farmers and clergymen and who later held the chair in Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology at [[Oberlin College]]'s theological seminary. [[Elizabeth Storrs Mead]] taught for two years at Oberlin College and subsequently, from 1890 to 1900, served as president of Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = John | authorlink = | title = George Herbert Mead | publisher = Sage | year = 2009 | location = | page= 7 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8039-2320-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, George Mead enrolled at Oberlin College, graduating in 1883 with a BA degree. After graduation, Mead taught grade school for about four months. For the following three years, he worked as a surveyor for the [[Wisconsin Central Railroad Company]].

In autumn 1887, Mead enrolled at [[Harvard University]], where his main interests were [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].  At Harvard, Mead studied with [[Josiah Royce]], a major influence upon his thought, and [[William James]], whose children he tutored.  In 1888, Mead left Harvard after receiving only a B.A. and moved to Leipzig, Germany to study with psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]], from whom he learned the concept of "the gesture," a concept central to his later work.

In 1891 he married Helen Kingsbury Castle (1860–1929), the sister of Henry Northrup Castle (1862–1895), a friend he met at Oberlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary A. |last=Cook |title=George Herbert Mead: the making of a social pragmatist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1Ki8BMXJRIC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=1993 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-06272-8 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite never finishing his dissertation, Mead was able to obtain a post at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1891. At the University of Michigan, Mead met [[Charles H. Cooley]] and [[John Dewey]], both of whom would influence him greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = David | authorlink = | title = George Herbert Mead: Self, Language, and the World | publisher = University of Texas Press | year = 2009 | location = | pages= xii-xix | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-292-72700-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 Mead moved, along with Dewey, to the [[University of Chicago]], where he taught until his death. Dewey's influence led Mead into educational theory, but his thinking soon diverged from that of Dewey, and developed into his famous psychological theories of mind, self and society.&lt;ref name="Ritz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ritzer | first = George | authorlink = | title = Sociological Theory | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2008 | location = | isbn = 978-0-07-352818-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|352–353 }}

No detached philosopher, he was active in Chicago's social and political affairs; among his many activities include his work for the [[City Club of Chicago]].  He believed that science could be used to deal with social problems and played a key role in conducting research at the settlement house in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Ritz"/&gt;{{rp|353}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= George H. Mead |title= The Social Settlement: Its basis and function |journal= University of Chicago Record |year= 1907 |pages= 108–110  |url= http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1907g.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as treasurer for Chicago's Hull House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Social Theory|last = Ritzer|first = George|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2004|isbn = 0-7619-2611-9|location = Thousand Oaks, California|pages = 491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = George Herbert Mead, Philosophy|url = https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/projects/centcat/centcats/fac/facch12_01.html|website = www.lib.uchicago.edu|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mead died of heart failure on April 26, 1931.

== Writings ==
In a career spanning more than 40 years, Mead wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in both philosophy and psychology.  However, he did not publish any books.  Following his death, several of his students put together and edited four volumes from records of Mead's social psychology course at the University of Chicago, his lecture notes, and his numerous unpublished papers.  The four volumes are: Mead's 1930 [[Carus Lectures]], edited by Charles W. Morris; ''The Philosophy of the Present'' (1932), edited by Arthur E. Murphy; ''[[Mind, Self and Society]]'' (1934), edited by [[Charles W. Morris]]; ''Movements of Thought in the Nineteenth Century'' (1936), edited by Merritt H. Moore; and ''The Philosophy of the Act'' (1938).

Most notable among Mead's published papers are "Suggestions Towards a Theory of the Philosophical Disciplines" (1900);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1900a.html] "Suggestions Towards a Theory of the Philosophical Disciplines" (1900)&lt;/ref&gt;  "Social Consciousness and the Consciousness of Meaning" (1910);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1910a.html] "Social Consciousness and the Consciousness of Meaning" (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;  "What Social Objects Must Psychology Presuppose" (1910);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1910d.html] "What Social Objects Must Psychology Presuppose" (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; "The Mechanism of Social Consciousness" (1912);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1912a.html] "The Mechanism of Social Consciousness"&lt;/ref&gt; "The Social Self" (1913);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1913.html] "The Social Self" (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;  "Scientific Method and the Individual Thinker"(1917);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1917g.html] "Scientific Method and the Individual Thinker" (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; "A Behavioristic Account of the Significant Symbol" (1922);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1922.html] "A Behavioristic Account of the Significant Symbol" (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; "The Genesis of Self and Social Control"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1925.html |title=George Herbert Mead: The Genesis of the Self and Social Control |publisher=Brocku.ca |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1925); "The Objective Reality of Perspectives"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs2/papers/Mead_1926b.html |title=George Herbert Mead: The Objective Reality of Perspectives |publisher=Brocku.ca |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1926); "The Nature of the Past"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs2/papers/Mead_1929d.html |title=George Herbert Mead: The Nature of the Past |publisher=Brocku.ca |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1929); and "The Philosophies of Royce, James, and Dewey in Their American Setting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs2/papers/Mead_1930c.html |title=George Herbert Mead: The Philosophies of Royce, James and Dewey in their American setting |publisher=Brocku.ca |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1929).

In his lifetime, Mead published around 100 scholarly articles, reviews, and incidental pieces. Given their diverse nature, access to these writings is difficult. The first editorial efforts to change this situation date from the 1960s. In 1964, Andrew J. Reck collected twenty-five of Mead's published articles in {{cite book | title = Selected Writings: George Herbert Mead | publisher = Bobbs-Merrill, The Liberal Arts Press | year = 1964}}&lt;ref name=iep&gt;{{citation | last = Cronk | first = George | authorlink = | editor1-last = Fieser | editor1-first = James | editor2-last = Dowden | editor2-first = Bradley | contribution = George Herbert Mead | title = [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | year = 2005 | contribution-url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/mead/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, John W. Petras published ''George Herbert Mead. Essays on his Social Psychology'', a collection of fifteen articles that included previously unpublished manuscripts.

More recently, Mary Jo Deegan published ''Essays in Social Psychology'' (2001), a book project originally abandoned by Mead in the early 1910s. In 2010, Filipe Carreira da Silva edited the ''G.H. Mead. A Reader'', the most comprehensive collection to date. It includes thirty of Mead's most important articles, ten of which previously unpublished.

The Mead Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/ The Mead Project at Brock University]&lt;/ref&gt; at Brock University in Ontario intends to publish all of Mead's 80-odd remaining unpublished manuscripts.

== Pragmatism and symbolic interaction ==
Much of Mead's work focused on the development of the self and the objectivity of the world within the social realm: he insisted that "the individual mind can exist only in relation to other minds with shared meanings" (Mead 1982: 5).

The two most important roots of Mead's work, and of [[symbolic interactionism]] in general, are the philosophy of pragmatism and social (as opposed to psychological) [[behaviorism]] (i.e.: Mead was concerned with the stimuli of gestures and social objects with rich meanings rather than bare physical objects which psychological behaviourists considered stimuli).  Pragmatism is a wide-ranging philosophical position from which several aspects of Mead's influences can be identified.

There are four main tenets of pragmatism (see [http://www.iep.utm.edu/pragmati/#H2the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]): First, to pragmatists true reality does not exist "out there" in the real world, it "is actively created as we act in and toward the world." Second, people remember and base their knowledge of the world on what has been useful to them and are likely to alter what no longer "works." Third, people define the social and physical "objects" they encounter in the world according to their use for them. Lastly, if we want to understand actors, we must base that understanding on what people actually do. Three of these ideas are critical to symbolic interactionism:
#the focus on the interaction between the actor and the world
#a view of both the actor and the world as dynamic processes and not static structures and
#the actor's ability to interpret the social world.
Thus, to Mead and symbolic interactionists, consciousness is not separated from action and interaction, but is an integral part of both. Symbolic interactionism as a pragmatic philosophy was an antecedent to the philosophy of [[transactionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Transactionalism-Historical-Interpretive-Trevor-Phillips-ebook/dp/B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|edition=2|location=|pages=54|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mead's theories in part, based on pragmatism and behaviorism, were transmitted to many graduate students at the University of Chicago who then went on to establish symbolic interactionism.&lt;ref name="Ritz"/&gt;{{rp|347–350}}

== Social philosophy (behaviorism) ==
Mead was a very important figure in 20th century social philosophy.  One of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms, discussed in ''Mind, Self and Society,'' also known as social behaviorism.&lt;ref name=Macmillan&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Borchert | editor-first = Donald M. | last = Desmonde | first = William H | authorlink = | chapter = Mead, George Herbert (1863-1931) | origyear = 1967 | title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy | volume = 6 | publisher = Macmillan Reference | year = 2006 | pages = 79–82 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-02-865786-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the [[symbolic interactionist]] school of sociology.  Rooted intellectually in [[Hegel]]ian dialectics and process philosophy, Mead, like Dewey, developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action. Human activity is, in a pragmatic sense, the criterion of truth, and through human activity meaning is made. Joint activity, including communicative activity, is the means through which our sense of self is constituted.  The essence of Mead's social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm, nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure.  This approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body.  The emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment; it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior, that is, thought. Mind, in Mead's terms, is the individualized focus of the communication process.  It is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual. There is, then, no "mind or thought without language;" and language (the content of mind) "is only a development and product of social interaction" (Mind, Self and Society 191-192). Thus, mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual, but is emergent in "the dynamic, ongoing social process" that constitutes human experience (Mind, Self and Society 7).&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;

For Mead, mind arises out of the social act of communication. Mead's concept of the social act is relevant, not only to his theory of mind, but to all facets of his social philosophy. His theory of "mind, self, and society" is, in effect, a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals, just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment.&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;  Action is very important to his social theory and, according to Mead, actions also occur within a communicative process. The initial phase of an act constitutes a gesture. A gesture is a preparatory movement that enables other individuals to become aware of the intentions of the given organism. The rudimentary situation is a conversation of gestures, in which a gesture on the part of the first individual evokes a preparatory movement on the part of the second, and the gesture of the second organism in turn calls out a response in the first person. On this level no communication occurs. Neither organism is aware of the effect of its own gestures upon the other; the gestures are nonsignificant. For communication to take place, each organism must have knowledge of how the other individual will respond to his own ongoing act. Here the gestures are significant symbols.&lt;ref name=Macmillan /&gt;  A significant symbol is a kind of gesture that only humans can make.&lt;ref&gt;This has been a contentious issue in the burgeoning field of Human Animal Studies. For a discussion see Wilkie, R. &amp; McKinnon, A. (2013). 'George Herbert Mead on Humans and Other Animals: Social Relations after Human-Animal Studies'. Sociological Research Online, vol 18, no. 4, 19. [http://www.socresonline.org.uk/18/4/19.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gestures become significant symbols when they arouse in the individual who is making them the same kind of response they are supposed to elicit from those to whom the gestures are addressed.  Only when we have significant symbols can we truly have communication.&lt;ref name="Ritz"/&gt;{{rp|356–357}}  Mead grounded human perception in an "action-nexus" (Joas 1985: 148). We perceive the world in terms of the "means of living" (Mead 1982: 120). To perceive food, is to perceive eating. To perceive a house, is to perceive shelter. That is to say, perception is in terms of action. Mead's theory of perception is similar to that of [[J. J. Gibson]].

Mead the social psychologist argued in tune with Durkheim that the individual is a product of an ongoing, preexisting [[society]], or more specifically, social interaction that is a consequence of a sui generis society. The ''self'' arises when the individual becomes an object to themselves. Mead argued that we are objects first to other people, and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people. Language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people, and thus through language we become other to ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Becoming Other: From Social Interaction to Self-Reflection | last = Gillespie | first = Alex | year = 2006 | publisher = Information Age Publishing | isbn = 978-1-59311-230-1 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/40487521/Becoming-Other-From-Social-Interaction-to-Self-Reflection}}&lt;/ref&gt; In joint activity, which Mead called 'social acts', humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their co-actors. A central mechanism within the social act, which enables perspective taking, is position exchange. People within a social act often alternate social positions (e.g., giving/receiving, asking/helping, winning/losing, hiding/seeking, talking/listening). In children's games there is repeated position exchange, for example in hide-and-seek, and Mead argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops.

However, for Mead, unlike [[John Dewey]] and [[J. J. Gibson]], the key is not simply human action, but rather social action. In humans the "manipulatory phase of the act" is socially mediated, that is to say, in acting towards objects humans simultaneously take the perspectives of others towards that object. This is what Mead means by "the social act" as opposed to simply "the act" (the latter being a Deweyan concept). Non-human animals also manipulate objects, but that is a non-social manipulation, they do not take the perspective of other organisms toward the object. Humans on the other hand, take the perspective of other actors towards objects, and this is what enables complex human society and subtle social coordination. In the social act of economic exchange, for example, both buyer and seller must take each other's perspectives towards the object being exchanged. The seller must recognize the value for the buyer, while the buyer must recognize the desirability of money for the seller. Only with this mutual perspective taking can the economic exchange occur (Mead was influenced on this point by [[Adam Smith]]).

==Nature of the self==
A final piece of Mead's social theory is the mind as the individual importation of the social process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=edited|first1=George H. Mead ;|last2=Morris|first2=with an introduction by Charles W.|title=Mind, self, and society from the standpoint of a social behaviorist|date=1967|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago London|isbn=9780226516608|pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mead states, "The self is a social process," meaning that there are series of actions that go on in the mind to help formulate one's complete self. As previously discussed, Mead presented the self and the mind in terms of a social process. As gestures are taken in by the individual organism, the individual organism also takes in the collective attitudes of others, in the form of gestures, and reacts accordingly with other organized attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=George H.|last2=Morris|first2=Charles W.|title=Mind, self, and society from the standpoint of a social behaviorist|date=1967|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago London|isbn=9780226516608|pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is characterized by Mead as the [['I' and the 'me'|"I" and the "Me"]]. The "Me" is the social self and the "I" is the response to the "Me." In other words, the "I" is the response of an individual to the attitudes of others, while the "me" is the organized set of attitudes of others which an individual assumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=George H.|last2=Morris|first2=Charles W.|title=Mind, self, and society from the standpoint of a social behaviorist|date=1967|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago London|isbn=9780226516608|pages=174–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Margolis | first = Joseph | authorlink = |author2=Jacques Catudal | title = The Quarrel between Invariance and Flux| publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press| year = 2001 | location = Pennsylvania| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mead develops [[William James]]' distinction between the "I" and the "me." The "me" is the accumulated understanding of "the generalized other" i.e. how one thinks one's group perceives oneself etc. The "I" is the individual's impulses. The "I" is self as subject; the "me" is self as object. The "I" is the knower, the "me" is the known. The mind, or stream of thought, is the self-reflective movements of the interaction between the "I" and the "me." There is neither "I" nor "me" in the conversation of gestures; the whole act is not yet carried out, but the preparation takes place in this field of gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MIND, SELF and SOCIETY|last=Mead|first=George|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1934|isbn=978-0-226-51668-4|location=Chicago|pages=175|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dynamics go beyond selfhood in a narrow sense, and form the basis of a theory of human cognition. For Mead the thinking process is the internalized dialogue between the "I" and the "me." Mead rooted the self's "[[perception]] and meaning" deeply and sociologically in "a common [[praxis (process)|praxis]] of subjects" (Joas 1985: 166) found specifically in social encounters.   Understood as a combination of the [['I' and the 'me']], Mead's self proves to be noticeably entwined within a sociological existence. For Mead, existence in community comes before individual consciousness. First one must participate in the different social positions within society and only subsequently can one use that experience to take the perspective of others and thus become self-conscious.

==Philosophy of science==
Mead is a major American philosopher by virtue of being, along with [[John Dewey]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] and [[William James]], one of the founders of [[pragmatism]].  He also made significant contributions to the philosophies of nature, science, and history, to [[philosophical anthropology]], and to [[process philosophy]].  Dewey and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] considered Mead a thinker of the first rank. He is a classic example of a social theorist whose work does not fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries.

As far as his work on the philosophy of science, Mead sought to find the psychological origin of science in the efforts of individuals to attain power over their environment. The notion of a physical object arises out of manipulatory experience.  There is a social relation to inanimate objects, for the organism takes the role of things that it manipulates directly, or that it manipulates indirectly in perception.  For example, in taking (introjecting or imitating) the resistant role of a solid object, an individual obtains cognition of what is "inside" nonliving things.  Historically, the concept of the physical object arose from an animistic conception of the universe.

Contact experience includes experiences of position, balance, and support, and these are used by the organism when it creates its conceptions of the physical world. Our scientific concepts of space, time, and mass are abstracted from manipulatory experience. Such concepts as that of the electron are also derived from manipulation. In developing a science we construct hypothetical objects in order to assist ourselves in controlling nature. The conception of the present as a distinct unit of experience, rather than as a process of becoming and disappearing, is a scientific fiction devised to facilitate exact measurement. In the scientific worldview immediate experience is replaced by theoretical constructs. The ultimate in experience, however, is the manipulation and contact at the completion of an act.&lt;ref name=Macmillan /&gt;

== Play and game and the generalized other ==
Mead theorized that human beings begin their understanding of the social world through "play" and "game". "Play" comes first in the child's development. The child takes different roles he/she observes in "adult" society, and plays them out to gain an understanding of the different social roles. For instance, he first plays the role of policeman and then the role of thief while playing "Cops and Robbers," and plays the role of doctor and patient when playing "Doctor."  As a result of such play, the child learns to become both subject and object and begins to become able to build a self.  However, it is a limited self because the child can only take the role of distinct and separate others, they still lack a more general and organized sense of themselves.&lt;ref name="Ritz"/&gt;{{rp|360}}

In the next stage, the game stage, it is required that a person develop a full sense of self.  Whereas in the play stage the child takes on the role of distinct others, in the game stage the child must take the role of everyone else involved in the game.  Furthermore, these roles must have a definite relationship to one another.  To illustrate the game stage, Mead gives his famous example of a baseball game:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But in a game where a number of individuals are involved, then the child taking one role must be ready to take the role of everyone else.  If he gets in a ball nine he must have the responses of each position involved in his own position.  He must know what everyone else is going to do in order to carry out his own play.  He has to take all of these roles.  They do not all have to be present in consciousness at the same time, but at some moments he has to have three or four individuals present in his own attitude, such as the one who is going to throw the ball, the one who is going to catch it and so on.  These responses must be, in some degree, present in his own make-up.  In the game, then, there is a set of responses of such others so organized that the attitude of one calls out the appropriate attitudes of the other. (Mead, 1934/1962:151)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the game stage, organization begins and definite personalities start to emerge.  Children begin to become able to function in organized groups and most importantly, to determine what they will do within a specific group.&lt;ref name="Ritz"/&gt;{{rp|360–361}}  Mead calls this the child's first encounter with "the [[generalized other]]", which is one of the main concepts Mead proposes for understanding the emergence of the (social) self in human beings. "The generalized other" can be thought of as understanding the given activity and the actors' place within the activity from the perspective of all the others engaged in the activity. Through understanding "the generalized other" the individual understands what kind of behavior is expected, appropriate and so on, in different social settings.

How does perspective taking occur according to Mead? It has been argued that social acts (such as games and routine forms of social interaction) enable perspective taking through 'position exchange'.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions, and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives, then it might be that by moving between roles in a game (e.g. between hiding and seeking or buying and selling) we come to learn about the perspective of the other. This new interpretation of Mead's account of taking the perspective of the other has experimental support.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin (2013-2016)===

GlamSci originally started as a blog for the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/reading-survey-response-amy-king|title=reading experiment survey response - amy king - Edinburgh International Science Festival - Edinburgh International Science Festival|website=Edinburgh International Science Festival|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as 'The Life and Times of a Chemistry Nerd', it documented the experiences of GlamSci Co-Founder Amy King through College and University as a young disabled woman in STEM after being 
"[[Women in STEM fields|repeatedly told "pure science isn’t for girls]]".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unialliance.ac.uk/2018/06/06/amy-king-bsc-hons-natural-sciences/|title=Amy King, BSc (Hons) Natural Sciences {{!}} University Alliance|website=www.unialliance.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}

GlamSci was unofficially founded in 2013, following a number of requests for female speakers, and workshops from the founding members of GlamSci. &lt;/ref&gt; Members have attended "educational events for educators and educational leaders, such as WorldTeachIn, and Athena Swan and Bett events".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GlamSci founding members worked for 3 years offering speakers for these types of educational events and built up a portfolio of other events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.1851trust.org.uk/1851-trusts-next-generation-roadshow-inspires-girls-science-technology/|title=1851 Trust’s #Next Generation Roadshow inspires girls in Science and Technology - 1851 Trust|date=2017-11-17|work=1851 Trust|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support that turned into official GlamSci Events and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techtalentcharter.co.uk/another-look-techs-diversity-problem/|title=Another look at tech’s diversity problem - Tech Talent Charter|website=techtalentcharter.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth (2016-Present)===
On November 2, 2017, the UK Department of Education recognized Amy King of GlamSci for "inspiring young people to work in science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/twitter/educationgovuk?year_from=2012&amp;year_to=2017&amp;amount=30&amp;sort=desc&amp;from=990|title=The National Archives - Department for Education {{!}} Twitter Archive - UK Government Web Archive|last=Archives|first=The National|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian Social Institute, Bangalore,''' has been an extension service of the [[Jesuits]] in [[Pune]], [[New Delhi]], [[India]], since the 1950s, working for social change in the interests of poor and underserved peoples. In 1993 it became an independent [[NGO]] and took its current name.

== Historical background ==
In 1951, [[Jerome D'Souza]], an educator and member of the [[Indian Constituent Assembly]], founded the Indian Institute of Social Order in [[Pune]], India, to contribute to the emergence of a new social order in post-independence India. Regional training centres were established in various parts of the country, including [[Bangalore]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} 

In 1963 the Institute in Pune moved to [[New Delhi]] and in 1967 became [[Indian Social Institute]]. Extension services increased especially in the southern states around Bangalore, giving assistance to the cooperative movement and offering consultancy services for development agencies, among other programs. Trainees spent up to three months learning the process of social analysis and skills for social mobilization. Numerous action groups emerged, trained at ISI-B, such as the fisherman's movement in [[Kerala]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Since the 1980s the Documentation Centre of [[Indian Social Institute]] functioned out of Bangalore furnishing documentation for activists throughout India. By 1993 the need was realized to make the Indian Social Institute in Bangalore a separate [[NGO]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isibangalore.com/about.html|title=Historical survey|last=|first=|date=|website=www.isibangalore.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject Matter==

Parliamentary and Political Law means the field of law, legal scholarship and legal practice relating to the functions and operations of parliamentary, governmental and judicial institutions and their respective officials.

Parliamentary Law means the body of law dealing with the establishment and functioning of parliamentary institutions, and includes the law of parliamentary privilege.

Political Law means the body of law dealing with the structure of the State and the processes of governing, with the application of legal, public policy and political instruments of governing, and with the impact of law on democratic governing.

Within the overall domain of public law, Parliamentary and Political Law is complementary to constitutional law and administrative law.  As an interdisciplinary study, it is distinct from, yet linked to, political science, and public policy and administration.

The Institute (and through its Journal) specializes in the interdisciplinary, comprehensive and comparative analysis of these topics.

==Publications and Programs==

The Institute publishes [http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/journal.aspx?section=36 The Journal of Parliamentary and Political Law] three times a year, which is available through [[Carswell (publishers)|Carswell Thomson]].

It also hosts a bi-annual conference, and The Third ''Law and Parliament'' Conference was held
November 2009 at the [[University of Toronto]].

[[File:Tusk carving National Museum India.jpg|thumb|20th century carved ivory tusk at Decorative Arts Gallery, National Museum, New Delhi]]
'''Carved elephant tusk depicting Buddha life stories''' is an intricately carved complete single tusk now exhibited at the Decorative Arts gallery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This tusk, which is nearly five foot long, illustrates forty three events in the life of the [[Buddha]] and is thought to have been made by early 20th century craftsmen from the Delhi region.

==Description==
The use of the complete ivory tusks for carving was popular in 18th and 19th century India, particularly in the [[Delhi]] region apart from [[Burma]]. Similar whole tusk carvings are also found in the [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The art of [[ivory]] carving in India is very ancient with references found in [[Kalidasa|Kalidasa's]] [[Meghadūta]]. The earliest ivory carving from the Indian region is comb dating to the 2nd century CE found at [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]. Ivory carving flourished in [[Assam]] and [[Mysore]] where elephants were available and the art of ivory carving had royal patronage. Ivory was an object of trade between kingdoms and they found their way into areas where the art of carving had patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

This ivory tusk illustrates important life events of [[The life of the Buddha|Buddha]] in 43 circular roundel, first 25 referring to the story of Buddha's birth to his enlightenment followed by 18 depicting his life events from enlightenment to ''Mahaparinirvana''. Similar scenes have been presented in sculptures and paintings many a times but this ivory tusk shows few new scenes of Buddha's life such as Siddharatha's fight for a bird, his move against animal sacrifice and realization of death. As the thickness of the tusk reduces upwards, one can see at the tip three well-known postures depicting ''Bhumisparsha mudra'', ''Abhayamudra'' and ''Dharmachakrapravatan mudra'' besides the roundels. There is also an intricately carved floral creeper banding around the roundels enhancing its beauty.

'''Lancero''' (''English: [[Lancer]]'') is a military course and a denomination within the [[Colombian Army]]. The course takes place at the School of Lanceros of Colombia in [[Tolemaida]], [[Department of Tolima]] in [[Colombia]].
[[File:Torre de Salto Tolemaida.jpg|thumb|300px]]

== Overview ==
The Colombian Army has been in a [[Colombian armed conflict|military conflict]] with rebel [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] since the 1960s.  This has led the Colombian Government and its military forces to develop courses specifically aimed to the training of both soldiers and officers for this kind of [[warfare]].  The term Lancero was chosen as a way to honor a specific unit of fighters (Lanceros) that helped the army of [[Simón Bolívar]] in his conflict for the independence of Colombia.  This unit showed special bravery and strength during the [[Vargas Swamp Battle]].

==History of the Course==
The course was created as a result of the reform that took place inside the National Army of Colombia organization during the early 60s as a way to specialize and refocus the national army towards an [[Irregular military|irregular conflict]] with armed peasants in the mountains of Colombia. Inexperienced and with little knowledge of guerrilla warfare the Colombian Army sent its own officers to [[Fort Benning]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States so they could take the Ranger Course that takes place there and as a way to apply their acquired knowledge in Colombia's specific situation.

The techniques learned in the American course were modified and taught to [[Sergeant]]s, [[Lieutenant]]s, [[Ensign (rank)|Ensigns]], [[Corporal]]s and some enlisted and ranking officers of the Naval Infantry. This techniques were later spread across all the Colombian military components.

In 1959 the army created companies of Lanceros. These newly created companies were more agile and flexible thus, leading to more successful operations. They were added as supportive personnel for units where the enemy was even more aggressive and active.

In 1966 an outbreak of dispersed bandits called for the creation of even sharper and faster units. This year the Colombian Army's military command put into effect a more extensive training program to combat the rebels; this program would later become a single course called "''Contraguerrillas''"

Since this time the Lancero course has focused on the training of Soldiers, Army Officers and even Police Officers for the needs of a country with an [[Asymmetric warfare|enemy that hides among the civilian population]]. After more than forty years the course has gained some notoriety among military personnel around the [[Earth|globe]] largely due to its focusing on guerrilla warfare and not on regular military warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejercito.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=92 Escuela de Lanceros - Ejército Nacional de Colombia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lancero and Lanza concept==
The term Lancero which can be translated as [[lancer]] has  subsequently led to the use of the term Lanza ([[Lance]]) as a way to refer to a fellow soldier. In fact the course has emphasized on the importance of cooperative work between two soldiers as a way to accomplish goals (one being the Lanza or spear and the other one being the lancero or lance carrier). Thus, the terms Lanza and Lancero are both colloquial and honoring ways to call a fellow soldier or an officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=128137 French Foreign Legion in Colombian Lancero course - Military Photos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Vienna]] into one of Europe's richest families, he inherited a fortune from his father in 1913.

His philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the ''Tractatus'', and a later period, articulated in the ''Philosophical Investigations''. The early Wittgenstein was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world and believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, he had solved all philosophical problems. The later Wittgenstein rejected many of the assumptions of the ''Tractatus'', arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given [[language-game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/conant/Ian%20Proops%20The%20New%20Wittgenstein%20A%20Critique.pdf|title=PDF|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey among American university and college teachers ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations."&lt;ref name="here"&gt;Lackey, Douglas [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0031-806X.00022/abstract?

He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men."&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Malcolm, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Wittgenstein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Karl Wittgenstein]] was one of the richest men in Europe.&lt;ref name=Bramann/&gt;|235x235px]]
According to a family tree prepared in Jerusalem after World War II, Wittgenstein's paternal great-great-grandfather was Moses Meier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wittgensteinchronology.com/4.html|title=Wittgenstein Family History - Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Chronology of his Life and Work|last=Preston|first=John|website=www.wittgensteinchronology.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] land agent who lived with his wife, Brendel Simon, in [[Bad Laasphe]] in the [[Siegen-Wittgenstein|Principality of Wittgenstein]], Westphalia.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:de:Schloss Wittgenstein|Schloss Wittgenstein]]. Various sources spell Meier's name Maier and Meyer.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1808, [[Napoleon]] issued a decree that everyone, including Jews, must adopt an inheritable [[Jewish surname|family surname]], and so Meier's son, also Moses, took the name of his employers, the [[Sayn-Wittgenstein]]s, and became Moses Meier Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein—who took the middle name "Christian" to distance himself from his Jewish background—married Fanny Figdor, also Jewish, who converted to [[Protestantism]] just before they married, and the couple founded a successful business trading in wool in Leipzig.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=4-5}} Ludwig's grandmother Fanny was a first cousin of the famous violinist [[Joseph Joachim]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=5}}

They had 11 children—among them Wittgenstein's father. Karl Otto Clemens Wittgenstein (1847–1913) became an industrial tycoon, and by the late 1880s was one of the richest men in Europe, with an effective monopoly on Austria's steel cartel.&lt;ref name="Bramann"&gt;Bramann, Jorn K. and Moran, John.

There were four girls: Hermine, [[Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein|Margaret]] (Gretl), Helene, and a fourth daughter Dora who died as a baby; and five boys: Johannes (Hans), Kurt, Rudolf (Rudi), [[Paul Wittgenstein|Paul]]—who became a concert pianist despite losing an arm in [[World War I]]—and Ludwig, who was the youngest of the family.&lt;ref name=Bartley16&gt;Bartley, William Warren. ''Wittgenstein''. Open Court, 1994, p. 16, first published 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were baptized as Catholics, received formal Catholic instruction, and were raised in an exceptionally intense environment.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;[[Norman Malcolm]], [[Peter Winch]], ''Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View?'', Cornell University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The family was at the center of Vienna's cultural life; [[Bruno Walter]] described the life at the Wittgensteins' palace as an "all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=8}} Karl was a leading patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Auguste Rodin]] and financing the city's exhibition hall and art gallery, the [[Secession hall (Austria)|Secession Building]]. [[Gustav Klimt]] painted Wittgenstein's sister for her wedding portrait, and [[Johannes Brahms]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] gave regular concerts in the family's numerous music rooms.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=8}}{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=18}}

For Wittgenstein, who highly valued precision and discipline, [[contemporary music]] was never considered acceptable at all. "Music," he said to his friend Drury in 1930, "came to a full stop with [[Brahms]]; and even in Brahms I can begin to hear the noise of machinery."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Redpath, Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Student's Memoir, London: Duckworth, 1990, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Wittgenstein himself had [[absolute pitch]],&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp=157&lt;/ref&gt; and his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life: he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings, and was unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-443}} He also learnt to play the [[clarinet]] in his thirties.&lt;ref name=Monk15/&gt; A fragment of music (three bars), composed by Wittgenstein, was discovered in one of his 1931 notebooks, by [[Michael Nedo]], Director of the Wittgenstein Institute in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1450-9814/2005/1450-98140505393H.pdf "Three Bars by Wittgenstein"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714153847/http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1450-9814/2005/1450-98140505393H.pdf |date=14 July 2014 }} by Eric Heijerman, ''Muzikologija'', 2005 (5): pp. 393–395.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family temperament and the brothers' suicides===
[[Ray Monk]] writes that Karl's aim was to turn his sons into captains of industry; they were not sent to school lest they acquire bad habits, but were educated at home to prepare them for work in Karl's industrial empire.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=11}} Three of the five brothers would later commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Kenny"&gt;Kenny, Anthony.

Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Michael Fitzgerald (psychiatrist)|Michael Fitzgerald]] argues that Karl was a harsh perfectionist who lacked empathy, and that Wittgenstein's mother was anxious and insecure, unable to stand up to her husband.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;Fitzgerald, Michael. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/wd1bk8fkp4ru6xvy/ "Did Ludwig Wittgenstein have Asperger's syndrome?"],
''European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry'', volume 9, number 1, pp. 61–65. {{doi|10.1007/s007870050117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Brahms said of the family, whom he visited regularly: "They seemed to act towards one another as if they were at court."&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"/&gt; The family appeared to have a strong streak of depression running through it. [[Anthony Gottlieb]] tells a story about Paul practicing on one of the pianos in the Wittgensteins' main family mansion, when he suddenly shouted at Ludwig in the next room: "I cannot play when you are in the house, as I feel your scepticism seeping towards me from under the door!"&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;Gottlieb, Anthony.

The family Palace housed seven grand pianos&lt;ref&gt;Waugh p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; and each of the siblings pursued music "with an enthusiasm that, at times, bordered on the pathological."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest brother, Hans, was hailed as a musical prodigy. At the age of four, writes [[Alexander Waugh]], Hans could identify the [[Doppler effect]] in a passing siren as a quarter-tone drop in pitch, and at five started crying "Wrong! Wrong!" when two brass bands in a carnival played the same tune in different [[Key signature|keys]]. But he died in mysterious circumstances in May 1902, when he ran away to America and disappeared from a boat in [[Chesapeake Bay]], most likely having committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 24–26.
* Also see Monk, p. 11ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, aged 22 and studying chemistry at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]], the third eldest brother, Rudi, committed suicide in a Berlin bar. He had asked the pianist to play [[Thomas Koschat]]'s "Verlassen, verlassen, verlassen bin ich" ("Forsaken, forsaken, forsaken am I"),&lt;ref&gt;For the Koschat song, see {{YouTube|QLMBkWWavJo|"Verlassen bin ich"}}. Retrieved 11 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; before mixing himself a drink of milk and [[potassium cyanide]]. He had left several suicide notes, one to his parents that said he was grieving over the death of a friend, and another that referred to his "perverted disposition". It was reported at the time that he had sought advice from the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]], an organization that was campaigning against [[Paragraph 175]] of the German Criminal Code, which prohibited homosexual sex. His father forbade the family from ever mentioning his name again.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 22–23.

The second eldest brother, Kurt, an officer and company director, shot himself on 27 October 1918 at the end of World War I, when the Austrian troops he was commanding refused to obey his orders and deserted ''en masse''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=11}} According to Gottlieb, Hermine had said Kurt seemed to carry "...the germ of disgust for life within himself."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Wittgenstein wrote: "I ought to have... become a star in the sky. Instead of which I have remained stuck on earth."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=156}}

==1903–1906: Realschule in Linz==

===Realschule in Linz===
[[File:Realschule in Linz.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Realschule]]'' in Linz]]
Wittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was fourteen years old. Subsequently, for three years, he attended a school. After the deaths of Hans and Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Wiener Neustadt; having had no formal schooling, he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tutoring to pass the exam for the more technically oriented [[k.u.k.]] [[Realschule]] in [[Linz]], a small state school with 300 pupils.&lt;ref name="Waugh33"&gt;Waugh, p. 33.
* McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889–1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 51ff.
* K.u.k. stood for "[[Kaiserlich und königlich]]".
* The successor institution to the ''Realschule'' in Linz is [[Bundesrealgymnasium Linz Fadingerstraße]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, when he was 14, he began his three years of formal schooling there, lodging nearby in term time with the family of Dr. Josef Strigl, a teacher at the local gymnasium, the family giving him the nickname Luki.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}}&lt;ref name="Sandgruber"&gt;Sandgruber, Roman.

Linz 2011. Retrieved 5 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On starting at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}} Historian [[Brigitte Hamann]] writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of [[High German]] with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable.&lt;ref name=Hamann15&gt;Hamann, Brigitte and Thornton, Thomas. ''Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship''. Oxford University Press, 2000 (first published 1996 in German), pp. 15–16, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: "''Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger Winde wegen Wienwärts''"&lt;ref name=Monk15&gt;Monk, pp.14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Monk can only be used as a source for the original German because this is incorrectly translated by Monk as "Wittgenstein wends his woeful windy way Vienna-wards"--&gt; ("Wittgenstein strolls wistfully Vienna-wards due to adverse winds"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark (5) in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}} He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931: "My bad spelling in youth, up to the age of about 18 or 19, is connected with the whole of the rest of my character (my weakness in study)."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=51}}

===Faith===
Wittgenstein was baptized as an infant by a Catholic priest and received formal instruction in Catholic doctrine as a child, as was common at the time.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; In an interview, his sister Gretl Stonborough-Wittgenstein says that their grandfather's "strong, severe, partly ascetic Christianity" was a strong influence on all the Wittgenstein children.&lt;ref&gt;Stonborough-Wittgenstein, Gretl. Reviewed in Portraits of Wittgenstein, Flowers &amp; Ground&lt;/ref&gt;  It was while he was at the ''Realschule'' that he decided he had lost his faith in God and became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=Monk18&gt;Monk, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless believed in the importance of the idea of [[confession]]. He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the ''Realschule''; Monk speculates that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.&lt;ref name=Monk18/&gt; As a teenager, Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual realism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately "shallow" thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts, his comes to an end."&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Value'', 1933-4, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's religious faith and his relationship with Christianity and religion, in general (for which he professed a sincere and devoted reverence{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}) would change over time, much like his philosophical ideas. In 1912, Wittgenstein wrote to Russell saying that Mozart and Beethoven were the actual sons of God.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=34}} However, Wittgenstein resisted formal religion, saying it was hard for him to "bend the knee",&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, 113&lt;/ref&gt; though his grandfather's beliefs continued to influence Wittgenstein—as he famously said, "I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view".&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig, reviewed in Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View, Tim Labron&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein referred to [[Augustine of Hippo]] in his ''Philosophical Investigations.'' Philosophically, Wittgenstein's thought shows fundamental alignment with religious discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce R. Ashford, "Wittgenstein's Theologians: A Survey of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Impact on Theology"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wittgenstein would become one of the century's fiercest critics of [[Scientism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monk|first1=Ray|title=Wittgenstein's Forgotten Lesson|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/regulars/ray-monk-wittgenstein|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=Prospect Magazine|issue=July 1999|publisher=Prospect Magazine|date=20 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With age, a deepening personal spirituality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, the temptation to think of God's existence as a matter of scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein, "Lectures on Religious Belief"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rush Rhees, "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Personal Recollections"&lt;/ref&gt; In Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'', he writes, "Is what I am doing [my work in philosophy] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." His close friend [[Norman Malcolm]] would write, "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Malcolm, "Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View"&lt;/ref&gt; At last, Wittgenstein writes, "Bach wrote on the title page of his ''[[Orgelbüchlein]]'', ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’  That is what I would have liked to say about my work."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Influence of Otto Weininger===
[[File:OttoWeiningerspring1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] (1880–1903)]]
While a student at the ''Realschule'', Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]]'s 1903 book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' (''[[Sex and Character]]'').
Weininger (1880–1903), who was also Jewish, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as [[Platonic realism|Platonic forms]], and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=19-26}} Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.&lt;ref&gt;p216, Philosophical Tales, Cohen, M., Blackwell 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated 23 August 1931, Wittgenstein wrote the following to [[G. E. Moore]];&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Moore,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Thanks for your letter. I can quite imagine that you don’t admire Weininger very much, what with that beastly translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It isn’t necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you just add a “∼” to the whole book it says an important truth.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In an unusual move, Wittgenstein took out a copy of Weininger's work on 1 June 1931 from the Special Order Books in the university library. He met Moore on 2 June where he probably gave Moore the copy of Weininger's work.{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=141}}

===Jewish background and Hitler===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Austria}}
There is much debate about the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews. The issue has arisen in particular regarding Wittgenstein's schooldays, because [[Adolf Hitler]] was, for a while, at the same school at the same time.&lt;ref name=McGuinnessStern&gt;For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as completely German, not Jewish, see McGuinness, Brian. "Wittgenstein and the Idea of Jewishness", and for an opposing view, see Stern, David.

''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp. 231ff and p. 237ff respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Goldstein]] argues it is "overwhelmingly probable" the boys met each other: that Hitler would have disliked Wittgenstein, a "stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart ..."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Lawrence. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EvHPNoKvmf0C&amp;pg=PA167 ''Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and his Relevance to Modern Thought'']. Duckworth, 1999, p. 167ff. Also see [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2659846 "Clear and Queering Thinking"], review in ''Mind'', Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein's wealth and unusual personality may have fed Hitler's antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Marie. "Hi Ludwig", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 26 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein and Hitler were born just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his mathematics exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so they ended up two grades apart at the ''Realschule''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler started at the school on 17 September 1900, repeated the first year in 1901, and left in the autumn of 1905; see Kersaw, Ian. ''Hitler, 1889–1936''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000, p. 16ff.
* McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: a life : young Ludwig 1889–1921''.

* Brigitte Hamann argues in ''Hitler's Vienna'' (1996) that Hitler was bound to have laid eyes on Wittgenstein, because the latter was so conspicuous, though she told ''Focus'' magazine they were in different classes, and she agrees with Monk that they would have had nothing to do with one another. See Hamann, Brigitte and Thornton, Thomas. ''Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship''. Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 15–16, 79, and Thiede, Roger.

In his own writings&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., MS 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein frequently referred to himself as Jewish, at times as part of an apparent self-flagellation. For example, while berating himself for being a "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" thinker, he attributed this to his own Jewish sense of identity, writing: "The saint is the only Jewish genius. Even the greatest Jewish thinker is no more than talented. (Myself for instance)."&lt;ref&gt;''Culture and Value'', Ludwig Wittgenstein, (Oxford 1998), page 16e (see also, pages 15e–19e).&lt;/ref&gt; While Wittgenstein would later claim that "[m]y thoughts are 100% Hebraic,"&lt;ref&gt;M.O'C. Drury, "Conversations with Wittgenstein", in ''Recollections of Wittgenstein'', ed. R. Rhees, New York: Oxford University Press, revised edition, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Hans Sluga]] has argued, if so, "His was a self-doubting Judaism, which had always the possibility of collapsing into a destructive self-hatred (as it did in [[Otto Weininger|Weininger's]] case) but which also held an immense promise of innovation and genius."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Sluga]], ''The Cambridge companion to Wittgenstein'', (Cambridge 1996), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1906–1913: University==

===Engineering at Berlin and Manchester===
[[File:10. Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen.jpg|right|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, aged about eighteen]]
[[File:1895 technische hochschule charlottenburg.jpg|right|thumb|The old [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin]]
He began his studies in mechanical engineering at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin, on 23 October 1906, lodging with the family of professor Dr. Jolles. He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a [[diploma]] (''Abgangzeugnis'') on 5 May 1908.

During his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in [[aeronautics]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=27}} He arrived at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in the spring of 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near [[Glossop]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=29}} Specifically, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir [[Arthur Schuster]].&lt;ref name="Lemco 39–51"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lemco |first=Ian |date=22 January 2007 |title=Wittgenstein's Aeronautical Investigation |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=39–51 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2006.0163 |jstor=20462605 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=30-35}} At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein’s ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein’s innovative design was created. Wittgenstein’s design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together.

Work on the jet-powered propeller proved frustrating for Wittgenstein, who had very little experience working with machinery.&lt;ref name="Mays, p.137"&gt;Mays, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that “when things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw his arms around, stomp about, and swear volubly in German.”&lt;ref&gt;Mays, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing on the design of the propeller — a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.&lt;ref name="Mays, p.137" /&gt;

It was at this time that he became interested in the [[foundations of mathematics]], particularly after reading [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903), and [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903).&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, Michael (ed.). ''The Frege Reader''. Blackwell, 1997, pp. 194–223, 258–289.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=30}} He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=30}} In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the [[University of Jena]] to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} He wrote: "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics."&lt;ref name="Kanterian36"&gt;Kanterian, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival at Cambridge===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein 1910.jpg|right|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1910s]]
Wittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18 October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name="ConnorRobertson"&gt;O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wittgenstein.html "Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein"], St Andrews University. Retrieved 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was having tea with [[C. K. Ogden]], when, according to Russell, "an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics &amp; has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} He was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to [[C. D. Broad]], [[Eric Harold Neville|E. H. Neville]], and H. T. J. Norton.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=36}} Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in [[Formal (university)#Terminology|Hall]]. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]: "My German friend threatens to be an infliction."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|pp=88-89}}
Russell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced."{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=88}} Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: "I love him &amp; feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is ''the'' young man one hopes for."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=41}} The role-reversal between Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein was soon such that Russell wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: "His [Wittenstein]'s criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''Autobiography''. Routledge, 1998, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambridge Moral Sciences Club and Apostles===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|234x234px|[[Bertrand Russell]], 1907]]

In 1912 Wittgenstein joined the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club|Cambridge Moral Sciences Club]], an influential discussion group for philosophy dons and students, delivering his first paper there on 29 November that year, a four-minute talk defining philosophy as "all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Jack. [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1617&amp;context=russelljournal "Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club"], ''Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell'' Studies: Vol. 1, issue 2, article 3, winter 1982.

Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, p. 332, citing Michael Nedo and Michele Ranchetti (eds.). ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: sein Leben in Bildern und Texten''. Suhrkamp, 1983, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He dominated the society and for a time would stop attending in the early 1930s after complaints that he gave no one else a chance to speak.&lt;ref name=Edmonds22&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 22–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club became infamous within popular philosophy because of a meeting on 25 October 1946 at [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Braithwaite]]'s rooms in [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], where [[Karl Popper]], another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was ''Are there philosophical problems?'', in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one—"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers"—at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein 'stormed out', but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion). It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the world, were ever in the same room together.&lt;ref&gt;Eidinow, John and Edmonds, David.

Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Maynard Keynes]] also invited him to join the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Russell and [[G. E. Moore]] had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not enjoy it and attended infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's unseriousness, style of humour, or the fact that the members were in love with one another.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=118}} He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the level of discussion; they took him back though in the 1920s when he returned to Cambridge. (He also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Moral Sciences Club.) {{fact|date=June 2018}}

=== Frustrations at Cambridge/Pre-war ===
Wittgenstein was quite vocal about his depression in his years at Cambridge, and before he went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=76}} Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he "felt the curse of those who have half a talent".{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=39}} He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wittgenstein in Cambridge|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=75}} Unless he was lying, Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: "how can I be a logician before I'm a human being? For the most important thing is coming to terms with myself!"{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=63}} He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell’s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portraits of Wittgenstein vol.1|last=1:Flowers, 2:Ground|first=1:F.A, 2: Ian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig’s temperament was also recorded in the diary of David Pinsent. Pinsent writes "I have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these sulky fits", and "I am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now than usual", when talking about Wittgenstein's emotional fluctuations.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}}

===Sexual orientation and relationship with David Pinsent===

[[File:Wittgenstein with friends drinking coffee.jpg|right|thumb|240x240px|Wittgenstein sitting with his friends and family in Vienna. Marguerite Respinger sits at the end of the left and the sculpture he made of her sits behind him on the mantel-place]]
Wittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men, and had a relationship with the latter two: [[David Pinsent|David Hume Pinsent]] in 1912, [[Francis Skinner]] in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=583-586}} He later revealed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=369}} Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein fell in love with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, modelling a sculpture of her and proposing marriage, albeit on condition that they would not have children.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=238-240, 318}}

Wittgenstein's relationship with David Pinsent (1891–1918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of [[David Hume]], Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and queer thinking: Wittgenstein's development and his relevance to modern thought''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the [[British Psychological Society|British Psychological Association]] in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912—the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including [[first class travel]], the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria – small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law.&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912–1914, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting [[Øystese]], Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic.&lt;ref&gt;Portraits of Wittgenstein, Extracts from the Diary of David Pinsent 1912–1914, p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality – sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, p. 58ff. *See Von Wright, G. H. ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912–1914''. Basil Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being "absolutely sulky and snappish" at times, as well.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=85}} In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating "No—Beastly!" to 90 percent of what he shewed [archaic spelling] us!"&lt;ref name="Kanterian40"&gt;Kanterian, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy: "He expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!"&lt;ref name=Kanterian40/&gt; The last time they saw each other was on 8 October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: "I got up at 6.15 to see Ludwig off. He had to go very early – back to Cambridge – as he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7.0 – to catch a 7.30 am train from New St Station. It was sad parting from him."&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;[[Georg Henrik von Wright|Von Wright, G. H.]] ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912–1914''. Basil Blackwell, 1990. p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.

==1913–1920: World War I and the ''Tractatus''==

===Work on ''Logik''===
[[File:Wittgenstein notes 1914.jpg|thumb|Entries from October 1914 in Wittgenstein's diary, on display at the [[Wren Library]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
Karl Wittgenstein died on 20 January 1913, and after receiving his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=71}} He donated some of his money, at first anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. Trakl requested to meet his benefactor but in 1914 when Wittgenstein went to visit, Trakl had already killed himself.  Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [[Skjolden]] in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing ''Logik'' (''Notes on Logic''), the predecessor of much of the ''Tractatus''.&lt;ref name=ConnorRobertson/&gt; While in Norway, Wittgenstein learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] to converse with the local villagers, and [[Danish language|Danish]] to read the works of the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart (philosopher)|Stewart, Jon.]] (ed.) ''Kierkegaard's Influence on Philosophy: German and Scandinavian Philosophy''. Ashgate Publishing, 2009, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that Wittgenstein began addressing what he considered to be a central issue in ''Notes on Logic'', a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that “[a]ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.”{{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=58}} Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.

The problem lay in forming a primitive proposition which encompassed this and would act as the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, “The big question now is, how must a system of signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic!” {{sfn|McGuinness|2008|p=59}} The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=96}} Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition by the time of the writing of the ''Tractatus''. The ''Tractatus'' does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, “Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.”&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: Side-By-Side-By-Side Edition''. Kegan Paul, 1922, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.

At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. [[David Edmonds (philosopher)|David Edmonds]] and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with "absolutely no intelligence whatever."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=262}} In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.&lt;ref name=Edmonds45/&gt; When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting ''Logik'' as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: "If I am not worth your making an exception for me ''even in some STUPID details'' then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I ''am'' worth it and you don't do it then—by God—''you'' might go there."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=103}} Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.{{sfn|McGuinness|1988|p=200}} The two did not speak again until 1929.&lt;ref name=Edmonds45&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===

On the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein immediately volunteered for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], despite being eligible for a medical exemption.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein had a double hernia, according to philosopher [[Iain King]], who recounts Wittgenstein's war record in an April 2014 article [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein's medical exemption is confirmed in [[Philosophy Now]] magazine [http://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism here (link to Philosophy Now)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He served first on a ship and then in an artillery workshop 'several miles from the action'.&lt;ref&gt;According to philosopher [[Iain King]], who described Wittgenstein's war record and its impact on his thinking [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was wounded in an accidental explosion, and hospitalised to [[Kraków]].&lt;ref&gt;From [[Iain King]], writing in April 2014 about Wittgenstein's war record and its impact on his thinking [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm here (link to Military History Monthly magazine article)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the [[7th Army (Austria-Hungary)|Austrian 7th Army]], where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the [[Brusilov Offensive]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=137-142}} Wittgenstein directed the fire of his own artillery from an observation post in no-man's land against Allied troops – one of the most dangerous jobs there was, since he was targeted by enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;From a July 2014 article in [[Philosophy Now]] magazine [http://philosophynow.org/issues/103/WittgensteinTolstoy_and_the_Folly_of_Logical_Positivism here (link to Philosophy Now)], accessed 23 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In action against British troops, he was decorated with the [[Military Merit Medal (Austria–Hungary)|Military Merit]] with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for "His exceptionally courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism," that "won the total admiration of the troops."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1917, he was sent as a member of a [[howitzer]] regiment to the Russian front, where he won several more medals for bravery including the [[Medal for Bravery (Austria-Hungary)|Silver Medal for Valour]], First Class.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=137}} In 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] as part of an artillery regiment. For his part in the final Austrian offensive of June 1918, he was recommended for the Gold Medal for Valour, one of the highest honours in the Austrian army, but was instead awarded the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swords&amp;nbsp;— it being decided that this particular action, although extraordinarily brave, had been insufficiently consequential to merit the highest honour.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=154}}
[[File:27. Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Wittgenstein’s military identity card during the First World War]]
Throughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, including his contempt for the character of the other soldiers.&lt;ref name="Klagge2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klagge|first=James Carl|title=Wittgenstein in exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMzajTUpEp0C&amp;pg=PA68|date=22 December 2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01534-9|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s 1896 ''[[The Gospel in Brief]]'' at a bookshop in [[Tarnów]], and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as "the man with the gospels."{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=44, 116, 382–384}}&lt;ref&gt;* Also see Bill Schardt &amp; David Large, [http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/witty.htm "Wittgenstein, Tolstoy, and the Gospel in Brief"], ''The Philosopher'', Volume LXXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Completion of the ''Tractatus''===
[[File:Wittgenstein family Vienna 1917.jpg|thumb|The Wittgenstein family in [[Vienna]], Summer 1917, with Kurt (furthest left) and Wittgenstein (furthest right) in officers' uniforms.]]
In the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in one of his family's Vienna summer houses, Neuwaldegg. It was there in August 1918 that he completed the ''Tractatus'', which he submitted with the title ''Der Satz'' (German: proposition, sentence, phrase, set, but also "leap") to the publishers Jahoda and Siegel.&lt;ref name=Bartley33&gt;Bartley, pp. 33–39, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13 August, his uncle Paul died. On 25 October, he learned that Jahoda and Siegel had decided not to publish the ''Tractatus'', and on 27 October, his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent's mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8 May.&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, pp. 33–34. For an original report, see "Death of D.H. Pinsent", ''Birmingham Daily Mail'', 15 May 1918: "Recovery of the Body. The body of Mr. David Hugh Pinsent, a civilian observer, son of Mr and Mrs Hume Pinsent, of Foxcombe Hill, near Oxford and Birmingham, the second victim of last Wednesday's aeroplane accident in West Surrey, was last night found in the Basingstoke Canal, at Frimley."

Retrieved 7 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal. He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and, as a result of the defeat of the Austrian army, he was captured by [[Allies of World War I|Allied forces]] on 3 November in [[Trentino]]. He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp.

He returned to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]]. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.&lt;ref name=Bartley33/&gt;

==1920–1928: Teaching, the ''Tractatus'', Haus Wittgenstein==

===Teacher training in Vienna===
In September 1919 he enrolled in the ''Lehrerbildungsanstalt'' (teacher training college) in the ''Kundmanngasse'' in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=169}} [[Thomas Bernhard]], more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein's life: "the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity."&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching posts in Austria===
In the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family... That one can neither simulate nor dissimulate anything including a refined education I need hardly tell you."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in [[Trattenbach]], under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: "I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Klagge, James Carl. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Malcolm|Malcolm, Norman]]. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v03/n21/norman-malcolm/wittgensteins-confessions "Wittgenstein’s Confessions"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 3 No. 21, 19 November 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the less able, it seems that he became something of a tyrant. The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=195}} They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;&lt;ref name=Bartley107&gt;Bartley, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting "''Krautsalat!''" ("coleslaw" – i.e. shredded cabbage) when the headmaster played the piano, and "Nonsense!" when a priest was answering children's questions.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=196, 198}}

===Publication of the ''Tractatus''===
[[File:Wittgenstein2.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Ludwig Wittgenstein, schoolteacher, c. 1922]]While Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung'', part of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]'s journal ''Annalen der Naturphilosophie'', though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;For the introduction, see Russell, Bertrand. [http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/aintro.html Introduction], ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be ''thought'') and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nieli. ''Wittgenstein: From Mysticism to Ordinary Language''. SUNY Press, 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the ''Tractatus''.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 35ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|''The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.''
''Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages. And in fact both were right and both wrong; though the view of the ancients is clearer insofar as they have an acknowledged terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained.''|Wittgenstein, [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]], 6.371-2}}
An English translation was prepared in Cambridge by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by [[C. K. Ogden]]. It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.'' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.&lt;ref name="archiveTractatus"/&gt; This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ramsey translated "''Sachverhalt''" and "''Sachlage''" as "atomic fact" and "state of affairs" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent "''Sachverhalten''", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating "''Sachverhalt''" as "state of affairs" and "''Sachlage''" as ''situation''. The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness. See:

An aim of the ''Tractatus'' is to reveal the relationship between language and the world: what can be said about it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that the logical structure of language provides the limits of meaning. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: "What we can say at all can be said clearly," he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.&lt;ref name=Grayling16&gt;Grayling, A. C. ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 16ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in the preface: "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)."&lt;ref&gt;''Tractatus'' (Ogden translation), preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is 75 pages long—"As to the shortness of the book, I am ''awfully sorry for it'' ... If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me," he told Ogden—and presents seven numbered propositions (1–7), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):&lt;ref&gt;For the comment to Ogden, see Monk, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist''.
#: The world is everything that is the case.&lt;ref&gt;The English is from the original Ogden/Ramsey translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Was der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten''.
#: What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
# ''Das logische Bild der Tatsachen ist der Gedanke''.
#: The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
# ''Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz''.
#: The thought is the significant proposition.
# ''Der Satz ist eine Wahrheitsfunktion der Elementarsätze''.
#: Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
# ''Die allgemeine Form der Wahrheitsfunktion ist: &lt;math&gt;[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]&lt;/math&gt;. Dies ist die allgemeine Form des Satzes''.
#: The general form of a truth-function is: &lt;math&gt;[\bar p,\bar\xi, N(\bar\xi)]&lt;/math&gt;. This is the general form of proposition.
# ''Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen''.
#: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

===Visit from Frank Ramsey, Puchberg===
[[File:Puchberg am Schneeberg-view.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited Wittgenstein in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]] in September 1923.]]
In September 1922 he moved to a secondary school in a nearby village, [[Hassbach (Lower Austria)|Hassbach]], but considered the people there just as bad—"These people are not human ''at all'' but loathsome worms," he wrote to a friend—and he left after a month. In November he began work at another primary school, this time in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg|Puchberg]] in the [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]] mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were "one-quarter animal and three-quarters human."

[[Frank P. Ramsey]] visited him on 17 September 1923 to discuss the ''Tractatus''; he had agreed to write a review of it for ''Mind''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=212, 214–216, 220–221.}} He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, D.H. [http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/3484/5/RamseyText.html "Cambridge Philosophers I: F. P. Ramsey"], Philosophy 70, 1995, pp. 243–262.&lt;/ref&gt; After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} Ramsey wrote to [[John Maynard Keynes]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Wittgenstein's family] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Haidbauer incident, Otterthal===
{{main|Haidbauer incident}}
[[File:31. Wittgenstein, 1925.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein, 1925]]
He moved schools again in September 1924, this time to [[Otterthal]], near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, ''Wörterbuch für Volksschulen'', published in Vienna in 1926 by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the ''Tractatus'' that was published in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="archiveTractatus"&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Tractatus and Teaching"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213064904/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html |date=13 February 2010 }}, Cambridge Wittgenstein archive. Retrieved 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A first edition sold in 2005 for £75,000.&lt;ref name="Ezard"&gt;Ezard, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/19/books.booksnews2 "Philosopher's rare 'other book' goes on sale"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as ''Der Vorfall Haidbauer'' (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=224, 232–233}} Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: "I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}}

Piribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=225}} Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of [[leukaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 162. Monk, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, in 1936, as part of a series of "confessions" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a "Ja, ja," though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not "to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it—to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought." Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, "This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness."{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=370-371}}

===The Vienna Circle===
{{See also|Vienna Circle}}
The ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up largely as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=212}} While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not actually the case. German philosopher [[Oswald Hanfling]] writes bluntly: "Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle's thought was at least as important as that of any of its members."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Essential Readings in Logical Positivism|last = Hanfling|first = Oswald |author-link=Oswald Hanfling |publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-631-12566-2|location = Oxford|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle whom his work had inspired. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/09/07/the-limits-of-science-and-scientists/|title=The Limits of Science—and Scientists - The Crux|date=7 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his autobiography, [[Rudolf Carnap]] describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that "there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems." As for Wittgenstein:
{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation ... the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Carnap, ''Autobiography'', in P.A. Schlipp (ed) ''The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap'', The Library of Living Philosophers, Volume 11, La Salle Open Court, 1963, pages 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Haus Wittgenstein===
{{Main|Haus Wittgenstein}}
[[File:Haus Wittgenstein, Stonborough House, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Wittgenstein worked on [[Haus Wittgenstein]] between 1926 and 1929.]]

{{rquote|right|"I am not interested in erecting a building, but in [...] presenting to myself the foundations of all possible buildings."|Wittgenstein&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Hyde, Lewis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/books/review/Hyde-t.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt "Making It"]. ''The New York Times'', 6 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926 Wittgenstein was again working as a gardener for a number of months, this time at the monastery of Hütteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''. Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that "This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty."&lt;ref name="Jeffries"&gt;Jeffries, Stuart. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,627752,00.html "A dwelling for the gods"], ''The Guardian'', 5 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150&amp;nbsp;kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of ''The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein'', said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: "It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor."&lt;ref name=Jeffries/&gt;

The house was finished by December 1928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: "Even though I admired the house very much....It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Wittgenstein said "the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and ''good'' manners, and expression of great ''understanding''... But ''primordial'' life, wild life striving to erupt into the open – that is lacking."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}} Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this "wild life striving to be in the open" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=240}}

==1929–1941: Fellowship at Cambridge==

===PhD and fellowship===
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein.jpg|thumb|Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1930]]

According to Feigl (as reported by Monk), upon attending a conference in Vienna by mathematician Brouwer, Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the possibility of a "return to Philosophy". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: "Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=255}} Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the ''Tractatus'' as his thesis.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=271}} Moore wrote in the examiner's report: "I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree."&lt;ref&gt;R.

[[File:43. Ludwig Wittgenstein on holiday.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein on holiday in [[France]] with Gilbert Pattisson, July 1936]]
From 1936 to 1937, Wittgenstein lived again in Norway,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html Ludwig Wittgenstein: Return to Cambridge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103154319/http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre8.html |date=3 November 2007 }} from the Cambridge Wittgenstein Archive&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked on the ''Philosophical Investigations''. In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of "confessions" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]], himself a former mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] which he was soon to set up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history//Biographies/De_Valera.html MacTutor: Biography of Éamon de Valera] "The most important contribution de Valera made to mathematics both in Ireland and internationally was the foundation of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS) in 1940."&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:21. Photographs showing Wittgenstein’s house in Norway.jpg|left|thumb|213x213px|Photograph showing Wittgenstein’s house in [[Norway]], sent by Wittgenstein to [[G. E. Moore]], October 1936]]While he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the ''Anschluss''; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a citizen of the enlarged Germany and a Jew under the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two. It meant ''inter alia'' that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.&lt;ref name=Waugh137&gt;Waugh, pp. 137ff, 204–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, pp. 224–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.&lt;ref&gt;For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as a Jew, see Stern, David.

A few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted ''Mischling'' status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, pp. 98, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim foreign currency, stocks and 1700&amp;nbsp;kg of gold held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein family trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb/&gt;

===Professor of philosophy===
[[File:46. Ludwig Wittgenstein in the Fellows' Garden.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein in the Fellows’ Garden at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], 1939]]
After G. E. Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired [[British subject|British citizenship]] soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1,700&amp;nbsp;kg of gold.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher [[Sofya Yanovskaya|Sophia Janowskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Moran, John. "Wittgenstein and Russia" ''New Left Review'' 73, May–June 1972, pp. 83–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Malcolm, at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938: {{quote|"At a meeting of the Moral Science Club, after the paper for the evening was read and the discussion started, someone began to stammer a remark. He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' – perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, pp. 23–4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Describing Wittgenstein's lecture program, Malcolm continues: {{quote|"It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After work, the philosopher would often relax by watching [[Western Movie|Westerns]], where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by [[Norbert Davis]].{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=528}}&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Josef. [http://www.mysteryfile.com/NDavis/Wit.html "Hard-boiled Wit: Ludwig Wittgenstein and Norbert Davis"], ''CADS'', no. 44, October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Malcolm wrote that Wittgenstein would rush to the cinema when class ended.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Wittgenstein's view on the [[foundations of mathematics]] had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]] who described Wittgenstein as "a ''very'' peculiar man". The two had many discussions about the relationship between computational logic and everyday notions of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Alan Turing: The Enigma |last = Hodges | first = Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Hodges | publisher = [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-784-70008-9|location = London|page = 194|title-link = Alan Turing: The Enigma }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Cora (ed.).

== 1941–1947: World War II and Guy's Hospital ==
[[File:50. Wittgenstein in Swansea (taken by Ben Richards).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Wittgenstein in [[Swansea]], Summer 1947]]
Monk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;For his desire that his students not pursue philosophy, see Malcolm, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1941, he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, delivering drugs from the pharmacy to the wards where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}}

In the new year of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein to his home in Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son recorded the weekend in his diary;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=434}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" Wittgenstein begged one of them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=432}} Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=431}} It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.

He had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from [[polio]]. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a [[City and Guilds]] exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought!"{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=443}} Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=442-423}}

While Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November 1942, Grant and Reeve moved to the [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of £4 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, [[Jesmond]]&lt;ref name="Schardt"&gt;[http://www.newphilsoc.org.uk/OldWeb1/Wittgenstein/wittgenstein_upon_tyne.htm Wittgenstein Upon Tyne] Bill Schardt, Newcastle Philosophical Society. Retrieved December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) from 29 April 1943 until February 1944.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=447}}

In the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']]. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, "The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background." On the 30th of September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, "Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me."{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}

Wittgenstein had only maintained contact with Fouracre from Guy's hospital who had joined the army in 1943 after his marriage, only returning in 1947. Wittgenstein maintained frequent correspondence with Fouracre during his time away displaying a desire for Fouracre to return home urgently from the war.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=493}}

In May 1947, Wittgenstein addressed a group of Oxford philosophers for the first time at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of [[René Descartes|Descartes']] [[Cogito ergo sum]] where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. [[Harold Arthur Prichard]] who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wittgenstein: If a man says to me, looking at the sky, ‘I think it will rain, therefore I exist,’ I do not understand him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Prichard: That’s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not?{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=496}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{rquote|left|Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.

[[File:52. Ludwig Wittgenstein in von Wright's garden.jpg|thumb|One of the last photographs taken of Wittgenstein, in the garden of [[Georg Henrik von Wright|Georg Henrik von Wrights']] home in [[Cambridge]], Summer 1950; Wittgenstein had taken the sheet from his bed and draped it behind him]]
Wittgenstein resigned the professorship at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing, and in 1947 and 1948 travelled to [[Ireland]], staying at Ross's Hotel in [[Dublin]] and at a farmhouse in [[Redcross]], [[County Wicklow]], where he began the manuscript volume MS 137, Band R. Seeking solitude he moved to ''Rosro'', a holiday cottage in [[Connemara]] owned by Maurice O'Connor-Drury.&lt;ref name=archivefinalyears/&gt;

He also accepted an invitation from [[Norman Malcolm]], then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at [[Ithaca, New York]]. He made the trip in April 1949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: "I haven't done any work since the beginning of March &amp; I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any." A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''. During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with [[philosophical skepticism]], that would eventually become the final fragments ''[[On Certainty]]''.
[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein Blue Plaque, 76 Storey's Way, Cambridge, UK.jpg|thumb|The plaque at "Storey's End", 76 [[Storey's Way]], Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]]
He returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable [[prostate cancer]], which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. "Great loss for me and all of us," he wrote. "Greater than I would have thought." He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with [[Georg Henrik von Wright|G. H. von Wright]]; to London to stay with [[Rush Rhees]]; then to Oxford to see [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into ''Storey's End'' at 76 [[Storey's Way]], the home of his doctor, [[Edward Vaughan Bevan|Edward Bevan]], and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.&lt;ref name="archivefinalyears"&gt;[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/text/biogre11.html "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Final Years"], Cambridge Wittgenstein archive.

By the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, p. 79ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other manuscripts were later published as ''[[Remarks on Colour]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]''.&lt;ref name="archivefinalyears" /&gt; He wrote to Malcolm on 16 April 13 days before his death: "An extraordinary thing happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been ''absolutely'' certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up.—Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks &amp; it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now."&lt;ref name="Malcolm80"&gt;Malcolm, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Death bed.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein on his deathbed, 1951]]
Wittgenstein began work on his final manuscript, MS 177, on 25 April 1951. It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27 April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, "Good!" Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: "Tell them I've had a wonderful life." Norman Malcolm describes this as a "...strangely moving utterance."&lt;ref name=Malcolm80/&gt;{{rquote|left|''I won't say 'See you tomorrow' because that would be like predicting the future, and I'm pretty sure I can't do that.''|Wittgenstein, 1949&lt;ref&gt;Drury, ''Recollections'', p. 160; cf. ''The Danger of Words'' (1973) p. ix, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Four of Wittgenstein's former students arrived at his bedside—Ben Richards, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]]. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father [[Conrad Pepler]], also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.[[File:Wittgenstein Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Wittgenstein's grave at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish Burial Ground]] in [[Cambridge]]]]

Wittgenstein was given a Catholic burial at [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. [[Mark Goldie]], pages 62 and 63 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Drury later said he had been troubled ever since about whether that was the right thing to do.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=576-580}} In 2015 the ledger gravestone was refurbished by the British Wittgenstein Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishwittgensteinsociety.org/wittgensteins-grave|title=Wittgenstein's Grave -|website=www.britishwittgensteinsociety.org|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his religious views, Wittgenstein was said to be greatly interested in [[Catholicism]] and was sympathetic to it. In his university years, he expressed belief in the [[resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="res"&gt;{{Citation |quote=What inclines even me to believe in Christ's resurrection? I play as it were with the thought.–If he did not rise from the dead, then he decomposed in the grave like every human being. He is dead &amp; decomposed. In that case he is a teacher, like any other &amp; can no longer help; &amp; we are once more orphaned &amp; alone. And have to make do with wisdom &amp; speculation. It is as though we are in a hell, where we can only dream &amp; are shut out from heaven, roofed in as it were. But if I am to be REALLY redeemed,– I need certainty–not wisdom, dreams, speculation–and this certainty is faith. And faith is faith in what my heart, my soul, needs, not my speculative intellect. For my soul, with its passions, as it were with its flesh and blood, must be redeemed, not my abstract mind. Perhaps one may say: Only love can believe the Resurrection. Or: it is love that believes the Resurrection |p=33 |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein, Culture and Value |first=Peter |last=Finch |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to [[Norman Malcolm]], Wittgenstein saw Catholicism as more of a way of life than as a set of beliefs he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir|authors=Norman Malcolm; G. H. Von Wright|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199247592|pages=59–60|quote=I believe that Wittgenstein was prepared by his own character and experience to comprehend the idea of a judging and redeeming God. But any cosmological conception of a Deity, derived from the notions of cause or of infinity, would be repugnant to him. He was impatient with 'proofs' of the existence of God, and with attempts to give religion a rational foundation. ...I do not wish to give the impression that Wittgenstein accepted any religious faith—he certainly did not—or that he was a religious person. But I think that there was in him, in some sense, the possibility of religion. I believe that he looked on religion as a 'form of life' (to use an expression from the Investigations) in which he did not participate, but with which he was sympathetic and which greatly interested him. Those who did participate he respected — although here as elsewhere he had contempt for insincerity. I suspect that he regarded religious belief as based on qualities of character and will that he himself did not possess. Of Smythies and Anscombe, both of whom had become Roman Catholics, he once said to me: 'I could not possibly bring myself to believe all the things that they believe.' I think that in this remark he was not disparaging their belief. It was rather an observation about his own capacity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Religious Point of View|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780826490278|author=Tim Labron|page=47|quote=Wittgenstein has no goal to either support or reject religion; his only interest is to keep discussions, whether religious or not, clear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein was said by some commentators to be [[agnostic]], in a qualified sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136731372|author=William Child|page=218|quote="Was Wittgenstein religious?

The idea of a God in the sense of the Bible, the image of God as the creator of the world, hardly ever engaged Wittgenstein's attention..., but the notion of a [[last judgement]] was of profound concern to him." – (Engelmann)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|year=2007|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|isbn=9781861893208|pages=145–146|author=Edward Kanterian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1953: Publication of the ''Philosophical Investigations''==
{{Main|Philosophical Investigations|Language-game|Private language argument}}
[[File:Kaninchen und Ente.png|thumb|Illustration of a "[[Rabbit–duck illusion|duckrabbit]]", discussed in the ''Philosophical Investigations'', section XI, part II]]
The ''[[Blue and Brown Books|Blue Book]]'', a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933–1934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language and is widely read as a turning-point in his philosophy of language.

''Philosophical Investigations'' was published in two parts in 1953. Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues the bewitchments of philosophical problems arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called "language gone on holiday."&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §107.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the "rough ground" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear."&lt;ref&gt;''PI'', §133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Wittgenstein left a voluminous archive of unpublished papers, including 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 pages. Choosing among repeated drafts, revisions, corrections and loose notes editorial work has found nearly one third of the total suitable for print.&lt;ref&gt;Stern D., "The Bergen Electronic Edition of Wittgenstein's Nachlass", ''[[European Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol 18, Issue 3, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; An Internet facility hosted by the [[University of Bergen]] allows access to images of almost all the material and to search the available transcriptions.&lt;ref&gt;The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen [http://wab.uib.no/wab_nachlass.page/ (WAB)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 two new boxes of Wittgenstein papers were found.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press release: [http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/unpublished-wittgenstein-archive-explored Unpublished Wittgenstein Archive explored]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' was the only nearly finished project and the book was published in 1953.

In 1999 a survey among American university and college teachers ranked the ''Investigations'' as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations."&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; The ''Investigations'' also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences.&lt;ref name="milproj"/&gt;

[[Peter Hacker]] argues that Wittgenstein's influence on 20th-century analytical philosophy can be attributed to his early influence on the Vienna Circle and later influence on the Oxford "ordinary language" school and Cambridge philosophers.&lt;ref name=hacker&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Hacker|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/58/Peter_Hacker|website=Philosophy Now|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interpreters===
Since Wittgenstein's death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between "early" and "late" Wittgenstein (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the ''Tractatus'' and those in ''Philosophical Investigations''), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein's unpublished papers (the ''[[Nachlass]]'').&lt;ref name="Glock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glock|first1=Hans-Johann|editor1-last=Kahane|editor1-first=Guy|editor2-last=Kanterian|editor2-first=Edward|editor3-last=Kuusela|editor3-first=Oskari|title=Wittgenstein and his interpreters: essays in memory of Gordon Baker|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9781405129220|pages=37–65|chapter=Perspectives on Wittgenstein: An Intermittently Opinionated Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of [[The New Wittgenstein]] school such as [[Cora Diamond]], [[Alice Crary]], and [[James F. Conant]].  While the ''Tractatus'', particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a "therapeutic" understanding of Wittgenstein's work—"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing."{{sfn|Crary|2000|p=1}} To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the ''Tractatus'' as "plain nonsense"—arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of [[John Wisdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John|last=Wisdom|title=Philosophy and Psycho-Analysis|publisher=Blackwell|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the review of ''The Blue Book'' written by [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]].&lt;ref name="Glock" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouwsma|first1=O. K.|title=The Blue Book|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=16 March 1961|volume=58|issue=6|pages=141–162|doi=10.2307/2023409|jstor=2023409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapeutic approach is not without critics: [[Hans-Johann Glock]] argues that the "plain nonsense" reading of the ''Tractatus'' "...is at odds with the external evidence, writings and conversations in which Wittgenstein states that the ''Tractatus'' is committed to the idea of ineffable insight."&lt;ref name="Glock" /&gt;

====Bertrand Russell====
In October 1944, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge around the same time as Russell who had been living in [[United States|America]] for several years. Russell returned to Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;&lt;blockquote&gt;Russell’s books should be bound in two colours…those dealing with mathematical logic in red – and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue – and no one should be allowed to read them.{{sfn|Monk|1990|p=471}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Philosophical Development|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1959|isbn=978-0041920154|location=New York|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Saul Kripke ====
[[Saul Kripke]]'s 1982 book ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]'' contends that the central argument of [[Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' centers on a devastating [[rule-following paradox]] that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language.  Kripke writes that this paradox is "the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date."&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''. Basil Blackwell Publishing, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as [[Gordon Baker]] and [[Peter Hacker]], who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has, however recently been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher [[Martin Kusch]] (2006), and Wittgenstein scholar [[David G. Stern]] considers the book to be "the most influential and widely discussed" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David G. 2006.

'''The MDI Biological Laboratory''' is an independent non-profit biomedical research institution founded in 1898 and located in [[Salisbury Cove, Maine]], on [[Mount Desert Island]]. Its mission is to improve human health and well- being through basic research, education, and development ventures that transform discoveries into cures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/about/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Laboratory was designated a Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) by the [[National Institutes of Health]], which awarded the Laboratory a grant of $13 million over five years to expand the institution’s research program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cobre.maineidea.net/ MDI Biological Laboratory COBRE Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The MDI Biological Laboratory has a full-time staff of 63, and will offer 23 research training courses in 2014.

==Research==

Scientists at the MDI Biological Laboratory focus on studying [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] and [[aging]] to promote longer, healthier lives. They are developing new approaches for treating and preventing [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], [[stroke]], [[diabetes]], and [[cancer]], as well as [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]], and [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s]] diseases. To do so, they pick the most efficient, effective, and economical [[model organism]] for each biological question, knowing that our common evolutionary heritage means that humans share a remarkable percentage of our genome with organisms that appear to be completely different than humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/research/regenerative-biology/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, MDI Biological Laboratory scientists study the tiny nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', with a lifespan of two to three weeks, to study [[genes]] that regulate [[aging]] and lifespan. Those same genes are present in [[human]]s. They study organisms such as [[zebrafish]] and [[salamander]]s that are naturally able to regenerate diseased or damaged tissue, organs, and limbs using the same genetic mechanisms found in humans. However, for some reason those mechanisms have been turned off in most [[mammal]]s. MDI Biological Laboratory scientists are learning how to reactivate these mechanisms to promote healing in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/research/regenerative-biology/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 scientists at the MDI Biological Laboratory formed a spin-off company, NovoBiosciences, to explore the potential of ZF143, a naturally occurring compound, to speed wound healing and tissue repair in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/press-release/research-discovery-leads-to-new-private-company/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and workforce training==

Education is an important part of the MDI Biological Laboratory’s mission. Students at all levels, from middle school to medical school, receive hands-on research training that prepares them for the 21st century workforce. In 2014, the Laboratory offered 25 one- or two-week-long courses for [[Maine]] undergraduates, medical students, and scientific professionals. Academic year and summer fellowships are offered for high school and undergraduate students. These fellowships provide an extended opportunity for students to work directly with an MDI Biological Laboratory scientist and gain real-world research experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/education/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/education/hs-undergrad/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDI Biological Laboratory leads the Maine INBRE or IDeA Network for Biomedical Research Excellence, a collaborative network of three Maine research institutions and ten Maine colleges that is strengthening Maine's capacity to conduct competitive biomedical research. Since its founding in 2001, the INBRE program has brought more than $68 million into Maine in federal grants for the research and education programs it supports, as well as an additional $38 million in federal funding for research initiated under the INBRE grant. Half of all INBRE funds are distributed across Maine among INBRE partner institutions to support student research training and junior faculty. The program has trained more than 2,000 Maine students in state-of-the-art research methods. Over 90% of INBRE graduates pursue careers or advanced education in scientific or medical fields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/research/maine-inbre/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13 institutions participating in the Maine INBRE are the MDI Biological Laboratory as lead institution, The [[Jackson Laboratory]], [[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]], [[Bates College|Bates]], and [[Colby College]]s, [[College of the Atlantic]], the [[University of Maine]], the University of Maine Honors College, and the [[University of Maine at Farmington]], [[University of Maine at Fort Kent|Fort Kent]], [[University of Maine at Machias|Machias]], and [[University of Maine at Presque Isle|Presque Isle]], and [[Southern Maine Community College]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/research/maine-inbre/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

IDeA and INBRE are programs administered and funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]].

==Public and environmental programs==

Programs at the MDI Biological Laboratory help break down the barriers that often exist between science and the public. The Laboratory offers the MDI Science Cafés, Family Science Night, Art Meets Science program, and the Community Environmental Health Laboratory (CEHL).&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/events/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Environmental Health Laboratory (CEHL) works to identify, locate, and remedy threats to public health and the clean waters on and around [[Mount Desert Island]] by putting science in the hands of community volunteers, students, and teachers. Every CEHL project relies on volunteer efforts from students and community members, and involves community education. Current projects at CEHL include the study and restoration of [[Zostera|eelgrass]] beds in [[Frenchman Bay]], eelgrass-based education and outreach in middle and high schools, swim beach water quality monitoring, and [[phytoplankton]] monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/research/environmental-sustainability/cehl/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

CEHL's director, Jane Disney, Ph.D., is the recipient of numerous awards for her community-based science efforts, including the [[SeaWorld]] [[Busch Gardens]] Environmental Excellence Award (1998), the Governor’s Award for Environmental Excellence (2000), and the Gulf of Maine Council Visionary Award (2007). She has been instrumental in the forming of the Frenchman Bay Partners, a broad-based stakeholder group committed to a sustainable future for [[Frenchman Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/faculty/jane-e-disney/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human and environmental sustainability summits==

The MDI Biological Laboratory launched the Human and Environmental Sustainability Summits in 2013 as part of its focus on improving human and environmental health and on using science to solve real world problems. The summits bring together a diverse group of stakeholders to develop actionable solutions to critical problems in environmental and public health. In 2014, forty scientists, engineers, health officials, consumer advocates, food industry representatives, and educators addressed the global problem of [[arsenic]] in [[food]] and [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mdibl.org/research/environmental-sustainability/ MDI Biological Laboratory Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">The Assyrian '''Eponym Chronicles''' represent an important source for the [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]]. They are chronicles or annals, which list at least one notable event per year under the name of a ruling official. 

The oldest eponym chronicle is the one compiled at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the 18th century BC, covering the years before and during the reign of [[Shamshi-Adad I]].
It is extant in eleven fragments excavated at the [[Royal Palace of Mari]] and first edited by M. Birot in 1985.

Michel (2002) proposed the identification of a solar eclipse mentioned in the Mari Eponym Chronicle (in the year eponymous of  Puzur-Ishtar) [[List_of_solar_eclipses_in_the_19th_century_BC|solar eclipse of  24 June 1833 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michel, "Nouvelles données pour la chronologie du IIe millénaire", ''NABU'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Werner Nahm]] (2014) this would date the beginning of the reign of [[Hammurabi]] to 1784 BC (close to the date of 1792 BC according to the [[Middle Chronology]]).{{cn|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--only found journalisti/blog reports on a talk given by Nahm on this in 2014, it does not appear this was actually published. It also isn't clear what of this is Nahm's own speculation and what is based on Michel (2002).--&gt;

==History==
Following the founding of an apprenticeship-training program in librarianship in 1897, the McGill Summer Library School was formally founded in 1904 under the jurisdiction of the University Library Committee to offer education in library administration. It was the first formal library education program in Canada, and one of the first university programs in librarianship outside of the United States. The School was renamed the Graduate School of Library Science in 1965, the Graduate School of Library and Information Studies in 1985, and the School of Information Studies in 2007.

'''Memphis Mansion''', until 2015 '''Graceland Randers''', is a museum and restaurant in [[Randers]], [[Denmark]]. It is dedicated to the rock and roll singer and actor [[Elvis Presley]] (1935-1977).

== History and background ==
The museum was opened on 14 April 2011 by Henrik Knudsen ([[:da:Henrik Knudsen (født 1964)|da]]). The official opening took place the day after, by the mayor of Randers Henning Jensen Nyhuus ([[:da:Henning Jensen Nyhuus|da]]), the American ambassador [[James P. Cain]] and the singer [[Suzi Quatro]].&lt;ref&gt;Henning Bagger, [http://www.gettyimages.nl/detail/nieuwsfoto's/creator-of-the-graceland-in-randers-henrik-knudsen-former-nieuwsfotos/112226190 Creator of the 'Graceland in Randers', Henrik Knudsen], 15 April 2011, Getty Images&lt;/ref&gt; It is twice as big as [[Graceland]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], from where the outside is nearly a straight copy.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

The museum has a collection of about 6,000 pieces,&lt;ref name="LocalDK" /&gt; with an estimated value of 1.5 million euro.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;CNN, [http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/07/travel/denmark-graceland-elvis/ Celebrating Elvis at Denmark's King-size Graceland], 7 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Next to that, a restaurant in American style and a fan shop have been established.&lt;ref name="LocalDK" /&gt;

Memphis Mansion is in the top 50 of Danish attractions.&lt;ref name="LocalDK" /&gt; In 2015 it attracted 130,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;VRT News Belgium, [http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur%2Ben%2Bmedia/muziek/1.2530598# Deens Elvismuseum mag niet langer "Graceland" heten], 23 December 2015 {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name change ==
Knudsen registrered the name Graceland Randers in 2006, about five years before the opening in 2011. In 2015 a lawsuit was filed against him for unlawful use of the name of ''Graceland''. The Sø- og Handelsretten (Maritime and Commercial Court) justified the claim of the hairs in September 2016 and imposed an indemnification of 500,000 [[Danish krone]]s (circa 75,000 dollar). Prior to the judgement the name was changed to Memphis Mansion. The claim that counterfeit articles of Elvis had been sold, was declared unfounded.&lt;ref name="LocalDK"&gt;The Local DK, [https://www.thelocal.dk/20160921/danish-museum-forced-to-pay-elvis-presley-heirs Danish museum forced to pay Elvis Presley heirs], 21 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8695">'''Narrative psychology''' is a perspective within [[psychology]] concerned with the "storied nature of human conduct",&lt;ref name=sarbin/&gt; that is, how human beings deal with experience by observing stories and listening to the stories of others. Operating under the assumption that [[human activity]] and [[experience]] are filled with "meaning" and stories, rather than [[logical argument]]s or lawful formulations, narrative psychology is the study of how human beings construct stories to deal with experiences.

==Definition==

==History==
Psychologists became interested in stories and everyday accounts of life in the 1970s. The term narrative psychology was introduced by [[Theodore R. Sarbin]] in his 1986 book ''Narrative Psychology: The storied nature of human conduct''&lt;ref name=sarbin&gt;{{cite book|title=Narrative Psychology: The storied nature of human conduct|first=Theodore R.|last=Sarbin|year=1986|publisher=Praeger|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=X5JrAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he claimed that human conduct is best explained through stories and that this explanation should be done through [[qualitative research]].&lt;ref name=Forgas&gt;{{cite book|page=8|title=Social Cognition and Communication|chapter=Social Cognition and Communication: Background, Theories, and Research|last1=Forgas|first1=Joseph P.|first2=Orsolya|last2=Vincze|first3=János|last3=László|year=2013|publisher=Psychology Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gYQ3AAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarbin argued that "narrative" is a root metaphor for psychology that should replace the mechanistic and organic metaphors which shaped so much theory and research in the discipline over the past century.&lt;ref name=sarbin/&gt;

[[Jerome Bruner]] explored the "narrative kind of knowing" in a more [[empirical]] way in his 1986 book ''Actual Minds, Possible Worlds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Actual Minds, Possible Worlds|first=Jerome|last=Bruner|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=YNuBf6W2rt0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruner makes a distinction between "[[paradigmatic]]" and "narrative" forms of thought, proposing that they are both fundamental but irreducible to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acts of Meaning|first=Jerome|last=Bruner|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=YHt_M41uIuUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative approach was also furthered by [[Dan P. McAdams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Stories We Live by: Personal Myths and the Making of the Self|first=Dan P.|last=McAdams|publisher=Guilford Press|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2d0v6Y6JoxAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; who put forward a life story model of identity to describe three levels of [[personality]], leading to explorations of how significant life transitions are narrated and how the "self and culture come together in narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=15|title=Narrative Psychology: Identity, Transformation and Ethics|first=Julia|last=Vassilieva|year=2016|publisher=Springer|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Nj4WDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Redemptive Self: Stories Americans Live By |first=Dan P.|last=McAdams|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-1TqSoLAkMUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative psychological approaches have become influential in research into the self and identity, as analysing life stories can explore the "unity and coherence" of the self.&lt;ref name=Forgas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Narrative Psychology, Trauma and the Study of Self/Identity|first=Michele L.|last=Crossley|journal=Theory Psychology|year=2000|pages=527–546|doi=10.1177/0959354300104005}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, narrative psychology has sought to use [[quantitative research]]  to study communication and identity, studying narratives to obtain empirical data about human social cognition and adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Stories: An Introduction to Narrative Psychology|first=János|last=László|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_f18AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Narrative psychologists use interviews to provide an opportunity for a person to give a detailed account of their life or particular events. Narratives can then be transcribed and analyzed in order to describe and interpret them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Qualitative Psychology: A Practical Guide to Research Methods|chapter=Narrative Psychology|first=Michael|last=Murray|pages=85–107|editor=Jonathan A. Smith|publisher=SAGE|year=2015|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GwMSCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Qualitative+Psychology:+A+Practical+Guide+to+Research+Methods&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIir65tO_SAhWkK8AKHcqsBQsQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Qualitative%20Psychology%3A%20A%20Practical%20Guide%20to%20Research%20Methods&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
According to Brown and Taylor (1997), African-American slaves have made contributions to narrative psychology by participating in the [[Federal Writers' Project]] that was conducted from 1937 to 1938. Nearly three hundred field workers participated in the process of interviewing 2000 slaves across seventeen states to construct  narratives from the former slaves' accounts of their lives as slaves and during the period after the Civil War. One of the best interviewers was said to be folklorist [[Ruby Pickens Tartt]], who worked principally in rural Sumter County in Alabama. She recorded exactly what the slaves would say in their interviews, and she went on to write folk tales based on their tales.&lt;ref name=brown-taylor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Alan|last2=Taylor|first2=David|year=1997|title=Gabr'l Blow Sof':  Sumter County, Alabama, Slave Narratives|publisher=Livingston Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WwAXAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Gabr'l+Blow+Sof':++Sumter+County,+Alabama,+Slave+Narratives&amp;dq=Gabr'l+Blow+Sof':++Sumter+County,+Alabama,+Slave+Narratives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6sqkjNXQAhWDoJQKHWM5AXwQ6AEIHTAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gregorian chant.gif|frame|A sample of [[Kyrie|Kýrie Eléison]] XI (Orbis Factor) from the ''Liber Usualis''. [[Media:Kyrie XI (Orbis Factor) sample.ogg|Listen]] to it interpreted.]]
A '''neume''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|nj|uː|m}}; sometimes spelled '''neum''')&lt;ref&gt;Dom Gregory Sunol, ''Textbook of Gregorian Chant According to the Solesmes Method'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-7661-7241-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7661-7241-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/chantsofchurch.pdf Chants of the Church]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/liberusualis.pdf Liber Usualis]&lt;/ref&gt; is the basic element of Western and Eastern systems of [[musical notation]] prior to the invention of five-line [[staff (music)|staff]] notation. The word entered the English language in the [[Middle English]] forms "newme", "nevme", "neme" in the 15th century, from the [[Middle French]] "neume", in turn from either medieval Latin "pneuma" or "neuma", the former either from [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|πνεῦμα}} {{transl|grc|''pneuma''}} ("breath") or {{lang|grc|νεῦμα}} {{transl|grc|''neuma''}} ("sign"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|neume}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pneu{{=}}ma|πνεῦμα}}, {{LSJ|neu{{=}}ma|νεῦμα|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or else directly from Greek as a [[corruption (linguistics)|corruption]] or an adaptation of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED2|neume}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--OED does not support this alternative etymology, though it does discuss the similarity of forms.--&gt;&lt;!--OED 2nd edition does (as an ad., i.e. adaptation); it is in fact the only etymology it provides: "neume, neum Mus. ... ad. Gr. πνεῦμα breath: see pneum, pneuma.]"--&gt;

The earliest neumes were inflective marks that indicated the general shape but not necessarily the exact [[Musical note|note]]s or [[rhythm]]s to be sung. Later developments included the use of heightened neumes that showed the relative [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] between neumes, and the creation of a four-line musical staff that identified particular pitches. Neumes do not generally indicate rhythm, but additional [[symbol]]s were sometimes juxtaposed with neumes to indicate changes in [[Articulation (music)|articulation]], [[duration (music)|duration]], or [[tempo]]. Neumatic notation was later used in [[medieval music]] to indicate certain patterns of rhythm called [[rhythmic mode]]s, and eventually evolved into [[Modern musical symbols|modern musical notation]]. Neumatic notation remains standard in modern editions of [[plainchant]].

==Early history==
Although [[chant]] was probably sung since the earliest days of the church, for centuries they were only transmitted [[Oral tradition|orally]].

The earliest known systems involving neumes are of [[Aramaic]] origin and were used to notate inflections in the quasi-emmelic (melodic) [[recitation]] of the [[Christian]] [[Holy Scriptures|holy scriptures]]. As such they resemble functionally a similar system used for the notation of recitation of the [[Qur'an]], the holy book of [[Islam]]. This early system was called ''ekphonetic notation'', from the Greek ἐκφώνησις ''ekphonesis'' meaning quasi-melodic recitation of text.

Around the 9th century neumes began to become shorthand [[mnemonic]] aids for the proper [[Melody|melodic]] recitation of [[chant]].&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest examples is the ''[[Planctus de obitu Karoli]]'' (c.814), which was provided neumatic notation in the 10th century, [[cf.]] [[Rosamond McKitterick]] (2008), ''Charlemagne: The Formation of a European Identity'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-88672-4}}), 225 n54. For the lyrics, see Peter Godman (1985), ''Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 206–11.&lt;/ref&gt; A prevalent view is that neumatic notation was first developed in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. This seems plausible given the well-documented peak of musical composition and cultural activity in major cities of the empire (now regions of southern [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]]) at that time. The corpus of extant [[Byzantine music]] in [[manuscript]] and printed form is far larger than that of the [[Gregorian chant]], due in part to the fact that neumes fell into disuse in the west after the rise of modern staff notation and with it the new techniques of [[polyphonic music]], while the Eastern tradition of [[Greek orthodox church]] music and the reformed neume notation remains alive until today.

Slavic neume notations ("[[Znamenny Chant]]") are on the whole even more difficult to decipher and [[Transcription (music)|transcribe]] than Byzantine or Gregorian neume notations.

==Use in Western plainchant==
[[File:Neume2.jpg|thumb|right|"''Iubilate deo universa terra''" shows [[psalm]] verses in unheightened cheironomic neumes.]]The earliest Western notation for chant appears in the 9th century.  These early staffless neumes, called ''cheironomic'' or ''in campo aperto'', appeared as freeform wavy lines above the text.  Various scholars see these as deriving from [[cheironomy|cheironomic]] hand-gestures, from the ekphonetic notation of Byzantine chant, or from [[punctuation]] or accent marks.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth levy, "Plainchant", Grove Music Online, edited by Laura Macy (Accessed January 20, 2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.40099.2.3#music.40099.2.3 (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; A single neume could represent a single pitch, or a series of pitches all sung on the same [[syllable]]. Cheironomic neumes indicated changes in pitch and duration within each syllable, but did not attempt to specify the pitches of individual notes, the [[interval (music)|intervals]] between pitches within a neume, nor the relative starting pitches of different syllables' neumes.

There is evidence that the earliest Western [[musical notation]], in the form of neumes ''in campo aperto'' (without [[Staff (music)|staff]]-lines), was created at [[Metz]] around 800, as a result of [[Charlemagne]]'s desire for [[Franks|Frank]]ish church musicians to retain the performance nuances used by the Roman singers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jams.2003.56.1.43 James Grier ''Ademar de Chabannes, Carolingian Musical Practices, and "Nota Romana"''], Journal of the American Musicological Society, Vol. 56, No. 1 (Spring, 2003), pp. 43-98, retrieved July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably these were intended only as mnemonics for melodies learned by ear. The earliest extant manuscripts (9th–10th centuries) of such neumes include:
* the [[abbey of St. Gall]], in modern-day Switzerland
* Messine neumes (from the monastery of [[Metz]] in northeast France)
* [[Aquitaine|Aquitanian]] neumes (southern France, also used in Spain)
* [[Notre-Dame of Laon|Laon]], [[Cathedral of Chartres|Chartres]], [[Montpellier]]

[[Image:Digraphic neumes.png|thumb|right|Digraphic neumes in an 11th-century manuscript from Dijon. Letter names for individual notes in the neume are provided]]
In the early 11th century, Beneventan neumes (from the churches of [[Benevento]] in southern Italy) were written at varying distances from the text to indicate the overall shape of the melody; such neumes are called "heightened" or "diastematic" neumes, which showed the relative pitches between neumes. A few manuscripts from the same period use "digraphic" notation in which note names are included below the neumes. Shortly after this, one to four [[staff (music)|staff]] lines—an innovation traditionally ascribed to [[Guido d'Arezzo]]—clarified the exact relationship between pitches. One line was marked as representing a particular pitch, usually C or F. These neumes resembled the same thin, scripty style of the chironomic notation. By the 11th century, chironomic neumes had evolved into square notation;&lt;ref name="Gregorian Chant"&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/classicalmusic15/gregorian-chant Gregorian Chant]&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, a variant called Gothic neumes continued to be used until the 16th century. This variant is also known as ''Hufnagel notation'', as the used neumes resemble the nails (hufnagels) one uses to attach horseshoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/13500|title= Hufnagel|author= David Hiley|website= Oxford Music Online|publisher= Oxford University|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Graduale Aboense.jpg|thumb|right|"''Gaudeamus omnes''," from the ''Graduale&amp;nbsp;Aboense'', was scripted using square notation.]]
By the 13th century, the neumes of Gregorian chant were usually written in ''square notation'' on a staff with four lines and three spaces and a [[clef]] marker, as in the 14th-15th century ''Graduale Aboense'' shown here.  In square notation, small groups of ascending notes on a syllable are shown as stacked squares, read from bottom to top, while descending notes are written with diamonds read from left to right.  In [[melisma]]tic chants, in which a syllable may be sung to a large number of notes, a series of smaller such groups of neumes are written in succession, read from left to right.  A special symbol called the ''custos'', placed at the end of a system, showed which pitch came next at the start of the following system.  Special neumes such as the oriscus, quilisma, and liquescent neumes, indicate particular vocal treatments for these notes.  This system of square notation is standard in modern chantbooks.

==Solesmes notation==
Various manuscripts and printed editions of Gregorian chant, using varying styles of square-note neumes, circulated throughout the Catholic Church for centuries. Some editions added rhythmic patterns, or [[Metre (music)|meter]], to the chants. In the 19th century the monks of the Benedictine abbey of [[St. Peter's Abbey, Solesmes|Solesmes]], particularly [[Joseph Pothier|Dom Joseph Pothier]] (1835–1923) and [[André Mocquereau|Dom André Mocquereau]] (1849–1930) collected [[facsimile]]s of the earliest manuscripts and published them in a series of 12 publications called ''[[Paléographie musicale]] ([[:fr:Paléographie musicale|French article]])''. They also assembled definitive versions of many of the chants, and developed a standardized form of the square-note notation that was adopted by the Catholic Church and is still in use in publications such as the [[Liber Usualis]] (although there are also published editions of this book in modern notation).

As a general rule, the notes of a single neume are never sung to more than one syllable; all three pitches of a three-note neume, for example, must all be sung on the same syllable. (This is not universally accepted; Richard Crocker has argued that in the special case of the early Aquitanian polyphony of the [[St. Martial school]], neumes must have been "broken" between syllables to facilitate the coordination of parts.)  However, a single syllable may be sung to so many notes that several neumes in succession are used to notate it. The single-note neumes indicate that only a single note corresponds to that syllable. Chants that primarily use single-note neumes are called ''syllabic''; chants with typically one multi-note neume per syllable are called ''neumatic'', and those with many neumes per syllable are called ''melismatic''.

==Rhythmic interpretation==
The Solesmes monks also determined, based on their research, [[performance practice]] for Gregorian chant. Because of the ambiguity of medieval musical notation, the question of rhythm in Gregorian chant is contested by scholars. Some neumes, such as the ''pressus'', do indicate the lengthening of notes.{{contradiction inline|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--According to Hiley's New Grove article, cited later, the pressus is a compound neume involving three or more consecutive notes. From that description, it is only the oriscus component of the pressus that might be construed as a lengthening.--&gt; Common modern practice, following the Solesmes interpretation, is to perform Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, in which time is free, allowing the text to determine the accent and the melodic contour to determine phrasing. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, it is believed that most chant was sung with each note getting approximately an equal value, although [[Jerome of Moravia]] cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, "Chant", p. 44.  "The performance of chant in equal note lengths from the 13th century onwards is well supported by contemporary statements."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Solesmes school, represented by Dom Pothier and Dom Mocquereau, supports a rhythm of equal values per note, allowing for lengthening and shortening of note values for musical purposes. A second school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, supports different rhythmic realizations of chant by imposing musical meter on the chant in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  Musicologist [[Gustave Reese]] said that the second group, called ''mensuralists'', "have an impressive amount of historical evidence on their side" (''Music in the Middle Ages'', p.&amp;nbsp;146), but the equal-note Solesmes interpretation has permeated the musical world, apparently due to its ease of learning and resonance with modern musical taste.&lt;ref&gt;Mahrt "Chant,", p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clefs===
Neumes are written on a four-line [[Staff (music)|staff]] on the lines and spaces, unlike modern music notation, which uses five lines. Chant does not rely on any [[absolute pitch]] or key; the clefs are only to establish the half and whole steps of the [[solfege]] or hexachord scale: "ut", "re", "mi", "fa", "sol", "la", "ti", "ut". The clef bracketing a line indicates the location "ut" in the case of the C clef, or "fa" in the case of the F clef as shown:

===Neumes representing single notes===
:{| class="wikitable"
|-
|[[File:punctum1.gif]] || '''Punctum''' ("point")
|-
|[[File:virga1.gif|34x77px]] || '''Virga''' ("rod")
|-
|[[File:repercussive.gif]] || '''Bipunctum''' ("two points")
|}
The virga and punctum are sung identically. Scholars disagree on whether the bipunctum indicates a note twice as long, or whether the same note should be re-articulated. When this latter interpretation is favoured, it may be called a ''repercussive neume''.

===Neumes representing two notes===
:{| class="wikitable"
|-
|[[File:clivis.gif]] || '''Clivis''' ("by slope") || Two notes descending
|-
|[[File:podatus.gif]] || '''Podatus''' or '''Pes''' ("foot") || Two notes ascending
|}
When two notes are one above the other, as in the podatus, the lower note is always sung first.

===Three-note neumes===
:{| class="wikitable"
|-
|[[File:scandicus.gif]] || '''Scandicus''' || Three notes ascending
|-
|[[File:climacus.gif]] || '''Climacus''' || Three notes descending
|-
|[[File:torculus.gif]] || '''Torculus''' || down-up-down
|-
|[[File:porrectus.gif]] || '''Porrectus''' || up-down-up
|}
The fact that the first two notes of the porrectus are connected as a diagonal rather than as individual notes seems to be a scribe's shortcut.

===Compound neumes===
Several neumes in a row can be juxtaposed for a single syllable, but the following usages have specific names. These are only a few examples.
:{| class="wikitable"
|-
| [[File:pressus.gif]] || '''Praepunctis''' || a note appended to the beginning is ''praepunctis''; this example is a ''podatus pressus'' because it involves a repeated note
|-
|[[File:scandicus subbipunctus.gif]] || '''Subpunctis''' || One or more notes appended at the end of a neume; this example is a ''scandicus subbipunctis''
|}

===Other basic markings===
:{| class="wikitable"
|-
|[[File:Flat neume.gif]] || Flat || Same meaning as modern [[flat (music)|flat]]; only occurs on B, and is placed before the entire neume, or group of neumes, rather than immediately before the affected note.
|-
|[[File:Custos.gif]] || '''Custos''' || At the end of a staff, the ''custos'' indicates what the first note of the next staff will be
|-
|[[File:Punctum mora.gif]] || '''Mora''' || Like a dot in modern notation, lengthens the preceding note, typically doubling it
|}

===Interpretive marks===
The interpretation of these markings is the subject of great dispute among scholars.
:{| class="wikitable"
|-
|[[File:vertical episema.gif]] || Vertical '''episema'''&lt;BR&gt;(vertical stroke) || Indicates a subsidiary accent when there are five or more notes in a neume group. This marking was an invention of the Solemnes interpreters, rather than a marking from the original manuscripts.
|-
|[[File:horizontal episema.gif]] || Horizontal '''episema'''&lt;BR&gt;(horizontal stroke) || Used over a single note or a group of notes (as shown), essentially ignored in the Solesmes interpretation; other scholars treat it as indicating a lengthening or stress on the note(s).
|-
|[[File:liquescent.gif]] || '''Liquescent neume'''&lt;BR&gt;(small note) || Can occur on almost any type of neume pointing up or down; usually associated with certain letter combinations such as double consonants, consonant pairs, or diphthongs in the text; usually interpreted as a kind of [[grace note]]
|-
|[[File:quilisma.gif]] || '''Quilisma'''&lt;BR&gt;(squiggly note) || Always as part of a multi-note neume, usually a climacus, this sign is a matter of great dispute; the Solesmes interpretation is that the ''preceding'' note is to be lengthened slightly.
|}

Other interpretations of the quilisma:
* '''Shake''' or [[trill (music)|trill]]—Prof. William Mahrt of [[Stanford University]] supports this interpretation. This interpretation is also put into practice by the Washington Cappella Antiqua, under the current direction of Dr. Patrick Jacobson.
* [[Quarter tone|Quarter-tone]] or [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]. The support for this interpretation lies in some early '''digraphic''' manuscripts that combine chironomic neumes with letter-names. In places where other manuscripts have quilismas these digraphs often have a strange symbol in place of a letter, suggesting to some scholars the use of a pitch outside the [[solmization]] system represented by the letter names.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

There are other uncommon neume shapes thought to indicate special types of vocal performance, though their precise meaning is a matter of debate:&lt;ref&gt;Don Michael Randel (ed.). 2003. "Neume".

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orthodox Solesme interpretation of this obscure three-note neume is a unison plus a third below, but there are other possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;David Hughes, "The Musical Text of the Introit ''Ressurexi''", in ''Music in Medieval Europe: Studies in Honour of Bryan Gillingham'', edited by Terence Bailey and Alma Colk Santosuosso, 163–80 (Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate Publishing, 2007), p.&amp;nbsp;170. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5239-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have originated at St. Gall, though it is also widespread in French chant sources from the 10th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;David Hughes, "An Enigmatic Neume", in ''Themes and Variations: Writings on Music in Honor of Rulan Chao Pian'', edited by Bell Yung and Joseph S. C. Lam, 8–30 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press Press, 1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that it may have a [[microtone|microtonal]] meaning, but there is "an admitted lack of conclusiveness in the arguments in favor of notes smaller than a semitone."&lt;ref&gt;David Hughes, "An Enigmatic Neume", in ''Themes and Variations: Writings on Music in Honor of Rulan Chao Pian'', edited by Bell Yung and Joseph S. C. Lam, 8–30 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press Press, 1994), p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''distropha''' and '''tristropha''' are groups of two and three '''apostrophes''', usually of the same pitch. They probably differed from normal repeated notes (virgae or puncta) in the way they were sung. Although there is some doubt on the matter, most modern writers accept Aurelian of Réôme's description of a staccato reiteration.&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley, "Distropha, tristropha [double apostrophe, bistropha; triple apostrophe]", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''oriscus''' is a single-note neume, usually found added as an auxiliary note to another neume. The name may derive from either the Greek ''horos'' (limit) or ''ōriskos'' (little hill). Its intended manner of performance is not clear. Although a microtonal interpretation has been suggested, there is possible contradicting evidence in the Dijon tonary, Montpellier H. 159.&lt;ref&gt;Anon., "Oriscus", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''pressus''' is a compound neume, usually involving an initial neume followed by an oriscus and a punctum. The initial neume may be a virga (in which case the virga + oriscus may be together called a ''virga strata''), in which case the pressus indicates three notes; if the initial neume is a pes, then the compound indicates a four-note group. Just as with the oriscus itself, the interpretation is unsure. When chant came to be notated on a staff, the oriscus was normally represented as having the same pitch as the immediately preceding note.&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley, "Pressus", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also ''litterae significativae'' in many manuscripts, usually interpreted to indicate variations in tempo, e.g. c = ''celeriter'' (fast), t = ''tenete'' (hold) (an early form of the [[tenuto]]), a = ''auge'' (lengthen, as in a [[Tie (music)|tie]]). The Solesmes editions omit all such letters.

==Other functions of Western neumes==
Neumes were used for notating other kinds of melody than plainchant, including [[troubadour]] and [[trouvère]] melodies, monophonic versus and conductus, and the individual lines of [[polyphony|polyphonic]] songs.  In some traditions, such as the [[Notre Dame school]] of polyphony, certain patterns of neumes were used to represent particular rhythmic patterns called [[rhythmic mode]]s.&lt;!--This section needs expansion--&gt;

==Other types==
* Ekphonetic neumes annotating the melodic recitation of (Christian) holy scriptures.
* Neumes of [[Byzantine music]] – in several stages, old Byzantine, middle Byzantine, late Byzantine and post-Byzantine, and neo-Byzantine (reformed).
* Neumes of Slavic chant (Slavic neumes).
* Mozarabic or Hispanic neumes ([[Spain]]), also called [[Visigothic script (music notation)|Visigothic script]]. These neumes have not been deciphered, but the [[Mozarabic]] liturgy varies somewhat from the [[Latin rite|Roman rite]].
* [[Catalan notation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Els manuscrits musicals a Catalunya fins al segle XIII|last = Garrigosa i Massana|first = Joaquim|publisher = Institut d'Estudis Ilerdencs|year = 2003|isbn = 9788489943742|location = Lleida|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Daseian notation]] – an early form of Western music notation used in 9th and 10th-century [[music theory]] treatises.
* [[Buddhist chant]] uses a type of neume.

==Digital notation==
Because [[Scorewriter|notation software]] usually focuses on modern European [[List of musical symbols|music notation]], software that allows the user to use neumes is rare.
* [[Gregorio (software)|Gregorio]] is a software especially written for that purpose. With its own GABC-Syntax and together with [[LuaTeX]] it provides high quality output of square notation neumes and also St. Gall neumes.

A '''Persian miniature'''  ([[Persian language|Persian]]:نگارگری ایرانی) is a small painting on paper, whether a book illustration or a separate work of art intended to be kept in an album of such works called a ''[[muraqqa]]''.  The techniques are broadly comparable to the Western and Byzantine traditions of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Although there is an equally well-established Persian tradition of wall-painting, the survival rate and state of preservation of miniatures is better, and miniatures are much the best-known form of Persian painting in the West, and many of the most important examples are in Western, or Turkish, museums.  Miniature painting became a significant [[genre]] in [[Persian art]] in the 13th century, receiving Chinese influence after the [[Mongol conquests]], and the highest point in the tradition was reached in the 15th and 16th centuries. The tradition continued, under some Western influence, after this, and has many modern exponents.  The Persian miniature was the dominant influence on other Islamic miniature traditions, principally the [[Ottoman miniature]] in Turkey, and the [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniature]] in the Indian sub-continent.

Persian art under Islam had never completely forbidden the human figure, and in the miniature tradition the depiction of figures, often in large numbers, is central.  This was partly because the miniature is a private form, kept in a book or album and only shown to those the owner chooses. It was therefore possible to be more free than in wall paintings or other works seen by a wider audience. The [[Qur'an]] and other purely religious works are not known to have been illustrated in this way, though histories and other works of literature may include religiously related scenes, including those [[Depictions of Muhammad|depicting the Prophet Muhammed]], after 1500 usually without showing his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, throughout; see Welch, 95-97 for one of the most famous examples, illustrated below&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the figurative scenes in miniatures, which this article concentrates on, there was a parallel style of non-figurative ornamental decoration which was found in borders and panels in miniature pages, and spaces at the start or end of a work or section, and often in whole pages acting as frontispieces.  In Islamic art this is referred to as "illumination", and manuscripts of the Qur'an and other religious books often included considerable number of illuminated pages.&lt;ref&gt;In the terminology of Western [[illuminated manuscript]]s, "illumination" usually covers both narrative scenes and decorative elements.&lt;/ref&gt;  The designs reflected contemporary work in other media, in later periods being especially close to book-covers and [[Persian carpet]]s, and it is thought that many carpet designs were created by court artists and sent to the workshops in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In later periods miniatures were increasingly created as single works to be included in albums called [[muraqqa]], rather than illustrated books.  This allowed non-royal collectors to afford a representative sample of works from different styles and periods.

==Style==
[[File:Хафт ауранг Джами 1556-65 Фрир.jpg|thumb|left|Camp scene from late in the classic period, with no frame.  [[Layla and Majnun|Majnun]] (at top wearing orange) spies on his beloved Layla (standing in tent doorway)]]
The bright and pure colouring of the Persian miniature is one of its most striking features.  Normally all the [[pigment]]s used are mineral-based ones which keep their bright colours very well if kept in proper conditions, the main exception being silver, mostly used to depict water, which will oxidize to a rough-edged black over time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;  The conventions of Persian miniatures changed slowly; faces are normally youthful and seen in three-quarters view, with a plump rounded lower face better suited to portraying typical Central Asian or Chinese features than those of most Persians. Lighting is even, without shadows or [[chiaroscuro]].  Walls and other surfaces are shown either frontally, or as at (to modern eyes) an angle of about 45 degrees, often giving the modern viewer the unintended impression that a building is (say) hexagonal in plan.  Buildings are often shown in complex views, mixing interior views through windows or "cutaways" with exterior views of other parts of a facade.  Costumes and architecture are always those of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-28; Welch, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Many figures are often depicted, with those in the main scene normally rendered at the same size, and recession (depth in the picture space) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space.  More important figures may be somewhat larger than those around them, and battle scenes can be very crowded indeed. Great attention is paid to the background, whether of a landscape or buildings, and the detail and freshness with which plants and animals, the fabrics of tents, hangings or carpets, or tile patterns are shown is one of the great attractions of the form.  The dress of figures is equally shown with great care, although artists understandably often avoid depicting the patterned cloth that many would have worn.  Animals, especially the horses that very often appear, are mostly shown sideways on; even the love-stories that constitute much of the classic material illustrated are conducted largely in the saddle, as far as the prince-protagonist is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 25-26, 44-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscapes are very often mountainous (the plains that make up much of Persia are rarely attempted), this being indicated by a high undulating horizon, and outcrops of bare rock which, like the clouds in the normally small area of sky left above the landscape, are depicted in conventions derived from Chinese art.  Even when a scene in a palace is shown, the viewpoint often appears to be from a point some metres in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 25-26, 48-49, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest miniatures appeared unframed horizontally across the page in the middle of text, following Byzantine and Arabic precedents, but in the 14th century the vertical format was introduced, perhaps influenced by Chinese scroll-paintings.  This is used in all the luxury manuscripts for the court that constitute the most famous Persian manuscripts, and the vertical format dictates many characteristics of the style.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Saki - Reza Abbasi - Moraqqa’-e Golshan 1609 Golestan Palace.jpg|thumb|''Saki'', album miniature by [[Reza Abbasi]], 1609]]

The miniatures normally occupy a full page, later sometimes spreading across two pages to regain a square or horizontal "landscape" format. There are often panels of text or captions inside the picture area, which is enclosed in a frame, eventually  of several ruled lines with a broader band of gold or colour.  The rest of the page is often decorated with dense designs of plants and animals in a muted ''[[grisaille]]'', often gold and brown; text pages without miniatures often also have such borders.  In later manuscripts, elements of the miniature begin to expand beyond the frame, which may disappear on one side of the image, or be omitted completely.&lt;ref&gt;OAO (3, ii and elsewhere)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another later development was the album miniature, conceived as a single picture rather than a book illustration, though such images may be accompanied by short lyric poems. The withdrawal of Shah [[Tahmasp I]] from commissioning illustrated books in the 1540s probably encouraged artists to transfer to these cheaper works for a wider circle of patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;  Albums or ''[[muraqqa]]s'' were assembled by collectors with album miniatures, specimen pages of calligraphy, and miniatures taken from older books, to which border paintings were often added when they were remounted.  Album miniatures usually showed a few figures on a larger scale, with less attention to the background, and tended to become drawings with some tints of coloured wash, rather than fully painted.

In the example at right the clothes are fully painted, and the background uses the gold grisaille style earlier reserved for marginal decoration, as in the miniature at the head of the article.  Many were individual portraits, either of notable figures (but initially rarely portraits of rulers), or of idealized beautiful youths. Others were scenes of lovers in a garden or picnics.  From about the middle of the 16th century these types of images became dominant, but they gradually declined in quality and originality and tended towards conventional prettiness and sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;OAO, Sims; Gray (1930), 74-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Books were sometimes refurbished and added to after an interval of many years, adding or partly repainting miniatures, changing the border decoration, and making other changes, not all improvements.&lt;ref&gt;OAO&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Conference of the Birds'' miniature in the gallery below is an addition of 1600 to a manuscript of over a century earlier, and elements of the style appear to represent an effort to match the earlier miniatures in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/63.210.11 Metropolitan Museum of Art] "The Conference of the Birds": Page from a manuscript of the Mantiq al-Tayr (The Language of the Birds) of Farid al-Din cAttar, [[Isfahan]] (63.210.11). In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2000–.&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous painting ''Princes of the House of Timur'' was first painted in 1550-55 in Persia for the exiled Mughal prince [[Humayun]], who largely began the Mughal miniature tradition by taking back Persian miniaturists when he gained the throne.  It was then twice updated in India (c.1605 and 1628) to show later generations of the royal house.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jarilwala, 50-51; [http://www.artfund.org/artwork/4691/princes-of-the-house-of-timur Art Fund] with image.  The painting uses miniature techniques on cotton, and is much larger than most miniatures.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dimensions of the manuscripts covered a range not dissimilar to typical modern books, though with a more vertical ratio; many were as small as a modern paperback, others larger.

[[File:Mir Sayyid Ali 2.jpg|thumb|left|Complex palace scene, 1539–1543, [[Mir Sayyid Ali]]]] 
In the classic period artists were exclusively male, and normally grouped in workshops, of which the royal workshop (not necessarily in a single building) was much the most prestigious, recruiting talented artists from the [[bazaar]] workshops in the major cities. However the nature of the royal workshop remains unclear, as some manuscripts are recorded as being worked on in different cities, rulers often took artists with them on their travels, and at least some artists were able to work on private commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Roxburgh (2000), 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;  As in Europe, sons very often followed their father into the workshop, but boys showing talent from any background might be recruited; at least one notable painter was born a slave. There were some highly placed amateur artists, including [[Shah Tahmasp I]] (reigned 1524–1576), who was also one of the greatest patrons of miniatures.  Persian artists were highly sought after by other Islamic courts, especially those of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mughal Empire]]s, whose own traditions of miniature were based on Persian painting but developed rather different styles.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was often divided between the main painter, who drew the outlines, and less senior painters who coloured in the drawing.  In [[Mughal miniature]]s at least, a third artist might do just the faces.  Then there might be the border paintings; in most books using them these are by far the largest area of painted material as they occur on text pages as well.  The miniatures in a book were often divided up between different artists, so that the best manuscripts represent an overview of the finest work of the period.  The scribes or [[Calligraphy|calligraphers]] were normally different people, on the whole regarded as having a rather higher status than the artists - their names are more likely to be noted in the manuscript.

Royal librarians probably played a significant role in managing the commissions; the extent of direct involvement by the ruler himself is normally unclear.  The scribes wrote the main text first, leaving spaces for the miniatures, presumably having made a plan for these with the artist and the librarian.  The book covers were also richly decorated for luxury manuscripts, and when they too have figurative scenes these presumably used drawings by the same artists who created the miniatures.  Paper was the normal material for the pages, unlike the [[vellum]] normally used in Europe for as long as the illuminated manuscript tradition lasted.  The paper was highly polished, and when not given painted borders might be flecked with gold leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-26; Welch, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique survival from the Timurid period, found "pasted inconspicuously" in a muraqqa in the [[Topkapi Palace]] is thought to be a report to Baysunghur from his librarian. After a brief and high-flown introduction, "Petition from the most humble servants of the royal library, whose eyes are as expectant of the dust from the hooves of the regal steed as the ears of those who fast are for the cry of ''[[Allahu akbar]]'' ..." it continues with very businesslike and detailed notes on what each of some twenty-five named artists, scribes and craftsmen has been up to over a period of perhaps a week: "Amir Khalil has finished the waves in two sea-scenes of the ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' and will begin to apply colour. ... All the painters are working on painting and tinting seventy-five tent-poles .... Mawlana Ali is designing a frontispiece illumination for the ''Shahnama''. His eyes were sore for a few days."&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from book arts, designs for tent-makers, tile-makers, woodwork and a saddle are mentioned, as is the progress of the "[[begum|begim]]'s little chest".&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, 43-44; a good number of those named are mentioned in other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Muhammad during the Mi'raj - from Jami al-Tawarikh.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mi'raj]] (also called the "Night Ride") of Muhammed on [[Buraq]], Tabriz, 1307; Ilkhanid, with both Christian and Chinese influences, and horizontal format.]]
[[File:Demotte Shahname 002.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from the [[Demotte Shahnameh|Demotte or "Great Mongol ''Shahnameh''"]], a key Ilkhanid work, 1330s?]]

The ancient Persian religion of [[Manichaeism]] made considerable use of images; not only was the founding prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (c.216–276) a professional artist, at least according to later Islamic tradition, but one of the sacred books of the religion, the [[Arzhang]], was illustrated by the prophet himself, whose illustrations (probably essentially cosmological diagrams rather than images with figures) were regarded as part of the sacred material and always copied with the text.  Unfortunately, the Islamic suppression of the religion was so thorough that only tiny fragments of Manichean art survive.  These no doubt influenced the continuing Persian tradition, but little can be said about how.  It is also known that [[Sassanid]] palaces had wall-paintings, but only fragments of these have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

There are narrative scenes in pottery, though it is hard to judge how these relate to lost contemporary book painting.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was also a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great period of the Persian miniature began when Persia was ruled by a succession of foreign dynasties, who came from the east and north. The traumatic [[Mongol conquests|Mongol invasion]] of [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|1219]] onwards established the [[Ilkhanate]] as a branch of the [[Mongol Empire]], and despite the huge destruction of life and property, the new court had a galvanising effect on book painting, importing many Chinese works and probably artists, with their long-established tradition of narrative painting. The Ilkhanids continued to migrate between summer and winter quarters, which together with other travels for war, hunting and administration, made the portable form of the illustrated book the most suitable vehicle for painting, as it also was for mobile European medieval rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Great Mongol Shahnameh]], now dispersed, is the outstanding manuscript of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1335 the Ilkhanate split into several warring dynasties, all swept aside by the new invasion of [[Timur]] from 1381. He established the [[Timurid dynasty]], bringing a fresh wave of Chinese influence, who were replaced by the [[Black Sheep Turkmen]] in 1452, followed by the [[White Sheep Turkmen]] from 1468, who were in turn replaced by the [[Safavid dynasty]] by 1501; they ruled until 1722.  After a chaotic period [[Nader Shah]] took control, but there was no long-lived dynasty until the [[Qajar dynasty]], who ruled from 1794 to 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1976), 309-315, OAO; Rawson, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baysunghur's Shahname 001.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Baysonghor Shahnameh]], 1430. He was a key patron of the [[Herat]] school]]

It was only in the 14th century that the practice began of commissioning illustrated copies of classic works of [[Persian poetry]], above all the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]] (940-1020) and the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', which were to contain many of the finest miniatures.  Previously book illustration, of works in both Arabic and Persian, had been concentrated in practical and scientific treatises, often following at several removes the Byzantine miniatures copied when ancient Greek books were translated.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1976), 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;  However a 14th-century flowering of Arabic illustrated literary manuscripts in Syria and Egypt collapsed at the end of the century, leaving Persia the undisputed leader in Islamic book illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the best miniatures from early manuscripts were removed from their books in later centuries and transferred to albums, several of which are now in [[Istanbul]]; this complicates tracing the art history of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Simms&lt;/ref&gt;

Miniatures from the Safavid and later periods are far more common than earlier ones, but although some prefer the simpler elegance of the early 15th and 16th centuries, most art historians agree in seeing a rise in quality up to the mid-16th century, culminating in a series of superb royal commissions by the Safavid court, such as the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]] (or Houghton Shahnameh). There was a crisis in the 1540s when Shah [[Tahmasp I]], previously a patron on a large scale, ceased to commission works, apparently losing interest in painting.  Some of his artists went to the court of his nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]], governor of [[Mashad]] from 1556, where there was a brief flowering of painting until the Shah fell out with his nephew in 1565, including a ''[[Haft Awrang]]'', the "Freer Jami".  Other artists went to the Mughal court.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 103; Welch (mostly on Freer Jami after p. 24), 23-27, 31, 98-127; [http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/loveYearning/base.html Freer Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;  After this the number of illustrated book manuscript commissions falls off, and the tradition falls into over-sophistication and decline.&lt;ref&gt;OAO; Gray (1930), 74-89; Welch, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tabriz]] in the north-west of Iran is the longest established centre of production, and [[Baghdad]] (then under Persian rule) was often important. [[Shiraz]] in the south, sometimes the capital of a sub-ruler, was a centre from the late 14th century, and [[Herat]], now in [[Afghanistan]], was important in the periods when it was controlled from Persia, especially when the Timurid prince [[Baysonqor]] was governor in the 1420s; he was then the leading patron in Persia, commissioning the [[Baysonghor Shahnameh]] and other works.  Each centre developed its own style, which were largely reconciled and combined under the Safavids.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 37-55; Welch, 14-18; OAO&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools of Herat, where the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] royal workshops usually were, had developed a style of classical restraint and elegance, and the painters of Tabriz, a more expressive and imaginative style.  Tabriz was the former capital of the Turkmen rulers, and in the early [[Safavid]] period the styles were gradually harmonized in works like the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]].&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 80; Walther &amp; Wolf, 420-424&lt;/ref&gt;  But a famous unfinished miniature showing [[Rustam]] asleep, while his horse [[Rakhsh]] fights off a lion, was probably made for this manuscript, but was never finished and bound in, perhaps because its vigorous Tabriz style did not please Tahmasp. It appears to be by Sultan Mohammad, whose later works in the manuscript show a style adapted to the court style of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Bizhad]].  It is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese influences==
[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|[[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]] of the Prophet by Sultan Muhammad, showing  Chinese-influenced clouds and angels, 1539-43.&lt;ref&gt;see Welch, 95-97&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Before Chinese influence was introduced, figures were tied to the ground line and included "backgrounds of solid color", or in "clear accordance with indigenous artistic traditions". However, once influenced by the Chinese, Persian painters gained much more freedom through the Chinese traditions of "unrestricted space and infinite planes". Much of the Chinese influence in Persian art is probably indirect, transmitted through Central Asia. There appear to be no Persian miniatures that are clearly the work of a Chinese artist or one trained in China itself. The most prestigious Chinese painting tradition, of ''literati'' [[landscape painting]] on scrolls, has little influence; instead the closest parallels are with wall-paintings and motifs such as clouds and dragons found in Chinese pottery, textiles, and other decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The format and composition of the Persian miniature received strong influence from Chinese paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz and Desai, 172; Meri, 585&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ilkhanid rulers did not convert to Islam for several decades, meanwhile remaining [[Tantric Buddhist]]s or Christians (usually [[Nestorian Christian|Nestorian]]s).  While very few traces now remain, Buddhist and Christian images were probably easily available to Persian artists at this period.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in Ilkhanid and Timurid [[Mongol]]-[[Persian people|Persian]] mythological miniatures,  mythical beasts were portrayed in a style close to the Chinese [[qilin]], [[fenghuang]] ([[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]), [[bixie]] and [[Chinese dragon]], though they have a much more aggressive character in Islamic art, and are often seen fighting each other or natural beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 169-173&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent Persian miniaturists ==
The workshop tradition and division of labour within both an individual miniature and a book, as described above, complicates the attribution of paintings.  Some are inscribed with the name of the artist, sometimes as part of the picture itself, for example as if painted on tiles in a building, but more often as a note added on the page or elsewhere; where and when being often uncertain.  Because of the nature of the works, literary and historical references to artists, even if they are relied upon, usually do not enable specific paintings to be identified, though there are exceptions.  The reputation of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād Herawī]], or Behzād, the leading miniaturist of the late Timurid era, and founder of the Safavid school, remained supreme in the [[Persianate]] world, and at least some of his work, and style, can be identified with a degree of confidence, despite a good deal of continuing scholarly debate.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 57-66; OAO&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sultan Mohammed]], [[Mir Sayyid Ali]], and [[Aqa Mirak]], were leading painters of the next generation, the Safavid culmination of the classic style, whose attributed works are found together in several manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 17-27, and many individual pictures shown&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abd al-Samad]] was one of the most successful Persian painters recruited by the [[Mughal Emperor]]s to work in India.  In the next generation, [[Reza Abbasi]] worked in the Late Safavid period producing mostly album miniatures, and his style was continued by many later painters.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the miniatures of Abu'l-Hasan Khan Gaffari ([[Sani ol molk]]), active in [[Qajar]] Persia, showed originality, naturalism, and technical perfection.&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Robinson, “[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abul-hasan-khan-gaffari-sani-al-molk-1814-66-painter-in-oils-and-miniature-lacquer-artist-and-book-illustrator Abu'l-Hasan Khan Gaffari],” Encyclopædia Iranica, I/3, pp. 306-308&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mahmoud Farshchian]] is a contemporary miniaturist whose style has broadened the scope of this art.

'''Pharmacometabolomics''', also known as '''pharmacometabonomics''', is a field which stems from [[metabolomics]], the quantification and analysis of [[metabolites]] produced by the body.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; It refers to the direct measurement of [[metabolites]] in an individual’s bodily fluids, in order to predict or evaluate the [[metabolism]] of [[pharmaceutical]] compounds, and to better understand the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; Alternatively, pharmacometabolomics can be applied to measure [[metabolite]] levels following the administration of a [[pharmaceutical]] compound, in order to monitor the effects of the compound on certain metabolic pathways(pharmacodynamics). This provides detailed mapping of drug effects on metabolism and the pathways that are implicated in mechanism of variation of response to treatment.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt; In addition, the metabolic profile of an individual at baseline (metabotype) provides information about how individuals respond to treatment and highlights heterogeneity within a disease state.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011 /&gt; All three approaches require the quantification of [[metabolites]] found in [[bodily fluids]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], such as blood or urine, and can be used in the assessment of [[pharmaceutical]] treatment options for numerous [[disease]] states.

==Goals of Pharmacometabolomics==
Pharmacometabolomics is thought to provide information that complements that gained from other [[omics]], namely [[genomics]], [[transcriptomics]], and [[proteomics]].  Looking at the characteristics of an individual down through these different levels of detail, there is an increasingly more accurate prediction of a person’s ability to respond to a [[pharmaceutical]] compound. The [[genome]], made up of 25 000 [[genes]], can indicate possible errors in drug [[metabolism]]; the [[transcriptome]], made up of 85,000 transcripts, can provide information about which genes important in [[metabolism]] are being actively transcribed; and the [[proteome]], &gt;10,000,000 members, depicts which [[proteins]] are active in the body to carry out these functions. Pharmacometabolomics complements the [[omics]] with direct measurement of the products of all of these reactions, but with perhaps a relatively smaller number of members: that was initially projected to be approximately 2200 [[metabolites]],&lt;ref name =Weiss-2012 /&gt; but could be a larger number when gut derived metabolites and xenobiotics are added to the list. Overall, the goal of pharmacometabolomics is to more closely predict or assess the response of an individual to a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] compound, permitting continued treatment with the right drug or dosage depending on the variations in their [[metabolism]] and ability to respond to treatment.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009 /&gt;

Pharmacometabolomic analyses, through the use of a [[metabolomics]] approach, can provide a comprehensive and detailed metabolic profile or “[[metabolome|metabolic fingerprint]]” for an individual patient. Such [[metabolome|metabolic profiles]] can provide a complete overview of individual [[metabolite]] or pathway alterations, providing a more realistic depiction of [[disease]] [[phenotypes]]. This approach can then be applied to the prediction of response to a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] compound by patients with a particular metabolic profile.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009/&gt;  Pharmacometabolomic analyses of drug response are often coupled or followed up with [[pharmacogenetics]] studies. [[Pharmacogenetics]] focuses on the identification of [[genetic variations]] (e.g. [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]]) within patients that may contribute to altered drug responses and overall outcome of a certain treatment. The results of pharmacometabolomics analyses can act to “inform” or “direct” [[pharmacogenetic]] analyses by correlating aberrant [[metabolite]] concentrations or metabolic pathways to potential alterations at the [[genetics|genetic]] level.&lt;ref name=abo-2012 /&gt; This concept has been established with two seminal publications from studies of antidepressants  serotonin reuptake inhibitors &lt;ref name=abo-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011 /&gt; where metabolic signatures were able to define pathway implicated in response to the antidepressant and that lead to identification of genetic variants within a key gene within highlighted pathway as being implicated in variation in response. These genetic variants were not identified through genetic analysis alone and hence illustrated how metabolomics can guide and inform genetic data.

==History==
Although the applications of pharmacometabolomics to [[personalized medicine]] are largely only being realized now, the study of an individual’s [[metabolism]] has been used to treat disease since the Middle Ages. Early physicians employed a primitive form of metabolomic analysis by smelling, tasting and looking at urine to diagnose disease. Obviously the measurement techniques needed to look at specific [[metabolites]] were unavailable at that time, but such technologies have evolved dramatically over the last decade to develop precise, [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] devices, as well as the accompanying data analysis software to analyze output. Currently, sample purification processes, such as [[high-performance liquid chromatography|liquid]] or [[gas chromatography]], are coupled with either [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based or [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)]]-based analytical methods to characterize the [[metabolite]] profiles of individual patients.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; Continually advancing [[bioinformatics|informatics]] tools allow for the identification, quantification and classification of [[metabolites]] to determine which [[metabolic pathway|pathways]] may influence certain [[pharmaceutical]] interventions.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; One of the earliest studies discussing the principle and applications of pharmacometabolomics was conducted in an [[animal model]] to look at the [[metabolism]] of [[paracetamol]] and liver damage. [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR spectroscopy]] was used to analyze the urinary metabolic profiles of rats pre- and post-treatment with [[paracetamol]]. The analysis revealed a certain metabolic profile associated with increased liver damage following [[paracetamol]] treatment.&lt;ref name=clayton-2006/&gt;  At this point, it was eagerly anticipated that such pharmacometabolomics approaches could be applied to [[personalized medicine|personalized]] human [[medicine]]. Since this [[publication]] in 2006, the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network led by Duke University researchers and that included partnerships between centers of excellence in metabolomics, pharmacogenomics and informatics (over sixteen academic centers funded by NIGMS) has been able to illustrate for the first time the power of the pharmacometabolomics approach in informing about treatment outcomes in large clinical studies and with use of drugs that include antidepressants, statins, antihypertensives, antiplatelet therapies and antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan-depressionpaper1-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper4-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=zhu-depressionpaper5-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=krauss-statins2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=wikoff-atenolol2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis-aspirinreview2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper1-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=perroud-cnspaper2-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper4-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=patkar-cnspaper5-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=mannelli-cnspaper6-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=steffens-cnspaper7-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper8-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=condray-cnspaper9-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper10-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=han-cnspaper11-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper12-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper13-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper14-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Motsinger-cnspaper15-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=McEvoy-cnspaper16-2013/&gt; Totally new concepts emerged from these studies on use of pharmacometabolomics as a tool that can bring a paradigm shift in the field of pharmacology. It illustrated how pharmacometabolomics can enable a Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology approach.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; 
Pharmacometabolomics has been applied for the treatment of numerous human diseases, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[diabetes]], [[neural disease]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

== Personalized Medicine==
As [[metabolite]] analyses are being conducted at the individual patient level, pharmacometabolomics may be considered a form of [[personalized medicine]]. This field is currently being employed in a predictive manner to determine the potential responses of therapeutic compounds in individual patients, allowing for more customized treatment regimens. It is anticipated that such pharmacometabolomics approaches will lead to the improved ability to predict an individual’s response to a compound, the efficacy and metabolism of it as well as adverse or off-target effects that may take place in the body. The metabolism of certain drugs varies from patient to patient as the [[copy number variations|copy number]] of the [[genes]] which code for common [[Cytochrome P450|drug metabolizing]] [[enzymes]] varies within the population, and leads to differences in the ability of an individual to metabolize different compounds.&lt;ref name=motulsky-1957/&gt; Other important personal factors contributing to an individual’s metabolic profile, such as patient nutritional status, commensal [[bacteria]], age, and pre-existing medical conditions, are also reflected in [[metabolite]] assessment.,&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=clayton-2006/&gt; Overall, pharmacometabolomic analyses combined with such approaches as [[pharmacogenetics]], can function to identify the [[metabolic]] processes and particular [[gene]]tic alterations that may compromise the anticipated efficacy of a drug in a particular patient. The results of such analyses can then allow for the modification of treatment regimens to optimize treatment outcome.&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt;

==Current Applications==

===Predicting treatment outcome===

====Metabotype informs about treatment outcomes====
Pharmacometabolomics may be used in a predictive manner to determine the correct course of action in regards to a patient about to undergo some type of drug treatment. This involves determining the metabolic profile of a patient prior to treatment, and correlating metabolic signatures with the outcome of a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] treatment course. Analysis of a patient’s metabolic profile can reveal factors that may contribute to altered drug [[metabolism]], allowing for predictions of the overall efficacy of a proposed treatment, as well as potential [[adverse drug reaction|drug toxicity]] risks that may differ from the general population.  This approach has been used to identify novel or previously characterized metabolic [[biomarkers]] in patients, which can be used to predict the expected outcome of that patient following treatment with a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical compound]].&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt; One example of the clinical application of pharmacometabolomics are studies that looked to identify a predictive metabolic marker for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder|major depressive disorder (MDD)]].,&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan-depressionpaper1-2010/&gt; In a study with antidepressant Sertraline, the Pharmacometabolomics Network illustrated that metabolic profile at baseline of patients with major depression can inform about treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt; In addition the study illustrated the power of metabolomics for defining response to placebo and compared response to placebo to response to sertraline and showed that several pathways were common to both.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt; In another study with escitalopram citalopram, [[metabolomic]] analysis of [[blood plasma|plasma]] from patients with [[major depressive disorder|MDD]] revealed that variations in [[glycine]] metabolism were negatively associated with patient outcome upon treatment with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)]], an important drug class involved in the treatment of this disease.&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;

===Monitoring drug-related alterations in metabolic pathways===
The second major application of pharmacometabolomics is the analysis of a patient’s metabolic profile following the administration of a specific therapy. This process is often secondary to a pre-treatment metabolic analysis, allowing for the comparison of pre- and post-treatment [[metabolite]]  concentrations. This allows for the identification of the metabolic processes and pathways that are being altered by the treatment either intentionally as a designated [[drug design|target]] of the compound, or unintentionally as a [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]. Furthermore, the concentration and variety of [[metabolites]] produced from the compound itself can also be identified, providing information on the rate of [[metabolism]] and potentially leading to development of a related compound with increased efficacy or decreased [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]]. An example of this approach was used to investigate the effect of several [[antipsychotic]] drugs on [[lipid metabolism]] in patients treated for [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt; It was hypothesized that these [[antipsychotic]] drugs may be altering [[lipid metabolism]] in treated patients with [[schizophrenia]], contributing to the weight gain and [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. The study monitored [[lipid]] metabolites in patients both before and after treatment with [[antipsychotics]]. The compiled pre- and post-treatment profiles were then be compared to examine the effect of these compounds on [[lipid]] [[metabolism]]. The researchers found correlations between treatment with [[antipsychotic]] drugs and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]], in both a lipid-class-specific and drug-specific manner,&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt; establishing new foundations around the concept that pharmacometabolomics provides powerful tools for enabling detailed mapping of drug effects. Additional studies by the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network enabled mapping in ways not possible before effects of statins,&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=krauss-statins2013/&gt;  atenolol &lt;ref name=wikoff-atenolol2013/&gt; and aspirin.&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis-aspirinreview2013/&gt; Totally new insights were gained about effect of these drugs on metabolism and they highlighted pathways implicated in response and side effects.

==Metabolite Quantification and Analysis==
In order to identify and quantify metabolites produced by the body, various detection methods have been employed. Most often, these involve the use of [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] or [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]], providing universal detection, identification and quantification of metabolites in individual patient samples. Although both processes are used in pharmacometabolomic analyses, there are advantages and disadvantages for using either [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]]- or [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based platforms in this application.

===Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy===
{{Main|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy}}
[[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] has been utilized for the analysis of biological samples since the 1980s, and can be used as an effective technique for the identification and quantification of both known and unknown metabolites. For details on the principles of this technique, see [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]]. In pharmacometabolomics analyses, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] is advantageous because minimal sample preparation is required. Isolated patient samples typically include blood or urine due to their minimally-invasive acquisition, however, other fluid types and solid tissue samples have also been studied with this approach.&lt;ref name=zhang2010/&gt; Due to the minimal preparation of samples before analysis, samples can be completely recovered following [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. This permits samples to be repeatedly processed with extremely high levels of reproducibility, as well as maintaining precious patient samples for alternative analysis. The high reproducibility and precision of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]], coupled with relatively fast processing time (greater than 100 samples per day), makes this process a relatively high-throughput form of sample analysis. One disadvantage of this technique is the relatively poor metabolite detection sensitivity compared to MS-based analysis, leading to a requirement for greater initial sample volume.&lt;ref name=zhang2010/&gt; Furthermore, the initial instrument costs are extremely high, for both [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and MS equipment.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

===Mass Spectrometry===
{{Main|Mass Spectrometry}}
An alternative approach to the identification and quantification of patient samples is through the use of mass spectrometry. This approach offers excellent precision and sensitivity in the identification, characterization and quantification of metabolites in multiple patient sample types, such as blood and urine. The [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] approach is typically coupled to [[gas chromatography|gas chromatography (GC)]], in [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]]  or [[Chromatography#Liquid chromatography|liquid chromatography (LC)]], in [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]], which aid in initially separating out the metabolite components within complex sample mixtures, and can allow for the isolation of particular metabolite subsets for analysis. [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] can provide relatively precise quantification of metabolites, as well as chemical structural information that can be compared to pre-existing chemical libraries.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] can be conducted in a relatively high-throughput manner (greater than 100 samples per day) with greater detection sensitivity than [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. A limitation of [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] for this application, however, is that processed metabolite components must be readily volatized for sample processing.

[[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] initially separates out the components of a sample mixture based on properties such as hydrophobicity, before processing them for identification and quantification by [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]. Overall, [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] is an extremely flexible method for processing most compound types in a somewhat high-throughput manner (20-100 samples a day), also with greater sensitivity than [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. For both [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] and [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] there are limitations in the reproducibility of metabolite quantification.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008 /&gt; Furthermore, sample processing for downstream [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] analysis is much more intensive than in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] application, and results in the destruction of the original sample (via [[trypsin]] digestion).&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

Following identification and quantification of metabolites in individual patient samples, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] output is compiled into a dataset. These datasets include information on the identity and levels of individual metabolites detected within processed samples, as well as characteristics of each metabolite during the detection process (e.g. mass-to-charge ratios for [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based analysis). Multiple datasets can be created and compiled into large databases for individual patients in order to monitor varying metabolic profiles over a treatment course (i.e. pre- and post-treatment profiles). Each database is then processed through a type of informatics platform with software designed to characterize and analyze the data to generate an overall metabolic profile for the patient. To generate this overall profile, computational programs are designed to:
* identify metabolic disease signatures&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* assess treatment class (pre- or post-treatment)&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* identify compounds present in a patient sample that may alter drug response, or be caused by a therapy&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* identify metabolite variables and interactions among these variables&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* map identified variables to known metabolic and biochemical pathways&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

==Limitations==
Along with the emerging diagnostic capabilities of pharmacometabolomics, there are limitations introduced when individual variability is looked at. The ability to determine an individual’s physiological state by measurement of metabolites is not contested, but the extreme variability that can be introduced by age, nutrition, and [[commensalism|commensal organisms]] suggest problems in creating generalized pharmacometabolomes for patient groups.&lt;ref name=adamo2010/&gt; However, as long as meaningful metabolic signatures can be elucidated to create baseline values, there still exists a possible means of comparison.&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009/&gt;

Issues surrounding the measurement of metabolites in an individual can also arise from the methodology of metabolite detection, and there are arguments both for and against [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]. Other limitations surrounding metabolite analysis include the need for proper handling and processing of samples, as well as proper maintenance and calibration of the analytical and computational equipment. These tasks require skilled and experienced technicians, and potential instrument repair costs due to continuous sample processing can be costly. The cost of the processing and analytical platforms alone is very high, making it difficult for many facilities to afford pharmacometabolomics-based treatment analyses.

==Implications for Health Care==
{{Main|Personalized medicine}}
Pharmacometabolomics may decrease the burden on the healthcare system by better gauging the correct choice of treatment drug and dosage in order to optimize the response of a patient to a treatment. Hopefully, this approach will also ultimately limit the number of [[adverse drug reactions|adverse drug reactions (ADRs)]] associated with many treatment regimens.&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt; Overall, physicians would be better able to apply more personalized, and potentially more effective, treatments to their patients. It is important to consider, however, that the processing and analysis of the patient samples takes time, resulting in delayed treatment. 
Another concern about the application of pharmacometabolomics analyses to individual patient care, is deciding who should and who should not receive this in-depth, personalized treatment protocol. Certain diseases and stages of disease would have to be classified according to their requirement of such a treatment plan, but there are no criteria for this classification. Furthermore, not all hospitals and treatment institutes can afford the equipment to process and analyze patient samples on site, but sending out samples takes time and ultimately delays treatment. 
Health insurance coverage of such procedures may also be an issue. Certain insurance companies may discriminate against the application of this type of sample analysis and metabolite characterization. Furthermore, there would have to be regulations put in place to ensure that there was no discrimination by insurance companies against the metabolic profiles of individual patients (“high metabolizers” vs. risky “low metabolizers”).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2977">'''Phenomics''' is an area of [[biology]] concerned with the measurement of [[phenome]]s (a [[phenome]] is the set of physical and biochemical traits belonging to a given organism) as they change in response to genetic mutation and environmental influences.&lt;ref name="HouleGovindaraju2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Houle |first1=David |last2=Govindaraju |first2=Diddahally R. |last3=Omholt |first3=Stig |title=Phenomics: the next challenge |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=11 |issue=12 |year=2010 |pages=855–866 |doi=10.1038/nrg2897 |pmid=21085204}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[functional genomics]], [[pharmaceutical research]], [[metabolic engineering]] and increasingly in [[phylogenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=O'Leary | first1=M.

An important field of research today is trying to improve, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the capacity to measure phenomes. This includes developing high-throughput measurement systems.

For example, the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility, an initiative of the Australian government, has developed a number of new instruments for comprehensive and fast measurements of phenotypes in both the lab and the field.

'''Physical education,''' also known as '''Phys Ed.''', '''PE''', '''gym''', or '''gym class''', and known in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries as '''physical training''' or '''PT''',&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2459735/Physical-training-in-schools-should-be-compulsory-says-leading-head.html ''The Daily Telegraph'', 25 July 2008: "Physical training in schools should be compulsory, says leading head"] Linked 2014-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[educational course]] related of maintaining the human body through physical exercises (i.e. [[calisthenics]]) (citation needed). It is taken during primary and [[secondary education]] and encourages [[psychomotor learning]] in a [[play (activity)|play]] or movement exploration setting to promote health.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D. (1989). ''The Discipline and the Profession.'' Foundations of Canadian Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports Studies. Dubuque, IA: Wm. C. Brown Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
In [[Singapore]], pupils from primary school through junior colleges are required to have two hours of PE every week, except during examination periods. Pupils may play games like [[soccer|football]], [[badminton]], [[captain ball]], and [[basketball]] during most sessions. Unorthodox sports such as [[fencing]], and [[skateboarding]] are occasionally played. In more prestigious secondary schools and in junior colleges, sports such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[marksmanship|shooting]], and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are played. (This paragraph needs to be cited. Where is this information from?)  

An Biennial compulsory fitness exam, NAPFA, is conducted in every school to assess pupils' physical fitness in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/napfa-fitness-test-education-tool|title=Napfa: From fitness test to education tool|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a series of fitness tests (pull-ups/inclined pull-ups for girls, standing broad jump, sit-ups, sit-and-reach and 1.6&amp;nbsp;km for primary [10- to 12-year-olds]/2.4&amp;nbsp;km for secondary and junior college levels [13- to 18-year-olds]). Students are graded by gold, silver, or bronze, or as fail. NAPFA for pre-enlistees serves as an indicator for an additional two months in the country's compulsory national service if they attain bronze or fail.

In [[Malaysia]], pupils from primary schools to secondary schools are expected to do two periods or one hour of PE throughout the year except a week before [[Test (assessment)|examinations]]. In most [[secondary schools]], games like badminton, [[sepak takraw]], [[association football|football]], [[netball]], basketball and tennis are available. Pupils may bring their own sports equipment to the school with the authorization of the teacher. (Again, citation needed for this paragraph. Where is this information from?) 

In the [[Philippines]], PE is mandatory for all years, unless the school gives the option for a student to do the [[Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme]] instead for fifth and sixth year.

[[File:SMATrinitasORBenteng.JPG|thumb|Indonesian high school students playing the traditional game "Benteng"]]
In [[Indonesia]], students ranging from [[kindergarten]] to [[high school]] have PE integrated with their curriculum. Kindergarten through grade 3 students have [[gymnastics]]. Starting from Grade 4, students are introduced to traditional martial arts [[Pencak Silat]] and some team games such as badminton, football, futsal, rounders, and basketball. Starting from [[junior high school]], games such as basketball, volleyball, cricket, tennis, badminton, kho kho, and kabaddi are played. Drills and physical training are taught.

In Bhutan, the inclusion of Health and Physical Education in the school curriculum was formally endorsed during the 7th CAPSD Board Meeting in 1997. A series of pilot tests were conducted in primary schools from 1998 to 1999. Since the pilot tests were very successful, HPE was introduced as a formal teaching subject in all the primary schools from the year 2000.

In 2007, a set of revised curriculum books, consisting of a curriculum framework and eight activity books, were developed for use from 2009 academic session.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], physical education was first made an important part of the curriculum in government primary and secondary schools in 1981. The policy was outlined in a Ministerial Statement to the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Minister for Educational Services, [[Norman Lacy]] MP on 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/MinisterialStatementOnNewDirectionsInPhysicalEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Ministerial Statement on New Directions in Physical Education |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the goal of physical education is to "develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shape America Home Page|url = http://www.shapeamerica.org|website = www.shapeamerica.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Hour is a before-school physical education class first implemented by [[Naperville Central High School]]. In the state of [[Illinois]] this program is known as Learning Readiness P.E. (LRPE). It was based on research indicating that [[student]]s who are physically fit are more [[academics|academically]] alert and experience growth in [[brain cell]]s or enhancement in [[brain]] development. NCHS pairs a PE class that incorporates [[cardiovascular exercise]], [[core strength]] training, cross lateral movements, and [[literacy]] and [[math]] strategies with literacy and math classes that utilize movement to enhance [[learning]] and improve achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Enhancing P.E. in Illinois, http://iphionline.org/pdf/P.E._Case_Study_Naperville.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In British Columbia, Canada, the government has stated in the grade one curriculum that students must participate in physical activity daily five times a week. The teacher is also responsible for planning Daily Physical Activity (DPA), which is thirty minutes of mild to moderate physical activity a day, not including curriculum physical education classes. The curriculum requires students in grade one to be knowledgeable about healthy living. For example, they must be able to describe benefits of regular exercise, identify healthy choices that require them to be more physically active, and describe the importance of choosing healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;BC curriculum package&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=June 2018}} &lt;!-- Not a strong source for this information. See actual curriculum documents for more reliable information regarding what students are learning.  --&gt;

Ontario, Canada has a similar procedure in place. On October 6, 2005 the Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) implemented a Daily Physical Activity policy in elementary schools, grades 1–8. It requires that all students in grades 1 to 8, including those with special needs, be provided with opportunities to participate in a minimum of twenty minutes of sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity each school day during instructional time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212025619/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf |date=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many factors that contribute to the ease of implementing and sustaining a quality program, including the involvement of the administration, parents, and community. However, it ultimately comes down to the willingness of the physical education teacher(s) to do their best no matter the situation &lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education https://www.supportrealteachers.org/the-importance-of-quality-physical-education.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiJncBRC1ARIsAOvG-a5DFCcyvtwvTO6TWrGWTlSx7w1mmTqLbz4jFcQRk2MNf73vNIItQS8aAvUSEALw_wcB&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], pupils from primary school can optionally join PE as an extra-curricular activity. From middle school to secondary school, pupils must participate in PE classes for two hours per week.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Scotland]] has is a government supported requirement of a minimum of two hours of quality PE in primary and two periods (50 minutes each) in secondary S1 to S4. Recent funding has ensured most local authorities have employed PE lead officers to support the requirement. In fifth and sixth year, PE is voluntary in that personalisation and choice must be considered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In [[Sweden]] it differs from municipality to municipality but generally, year 0 to 2 has 55 minutes PE a week. Year 3 to 6 has 110 minutes a week and year 7-9 has 220 minutes. In upper secondary school, all national programs have an obligatory course, Idrott och hälsa 1, containing 100 points of PE, which corresponds to 90-100 hours of PE during the course. (One point should be one hour, but due to holidays this isn't true.) The schools can spend these hours as they like during the three years students attend. Most schools put this course during the first year and offer the follow-up course, Idrott och hälsa 2, which also contains 100 points.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}


In Ireland, you are expected to do 2 Classes worth of P.E.(80 Minutes)This also includes Shower and Changing Times, so averagely 60-65 minutes outside.

==Trends==
{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Corta-Mato Escolar 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] children participating in a school race]]
Physical education [[fad|trends]] have developed recently{{when|date=March 2014}} to incorporate a greater variety of activities besides typical [[sports]]. Introducing students to activities like [[bowling]], [[walking]]/[[hiking]], or [[frisbee]] at an early age can help them develop good activity habits that will continue into adulthood. 

Some [[teacher]]s have begun to incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as [[yoga]], deep breathing and [[tai chi]]. Tai chi, an ancient martial arts form focused on slow meditative movements, is a relaxation activity with many benefits. Studies have shown that it enhances muscular strength and endurance, as well as cardiovascular endurance. It also provides psychological benefits such as improving general mental health, concentration, awareness and positive mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Chi for Mental Health {{!}} Psych Central News|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2010/05/24/tai-chi-for-mental-health/14015.html|website=Psych Central News|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taught to any age student with little or no equipment, making it ideal for mixed ability and age classes. Tai chi can easily be incorporated into a holistic learning body and mind unit.&lt;ref&gt;Lu C. (2007 {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

Teaching non-traditional sports may also provide motivation for students to increase their activity, and can help them learn about different cultures. For example, while learning about [[lacrosse]] in the Southwestern United States, students might also learn about the Native American cultures of the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada, where the sport originated. Teaching non-traditional (or non-native) sports provides an opportunity to integrate academic concepts from other subjects as well, which may now be required of many PE teachers.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

PE is very important to students' health and overall well-being. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stated that over the past three years{{when|date=June 2018}} obesity in children (ages 2–5) and adolescents (ages 12–19) has doubled because of diet and lack of activity. Since the 1970s the number of children who are obese has tripled.&lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education. (n.d.). Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://www.veanea.org/home/1000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jf;fhjk;sfdbkdfl'b.jpg|thumbnail]]

SHAPE America's National Standards &amp; Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education define what a student should know and be able to do as result of an effective physical education program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shapeamerica.org/standards/pe/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend is the incorporation of [[health]] and [[nutrition]] into the physical education curriculum. The [[Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004]] required that all school districts with a federally-funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Pangrazi, Robert (2007) "Dynamic Physical Education for Elementary School Children" 15th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching students sports and movement skills, PE teachers are now incorporating short health and nutrition lessons into the curriculum. This is more prevalent at the elementary school level, where students do not have a specific Health class. Recently most elementary schools have specific health classes for students as well as physical education class. Due to the recent outbreaks of diseases such as swine flu, school districts are making it mandatory for students to learn about practicing good hygiene along with other health topics.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Today many states require Physical Education teachers to be certified to teach Health courses.  Many colleges and universities offer both Physical Education and Health as one certification. This push towards health education is beginning at the intermediate level, including lessons on bullying, self-esteem and stress and anger management.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=REYNOLDS|first=GRETCHEN|title=Phys Ed: Can Exercise Make Kids Smarter?|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/phys-ed-can-exercise-make-kids-smarter/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporating local indigenous knowledge into physical education can lead to many meaningful experiences and a way of learning about other cultures. For example, by incorporating traditional knowledge from varying indigenous groups from across Canada, students can be exposed to many concepts such as holistic learning and the medicine wheel. A unit could be focused on connecting to a place or feeling while outdoors, participating in traditional games, or outdoor environmental education. These types of lesson can easily be integrated into other parts of the curriculum and give Aboriginal students a chance to incorporate their culture in the local school community.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, G {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been done in how physical education can help improve academic achievement. In a 2007 article, researchers found a profound gain in English Arts [[standardized testing]] test scores among students who had 56 hours of physical education in a year, compared to those who had 28 hours of physical education a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremarche|first1=Pamela V.|last2=Robinson|first2=Ellyn M.|last3=Graham|first3=Louise B.|title=Physical Education and Its Effect on Elementary Testing Results|journal=Physical Educator|date=2007|volume=64|issue=2 |pages=58–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the physical education curriculum is designed to allow school pupils a full range of modern opportunities, including sports. [[Martial arts]] classes, like [[wrestling]] in the United States, and [[Pencak Silat]] in France, [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]], teach children [[self-defense]] and to feel good about themselves. The physical education curriculum is designed to allow students to experience at least a minimum exposure to the following categories of activities: [[aquatic sports|aquatics]], conditioning activities, [[gymnastics]], individual/dual sports, [[team sports]], rhythms, and [[dance]].

In these areas, a planned sequence of learning experiences is designed to support a progression of student development. This allows kids through 6th grade to be introduced to sports, fitness, and teamwork in order to be better prepared for the middle and high school age. In 1975, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to require school physical education classes include [[coeducation|both genders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=483834 |title=Physical Education – Jul 18, 1975 – NBC – TV news: Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1975-07-18 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some high school and some middle school PE classes are single-sex. &lt;!-- This makes no sense as written. Can someone clarify?) Requiring individuals to participate in physical education activities, such as [[dodge ball]], [[flag football]], and other competitive sports remains a controversial subject because of the social impact these have cases physical education programs have been cut.--&gt;&lt;!-- A lot of research shows the benefits of physical education however there can also be a lot of negative experiences students deal with regarding physical education.  --&gt;&lt;!-- A section detailing possible negative experiences students may face during physical education would be beneficial  --&gt;

==Technology use in physical education==

New technology in education is playing a big role in classes. One of the most affordable and effective tools is a simple video recorder.  With this, students can see the mistakes they're making in things such as a throwing motion or swinging form.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Wang, L., Myers, D., &amp; Yanes, M. (2010). Creating student-centered learning experience through the assistance of high-end technology in physical education. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 37(4), 352–356.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that students find this more effective than having someone try to explain what they are doing wrong, and then trying to correct it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Educators may use technologies such as [[pedometer]]s and [[heart rate monitor]]s to make step and heart rate goals for students.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, M., Karp, G., Goc, H., &amp; Perlman, D. (2008). Physical educators' usage. Physical Educator, 65(2), 82–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Other technologies that can be used in a Physical Education setting include [[video projector]]s, [[GPS]] and games and gaming systems such as [[Kinect]], [[Wii]] Fit and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Projectors can show students proper form or how to play certain games. [[GPS]] systems can be used to get students active in an outdoor setting, and active exergames{{clarify|date=October 2014}} can be used by teachers to show students a good way to stay fit in and out of the classroom setting.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, G. (2011, November 21). Interview by M Massey [Personal Interview].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of technology that is commonly used in Physical Education is the pedometer. This does not necessarily track how far a person is going, but lets them know the number of steps they are taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/using-pedometers-to-assess-physical-activity-participation-levels |title=Using pedometers to assess physical activity participation levels |publisher=Humankinetics.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pecentral.org/lessonideas/pedometer/pedometerlessonndex.html |title=PEC: Pedometer Lesson Activities |publisher=Pecentral.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Context-based model of minimal counterintuiveness]], postdictable counterintuitive concepts are minimally counterintuitive and are remembered well.  Those counterintuitive concepts that are not postdictable in a given context are considered to be maximally counterintuitive and are not remembered well by people. Thus the concept of a flying elephant is postdictable (and thus minimally counterintuitive) when set up in the context of [[Operation Dumbo Drop]] because it can be justified in that context.  The concept of a "square triangle that only exists on Wednesdays and eats cats" however does not make any sense and is therefore not postdictable.

'''Protistology''' is a scientific discipline devoted to the study of [[protists]], a highly diverse group of [[Microorganism#Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] organisms. Its field of study overlaps with more traditional disciplines of [[phycology]], [[mycology]], and [[protozoology]], just as protists, which, being a [[paraphyletic group]] embrace [[algae]], some organisms regarded previously as primitive [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]] ("animal" motile protists lacking chloroplasts).

==History==
As the term "[[protozoology]]" has become dated as our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the eukaryotes has improved, the term "protistology" become more common. For example, the Society of Protozoologists, founded in 1947, was renamed International Society of Protistologists in 2005. However, the older term persists in some cases (e.g., the Polish journal Acta Protozoologica).

==Notable protistologists (sorted by alphabetical order of surnames) ==
The field of protistology was idealized by Haeckel, but its widespread recognition is more recent. In fact, many of the researchers cited below considered themselves as protozoologists, phycologists, mycologists, microbiologists, microscopists, parasitologists, limnologists, biologists, naturalists, zoologists, botanists, etc., but made significant contributions to the field.

'''Psychosociology''' or '''psycho-sociology''' is the study of problems common to [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], particularly the way individual behavior is influenced by the groups the person belongs to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/psychosociology Psychosociology], [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, in the study of [[criminals]], ''psychology'' studies the personality of the criminal shaped by the criminal's upbringing.  ''Sociology'' studies the behavior of the entire group itself: the methods the criminal group uses to recruits members and the way the group changes over time. ''Psychosociology'' studies the criminal's behavior, which is created by the group they belong to, such as the young people living in the same neighborhood block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mon.univ-montp2.fr/claroline/backends/download.php?url=L1BQVF9XSEFUX0lTX1BTWUNIT1NPQ0lPTE9HWS5wcHQ%3D&amp;cidReset=true&amp;cidReq=DUGCIPSYSOCI. What is Psychosociology], Espace Pédagogique Claroline Université montpellier 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many social factors that can affect the psychology of others. An example of this is social [[cliques]]. Whether one gets accepted into their desired clique or not, it changes the way they think of themselves, and the people around them. Friendships at young ages while growing up also have much to do with not only psychological development, but [[social skills]] and [[social behavior]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas J|first1=Berndt|title=The Features and Effects of Friendship in Early Adolescence|jstor=1130071|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for common laws in society. Whether an individual's group decides to obey by them or not, it affects that individual's outlook on the law and their group as a whole. The way people may act or speak dictates the way others see them in a society. For example, individuals can see authority in many different ways depending on their experiences and what others have told them. Because of this, based on people's social knowledge of authority, their opinions and ideas are very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diesing|first1=Paul|title=How Does Social Science Work?|jstor=j.ctt5hjpmm.13|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every individual has their own unique and personal psychological thought process in which they use to analyze the world around them. People internalize and process sociological factors in ways relative to their psychological thought process. This relationship is reciprocated with one another as society can alter and morph the ways that people think while at the same time, society can be influenced by the externalized psychological thinking of the individuals within the society itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=2001-08-01|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03|journal=Media Psychology|volume=3|issue=3|pages=265–299|doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, one could see how psychology is instrumental in helping the sociologist to view the wide spread effects of social facts within an individuals behavior.

[[Waseda University]] '''School of International Liberal Studies''' (SILS, {{lang|ja|国際教養学部}}) is the 10th department established in 2004 under the Faculty of International Research and Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waseda.jp/jp/global/faculty/ 学術院、学部・研究科および専門職大学院]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waseda.jp/sils/jp/about/index.html 国際教養学部について]&lt;/ref&gt; The School of International Liberal Studies conducts all classes in English under the premise of [[multiculturalism]], which is not limited to a certain language or culture. The students who speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]] follow Study Plan 1 (''SP1'') and those who speak other [[language]]s other than Japanese follow Study Plan 2 (''SP2''). The students from foreign institutes as exchange students follow Study Plan 3 (''SP3''). It is mandatory for the Study Plan 1 students to study abroad prior to their graduation. As of May 2015, there are 715 international students enrolled in the department, the most of any other department at Waseda.&lt;ref name="university facts"&gt;http://www.waseda.jp/intl-ac/assets/FACTS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The School of International Liberal Studies was located at building 19 until 2009 when its new facility, building 11 was officially opened. The School of International Liberal Studies is sharing the current building with the School of Commerce.

== Global Five ==
The Global Five refers to Japanese universities which enthusiastically focus on globalized mindset and strong English skills. The School of International Liberal Studies is one of the Global Five which includes [[International Christian University]], [[Akita International University]], [[Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University]] and [[Sophia University]]'s Faculty of Liberal Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.nikkei.com/print/article/7479 'Global' grads in demand at Japanese companies]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14034">'''Science advice''' is the process, structures and institutions through which governments and politicians consider science, technology and innovation information in policy- and decision- making. Across different national governments and international bodies, there are a variety of structures and institutions for scientific advice.  They reflect distinctive cultures and traditions of decision-making, which [[Sheila Jasanoff]] has termed the ‘civic epistemology’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6#page-1 |title= Controlling Biotechnology: Science, Democracy and ‘Civic Epistemology’|date=2008-05-07 |accessdate= 2015-05-31 |doi=10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6 |volume= 17 |journal=Metascience |pages= 177–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which expert claims are constructed, validated or challenged in a given society.

Science advice can also be called "science for policy," indicating the flow of information from scientific to policy domains with the intention of informing decisions. This is distinct from "policy for science," the institutions, rules and norms governing how science is funded, conducted, and communicated.

At the national level, countries have diverse models for how to connect scientists and policymakers. In some countries, the president of the [[National academy]], an elected organization of distinguished researchers in natural and social sciences, engineering, medicine, and the humanities, serves as a government science advisor, while other countries have an advisory committee or civil servants perform this role.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web | first1 =James | last1 = Wilsdon | first2 = Kristiann | last2 = Allen | first3 = Katsia | last3 = Paulavets |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/aug/27/a-rough-guide-to-science-advice |title=A rough guide to science advice &amp;#124; Science | work =The guardian | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; National academies are often commissioned to write reports advising government on the state of scientific knowledge to inform policy-relevant questions, such as the risk from chemicals or disease.

Other countries, such as the UK, have a wide range of sources of expert scientific advice which draw on several of these sources.&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.globalscienceadvice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Science_Advice_to_Governments_Briefing_Paper_25-August.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science Advice to Governments: Diverse systems, common challenges |publisher= Global science advice |accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

At the international level, there is an increasing movement to bring together national science advisors to share best practices and form a network to deal with global challenges (e.g., pandemics, climate change). The first global Science Advice to Governments meeting was held in Auckland, New Zealand on August 27–28, 2014.  This meeting brought together high-level science advisors, scientists, and practitioners to discuss the relationship between science and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalscienceadvice.org/ |title=INGSA |publisher= Global science advice | accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new network of European science academies was established at the European Open Science meeting in Copenhagen in June 2014,&lt;ref name= "guardian" /&gt; which now includes 20 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slideshare.net/SciAdvice14/1000-days-in-the-life-of-a-science-advisor-38529597 |title=1000 days in the life of a science advisor |publisher=Slideshare | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) is a major international organization with a program in science for policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.icsu.org/science-for-policy/ |title= Introduction: Science for Policy |publisher=ICSU |date= 2015-05-25 |accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science advice structures ==
A briefing paper,&lt;ref name="globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt; described four of the most commonly used science advice structures for jurisdictions: advisory councils, advisory committees, national academies, and chief scientific advisors. These structures are most commonly employed at the national level, but may also be used in sub-national jurisdictions like Quebec, or supra-national bodies like the [[European Commission]], which has an in-house science service, the [[Joint Research Centre]].

Science advice also occurs at sub-national levels, where structures may include departmental scientific advisors (for example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and at the international level, where networks such as the [[International Council for Science]] coordinate science for policy, for example through serving as the science voice in the [[United Nations]].

For any of these structures, individual experts may be asked for advice in specific circumstances.

! Science Advice Structure&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt;!! Explanation&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt;
|-
| Advisory councils || Many economies have a high-level council for science (or science and innovation) policy. Members typically include senior scientists, alongside representatives of industry, higher education and civil society. Examples include Japan’s Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI) and the US President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). Another example is Australia, where chief scientist Ian Chubb recently announced that he plans to establish a new science council to advise government on policy. However, in most systems, the focus of such entities remains on policy advice in relation to the science system, which is distinct from science advice for public policy.

|-
| Advisory committees || Most governments also rely on an array of specialized scientific and expert committees, which can address detailed technical and regulatory issues in areas such as health, environment and food safety. For example, the US and Japan have hundreds of such committees; the UK has over seventy.
|-

|-
| National academies || A growing number of national academies are active in science policy and/or policy for science. In economies such as Canada, China, Germany, Netherlands, South Africa, US and UK, academies are an important source of scientific advice. Furthermore, networks of national academies such as the International Council for Science, with a membership of 121 national bodies, representing 141 economies, and 31 International Scientific Unions, and the Inter-Academy Panel, the global network of science academies from 107 economies are actively involved in science for policy processes at the international level.
|-

|-
| Chief scientific advisors || The first chief scientific advisor was appointed by the US in 1957, followed by the UK in 1964.  The first chief scientific advisor in Quebec, Canada, was appointed in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14724">'''Sexual capital''' or '''erotic capital''' is the social value an [[individual capital|individual]] or [[social group|group]] accrues, as a result of their [[sexual attractiveness]]. As with other forms of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], sexual capital is convertible, and may be useful in acquiring other forms of capital, including [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]].

== Origins ==
The term erotic capital was first used by British [[sociologist]] [[Catherine Hakim]] in the early 2000s. Hakim defined it as separate from and building upon French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s concepts of economic, cultural and social capital. She says erotic capital is independent of class origin and therefore enables social mobility, and argues that this makes erotic capital socially subversive, which results in the prevailing power structures devaluing and trying to suppress it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Erotic Capital: The Power of Attraction in the Boardroom and the Bedroom|last = Hakim|first = Catherine|publisher = Basic Books|year = 2011|isbn = 0465027474|location = |pages = 16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the manosphere, the parallel term ''sexual market value'' or its abbreviation ''SMV'' is often used.&lt;ref&gt;Boysen, Benjamin.

==Definition==

===Economic===
One economic-related definition is based on the human truth capital theory of [[Gary Becker]], and predicts that people invest rationally in exhibiting their sex appeal when they can expect a return on their investments. This he defines as a form of health capital which is itself a form of [[individual capital]].&lt;ref name="Sexual Capital"&gt;{{cite journal

Some of these attributes may be immutable, such as an individual's race or [[height]], while others may be acquired through fitness training, or artificially, through [[plastic surgery]] or a [[makeover]], etc.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt; There is no single [[hegemonic]] form of erotic (sexual) capital. On the contrary, currencies of capital are quite variable, acquiring a hegemonic status in relation to the erotic preferences of highly specialized social groups that distinguish one [[sexual field]] from another. Importantly, this means that erotic capital is best conceived as a property of the field, and not an individual form of capital.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;

A second definition is developed by Hakim, treating erotic capital as the fourth personal asset. This definition is a multifaceted combination of physical and social attractiveness that goes well beyond sexual attractiveness that is the focus of the 'fields' perspective. Unlike Green's conception of sexual capital, Hakim's erotic capital is an individual capital with no necessary referent to a field.&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt;

Extensive supporting evidence for the concept of sexual capital, defined as beauty, physical attractiveness, and good looks, is provided in [[Daniel Hamermesh]]'s latest book, ''Beauty Pays'', where he reviews the research evidence on the economic benefits of being attractive in all contexts, including higher education teaching, politics, sales and marketing, and everyday social interaction. Hamermesh assumes these economic benefits must be due to unfair discrimination, a position he takes from [[Deborah Rhode]]'s new book, ''Beauty Bias'', a feminist lawyer's critique of the social benefits that accrue to attractive people, and the disadvantages experienced by unattractive people, most particularly the [[obese]].

==Importance==
Catherine Hakim argues that erotic capital matters beyond the sexual field, and beyond private relationships. Her research suggests that erotic capital is important in the fields of [[Mass media|media]], [[politics]], [[advertising]], [[sport]]s, [[the arts]], and in everyday [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]], and consists of six elements:&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt;

# [[Physical attractiveness|Beauty]]
# [[Sexual attraction|Sexual attractiveness]]
# Social attractiveness
# Vivaciousness and energy
# Presentation
# [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]]

Catherine Hakim's theory of erotic capital argues that erotic capital is an important fourth personal asset, alongside economic capital, cultural/human capital and social capital; that erotic capital is increasingly important in affluent modern societies; that women generally have more erotic capital than men, and that erotic capital has social benefits and privileges that benefit the female gender.&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Hakim |title=Erotic capital |journal=[[European Sociological Review]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |year=2010 |pages=499–518 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcq014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This definition of erotic capital has been contested by some sociologists who reject the idea that erotic capital / sexual capital is something individuals possess, like a portable portfolio of resources, with no implicit link to the particular [[sexual field]] in which such characteristics are deemed desirable (For more, see Green, Adam Isaiah. 2013. "Erotic Capital and the Power of Desirability: Why 'Honey Money' is a Bad Collective Strategy for Remedying Gender Inequality". Sexualities 16:137-158).

Sexual capital may be related to both sexual and mental health, as when individuals with low sexual capital show diminished ability to talk about or negotiate condom use with a partner possessing greater erotic capital, and develop negative emotional states as a consequence of feeling unattractive.&lt;ref name = "Green"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi= 10.1177/002214650804900405 | last= Green | first= Adam Isaiah | title= Health and Sexual Status in an Urban Gay Enclave: An Application of the Stress Process Model | journal= Journal of Health and Social Behavior| publisher= American Sociological Association | volume= 49 | year= 2008 | pages=436–451 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In broader theoretical terms, sexual capital is important for social theory insofar as it is one among other types of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], including [[social capital]], [[symbolic capital]], and [[cultural capital]] which influence the status accorded individual members of the larger society. Sexual capital is convertible to other forms of capital, as when actors parlay sexual capital into financial capital or social capital (e.g. [[Marilyn Monroe]]),&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hakim Erotic Capital" /&gt; or when attractive employees get raises and social connections from bringing in more customers by virtue of their looks.&lt;ref name="Prospect"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race==
Several studies suggest that sexual capital is closely associated with [[Race (human classification)|race]] or racial stereotypes of sexual attractiveness.&lt;ref name="SocialOppression"&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Gonzales

|journal=Journal of Black Studies
|volume=35|pages=715–729
|publisher=
|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies show a more complex relationship between erotic capital and race. For example, some black men are afforded high sexual status because they appeal to the fantasies of some white gay men.&lt;ref name="Green Sexual Fields Approach" /&gt;
Susan Koshy argues that Asian women have gained sexual capital in the West through glamorous accounts of western male – Asian female sexual relationships in the media and arts.&lt;ref name="Sexual Naturalization" /&gt; James Farrer argues that white men living in China have enhanced sexual capital arising out of associations of [[Whiteness studies|whiteness]] with modernity, sexual openness and mobility.&lt;ref name="Alien Sexual Capital"&gt;{{cite journal

|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Class and gender==
Scholars suggest that sexual capital is closely tied to [[social class]]. Groes-Green argues that sexual capital and other forms of bodily power become important resources among disenfranchised young men in Southern Africa when their access to [[economic capital]] and jobs is diminished. Groes-Green further argues that the emergence of sexual capital is linked to [[gender]] relations, e.g. when poor young men build sexual capital by grooming their looks and improving sexual performance in order to satisfy female partners and in competition with [[middle class]] peers and older so-called '[[sugar daddy (slang term)|sugar-daddies]]'. Thus sexual capital reinforces [[masculinity]] in the face of male disempowerment, and it often develops as a response to conflict between [[hegemonic]] and subordinated masculinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groes-Green | first1 = Christian | year = 2009 | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol18num4/groes-green.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 286–304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital portfolios==
Because desirability in a sexual field may depend on more than merely sexual attractiveness, Green (2014) develops the concept, capital portfolio, to capture the particular combination of capitals that make an individual or group more desirable than others.  Capital portfolios typically involve a combination of sexual capital with economic, cultural and social capitals. As an example, to the extent that women, on average, value financial resources (i.e., economic capital) in their male partners more than sexual capital, and men value sexual capital more than economic capital in their female partners, so one may conclude that heterosexual women and men seek out distinctive capital portfolios that include a different, gendered balance of capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Adam Isaiah|title=Sexual Fields: Toward a Sociology of Collective Sexual Life|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social history''', often called the '''new social history,''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at the lived experience of the past. In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 841 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/teachers "History Online:Teachers of History"] accessed 1/21/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old and new social history==
The older social history (before 1960) included numerous topics that were not part of the mainstream historiography of political, military, diplomatic and constitutional history. It was a hodgepodge without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. [[People's history]] was sometimes so [[Marxism|Marxist]] that non-Marxists were alienated by it. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=0-582-48488-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Social History movement==
The "new social history" exploded on the scene in the 1960s, quickly becoming one of the dominant styles of historiography in the U.S., Britain and Canada.  The French version, promulgated by the [[Annales School]], was very well organized and dominated French historiography, and influenced much of Europe and Latin America. [[Jürgen Kocka]] finds two meanings to "social history."  At the simplest level, it was the subdivision of historiography that focused on social structures and processes.  In this regard it stood in contrast to political or economic history.  The second meaning was broader, and the Germans called it "Gesellschaftsgeschichte."  It is the history of an entire society from a social-historical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society: Business, Labor, and Bureaucracy in Modern Germany, 1800-1918'' (New York: Berghahn Books, 1999) pp 275-97, at p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the "Gesellschaftsgeschichte" movement introduced a vast range of topics, as Kocka, a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] recalls:
:In the 1960s and 1970s, "social history" caught the imagination of a young generation of historians. It became a central concept -- and a rallying point -- of [[Historical revisionism|historiographic revisionism]]. It meant many things at the same time. It gave priority to the study of particular kinds of phenomena, such as classes and movements, urbanization and industrialization, family and education, work and leisure, mobility, inequality, conflicts and revolutions. It stressed structures and processes over actors and events. It emphasized analytical approaches close to the social sciences rather than by the traditional methods of historical hermeneutics. Frequently social historians sympathized with the causes (as they saw them) of the little people, of the underdog, of popular movements, or of the working class. Social history was both demanded and rejected as a vigorous revisionist alternative to the more established ways of historiography, in which the reconstruction of politics and ideas, the history of events and hermeneutic methods traditionally dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Americanist Paul E. Johnson recalls the heady early promise of the movement in the late 1960s:
:The New Social History reached UCLA at about that time, and I was trained as a quantitative social science historian. I learned that "literary" evidence and the kinds of history that could be written from it were inherently elitist and untrustworthy. Our cousins, the Annalistes, talked of ignoring heroes and events and reconstructing the more constitutive and enduring "background" of history. Such history could be made only with quantifiable sources. The result would be a "History from the Bottom Up" that ultimately engulfed traditional history and, somehow, helped to make a Better World. Much of this was acted out with mad-scientist bravado. One well-known quantifier said that anyone who did not know statistics at least through multiple regression should not hold a job in a history department. My own advisor told us that he wanted history to become "a predictive social science."  I never went that far. I was drawn to the new social history by its democratic inclusiveness as much as by its system and precision. I wanted to write the history of ordinary people—to historicize them, put them into the social structures and long-term trends that shaped their lives, and at the same time resurrect what they said and did. In the late 1960s, quantitative social history looked like the best way to do that.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Johnson, "Reflections: Looking Back at Social History," ''Reviews in American History'' Volume 39, Number 2, June 2011 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v039/39.2.johnson.html online at [[Project MUSE]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Science History Association]] was formed in 1976 to bring together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in social history. It is still active and publishes ''[[Social Science History]]'' quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The field is also the specialty of the ''[[Journal of Social History]]'', edited since 1967 by [[Peter Stearns]]&lt;ref&gt;. See [http://chnm.gmu.edu/jsh/ ''Journal of Social History'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It covers such topics as gender relations; race in American history; the history of personal relationships; consumerism; sexuality; the social history of politics; crime and punishment, and history of the senses. Most of the major historical journals have coverage as well.

However, after 1990 social history was increasingly challenged by [[cultural history]], which emphasizes language and the importance of beliefs and assumptions and their causal role in group behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Hunt]] and Victoria Bonnell, eds., ''Beyond the Cultural Turn'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfields==

===Historical demography===
{{main|Historical demography}}
The study of the lives of ordinary people was revolutionized in the 1960s by the introduction of sophisticated quantitative and demographic methods, often using individual data from the census and from local registers of births, marriages, deaths and taxes, as well as theoretical models from sociology such as [[social mobility]].  H-DEMOG is a daily email discussion group that covers the field broadly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~demog/ H-DEMOG]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical demography is the study of population history and demographic processes, usually using census or similar statistical data. It became an important specialty inside social history, with strong connections with the larger field of [[demography]], as in the study of the [[Demographic Transition]].

===Black history===
Black history or [[African-American history]] studies African Americans and Africans in American history. The [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]] was founded by [[Carter G. Woodson]] in 1915 and has 2500 members and publishes the ''[[Journal of African American History]],'' formerly the ''Journal of Negro History.'' Since 1926 it has sponsored [[Black History Month]] every February.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.asalh.org/ ASALH]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic history===
[[Ethnic history]] is especially important in the U.S. and Canada, where major encyclopedias helped define the field.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.  Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the history of ethnic groups (usually not including blacks or Native Americans). 
Typical approaches include critical ethnic studies; comparative ethnic studies; critical race studies; Asian-American, and Latino/a or Chicano/a studies.  In recent years Chicano/Chicana studies has become important as the Hispanic population has become the largest minority in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo F. Acuna, ''The Making of Chicana/o Studies: In the Trenches of Academe'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Making-Chicana-Studies-Latinidad-Transnational/dp/0813550025/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor history===
{{main|Labor history (discipline)}}
[[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]], deals with labor unions and the social history of workers. See for example [[Labor history of the United States]]  The Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History was established: 1971 and has a membership of 1000.  It publishes ''International Labor and Working-Class History''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518111017/http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H-LABOR is a daily email-based discussion group formed in 1993 that reaches over a thousand scholars and advanced students.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~labor/ H-LABOR website]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Labor and Working-Class History Association]] formed in 1988 and publishes ''[[Labor: Studies in Working-Class History]].''

Kirk (2010) surveys labour historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labour history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labour, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labour historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal? Themes in the Labour History of Britain, 1960–2010," ''Labour History Review,'' Aug 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 162-180&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Navickas, "What happened to class?

===Women's history===
[[Women's history]] exploded into prominence in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mtsu.edu/~kmiddlet/history/women.html American Women's History: A Research Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now well represented in every geographical topic; increasingly it includes gender history.&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1405149604 Teresa A. Meade and Merry Wiesner-Hanks, eds. ''A Companion to Gender History'' (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Social history uses the approach of women's history to understand the experiences of ordinary women, as opposed to "Great Women," in the past. [[Joan Kelly|Feminist women's historians]] have critiqued early studies of social history for being too focused on the male experience.

===Gender history===
Gender history focuses on the categories, discourses and experiences of femininity and masculinity as they develop over time. Gender history gained prominence after it was conceptualized in 1986 by [[Joan W. Scott]] in her article "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Joan W.|title=Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1986|volume=91|issue=5|pages=1053–1075|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1864376?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101570710027|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.2307/1864376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social historians use Scott's concept of "perceived differences" to study how gender relations in the past have unfolded and continue to unfold. In keeping with the [[cultural turn]], many social historians are also gender historians who study how discourses interact with everyday experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensu.ca/skhs/faculty-and-staff/faculty/mary-louise-adams |title=DR. MARY LOUISE ADAMS, PH.D. (TORONTO) |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the family===
{{see also|History of the family}}
The History of the family emerged as a separate field in the 1970s, with close ties to anthropology and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara K. Hareven, "The history of the family and the complexity of social change," ''American Historical Review,'' Feb 1991, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp. 95-124&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was especially pronounced in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Comacchio, "'The History of Us': Social Science, History, and the Relations of Family in Canada," ''Labour / Le Travail,'' Fall 2000, Vol. 46, pp. 167-220, with very thorough coverage.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes demographic patterns and public policy, but is quite separate from [[genealogy]], though often drawing on the same primary sources, such as censuses and family records.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jfh.sagepub.com/ ''Journal of Family History'', quarterly since 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The influential pioneering study ''Women, Work, and Family'' (1978) was done by [[Louise A. Tilly]] and [[Joan W. Scott]]. It broke new ground with their broad interpretive framework and emphasis on the variable factors shaping women's place in the family and economy in France and England. The study considered the interaction of production, or traditional labor, and reproduction, the work of caring for children and families, in its analysis of women's wage labor and thus helped to bring together labor and family history.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dublin, "Women, Work, and Family: The View from the United States," ''Journal of Women's History,'' Autumn 99, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Much work has been done on the dichotomy in women's lives between the private sphere and the public.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent worldwide overview covering 7000 years see Maynes and Waltner's 2012 book and ebook, ''The Family: A World History'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Maynes and Ann Beth Waltner, ''The Family: A World History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012) [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38304 online review]&lt;/ref&gt; For comprehensive coverage of the American case, see Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong, eds. ''The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia'' (4 vol, 2014).

The [[history of childhood]] is a growing subfield.&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Stearns, "Social History and World History: Prospects for Collaboration." ''Journal of World History'' 2007 18(1): 43-52. {{ISSN|1045-6007}} Fulltext: [[History Cooperative]] and [[Project Muse]], deals with the history of childhood worldwide. See Peter N. Stearns, ''Childhood in World History'' (2005), A.R. Colon with P. A.

===History of education===
{{main|History of education|History of education in the United States#Historiography|History of childhood care and education}}
For much of the 20th century, the dominant American historiography, as exemplified by [[Ellwood Patterson Cubberley]] (1868-1941) at Stanford, emphasized the rise of American education as a powerful force for literacy, democracy, and equal opportunity, and a firm basis for higher education and advanced research institutions. It was a story of enlightenment and modernization triumphing over ignorance, cost-cutting, and narrow traditionalism whereby parents tried to block their children's intellectual access to the wider world.  Teachers dedicated to the public interest, reformers with a wide vision, and public support from the civic-minded community were the heroes.  The textbooks help inspire students to become public schools teachers and thereby fulfill their own civic mission.&lt;ref&gt;Sol Cohen, "The history of the history of American education, 1900-1976: The uses of the past." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 46#3 (1976): 298-330. online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence A. Cremin, ''The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis came in the 1960s, when a new generation of [[New Left]] scholars and students rejected the traditional celebratory accounts, and identified the educational system as the villain for many of America's weaknesses, failures, and crimes. Michael Katz (1939-2014) states they:
:tried to explain the origins of the Vietnam War; the persistence of racism and segregation; the distribution of power among gender and classes; intractable poverty and the decay of cities; and the failure of social institutions and policies designed to deal with mental illness, crime, delinquency, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Katz|title=Reconstructing American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpeeMe6o5jIC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2009|publisher=Harvard UP|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old guard fought back and bitter historiographical contests, with the younger students and scholars largely promoting the proposition that schools were not the solution to America's ills, they were in part the cause of Americans problems. The fierce battles of the 1960s died out by the 1990s, but enrollment in education history courses and never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;For a counterattack see Diane Ravitch, ''The Revisionists Revised: A Critique of the Radical Attack on the Schools'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, compromise had been worked out, with all sides focusing on the heavily bureaucratic nature of the American public schooling.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardin Best, ed. ''Historical inquiry in education: A research agenda'' (American Educational Research Association, 1983); The most comprehensive overview of the historiography of American education, with essays by 13 scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years most histories of education deal with institutions or focus on the ideas histories of major reformers,&lt;ref&gt;Three fourths of British studies are institutional, says William Richardson, "British Historiography of Education in International Context at the Turn of the Century, 1996-2006," ''History of Education'', July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 569-593,&lt;/ref&gt;  but a new social history has recently emerged, focused on who were the students in terms of social background and social mobility. In the U.S. attention has often focused on minority and ethnic students. In Britain, Raftery et al. (2007) looks at the historiography on social change and education in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with particular reference to 19th-century schooling. They developed distinctive systems of schooling in the 19th century that reflected not only their relationship to England but also significant contemporaneous economic and social change. This article seeks to create a basis for comparative work by identifying research that has treated this period, offering brief analytical commentaries on some key works, discussing developments in educational historiography, and pointing to lacunae in research.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Raftery, Jane McDermid, and Gareth Elwyn Jones, "Social Change and Education in Ireland, Scotland and Wales: Historiography on Nineteenth-century Schooling," ''History of Education'', July/Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 447-463&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have recently looked at the relationship between schooling and urban growth by studying educational institutions as agents in class formation, relating urban schooling to changes in the shape of cities, linking urbanization with social reform movements, and examining the material conditions affecting child life and the relationship between schools and other agencies that socialize the young.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Reeder, Schooling in the City: Educational History and the Urban Variable," ''Urban History,'' May 1992, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 23-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juergen Herbst, "The History of Education: State of the Art at the Turn of the Century in Europe and North America," ''Paedagogica Historica'' 35, no. 3 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most economics-minded historians have sought to relate education to changes in the quality of labor, productivity and economic growth, and rates of return on investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sanderson, "Educational and Economic History: The Good Neighbours," ''History of Education,'' July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 429-445&lt;/ref&gt;  A major recent exemplar is Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, ''The Race between Education and Technology'' (2009), on the social and economic history of 20th-century American schooling.

===Urban history===
{{main|Urban history}}
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1950s in Britain and in the 1960s in the U.S. It looked at the "city as process" and, often using quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A major early study was [[Stephan Thernstrom]]'s ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other exemplars of the new urban history included Kathleen Conzen,  ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860'' (1976); Alan Dawley, ''Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn'' (1975; 2nd ed. 2000); Michael B. Katz,  ''The People of Hamilton, Canada West'' (1976);&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/159740411X/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Henry Monkkonen|Eric H. Monkkonen]], ''The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus Ohio 1860-1865'' (1975); and Michael P. Weber, ''Social Change in an Industrial Town: Patterns of Progress in Warren, Pennsylvania, From Civil War to World War I.'' (1976).

Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''Journal of Early Modern History'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural history===
{{main|Rural history}}
[[Agricultural History]] handles the economic and technological dimensions, while [[Rural history]] handles the social dimension.  Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of modern English rural history and identifies an "orthodox" school, focused on the economic history of agriculture. This historiography has made impressive progress in quantifying and explaining the output and productivity achievements of English farming since the "agricultural revolution."&lt;ref&gt;On British rural history see Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?"  ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481. {{ISSN|0018-246X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebratory style of the orthodox school was challenged by a dissident tradition emphasizing the social costs of agricultural progress, notably enclosure, which forced poor tenant farmers off the land. Recently, a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History,'' has broken away from this narrative of agricultural change, elaborating a wider social history. The work of Alun Howkins has been pivotal in the recent historiography, in relation to these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''The Death Rural England'' (2003) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/041513885X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Howkins, like his precursors, is constrained by an increasingly anachronistic equation of the countryside with agriculture. Geographers and sociologists have developed a concept of a "post-productivist" countryside, dominated by consumption and representation that may have something to offer historians, in conjunction with the well-established historiography of the "rural idyll."  Most rural history has focused on the [[Southern United States|American South]]—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of [[Union (American Civil War)|the North]] as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old frontier history as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Historiography of religion}}
The historiography of religion focuses mostly on theology and church organization and development. Recently the study of the social history or religious behavior and belief has become important.&lt;ref&gt;John T. McGreevy,  "Faith and Morals in the Modern United States, 1865-Present." Reviews in American History 26.1 (1998): 239-254. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v026/26.1mcgreevy.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history in Europe==

===France===
{{main|Annales School}}
Social history has dominated French historiography since the 1920s, thanks to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{see also|Bielefeld School|Historiography of Germany}}
Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s-60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society" - ''Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' - has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] (1931-2014) and his [[Bielefeld School]] as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''[[German Studies Review]]'' 1984 7(3): 451-480. {{DOI|10.2307/1428885}} [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1428885 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s German historians of society, led by Wehler and [[Jürgen Kocka]] at the "Bielefeld school"  gained dominance in Germany by applying both modernization theories and social science methods. From the 1980s, however, they were increasingly criticized by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'? On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Modernization Theory for History." ''Rethinking History'' 2006 10(2): 171-200. {{ISSN|1364-2529}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Before World War II, political history was in decline and an effort was made to introduce social history in the style of the French [[Annales School]].  After the war only Marxist interpretations were allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Erős Vilmos|hu}}, "In the lure of Geistesgeschichte : the theme of decline in Hungarian historiography and historical thinking in the first half of the twentieth century". ''[[European Review of History]]'' (2015) 22#3 pp 411-432. {{doi|10.1080/13507486.2014.986435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|end of Communism in Hungary]] in 1989. [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed and social history came into its own, especially the study of the demographic patterns of the early modern period. Research priorities have shifted toward [[urban history]] and the conditions of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Gyáni Gábor|hu}}, "Trends in contemporary Hungarian historical scholarship," ''[[Social History (journal)|Social History]],'' (2009) 34#2 pp 250-260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
When [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Communism ended]] in 1991, large parts of the [[Soviet archives]] were opened.  The historians' data base leapt from a limited range of sources to a vast array of records created by modern bureaucracies. Social history flourished.  The old [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Fitzpatrick]],  "Impact of the Opening of Soviet Archives on Western Scholarship on Soviet Social History."

==Canada==
{{main|Social history of Canada}}
Social history had a "golden age" in Canada in the 1970s, and continues to flourish among scholars. Its strengths include demography, women, labour, and urban studies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S.

==Political history==
While the study of elites and political institutions has produced a vast body of scholarship, the impact after 1960 of social historians has shifted emphasis onto the politics of ordinary people—especially voters and collective movements. Political historians responded with the "new political history," which has shifted attention to political cultures. Some scholars have recently applied a cultural approach to political history.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Pasley, Andrew W. Robertson, and David Waldstreicher, eds. ''Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians complain that social historians are likely to put too much stress on the dimensions of class, gender and race, reflecting a leftist political agenda that assumes outsiders in politics are more interesting than the actual decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;Romain Huret, "All in the Family Again? Political Historians and the Challenge of Social History," ''Journal of Policy History'', July 2009, Vol. 21 Issue 3, pp 239-263&lt;/ref&gt;

Social history, with its leftist political origins, initially sought to link state power to everyday experience in the 1960s. Yet by the 1970s, social historians increasingly excluded analyses of state power from its focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parthasarathi|first=Prasannan|title=The State and Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=771–778|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3parthasarathi.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social historians have recently engaged with political history through studies of the relationships between state formation, power and everyday life with the theoretical tools of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[governmentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Simon|title=From Hegemony to Governmentality:  Changing Conceptions of Power in Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=705–720|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3gunn.html|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social psychology''' is the [[Science|scientific]] study of how people's [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, and [[behavior]]s are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Allport|first=G. W|year=1985|title=The historical background of social psychology|editor1-first=G|editor1-last=Lindzey|editor2-first=E|editor2-last=Aronson|encyclopedia=The Handbook of Social Psychology|location=New York|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]}}p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, ''scientific'' refers to the [[empirical]] investigation using the [[scientific method]]. The terms ''thoughts'', ''feelings'', and ''behavior'' refer to [[psychology|psychological]] variables that can be measured in humans. The statement that others' presence may be ''imagined'' or ''implied'' suggests that humans are malleable to social influences even when alone, such as when watching television or following internalized [[norm (sociology)|cultural norms]]. Social psychologists typically explain [[human behavior]] as a result of the interaction of [[mind|mental states]] and social [[situationism (psychology)|situations]].

Social psychologists examine factors that cause behaviors to unfold in a given way in the presence of others. They study conditions under which certain behavior, actions, and feelings occur. Social psychology is concerned with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and goals are cognitively constructed and how these mental representations, in turn, influence our interactions with others.

Social psychology traditionally bridged the gap between psychology and sociology. During the years immediately following [[World War II]] there was frequent collaboration between psychologists and sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=W. H|year=1989|title=Some reflections on the golden age of interdisciplinary social psychology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=15|doi=10.1146/annurev.so.15.080189.000245|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two disciplines, however, have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists focusing on "macro variables" (e.g., social structure) to a much greater extent than psychologists.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nevertheless, [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociological approaches]] to psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area.

In addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and [[Europe]]an social psychologists. As a generalization, American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena (see [[group dynamics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moscovici|first1=S|last2=Markova|first2=I|year=2006|title=The Making of Modern Social Psychology|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Polity Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Although there were some older writings about social psychology, such as those by Islamic philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius),&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amber Haque|year=2004|title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=43|issue=4|pages=357–377|jstor=27512819|doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; the discipline of social psychology, as its modern-day definition, began in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. By that time, though, the discipline had already developed a significant foundation. Following the 18th century, those in the emerging field of social psychology were concerned with developing concrete explanations for different aspects of human nature.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} They attempted to discover concrete cause and effect relationships that explained the social interactions in the world around them. In order to do so, they believed that the [[scientific method]], an empirically based scientific measure, could be applied to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gergen| first1= K. J. |year=1973| title= Social Psychology as History |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=26| issue= 2 | pages= 309–320| doi=10.1037/h0034436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published study in this area was an experiment in 1898 by [[Norman Triplett]], on the phenomenon of [[social facilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Triplett|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Triplett|year=1898|title=The dynamogenic factors in pacemaking and competition|journal=[[American Journal of Psychology]]|volume=9|pages=507–533|doi=10.2307/1412188|issue=4|jstor=1412188}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, many [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychologists, most notably [[Kurt Lewin]], fled to the United States from Nazi Germany. They were instrumental in developing the field as something separate from the [[behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] schools that were dominant during that time, and social psychology has always maintained the legacy of their interests in [[perception]] and [[cognition]]. [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]] and [[communication in small groups|small group]] phenomena were the most commonly studied topics in this era.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

During World War II, social psychologists studied [[persuasion]] and [[propaganda]] for the U.S. military&lt;!-- Should a link to [[psychological warfare]] be in here? --&gt;. After the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including [[gender]] issues and [[racial prejudice]].  Most notable, revealing, and contentious of these were the [[Stanley Milgram shock experiments]] on [[obedience to authority]]. In the sixties, there was growing interest in new topics, such as [[cognitive dissonance]], [[Bystander effect|bystander intervention]], and [[aggression]]. By the 1970s, however, social psychology in America had reached a crisis. There was heated debate over the ethics of laboratory experimentation, whether or not attitudes really predicted behavior, and how much science could be done in a cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gergen|first=Kenneth J|authorlink=Kenneth Gergen|year=1973|title=Social psychology as history|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=26|pages=309–320|doi=10.1037/h0034436|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the time when a radical [[situationism (psychology)|situationist]] approach challenged the relevance of self and personality in psychology.&lt;ref name="social-psychology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/|title=Social Psychology: Definition, History, Methods, Applications - IResearchNet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s social psychology reached a more mature level. Two of the areas social psychology matured in were theories and methods.&lt;ref name="social-psychology"/&gt; Careful [[Research ethics|ethical standards]] now regulate research. [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralistic]] and [[multicultural]] perspectives have emerged. Modern researchers are interested in many phenomena, but [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]], [[social cognition]], and the self-concept are perhaps the greatest areas of growth in recent years.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Social psychologists have also maintained their applied interests with contributions in the social psychology of health, education, law, and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Kassin, S., Fein, S., &amp; Markus, H.R. (2017). ''Social psychology'' (10th edition). Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrapersonal phenomena==

===Attitudes===
{{Main|Attitude (psychology)}}
In social psychology, attitudes are defined as learned, global evaluations of a person, object, place, or issue that influence thought and action.&lt;ref name=Sison&gt;{{cite book|last=Sison|first=Erick Louie. A|year=2008|title=The dynamics of persuasion|location=New York|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2012}} Put more simply, attitudes are basic expressions of approval or disapproval, favorability or unfavorability, or as Bem put it, likes and dislikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bem|first=D|year=1970|title=Beliefs, attitudes, and human affairs|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Brooks/Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples would include liking chocolate ice cream, or endorsing the values of a particular political party.

Social psychologists have studied attitude formation, the structure of attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, and the relationship between attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior. For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day.

In recent times, research on attitudes has examined the distinction between traditional, self-reported attitude measures and "implicit" or unconscious attitudes. For example, experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Allen|date=September 2001|title=Relations among the Implicit Association Test, Discriminatory Behavior, and Explicit Measures of Racial Attitudes|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103100914707|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=5|pages=435–442|via=|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1470}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Implicit Association Test]] have found that people often demonstrate implicit bias against other races, even when their explicit responses reveal equal mindedness. One study found that explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior in interracial interactions, whereas implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heider|first1=J. D|last2=Skowronski|first2=J. J|year=2007|title=Improving the Predictive Validity of the Implicit Association Test|journal=[[North American Journal of Psychology]]|volume=9|pages=53–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis on how attitudes are formed, first advanced by [[Abraham Tesser]] in 1983, is that strong likes and dislikes are ingrained in our [[genetic make-up]]. Tesser speculates that individuals are disposed to hold certain strong attitudes as a result of inborn physical, sensory, and [[cognitive skill]]s, temperament, and [[personality traits]]. Whatever disposition nature elects to give us, our most treasured attitudes are often formed as a result of exposure to attitude objects; our history of rewards and punishments; the attitude that our parents, friends, and enemies express; the social and cultural context in which we live; and other types of experiences we have. Obviously, attitudes are formed through the basic process of learning. Numerous studies have shown that people can form strong positive and negative attitudes toward neutral objects that are in some way linked to emotionally charged stimuli.&lt;ref name=Kassin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kassin|first1=Saul|title=Social Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston, NY|isbn=978-0-618-86846-9|edition=7|first2=Steven|last2=Fein|first3=Hazel Rose|last3=Markus}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185–186}}

Attitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline, such as [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]], [[interpersonal attraction]], social perception, and [[prejudice]].

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The topic of persuasion has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Persuasion is an active method of influence that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive means. Persuasion relies on "appeals" rather than strong pressure or [[coercion]]. Numerous variables have been found to influence the persuasion process; these are normally presented in five major categories: ''who'' said ''what'' to ''whom'' and ''how''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology, Tenth Edition|last=Myers|first=David|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-337066-8|location=New York|pages=234–253|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[Orator|Communicator]], including [[credibility]], [[expert]]ise, [[trustworthiness]], and [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].
# The [[Message]], including varying degrees of [[reason]], [[emotion]] (such as fear), one-sided or two sided arguments, and other types of informational content.
# The [[Audience]], including a variety of [[demographics]], [[personality trait]]s, and [[preference]]s.
# The Channel or [[Media (communication)|Medium]], including the printed word, radio, television, the internet, or face-to-face interactions.
# The Context, including the environment, group dynamics, and preamble to the message.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Are you saying that these act as a preamble to the message, or that anything said prior to the message is a part of the context?}}

[[dual process theory|Dual-process theories]] of persuasion (such as the [[elaboration likelihood model]]) maintain that the persuasive process is mediated by two separate routes; central and peripheral. The central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer lasting change, but requires motivation to process. The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process. An example of a peripheral route of persuasion might be a politician using a flag lapel pin, smiling, and wearing a crisp, clean shirt. Notice that this does not require motivation to be persuasive, but should not last as long as persuasion based on the central route. If that politician were to outline exactly what they believed, and their previous voting record, this would be using the central route, and would result in longer lasting change, but would require a good deal of motivation to process.

===Social cognition===
{{Main|Social cognition}}
Social cognition is a growing area of social psychology that studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Much research rests on the assertion that people think about (other) people differently from non-social targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moskowitz|first=Gordon B|title=Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others|year=2005|publisher=Guilford|isbn=978-1-59385-085-2|series=Texts in Social Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;dq=%22Social+Cognition%22+Moskowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assertion is supported by the social cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dobbs|first1=Davis|title=The Gregarious Brain| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 8 July 2007 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/magazine/08sociability-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Person perception]] is the study of how people form impressions of others. The study of how people form beliefs about each other while interacting is known as [[interpersonal perception]].

A major research topic in social cognition is attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisenzein|first1=Rainer|last2=Rudolph|first2=Udo|title=50 Years of Attribution Research|journal= [[Social Psychology (journal)|Social Psychology]] |volume=39|issue=3|year=2008|pages=123–124|issn=1864-9335|doi=10.1027/1864-9335.39.3.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributions are the explanations we make for people's behavior, either our own behavior or the behavior of others. One element of attribution ascribes the locus of a behavior to either internal or external factors. An ''internal'', or dispositional, attribution assigns behavior to causes related to inner traits such as personality, disposition, character or ability. An ''external'', or situational, attribution involves situational elements, such as the weather.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}}  A second element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to either stable or unstable factors (whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances). Finally, we also attribute causes of behavior to either controllable or uncontrollable factors: how much control one has over the situation at hand.

Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered. For instance, the [[fundamental attribution error]] is the tendency to make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|724}} The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|107}} The [[self-serving bias]] is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|109}} Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by [[just-world phenomenon|believing in a just world]], blaming victims for their suffering, and making [[defensive attribution hypothesis|defensive attributions]], which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|111}} Researchers have found that mildly [[Clinical depression|depressed]] individuals often lack this bias and actually have [[depressive realism|more realistic perceptions of reality]] (as measured by the opinions of others).&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Andrews2001.pdf |pmid=11182572|year=2001|last1=Andrews|first1=P.

[[Heuristics in judgment and decision making|Heuristic]]s are cognitive short cuts. Instead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The [[availability heuristic]] occurs when people estimate the [[probability]] of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias.{{Contradict-inline|article=Availability heuristic|date=March 2012}} The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|63}} Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The [[hindsight bias]] is a [[Confabulation|false memory]] of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The [[confirmation bias]] is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Another key concept in social cognition is the assumption that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. [[schema (psychology)|Schemas]] are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate [[automaticity|automatically]] and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that people are more likely to misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Correll|first1=Joshua|last2=Park|first2=Bernadette|last3=Judd|first3=Charles M|last4=Wittenbrink|first4=Bernd|title=The police officer's dilemma: Using ethnicity to disambiguate potentially threatening individuals|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=83|issue=6|year=2002|pages=1,314–1,329|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314|citeseerx=10.1.1.466.7243}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of schema is actually a [[stereotype]], a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an [[ultimate attribution error]]). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior ([[discrimination]]). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as ''scripts''.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Self-concept===
{{Main|Self-concept}}
Self-concept is a term referring to the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves. However, what specifically does self-concept consist of? According to Hazel Markus (1977), the self-concept is made up of cognitive molecules called [[self-schema]]s&amp;nbsp;– beliefs that people have about themselves that guide the processing of self-reliant information. For example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be one "self," who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the "self" who processes information about things related to being an athlete (recognizing an incoming pass, aiming a shot, etc.). These "selves" are part of one's identity and the self-reliant information is the information that relies on the proper "self" to process and react on it. If a "self" is not part of one's identity, then it is much more difficult for one to react. For example, a civilian may not know how to handle a hostile threat as a trained Marine would. The Marine contains a "self" that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly, whereas a civilian may not contain that self, disabling them from properly processing the information from the hostile threat and, furthermore, debilitating them from acting accordingly. Self-schemas are to an individual’s total self–concept as a hypothesis is to a theory, or a book is to a library. A good example is the body weight self-schema; people who regard themselves as over or underweight, or for those whom body image is a significant self-concept aspect, are considered ''schematics'' with respect to weight. For these people a range of otherwise mundane events&amp;nbsp;– grocery shopping, new clothes, eating out, or going to the beach&amp;nbsp;– can trigger thoughts about the self. In contrast, people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are ''a-schematic'' on that attribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markus|first=Hazel|title=Self-Schemata and Processing Information|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |year=1977|volume=35|issue=2|pages=63–78|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.2.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rather clear that the self is a special object of our [[attention]]. Whether one is mentally focused on a [[memory]], a [[conversation]], a foul smell, the song that is stuck in one's head, or this sentence, [[consciousness]] is like a spotlight. This [[:wikt:spotlight|spotlight]] can shine on only one object at a time, but it can switch rapidly from one object to another and process the information out of [[awareness]].{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Process which information? And consciousness implies awareness...}} In this spotlight the self is front and center: things relating to the self have the spotlight more often.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The self's ABCs are affect, behavior, and cognition. An affective (or emotional) question: How do people evaluate themselves, enhance their self-image, and maintain a secure sense of identity? A behavioral question: How do people regulate their own actions and present themselves to others according to interpersonal demands? A [[cognitive]] question: How do individuals become themselves, build a self-concept, and uphold a stable sense of identity?&lt;ref name=Kassin /&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Affective forecasting]] is the process of [[prediction|predicting]] how one would feel in response to future [[emotional]] events. Studies done by [[Timothy Wilson]] and [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] in 2003 have shown that people overestimate the strength of reaction to anticipated positive and negative life events that they actually feel when the event does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D|authorlink1=Timothy Wilson|first2=Daniel T|last2=Gilbert|title=Affective Forecasting|journal= Advances in Experimental Psychology |year=2003|issue=35|pages=345–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories on the perception of our own behavior. Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bem|first=Daryl J|title=Self Perception Theory|year=1972|volume=6|pages=1–62|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60024-6|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=978-0-12-015206-3|chapter=Self-Perception Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Festinger]]'s 1954 [[social comparison theory]] is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Festinger|first=Leon|authorlink=Leon Festinger|title=A theory of social comparison process|journal= [[Human Relations (journal)|Human Relations]] |year=1954|volume=7|pages=117–140|doi=10.1177/001872675400700202|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[facial feedback hypothesis]]: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.&lt;ref name=Kassin /&gt;{{rp|56}}

The fields of social psychology and [[Personality psychology|personality]] have merged over the years, and social psychologists have developed an interest in self-related phenomena. In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place a greater emphasis on cognitions than on traits. Much research focuses on the [[self-concept]], which is a person's understanding of their self. The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component, known as the ''self-schema'', and an evaluative component, the ''self-esteem''. The need to maintain a healthy [[self-esteem]] is recognized as a central human [[motivation]] in the field of social psychology.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Self-efficacy]] beliefs are associated with the self-schema. These are expectations that performance on some task will be effective and successful. Social psychologists also study such self-related processes as [[self-control]] and [[impression management|self-presentation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

People develop their self-concepts by varied means, including [[introspection]], feedback from others, [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]], and social comparison. By comparing themselves to relevant others, people gain information about themselves, and they make inferences that are relevant to self-esteem. Social comparisons can be either "upward" or "downward," that is, comparisons to people who are either higher in status or ability, or lower in status or ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology|last=Baron|first=Robert A.|last2=Branscombe|first2=Nyla R.|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-0-205-20558-5|location=United States of America|pages=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downward comparisons are often made in order to elevate self-esteem.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Self-perception is a specialized form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior. Psychologists have found that too many extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as [[overjustification]]. People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=E. L|last2=Koestner|first2=R|last3=Ryan|first3=R. M|year=2001|title=Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again|journal=71|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important exception to [[reinforcement]] theory.

==Interpersonal phenomena==

===Social influence===
{{Main|Social influence}}
Social influence is an overarching term given to describe the persuasive effects people have on each other. It is seen as a fundamental value in social psychology and overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include: [[conformity]], [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most principles of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.

The first major area of social influence is conformity. Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group, i.e. status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variation among group members plays a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform.&lt;ref name="Aaronson2"/&gt;{{rp|27}} Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.&lt;ref name=Aaronson2&gt;

[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|left|Which line matches the first line, A, B, or C? In the [[Asch conformity experiments]], people frequently followed the majority judgment, even when the majority was (objectively) wrong.]]

The second major area of social influence research is compliance. [[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]] refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person. The [[foot-in-the-door technique]] is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars. A related trick is the [[bait and switch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=R.B|year=2000|title=Influence: Science and Practice|publisher=[[Allyn and Bacon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third major form of social influence is [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person. Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the [[Milgram study]], wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.&lt;ref name=Aaronson2/&gt;{{rp|41}}

An unusual kind of social influence is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true. For example, in the [[stock market]], if it is widely believed that a [[stock market crash|crash]] is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus actually cause the crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their own behavior.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|18}}

===Group dynamics===
{{Main|Group dynamics}}
A [[Social group|group]] can be defined as two or more individuals that are connected to each another by [[interpersonal relationship|social relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D.R|year=2006|title=Group dynamics|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Thomson-Wadworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups tend to interact, influence each other, and share a common identity. They have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from [[wikt:aggregate|aggregates]]:
* [[Norm (sociology)|Norms]]: Implicit rules and expectations for group members to follow, e.g. saying thank you, shaking hands.
* [[Role]]s: Implicit rules and expectations for specific members within the group, e.g. the oldest sibling, who may have additional responsibilities in the family.
* [[Interpersonal relationship|Relations]]: Patterns of liking within the group, and also differences in prestige or status, e.g., leaders, popular people.
Temporary groups and aggregates share few or none of these features, and do not qualify as true social groups. People waiting in line to get on a bus, for example, do not constitute a group.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Groups are important not only because they offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their [[social identity]]. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tajfel|first1=H|last2=Turner|first2=J.C|year=1986|title=The social identity theory of intergroup behavior|editor1-first=S|editor1-last=Worchel|editor2-first=W.G|editor2-last=Austin|encyclopedia=Psychology of Intergroup Relations|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=Nelson-Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society.&lt;ref name=Haidt2003&gt;{{cite journal | last = Haidt | first = Jonathan  | last2 = Rosenberg | first2 = Evan | last3 = Hom | first3 = Holly | year = 2003 | title = Differentiating Diversities: Moral Diversity Is Not Like Other Kinds | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 33 | issue =1 | pages = 1–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb02071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and [[group polarization]] encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.

Groups often moderate and improve [[decision making]],{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and are frequently relied upon for these benefits, such as in committees and juries. A number of group biases, however, can interfere with effective decision making. For example, group polarization, formerly known as the "risky shift," occurs when people polarize their views in a more extreme direction after group discussion. More problematic is the phenomenon of [[groupthink]]. This is a collective thinking defect that is characterized by a premature consensus or an incorrect assumption of consensus, caused by members of a group failing to promote views which are not consistent with the views of other members. Groupthink occurs in a variety of situations, including isolation of a group and the presence of a highly directive leader. Janis offered the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] as a historical case of groupthink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janis|first=I.L|year=1972|title=Victims of Groupthink|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups also affect performance and [[productivity]]. Social facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others. Social facilitation increases the ''[[dominant response]]''{{'}}s likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In contrast, [[social loafing]] is the tendency of individuals to [[slacker|slack off]] when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/05/social-loafing-when-groups-are-bad-for-productivity.php PsyBlog], "Social Loafing: when groups are bad for productivity," 19 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}

Social psychologists study group-related (collective) phenomena such as the behavior of [[crowd]]s. An important concept in this area is [[deindividuation]], a reduced state of [[self-awareness]] that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior. It is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron, R.S., &amp; Kerr, N. L.|title=Group Process, Group Decision, Group Action|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;In the online domain, e.g., see Rosen, L. D., Cheever, N. A., &amp; Carrier, L. M. (2015) The Wiley Handbook of Psychology, Technology and Society. Oxford: Wiley Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soc-psy diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Social psychologists study interactions within [[social group|groups]], and between both groups and individuals.]]

===Interpersonal attraction===
{{Main|Interpersonal attraction}}
A major area in the study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction. This refers to all forces that lead people to like each other, establish relationships, and (in some cases) fall in [[love]]. Several general principles of attraction have been discovered by social psychologists, but many still continue to experiment and do research to find out more.  One of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people are.  The more similar two people are in general attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more probable an attraction is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, D. (1961). ''[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]''. ''62''. pp. 713–715. "Thus Interpersonal attraction and attitude similarity have a direct correlation.  More so than those with dissimilar attitudes and views, who tend to not be as successful in the attraction department."&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is an important element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of [[limerence|passion]]. Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from ''passionate'' to ''companionate''. [[Robert Sternberg]] has suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J|authorlink=Robert Sternberg|year=1986|title=A Triangular Theory of Love|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=93|pages=119–135|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.119|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love.

According to [[social exchange theory]], relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis. If one partner's costs begin to outweigh their benefits, that person may leave the relationship, especially if there are good alternatives available. This theory is similar to the [[minimax principle]] proposed by mathematicians and economists (despite the fact that human relationships are not [[zero-sum game]]s). With time, long term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Research==

===Methods===
Social psychology is an [[empirical]] science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses, both in the laboratory and in the field. Careful attention to sampling, research design, and [[statistics|statistical analysis]] is important; results are published in peer reviewed journals such as the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]''. Social psychology studies also appear in general science journals such as ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.

[[Experiment|Experimental methods]] involve the researcher altering a variable in the environment and measuring the effect on another variable. An example would be allowing two groups of children to play violent or nonviolent videogames, and then observing their subsequent level of aggression during free-play period. A valid experiment is controlled and uses [[random assignment]].

[[Correlation|Correlational methods]] examine the statistical association between two naturally occurring variables. For example, one could correlate the amount of violent television children watch at home with the number of violent incidents the children participate in at school. Note that this study would ''not'' prove that violent TV causes aggression in children: it is quite possible that aggressive children choose to watch more violent TV.

[[Observation|Observational methods]] are purely descriptive and include [[naturalistic observation]], "contrived" observation, participant observation, and archival analysis. These are less common in social psychology but are sometimes used when first investigating a phenomenon. An example would be to unobtrusively observe children on a playground (with a videocamera, perhaps) and record the number and types of aggressive actions displayed.

Whenever possible, social psychologists rely on controlled experimentation. Controlled experiments require the manipulation of one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] in order to examine the effect on a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]. Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in [[internal validity]], meaning that they are free from the influence of [[confounding]] or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in [[external validity]], or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control ([[internal validity]]) and being able to generalize to the population ([[external validity]]).

Because it is usually impossible to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of persons from the wider [[population]]. Social psychologists frequently use [[Statistical survey|survey]] research when they are interested in results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]] to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. However, new statistical methods like [[structural equation modeling]] are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Some psychologists, including Dr. [[David O. Sears]], have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings. Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sears|first=David|year=1986|title=College Sophomores in the Laboratory: Influences of a Narrow Data Base on Social Psychology's View of Human Nature|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–530|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.3.515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of which method has been chosen to be used, the results are of high importance. Results need to be used to evaluate the hypothesis of the research that is done. These results should either confirm or reject the original hypothesis that was predicted.There are two different types of testing social psychologists use in order to test their results. Statistics and probability testing define a [[Statistical significance|significant]] finding that can be as low as 5% or less, likely to be due to chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/ | title=Social Psychology: Definition, History, Methods, Applications - IResearchNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reproducibility|Replications]] are important, to ensure that the result is valid and not due to chance, or some feature of a particular sample. [[False positive]] conclusions, often resulting from the [[Publish or perish|pressure to publish]] or the author's own [[confirmation bias]], are a hazard in the field.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al. (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Simmons| first1 = Joseph|first2 = Leif|last2=Nelson|first3=Uri|last3=Simonsohn| title = False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant| journal = [[Psychological Science]]| volume = 22| issue = 11| pages = 1359–1366| date = November 2011| url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359.full| issn = 0956-7976| doi = 10.1177/0956797611417632| accessdate =29 January 2012| pmid=22006061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
The goal of social psychology is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but the very act of observing people can influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize [[deception]] to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=What about concealment of the existence or purpose of observation?}}

The practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g., [[role-playing]]) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the [[Milgram experiment]] and [[Stanford prison experiment]]), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.

To protect the rights and well-being of research participants, and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an [[ethics|ethical]] review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or [[Institutional Review Board]]. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.

Furthermore, a process of [[informed consent]] is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=How, if there will be portions of the experiment that involve deception?}} and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A [[debriefing]] is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=And what would the response be if they weren't? I would assume offering of psychological counseling...}} Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/undergrad/ptacc/irb-college-guide.pdf|title=THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB): A COLLEGE PLANNING GUIDE|last=COMMITTEE ON ASSOCIATE AND BACCALAUREATE EDUCATION|date=2009|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replication crisis===
{{main|replication crisis}}
Social psychology has recently found itself at the center of a "[[replication crisis]]" due to some research findings proving difficult to replicate.  Replication failures are not unique to social psychology and are found in all fields of science.  However, several factors have combined to put social psychology at the center of the current controversy.

Firstly, [[questionable research practices]] (QRP) have been identified as common in the field.  Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample size or data management, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al. (2011)"/&gt;  Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of QRP are highly prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/questionable-research-practices-surprisingly-common.html|title=Questionable Research Practices Surprisingly Common|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the critics of Daryl Bem in the [[Daryl Bem#.22Feeling the Future.22 controversy|feeling the future controversy]] has suggested that the evidence for precognition in this study could (at least in part) be attributed to QRP.

Secondly, social psychology has found itself at the center of several recent scandals involving outright fraudulent research.  Most notably the admitted data fabrication by [[Diederik Stapel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/129746/|title=Fraud Scandal Fuels Debate Over Practices of Social Psychology: Even legitimate researchers cut corners, some admit|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Christopher|last=Shea|date=13 November 2011|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as allegations against others.  However, most scholars acknowledge that fraud is, perhaps, the lesser contribution to replication crises.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Third, several effects in social psychology have been found to be difficult to replicate even before the current replication crisis. For example, the scientific journal ''[[Society for Judgment and Decision Making#Publications and journal|Judgment and Decision Making]]'' has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the [[unconscious thought theory]]. Replications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioning.

These three elements together have resulted in renewed attention for replication supported by [[Daniel Kahneman]]. Scrutiny of many effects have shown that several core beliefs are hard to replicate. A recent special edition of the journal Social Psychology focused on replication studies and a number of previously held beliefs were found to be difficult to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.is/20140530230728/http://www.psycontent.com/content/l67413865317/?p=3f8268e0307f4036906c158b1667c57a&amp;pi=0 | title=Social Psychology - Volume 45, Number 3 / 2014 - Hogrefe Publishing| date=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 special edition of the journal ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'' also focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion that contribute to the replication crises in psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6.toc|title=Table of Contents: Volume 7, Issue 6, November 2012|work=Perspectives on Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that this replication crisis does not mean that social psychology is unscientific.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Rather this process is a healthy if sometimes acrimonious part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/28/psychology-replication-drive-methods-bullying|title=Psychology's replication drive: it's not about you|journal=The Guardian|first=Pete|last=Etchells|date=28 May 2014|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The consequence is that some areas of social psychology once considered solid, such as social priming, have come under increased scrutiny due to failed replications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Power-of-Suggestion/136907/|title=Power of Suggestion|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Tom|last=Bartlett|date=30 January 2013|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famous experiments===
[[File:Milgram experiment v2.svg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Milgram experiment]]: The experimenter (E) persuades the participant (T) to give what the participant believes are painful electric shocks to another participant (L), who is actually an actor. Many participants continued to give shocks despite pleas for mercy from the actor.]]

The [[Asch conformity experiments]] demonstrated the power of conformity in small groups with a line length estimation task that was designed to be extremely easy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S.E|year=1955|title=Opinions and social pressure|journal=[[Scientific American]]|pages=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In well over a third of the trials, participants conformed to the majority, who had been instructed to provide incorrect answers, even though the majority judgment was clearly wrong. Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experiment.  Additional manipulations to the experiment showed participant conformity decreased when at least one other individual failed to conform, but increased when the individual began conforming or withdrew from the experiment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, participant conformity increased substantially as the number of incorrect individuals increased from one to three, and remained high as the incorrect majority grew.  Participants with three incorrect opponents made mistakes 31.8% of the time, while those with one or two incorrect opponents made mistakes only 3.6% and 13.6% of the time, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Muzafer Sherif]]'s  [[Robbers' Cave Experiment]] divided boys into two competing groups to explore how much hostility and aggression would emerge. Sherif's explanation of the results became known as realistic group conflict theory, because the intergroup conflict was induced through competition over resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherif|first=Muzafer|authorlink=Muzafer Sherif|year=1954|title=Experiments in group conflict|journal=Scientific American|volume=195|issue=5|pages=54–58|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1156-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inducing cooperation and [[superordinate goals]] later reversed this effect.

In [[Leon Festinger]]'s cognitive dissonance experiment, participants were asked to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html|title=Cognitive Dissonance Theory - Simply Psychology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Festinger|first1=Leon|last2=Carlsmith|first2=J.M|year=1959|title= Cognitive consequences of forced compliance|journal=[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]|volume=58|pages=203–211|doi=10.1037/h0041593|issue=2|citeseerx=10.1.1.497.2779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable experiments in social psychology was the [[Milgram experiment]], which studied how far people would go to obey an [[authority]] figure. Following the events of [[The Holocaust]] in World War II, the experiment showed that (most) normal American citizens were capable of following orders from an authority even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stanley|last=Milgram|year=1975|title=Obedience to authority|publisher=Harper and Bros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Bandura]]'s [[Bobo doll experiment]] demonstrated how aggression is learned by [[imitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Ross|first2=D|last3=Ross|first3=S.A|year=1961|title=Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=63|pages=575–582|doi=10.1037/h0045925|pmid=13864605|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of studies fueled debates regarding [[media violence]] which continue to be waged among scholars.

In the [[Stanford prison study]], by [[Philip Zimbardo]], a simulated exercise between student prisoners and guards showed how far people would follow an adopted role. In just a few days, the "guards" became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant. This was initially argued to be an important demonstration of the power of the immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haney|first1=C|last2=Banks|first2=W.C|last3=Zimbardo|first3=Philip G|year=1973|title=Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison|journal=International Journal of Criminology and Penology|volume=1|pages=69–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to this day, it remains a matter of contention what conclusions may be drawn from this study. For example, it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behaviour,&lt;ref name=revisitingSFE&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8125">'''Theoretical linguistics''', or '''general linguistics''', is the branch of [[linguistics]] which inquires into the nature of [[language]] itself and seeks to answer fundamental questions as to what language is; how it works; how [[universal grammar]] (UG) as a domain-specific mental organ operates, if it exists at all; what are its unique properties; how does language relate to other cognitive processes, etc. Theoretical linguists are most concerned with constructing models of linguistic knowledge, and ultimately developing a linguistic theory.

The fields that are generally considered the core of theoretical linguistics are phonology, [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], syntax, and semantics. Although [[phonetics]] often guides phonology, it is often excluded from the purview of theoretical linguistics, along with [[semantics]]. Theoretical linguistics also involves the search for an explanation of linguistic universals, that is, properties that all, or many [[language]]s have in common.

==Terminology==

In the first half of the 20th century, the term "general linguistics" was more common (cf. Ferdinand de Saussure's famous ''Course in General Linguistics''), which could be contrasted with "language-particular linguistics" (which is more often called [[descriptive linguistics]]). Since the 1960s, the term "theoretical linguistics" has typically been used in more or less the same sense as "general linguistics", even though it also contrasts with [[applied linguistics]], and even though it is often said that language description is inherently theoretical. The usual terminology is thus not entirely clear and consistent.

==Major fields==
{{See|grammar|formal grammar|grammar framework}}

===Phonetics===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Phonetics is the study of speech sounds with concentration on three main points :
* Manner of articulation|Articulation: the production of speech sounds in human speech organs.
* [[Perception]] : the way human ears respond to speech signals, how the human brain analyses them.
* Acoustic features : physical characteristics of speech sounds such as, loudness, amplitude, frequency etc.
According to this definition, phonetics can also be called linguistic analysis of human speech at the surface level. That is one obvious difference from [[phonology]], which concerns the structure and organisation of speech sounds in natural languages, and furthermore has a theoretical and abstract nature. One example can be made to illustrate this distinction:
In English, the suffix ''-s'' can represent either {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or can be silent (written Ø) depending on context.
 
====Articulatory phonetics====

The field of [[articulatory phonetics]] is a subfield of phonetics. In studying [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], phoneticians attempt to document how humans produce speech sounds (vowels and consonants). That is, articulatory phoneticians are interested in how the different structures of the vocal tract, called the articulators (tongue, lips, jaw, palate, teeth etc.), interact to create the specific sounds.

====Auditory phonetics====

[[Auditory phonetics]] is a branch of phonetics concerned with the hearing, acquisition and comprehension of phonetic sounds of words of a language.  As articulatory phonetics explores the methods of sound production, auditory phonetics explores the methods of reception—the ear to the brain, and those processes.

====Acoustic phonetics====

[[Acoustic phonetics]] is a subfield of phonetics which deals with acoustic aspects of speech sounds. Acoustic phonetics investigates properties like the mean squared amplitude of a waveform, its duration, its [[fundamental frequency]], or other properties of its frequency spectrum, and the relationship of these properties to other branches of phonetics (e.g. articulatory or auditory phonetics), and to abstract linguistic concepts like phones, phrases, or utterances.

=== Phonology ===
{{See|Phonology}}

[[Phonology]] (sometimes called ''phonemics'' or ''phonematics'') is the study of how sounds are used in languages to convey meaning. Phonology includes topics such as [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

The basic unit of analysis for phonology is called [[phoneme]]. A phoneme is a group of sounds which are not distinguished by the language rules in determining the meaning. In English, for example, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[tʰ]}} are different [[allophone]]s that represent a single phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}.

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of the internal structure of words. For example, in the sentences ''The dog runs'' and ''The dogs run'', the [[word form]]s ''runs'' and ''dogs'' have an affix ''-s'' added, distinguishing them from the base forms ''dog'' and ''run''. Adding this suffix to a [[noun|nominal]] stem gives plural forms, adding it to [[verb]]al stems restricts the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] to third person singular. Some morphological theories operate with two distinct suffixes ''-s'', called [[allomorph]]s of the [[morpheme]]s Plural and Third person singular, respectively. Languages differ with respect to their morphological structure. Along one axis, we may distinguish [[analytic language]]s, with few or no affixes or other morphological processes from [[synthetic language]]s with many affixes. Along another axis, we may distinguish [[agglutinative language]]s, where affixes express one grammatical property each, and are added neatly one after another, from [[fusional language]]s, with non-concatenative morphological processes ([[infixation]], [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]], [[ablaut]], etc.) and/or with less clear-cut affix boundaries.

===Syntax===
[[Syntax]] is the study of language structure and phrasal hierarchies, depicted in [[parse tree]] format. It is concerned with the relationship between units at the level of words or morphology. Syntax seeks to exactly delineate all and only those sentences which make up a given language, using  native speaker intuition. Syntax seeks to formally describe exactly how structural relations between elements (lexical items/words and operators) in a sentence contribute to its interpretation. Syntax uses principles of formal logic and Set Theory to formalize and accurately represent the hierarchical relationship between elements in a sentence. [[Abstract syntax tree]]s are often used to illustrate the hierarchical structures that are posited. Thus, in active declarative sentences in English the subject is followed by the main verb which in turn is followed by the object (SVO). This order of elements is crucial to its correct interpretation and it is exactly this which syntacticians try to capture. They argue that there must be a formal computational component contained within the language faculty of normal speakers of a language and seek to describe it.

===Semantics===
[[Semantics]] is the study of [[intension]], that is, the intrinsic meanings of words and phrases. Much of the work in the field of [[philosophy of language]] is concerned with the relation between meanings and the word, and this concern cross-cuts formal semantics in several ways. For example, both philosophers of language and semanticists make use of propositional, predicate and modal logics to express their ideas about word meaning.

Bryn Mawr and Haverford enjoy an especially close relationship (which students often refer to colloquially as "the Bi-Co"). The two schools share a student newspaper and radio station, and they have a fairly integrated student life. A bus transports students from campus to campus.

The [[Quaker Consortium]] is another consortium which joins the Tri-College with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia.

      <comment>Reverted to revision 855066810 by 213.175.190.163: Thanks, but I think the first sentence is redundant and probably not relevant, the second puzzling - who is he and what did he consider? the Stone of the Pregnant Woman doesn't seem relevant as a see also either.

A '''trilithon''' (or ''trilith'') is a structure consisting of two large vertical stones (posts) supporting a third stone set horizontally across the top (lintel). It is commonly used in the context of [[megalithic]] monuments. The most famous trilithons are those of [[Stonehenge]] in [[England]], those found in the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|Megalithic temples]] of [[Malta]], both of which are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, and the [[Osireion]] in Egypt.

The word ''trilithon'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "having three stones" (''τρι-/tri-'' 'three' + ''λίθος/lithos'' 'stone') and was first used by [[William Stukeley]].

The term also describes the groups of three stones in the [[Hunebed]] tombs of the [[Netherlands]] and the three massive stones forming part of the wall of the Roman Temple of Jupiter at [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]]. Far from [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], another famous trilithon is the [[Ha'amonga 'a Maui|Haʻamonga ʻa Maui]] in [[Tonga]], [[Polynesia]].

[[File:Trilithon of Baalbek 3.jpg|thumb|The 3 blocks known as trilithon in Temple of Jupiter Baal ("Heliopolitan Zeus") in Baalbek, Lebanon.]]
A group of three horizontally lying giant stones, which form part of the podium of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Temple of Jupiter (Roman Heliopolis)|Jupiter temple]] of [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]], are called a "Trilithon", although they do not fit the above definition. The location of the megalithic structures is atop of a hill in the region, known as Tel Baalbek. Numerous archaeological expeditions have gone to the site starting in the 19th century, primarily German and French groups, and research continued into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://gilgamesh42.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/moving-the-stones-of-baalbek-the-wonders-of-roman-engineering/|title = Moving the Stones of Baalbek–The Wonders of Roman Engineering|last = Adair|first = Aaron|website = Fleeing Nergal, Seeking Stars|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one of these stones is 19 metres long, 4.2 metres high, 3.6 metres thick and weighs around 800 tonnes.  The supporting stone layer beneath features a number of stones which weigh an estimated 350 tonnes and are 11 metres wide.&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 52"&gt;{{harvnb|Adam|1977|p = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[quarry]] nearby, [[Stone of the Pregnant Woman|two Roman building blocks]], which were intended for the same podium, surpass 1,000 tonnes. They have not been used since their extraction in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|pp=7–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
