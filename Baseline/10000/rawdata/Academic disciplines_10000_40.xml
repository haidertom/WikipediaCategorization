'''Alessandro Longo''' (31 December 1864 – 3 November 1945) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[composer]] and [[musicology|musicologist]].

==Early life==
Longo was born in [[Amantea]]. After studying at the [[Music conservatories of Naples|Naples Conservatory]] under [[Beniamino Cesi]] (and composition under [[Paolo Serrao]]), he began teaching [[piano]] at his [[alma mater]] in 1887, deputizing for Cesi as pianoforte professor, and succeeded him in 1897.

==Career==
As a pianist, Longo often played in chamber ensemble with the Ferni Quartet, and with the Quartetto Napoletano (with Cantani, Parmiciano, Scarano and Viterbini). He founded various musical institutions in Naples, and gained a high reputation as a concert pianist. In 1914 he began editing the review ''L'Arte Pianistica''.&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph derived from [[Arthur Eaglefield Hull]], ''A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians'' (Dent, London 1924), 87, 303-304.&lt;/ref&gt; He became Director of the Naples Conservatory in 1944, and died in [[Naples]] the following year, aged 80.

==Legacy==
Today, Longo is mainly remembered for compiling an almost comprehensive catalogue of the [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] works of [[Domenico Scarlatti]].  For many years, [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas]] were conventionally identified by their Longo numbers, but these were later superseded by those found in [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]]'s catalogue. Longo's Catalogue originated in his landmark full publication of the works of Scarlatti in 11 volumes&lt;ref&gt;A. Longo, ''545 Scarlatti Sonatas in XI Volumes'' (Ricordi, 1906-1913).&lt;/ref&gt; and implied particular groupings of the sonatas, the chronology of which was later completely revised and differently grouped in Kirkpatrick's 1953 study of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kirkpatrick, ''Domenico Scarlatti'' (Princeton University Press, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; Longo also edited works by [[Domenico Gallo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permanent Link to Catalog Card Entry for Gallo Sonata, attributed to Pergolesi, as Arranged by Longo|publisher=Cornell University|url=https://catalog.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=2004985&amp;DB=local|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His compositions include, among others, two works for piano four-hands, a serenade and a suite;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGraw|first=Cameron|title=Piano Duet Repertoire: Music Originally Written for One Piano, Four Hands|year=1981|pages=174|isbn=0-253-21461-0|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|

'''Anagoge''' (ἀναγωγή), sometimes spelled '''anagogy''', is a Greek word suggesting a "climb" or "ascent" upwards.  The anagogical is a method of [[mystical]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] interpretation of statements or events, especially [[Scriptures|scriptural]] [[exegesis]], that detects allusions to the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22340/anagogical-interpretation Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v. "anagogical interpretation", accessed October 11, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain medieval theologians describe [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|four methods of interpreting the scriptures]]: literal/historical, [[tropological reading|tropological]], [[allegory|allegorical]], and anagogical. [[Hugh of St. Victor]], in ''De scripturis et scriptoribus sacris'', distinguished anagoge, as a kind of allegory, from simple allegory.&lt;ref&gt; "De Scripturis et Scriptoribus Sacris", in ''Hugonis de S. Victore... Opera Omnia'', I (of 3), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JoXYAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Patrologia Latina'' Vol. 175] (J.-P. Migne, 1854), columns 9-28, Chapter III: De triplici intelligentia sacrae Scripturae, at Column 12, loc. B.&lt;/ref&gt; He differentiated in the following way: in a simple allegory, an invisible action is (simply) ''signified'' or ''represented'' by a visible action; Anagoge is that "reasoning upwards" (''sursum ductio''), when, from the visible, the invisible action is ''disclosed'' or ''revealed''.&lt;ref&gt;"... est simplex allegoria, cum per visibile factum aliud invisibile factum significatur. Anagoge, id est sursum ductio, cum per visibile invisibile factum declaratur."&lt;/ref&gt;

The four methods of interpretation point in four different directions: The literal/historical backwards to the past, the allegoric forwards to the future, the tropological downwards to the moral/human, and the anagogic upwards to the spiritual/heavenly.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

'''Andrea Palladio''' ({{IPA-it|anˈdrɛːa palˈlaːdjo}}; 30 November 1508&amp;nbsp;– 19 August 1580) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; architect active in the [[Venetian Republic]]. Palladio, influenced by [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], primarily by [[Vitruvius]], is widely considered to be one of the most influential individuals in the [[Architectural history|history of architecture]]. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura|The Four Books of Architecture]]'', gained him wide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladio.html His conception of classical architecture was heavily influenced by Vitruvian ideas and his mentor Trissino. "Andrea Palladio."]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Vicenza]], with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and the [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are listed together as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Biography==
Palladio was born on 30 November 1508 in [[Padua]] and was given the name, Andrea Di Pietro della Gondola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Houghton Mifflin dictionary of biography |page=1167 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn=0-618-25210-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfesntdNnbwC&amp;lpg=PA1167&amp;pg=PA1167#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Pietro, called "Della Gondola", was a miller. From early on, Andrea Palladio was introduced into the work of building. In Padua he gained his first experiences as a stonecutter in the sculpture workshop of Bartolomeo Cavazza da Sossano, who was the sculptor responsible for the altar in the Church of Santa Maria dei Carmini in Padua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moose|first1=editor, Christina J.|title=Great lives from history.|date=2005|publisher=Salem Press|location=Pasadena, Calif.|isbn=978-1-58765-211-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavazza da Sossano is said to have imposed particularly hard working conditions. At the age of sixteen he moved to Vicenza where he would reside for most of his life. Here he became an assistant in the Pedemuro studio, a leading workshop of stonecutters and masons. He joined a guild of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was employed as a stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures. These sculptures reflected the [[Mannerist]] style of the architect [[Michele Sanmicheli]].

Perhaps the key moment that sparked Palladio's career was being employed by the Humanist poet and scholar, [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], from 1538 to 1539. While Trissino was reconstructing the Villa Cricoli, he took interest in Palladio's work. Trissino was heavily influenced by the studies of Vitruvius, who later influenced Palladio's own ideals and attitudes toward classical architecture. As the leading intellectual in Vicenza, Trissino stimulated the young man to appreciate the arts, sciences, and Classical literature and he granted him the opportunity to study Ancient architecture in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;He visited Rome alongside Trissino in 1541, 1547, and 1554 until 1556. His earlier visits to Rome influenced his designs of palaces. He modeled his designs based on his interpretation of classical architecture he had witnessed. Curl, James Stevens, "A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture", [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Trissino who gave him the name by which he became known, Palladio, an allusion to the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of wisdom [[Athena|Pallas Athene]] and to a character of a play by Trissino. Indeed, the word Palladio means ''Wise one''.&lt;ref&gt;"How I Spent A Few Days in Palladio's World" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 3 March 2009, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123603460173214171?mod=article-outset-box WSJ.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After Trissino's death in 1550, Palladio benefited from the patronage of the Barbaro brothers, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Daniele Barbaro]], who encouraged his studies of [[classical architecture]] and brought him to Rome in 1554, and his younger brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]]. The powerful Barbaros introduced Palladio to [[Venice]], where he finally became "Proto della Serenissima" (chief architect of the Republic of Venice) after [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mostra del Palladio: Vicenza / Basilica Palladiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUk3AQAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Electa|page=46|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Barbaros, the Corner, [[Foscari]], and [[Pisani family|Pisani]] families supported Palladio's career.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice and the Renaissance", Manfredo Tafuri, trans. Jessica Levine, 1989, [[MIT Press]], p.127 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BYaBnsP5PMC Books.Google.com] {{ISBN|0-262-70054-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio began to develop his own architectural style around 1541. The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]], named after him, adhered to classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] principles he rediscovered, applied, and explained in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Palladio knew relatively little about Greek architecture, not yet rediscovered at his times, but he studied deeply the Roman remains during five trips to Rome. His works are heavily influenced by his studies of Greco-Roman architecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio is known to be one of the most influential architects in Western architecture. His architectural works have "been valued for centuries as the quintessence of High Renaissance calm and harmony" (Watkin, D., ''A History of Western Architecture''). He designed many palaces, [[villa]]s, and churches, but Palladio's reputation, initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Burns]], [http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e ''Andrea Palladio (1508–1580)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924065640/http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e |date=24 September 2009 }}, [[Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[palladian villas]] are located mainly in the [[province of Vicenza]], while the ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' are concentrated in the city of [[Vicenza]] and the churches in [[Venice]]. A number of his works are now protected as part of the [[World Heritage Site]] ''[[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]]''. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the ''Venice and its Lagoon'' World Heritage Site.

Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for building the [[loggia]]s for the town hall, known as the [[Basilica Palladiana]], were approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two-storey stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while using classical proportions. The construction was completed in 1617 after Palladio's death.

Aside from Palladio's designs, his publications contributed to ''[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]]''. During the second half of his life, Palladio published many books, above all, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (''The four books of architecture'', Venice, 1570). Palladio is most known for his designs of villas and palaces as well as his books.

The precise circumstances of his death are unknown. Palladio died in 1580,&lt;ref name="Avcioglu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Nebahat Avcioglu|title=Architecture, Art and Identity in Venice and its Territories, 1450–1750: Essays in Honour of Deborah Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOL9i4VXrtkC&amp;pg=PA150|date=23 December 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-1082-5|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; retold in tradition, in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], near [[Treviso]], and was buried in the church of [[Santa Corona]] in Vicenza; since the nineteenth century his tomb has been located in the ''Cimitero Maggiore'' of Vicenza.

Palladio's architecture was not dependent on expensive materials, which must have been an advantage to his more financially pressed clients. Many of his buildings are of brick covered with [[stucco]]. Stuccoed brickwork was always used in his villa designs in order to portray his interpretations of the Roman villa typology.

In the later part of his career, Palladio was chosen by powerful members of Venetian society for numerous important commissions. His success as an architect is based not only on the beauty of his work, but also for its harmony with the culture of his time. His success and influence came from the integration of extraordinary aesthetic quality with expressive characteristics that resonated with his client's social aspirations. His buildings served to communicate, visually, their place in the social order of their culture. This powerful integration of beauty and the physical representation of social meanings is apparent in three major building types: the urban palazzo, the agricultural villa, and the church.

Relative to his trips to Rome, Palladio developed three main palace types by 1556. In 1550, the [[Palazzo Chiericati]] was completed. The proportions for the building were based on musical ratios for adjacent rooms. The building was centralized by a tripartite division of a series of columns or colonnades. In 1552, the [[Palazzo Porto|Palazzo Iseppo Porto]] located in Vicenza was rebuilt incorporating the Roman Renaissance element for façades. A colonnade of Corinthian columns surrounded a main court. The [[Palazzo Antonini]] in Udine, constructed in 1556, had a centralized hall with four columns and service spaces placed relatively toward one side. He uses styles of incorporating the six columns, supported by pediments, into the walls as part of the façade. This technique had been applied in his villa designs as well. Palladio experimented with the plan of the Palazzo Iseppo Porto by incorporating it into the [[Palazzo Thiene]]. It was an earlier project from 1545 to 1550 and remained uncompleted due to elaborate elevations in his designs. He used Mannerist elements such as stucco surface reliefs and large columns, often extending two stories high.

In his urban structures he developed a new improved version of the typical early [[Renaissance]] palazzo (exemplified by the [[Palazzo Strozzi]]). Adapting a new urban palazzo type created by [[Bramante]] in the [[House of Raphael]], Palladio found a powerful expression of the importance of the owner and his social position. The main living quarters of the owner on the second level were clearly distinguished in importance by use of a [[pediment]]ed classical [[portico]], centered and raised above the subsidiary and utilitarian ground level (illustrated in the [[Palazzo Porto]] and the [[Palazzo Valmarana]]). The tallness of the portico was achieved by incorporating the owner's sleeping quarters on the third level, within a [[Giant order|giant]] two-story classical colonnade, a motif adapted from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Capitoline]] buildings in Rome. The elevated main floor level became known as the "[[piano nobile]]", and is still referred to as the "first floor" in Europe.

Palladio also established an influential new building format for the agricultural villas of the Venetian [[aristocracy]]. Palladio's approach to his villa designs was not relative to his experience in Rome. His designs were based on practicality and employed few reliefs. He consolidated the various stand-alone farm outbuildings into a single impressive structure, arranged as a highly organized whole, dominated by a strong center and symmetrical side wings, as illustrated at [[Villa Barbaro]]. In the project of the Villa Barbaro, Palladio most likely was also engaged in the interior decoration. Alongside the painter [[Paolo Veronese]], he invented the complex and sophisticated illusionistic landscape paintings that cover the walls of various rooms.&lt;ref&gt;For the illusionistic landscape paintings and the relationship of Palladio and Veronese see http://www.kunstgeschichte-ejournal.net/329/1/Paolo_Veronese%2C_Andrea_Palladio_und_die_Stanza_di_Baco.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Villa Rotonda]] of 1552, outside Vicenza, was constructed as a summer house with views from all four sides. The plan has centralized circular halls with wings and porticos expanding on all four sides. Palladio began to implement the classical temple front into his design of façades for villas. He felt that to make an entry appear grand, the Roman temple front would be the most suitable style. The Palladian villa configuration often consists of a centralized block raised on an elevated [[podium]], accessed by grand steps, and flanked by lower service wings, as at [[Villa Foscari]] and [[Villa Badoer]]. This format, with the quarters of the owners at the elevated center of their own world, found resonance as a prototype for Italian villas and later for the country estates of the British nobility (such as [[Lord Burlington]]'s [[Chiswick House]], Vanbrugh's [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]], Walpole's [[Houghton Hall]], and Adam's [[Kedleston Hall]] and [http://www.paxtonhouse.co.uk/ Paxton House] in Scotland). His villas were used by a capitalist gentry who developed an interest in agriculture and land. The configuration was a perfect architectural expression of their worldview, clearly expressing their perceived position in the social order of the times. His influence was extended worldwide into the [[British colonies]]. Palladio developed his own prototype for the plan of the villas that was flexible to moderate in scale and function. The Palladian villa format was easily adapted for a democratic worldview, as may be seen at [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and his arrangement for the [[University of Virginia]]. It also may be seen applied as recently as 1940 in Pope's [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington D.C., where the public entry to the world of high culture occupies the exalted center position. The [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] of exposed [[basement]] walls of Victorian residences is a late remnant of the Palladian format, clearly expressed as a podium for the main living space for the family.

Similarly, Palladio created a new configuration for the design of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] churches that established two interlocking architectural orders, each clearly articulated, yet delineating a hierarchy of a larger order overriding a lesser order. This idea was in direct coincidence with the rising acceptance of the theological ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], who postulated the notion of two worlds existing simultaneously: the divine world of faith, and the earthly world of humans.  Palladio created an architecture which made a visual statement communicating the idea of two superimposed systems, as illustrated at [[San Francesco della Vigna]]. In a time when religious dominance in Western culture was threatened by the rising power of science and [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], this architecture found great favor with the Catholic Church as a clear statement of the proper relationship of the earthly and the spiritual worlds.

==Influence==
[[File:Palladio Titel 1642.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture)]]

[[File:Frontispiece Campbell's edition of Palladio's First Book of Architecture 1728.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Colen Campbell]]'s edition of Palladio's ''First Book of Architecture'', published at London, 1728]]

Although his buildings are all in a relatively small part of Italy, Palladio's influence was far-reaching. One factor in the spread of his influence was the publication in 1570 of his architectural treatise, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture), which set out rules others could follow. The first book includes studies of decorative styles, classical orders, and materials. The second book included Palladio's town and country house designs and classical reconstructions. The third book has bridge and basilica designs, city planning designs, and classical halls. The fourth book included information on the reconstruction of ancient Roman temples. Before this landmark publication, architectural drawings by Palladio had appeared in print as illustrations to [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s "Commentary" on [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Clini "Vitruvius' Basilica at Fano: The drawings of a lost building from 'De Architectura Libri Decem'" The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Vol. XXXIV, Part 5/W12 pp121 – 126 2002 [http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf ISPRS.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517124924/http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf |date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in his style was renewed in later generations and became fashionable throughout Europe, for example in parts of the [[Loire Valley]] of France. In Britain, [[Inigo Jones]], [[Elizabeth Wilbraham]], and [[Christopher Wren]] embraced the Palladian style. In his [[Italian Journey]], [[Johann von Goethe]] describes Palladio as a genius, commending his unfinished Convent of Saint Maria della Carita as the most perfect existing work of architecture. Another admirer was the architect, [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], 4th [[Earl of Cork]], also known as [[Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], who, with [[William Kent]], designed [[Chiswick House]]. The influence of Palladio even spread to America. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Dawes]] much admired that style of architecture, and the United States Capitol building is an example of a slightly evolved version of Palladio's works. The One Hundred Eleventh [[Congress of the United States of America]] called him the "Father of American Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcadoc.it/english/news/Palladio-Father-of-American-Architecture.htm|title=The US Congress: 'Palladio, the Father of American Architecture'|website=www.marcadoc.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Congressional Resolution no. 259 of 6 December 2010). Exponents of Palladianism include the eighteenth century [[Venice|Venetian]] architect, [[Giacomo Leoni]], who published an authoritative four-volume work on Palladio and his architectural concepts.

More than 330 of Palladio's original drawings and sketches still survive in the collections of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx Collecting Palladio's drawings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192605/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of which originally were owned by Inigo Jones. Jones collected a significant number of these on his Grand Tour of 1613–1614, while some were a gift from [[Henry Wotton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx Inigo Jones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192618/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a nonprofit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio's influence in the architecture of the United States.

In 2010, the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] created an exhibition dedicated solely to Palladio and his legacy. The exhibition, titled ''Palladio and His Legacy: A Transatlantic Journey'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710002925/http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |archivedate=10 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was open to the public until January 2011.

'''Bareback sex''' is physical [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[sexual penetration]], without the use of a [[condom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Partridge |first1=Eric |year=2006|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I |first2=Tom |last2=Dalzell |first3=Terry |last3=Victor|edition=reprint |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-25937-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YfsEgHLjboC |quote=Bareback - to engage in sex without a condom.|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; It most commonly refers to [[anal sex]] between [[men who have sex with men]] without the use of a condom, and may be distinguished from [[unprotected sex]] because of the deliberate act of forgoing condom use that is associated with it.&lt;ref name="Drescher"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Jack Drescher, Perry Halkitis, Leo Wilton| title =Barebacking: Psychosocial and Public Health Approaches|publisher =[[CRC Press]]|year = 2006|pages=150–151|accessdate = September 11, 2016| isbn = 978-0789021748|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DR4x0gJcsTUC&amp;pg=PA150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggleton"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Peter Aggleton, Richard Parker| title =Routledge Handbook of Sexuality, Health and Rights|publisher =[[Routledge]]|year = 2010|pages=391–393|accessdate = September 11, 2016| isbn = 978-1135272876|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=mlmOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[slang]] term, ''bareback sex'' comes from the [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] term ''[[bareback riding|bareback]],'' which refers to the practice of riding a [[horse]] without a [[saddle]].

==Etymology==
It is not known when the term (as sexual slang) was first used, although its use did gain momentum in the 1960s with the first appearance in print (as analogous reference) occurring in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Bernard and Joseph Bensman|title=Sexual Patterns in Three Ethnic Subcultures of an American Underclass|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=1968|issue=376|page=70|quote=Risk or no risk, boys are generally hostile to the idea of prophylaxis. One objection is phrased purely in terms of the pleasure principle, most colorfully by a Chicago boy who explains why he never uses anything like a rubber, ‘I tried it once. lt's like riding a horse with a saddle instead of bareback.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was used by [[G.I. (military)|G.I.'s]] during the [[Vietnam War]] when sex without the use of a condom was known as "going in" or "riding" bareback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Gregory R.|title=Words of the Vietnam War: the Slang, Jargon. . .[etc.]|date=1990|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0899504650|page=437|quote=(under “Ride Bareback”) “GI slang for having sexual intercourse without using a condom. See also p. 66 (under “Boom-Boom”) “A GI that had his sex without the use of a condom was known as ‘going in’ or ‘riding’ bareback.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was included in the 1972 publication, ''Playboy's Book of Forbidden Words: A Liberated Dictionary of Improper English''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Robert Anton|title=Playboy's Book of Forbidden Words: A Liberated Dictionary of Improper English|date=1972|publisher=Playboy Press|page=20|quote=BAREBACK - Intercourse without any form of contraception, as in "They went at it bareback."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appeared occasionally in print until the 1980s and then in context to the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|AIDS epidemic]] and the discussion of sexual practices. It did not have widespread use in [[LGBT culture]] until 1997, when there was an increase of discussion regarding condomless sex (as reflected in print publications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peyser|first1=Marc|title=A Deadly Dance: As AIDS Cases Decline Sharply, Some Gay Men Are Returning to Unsafe Sex. They Call It Barebacking|journal=Newsweek|date=September 29, 1997|volume=130|issue=13|page=136|quote=See also The Advocate (Jul 8, 1997) p. 34 (and other various references in 1997; Out [Magazine] (6:1-6) 1997 (various references throughout.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and culture==
{{Further|Condom}}
Initially used for [[contraception|contraceptive]] purposes, condoms also came to be used to limit or prevent [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), even after other contraceptive methods were developed. As [[AIDS]] emerged and the sexual transmission of [[HIV]] became known in the 1980s, the use of condoms to prevent infection became much more widespread, especially among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) who engage in [[anal sex]]. At the beginning of the AIDS crisis, in the context of the invention and development of [[safe sex]], the uptake of condoms among Western MSM was so widespread and effective that condom use became established as a norm for sex between men. From 1995, several high-profile HIV positive men{{who|date=April 2012}} declared their refusal to wear condoms with other HIV positive men in gay publications, dubbing the practice ''barebacking.'' While these early articulations of barebacking expressed a concern for HIV prevention, in that they generally referred to dispensing with condoms in the context of sex between people of the same HIV status, the [[moral panic]] which ensued was so pronounced that barebacking came to be framed as a rebellious and transgressive erotic practice for HIV positive and HIV negative people alike, irrespective of the risks of HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="Race 2010"&gt;{{citation |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Engaging in a Culture of Barebacking: Gay Men and the Risk of HIV Prevention|journal=HIV Treatment and Prevention Technologies in International Perspective |isbn=978-0-230-23819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurgence and stigma===

A resurgence of barebacking in first-world gay communities during the 1990s has been a frequent topic for gay columnists and editorialists in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', [[Genre magazine|''Genre'' magazine]], and [[Out Magazine|''Out'' magazine]].&lt;ref name=Finlayson1998&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Human Condition: Johnny be good |last=Finlayson |first=Iain |authorlink=Iain Finlayson |date=21 June 1998 |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-human-condition-johnny-be-good-1166398.html |quote=Whatever happened to that condom moment? 'Bareback', or unprotected, sex is still practiced by up to a third of gay men - because, despite the dangers, it feels liberated, sensuous and like one in the eye for 'sex police'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these articles express concern over bareback sex's popularity, and liken it to irresponsible and reckless behavior, despite the fact that a third of gay men take part in the practice.&lt;ref name=Finlayson1998/&gt; An article in the online resource ''The Body'' lists no fewer than 22 reasons why barebacking has become increasingly acceptable in the gay community.&lt;ref name=sowadsky&gt;See Rick Sowadsky, "Barebacking in the Gay Community," [http://www.thebody.com/content/art2276.html The Body] (May, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons listed are: the recent perception of HIV as a treatable illness one can live with, insufficient sex education, use of drugs such as crystal meth in sexual settings, and fetishization of bareback sex on various porn and dating sites.

Academic works suggest that barebacking is a way to reach for transcendence, to overcome the boredom of everyday average life in a hyper-rationalized society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Holmes |first=Dave |year=2006 |title=Raw Sex as Limit Experience: A Foucauldian Analysis of Unsafe Anal Sex between Men |last2=O'Byrne |first2=Patrick |last3=Gastaldo |first3=Denise |journal=Social Theory &amp; Health |pages=319–333 |volume=4.4 |issue=4 |issn=1477-8211 |oclc=366722101 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.sth.8700077}} and {{citation |last=Martin |first=James |year=2006 |title=Transcendence Among Gay Men: Implications for HIV Prevention |journal=Sexualities |pages=214–235 |volume=9.2 |issue=2 |issn=1363-4607 |oclc=441346802 |doi=10.1177/1363460706058398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men are dispensing with condoms in the context of seroconcordant sex (sex between two men of the same HIV status). Early articulations of barebacking generally refer to sex between two HIV-positive men. This poses no risk of infecting an HIV-negative person newly with HIV (though it can cause [[HIV superinfection|infection with a new strain of HIV]], hastening disease progression). On this account, barebacking could be considered an early harm reduction strategy, similar to [[serosorting]], which was later endorsed by some public health authorities in the USA.&lt;ref name="Race 2010"/&gt;

Bareback sex has also become more acceptable since the introduction of [[pre exposure prophylaxis]] (PrEP). One of the most popular forms of PrEP is [[Truvada]], a medication previously taken for HIV treatment that, when taken properly, has been shown to prevent HIV-negative users from contracting HIV from infected partners. While these drugs do not necessarily prevent the transmission of other STIs, they have stirred a discussion on what "safe" sex without the use of condoms really entails.

A 2005 study by Perry N. Halkitis concluded that the resurgence of barebacking led to an increase in sexually transmitted infections among the MSM community. The study found that of the 448 men who were familiar with barebacking, nearly half reported they had bareback sex in the last three months. In the San Francisco study, fewer men reported engaging in barebacking when the behavior was defined as intentional unprotected anal intercourse with a non-primary partner. Using this definition, 14% of the 390 men who were aware of barebacking reported engaging in the behavior in the past two years. Halkitis and Richard Wolitski also found that HIV-positive MSM were more likely to have bareback sex than were HIV-negative MSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Halkitis PN, Drescher J, Wilton L |title=Barebacking: psychosocial and public health approaches |journal=Gay and Lesbian Psychotherapy |volume=9 |issue=3/4 |pages=14–15 |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7890-2174-8 |doi=10.1300/j236v09n03_01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study by Joseph Brennan used textual analysis to read discourse on gay pornography performer Jake Lyons and his decision to perform for bareback studios. Brennan explored the stigma attached to the practice, in particular narratives of 'disposal and disgust' that became associated with the performer, and contributed to a decline in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Joseph|title=‘Bare-backing spoils everything. He's spoiled goods’: Disposal and disgust, a study of retired power bottom twink Jake Lyons|journal=Porn Studies|date=2016|volume=3|issue=1|pages=20–33|doi=10.1080/23268743.2015.1074867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bugchasing===

An extreme form of barebacking is [[bugchasing]], in which seronegative gay men actively seek to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="Drescher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Freeman, "In Search of Death," ''Rolling Stone'', January 23, 2003 https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023402/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers; Gemma Aldridge, "Bug chasing: Men deliberately trying to catch HIV for sexual thrill in astonishing craze", ''Mirror'', July 7, 2013, https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bug-chasing-men-deliberately-trying-2033433&lt;/ref&gt; These men may seek to contract HIV in order to not have to constantly live in fear of becoming infected.&lt;ref name="Drescher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Brandon Andrew. 2014. "Barebacking with Weber: Re-enchanting the Rational Sexual Order." Social Theory &amp; Health 12: 235-250. DOI: 10.1057/sth.2014.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay pornographic films===
Bareback [[gay pornography]] was standard in "pre-condom" films from the 1970s and early 1980s. As awareness of the risk of AIDS developed, pornography producers came under pressure to use condoms, both for the health of the performers and to serve as role models for their viewers. By the early 1990s new pornographic videos usually featured the use of condoms for anal sex. However, beginning in the 1990s, an increasing number of studios have been devoted to the production of new films featuring men engaging in unprotected sex.&lt;ref name=hivscandalbbc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7277000.stm|title=HIV scandal in gay porn industry|first=Madeleine|last=Holt|work=[[BBC]]|date=4 March 2008|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[San Francisco]]-based studio [[Treasure Island Media]], whose work focuses in this area, has produced bareback films since 1999. Other companies that do so include [[Spunk Video]], [[Lucas Entertainment]], SEVP, and [[Eurocreme]]. Mainstream gay pornographic studios such as [[Kristen Bjorn]] Productions have featured the occasional bareback scene such as in "El Rancho" between performers who are real-life partners. Other studios such as [[Falcon Entertainment]] and Spunk Video have also reissued older pre-condom films.&lt;ref&gt;"Bareback Classics" (FVS 301) is an example of such a re-issue by Falcon. For Spunk Video reissues, see Christopher Rage.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, mainstream studios that consistently use condoms for anal sex scenes may sometimes choose editing techniques that make the presence of condoms somewhat ambiguous and less visually evident, and thus may encourage viewers to fantasize that barebacking is taking place, even though the performers are following safer-sex protocols. (In contrast, some mainstream directors use close-up shots of condom packets being opened, etc., to help clearly establish for the viewer that the sex is not bareback.)

Some bareback pornography studios say that they do not inquire whether their models are HIV positive, but assume that they are infected. For example, Hot Desert Knights (HDK) was one of the studios that initially operated on the assumption that all of their bareback models were HIV positive.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Adams, "The Adams Report: The GayVN Awards Show Highlights" (2002), quotes Jackson Price, the then director of casting for HDK, as saying, "we assume everyone is positive," and as implying that HDK did not require disclosure of any model's HIV status. (This report no longer appears to be available online.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2008 HDK announced that it would begin testing its models for HIV and engage in a process of "sero-sorting", which match HIV-positive performers with other HIV-positive performers, and negative with negative. Critics suggest that sero-sorting may not prevent the development of a multi-strain HIV [[HIV superinfection|"superinfection"]]. By contrast, [[BelAmi]] is one of the studios that claimed from the beginning to test their bareback models for HIV before allowing them to participate in condom-free scenes. A notice on the BelAmi website states: "all our performers are regularly tested for the presence of HIV or other communicable diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belamionline.com/vodstore/condomfree.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731202409/http://www.belamionline.com/vodstore/condomfree.asp|title=BelAmi Video On Demand|archivedate=31 July 2008|work=belamionline.com|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] was formed to promote and facilitate STD testing and safety precautions among pornographic film actors.

==Heterosexual bareback==
The term ''bareback sex'' is used less frequently among heterosexuals.&lt;ref name="aids.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aids.about.com/od/safersexresources/a/barebacking.htm|title=Link Between HIV Infection and Barebacking|author=Mark Cichocki, R.N.|work=About.com Health|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] found that heterosexual women are more likely to bareback when engaging in anal sex than homosexual and bisexual men are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/04/23/survey-finds-more-straight-women-barebacking-than-gay-men/|title=Survey finds more straight women barebacking than gay men|work=PinkNews|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosexual bareback sex, as opposed to [[safe sex]] with condoms, poses an increased risk of STIs whether vaginally or anally, and an increased risk of [[pregnancy]].

== Health risks ==
In addition to sexually transmitted infections, mechanical trauma are the same as in [[anal sex]]. Unprotected anal sex is a risk factor for formation of [[antisperm antibodies]] (ASA) in the recipient. In some people, ASA may cause autoimmune [[infertility]]. Antisperm antibodies impair fertilization, negatively affect the [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] process and impair growth and development of the [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Restrepo|first=B.|last2=Cardona-Maya|first2=W.|date=October 2013|title=Antisperm antibodies and fertility association|journal=Actas Urologicas Espanolas|volume=37|issue=9|pages=571–578|doi=10.1016/j.acuro.2012.11.003|issn=1699-7980|pmid=23428233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfK8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA311|title=Principles &amp; Practice of Assisted Reproductive Technology (3 Vols)|last=Rao|first=Kamini|date=2013-09-30|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|year=|isbn=9789350907368|location=|pages=311|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">The '''Bass Model''' or '''Bass Diffusion Model''' was developed by [[Frank Bass]].  It consists of a simple [[differential equation]] that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population. The model presents a rationale of how current adopters and potential adopters of a new product interact. The basic premise of the model is that adopters can be classified as [[innovators]] or as imitators and the speed and timing of adoption depends on their degree of innovativeness and the degree of imitation among adopters. The Bass model has been widely used in [[forecasting]], especially new products' [[sales forecasting]] and [[technology forecasting]]. Mathematically, the basic Bass diffusion is a [[Riccati equation]] with constant coefficients.

In 1969, Frank Bass published his paper on a new product growth model for consumer durables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Management Science |accessdate=September 22, 2016 |volume=50 |issue=12 |pages=1833–1840 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.1976&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |title=Comments on "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables": The Bass Model |first=Frank M. |last=Bass |year=2004 |quote=Perhaps the first thing to notice about the paper that has come to be known as the "Bass Model" (Bass 1969) is the title. It contains a typo. The paper was published with the title: "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables." The correct title should be: "A New Product Growth Model for Consumer Durables." |doi=10.1287/mnsc.1040.0300}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1833}}&lt;ref name="Bass1969"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bass |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Bass  |year=1969 |title= A new product growth for model consumer durables |journal=Management Science |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=215–227 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1287/mnsc.15.5.215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this, [[Everett Rogers]] published ''Diffusion of Innovations'', a highly influential work that described the different stages of product adoption. Bass contributed some mathematical ideas to the concept.&lt;ref name="MgtScienceDec2004"&gt;''Management Science'' 50 Number 12 Supplement, Dec 2004 {{issn|0025-1909}} p1833-1840&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model formulation==
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = p + q F(t)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;\ f(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the change of the installed base fraction
* &lt;math&gt;\ F(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the installed base fraction
* &lt;math&gt;\ p &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of innovation
* &lt;math&gt;\ q &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of imitation

Sales &lt;math&gt;\ S(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of installed base (i.e. adoption) &lt;math&gt;\ f(t) &lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the ultimate market potential &lt;math&gt;\ m &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ S(t)=mf(t) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ S(t)=m{ \frac{(p+q)^2}{p}} \frac{e^{-(p+q)t}}{(1+\frac{q}{p}e^{-(p+q)t})^2} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

The time of peak sales &lt;math&gt;\ t^* &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\ t^*=\frac{\ln q - \ln p}{p+q} &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

===Explanation===
The coefficient ''p'' is called the coefficient of innovation, external influence or advertising effect.  The coefficient q is called the coefficient of imitation, internal influence or word-of-mouth effect.

Typical values of ''p'' and ''q'' when time ''t'' is measured in years:&lt;ref name="Empirical Generalizations"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahajan |first=Vijay |author2=Muller, Eitan |author3=Bass, Frank |year=1995 |title=Diffusion of new products: Empirical generalizations and managerial uses |journal=Marketing Science |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=G79–G88 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1287/mksc.14.3.G79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The average value of ''p'' has been found to be 0.03, and is often less than 0.01
*The average value of ''q'' has been found to be 0.38, with a typical range between 0.3 and 0.5

==Extensions to the model==
===Generalised Bass model (with pricing)===

Bass found that his model fit the data for almost all product introductions, despite a wide range of managerial decision variables, e.g. pricing and advertising.  This means that decision variables can shift the Bass curve in time, but that the shape of the curve is always similar.

Although many extensions of the model have been proposed, only one of these reduces to the Bass model under ordinary circumstances.&lt;ref name=Bass1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bass|first=Frank M.|author2=Trichy V. Krishnan |author3=Dipak C. Jain |title=Why the Bass Model Fits without Decision Variables|journal=Marketing Science|date=1994|volume=13|issue=2|pages=203–223|doi=10.1287/mksc.13.3.203}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[image:Bass diffusion model.svg|right]] This model was developed in 1994 by Frank Bass, Trichy Krishnan and Dipak Jain:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = (p + {q}F(t)) x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ x(t) &lt;/math&gt; is a function of percentage change in price and other variables

===Successive generations===
Technology products succeed one another in generations.  Norton and Bass extended the model in 1987 for sales of products with continuous repeat purchasing.  The formulation for three generations is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=John A.|author2=Frank M. Bass|title=A Diffusion Theory Model of Adoption and Substitution for Successive Generations of High-Technology Products|journal=Management Science|date=1987|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1069–1086|doi=10.1287/mnsc.33.9.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{1,t} = F(t_1) m_1 (1-F(t_2)) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{2,t} = F(t_2) (m_2 + F(t_1) m_1 ) (1-F(t_3)) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{3,t} = F(t_3) (m_3 + F(t_2) (m_2 + F(t_1) m_1 )) &lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;\ m_i = a_i M_i &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ M_i &lt;/math&gt; is the incremental number of ultimate adopters of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ a_i &lt;/math&gt; is the average (continuous) repeat buying rate among adopters of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ t_i &lt;/math&gt; is the time since the introduction of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ F(t_i) = \frac{1-e^{-(p+q)t_i}}{1+\frac{q}{p} e^{-(p+q)t_i}} &lt;/math&gt;

It has been found that the p and q terms are generally the same between successive generations.

===Relationship with other s-curves===
There are two special cases of the Bass diffusion model.

*The first special case occurs when q=0, when the model reduces to the [[Exponential distribution]].
*The second special case reduces to the [[logistic distribution]], when p=0.

The Bass model is a special case of the Gamma/[[shifted Gompertz distribution]] (G/SG): Bemmaor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Bemmaor | given=Albert C. | year= 1994 |pages=201–223| chapter=Modeling the Diffusion of New Durable Goods: Word-of-Mouth Effect Versus Consumer Heterogeneity | editor=G. Laurent, G.L. Lilien &amp; B. Pras | title=Research Traditions in Marketing | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | place=Boston| isbn=0-7923-9388-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1994) 

'''Use in online social networks'''
The rapid, recent (as of early 2007) growth in online social networks (and other [[virtual communities]]) has led to an increased use of the Bass diffusion model.  The Bass diffusion model is used to estimate the size and growth rate of these social networks. The work by Christian Bauchkage and co-authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last= |first= |author-link= |eprint=1406.6529 |title=Strong Regularities in Growth and Decline of Popularity of Social Media Services|class= cs.SI|date= |last1= Bauckhage|first1= Christian|last2= Kersting|first2= Kristian|year= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the Bass model provides a more pessimistic picture of the future than alternative model(s) such as the Weibull distribution and the shifted Gompertz distribution.

==Adoption of this Model ==
The model is one of the most cited empirical generalizations in marketing; as of October 2018 the paper "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables" published in Management Science had (approximately) 8499 citations in Google Scholar&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C45&amp;q=A+New+Product+Growth+for+Model+Consumer+Durables&amp;btnG=&lt;/ref&gt;. 

This model has been widely influential in marketing and management science.  In 2004 it was selected as one of the ten most frequently cited papers in the 50-year history of ''Management Science''.&lt;ref name=MgtScienceDec2004 /&gt;  It was ranked number five, and the only marketing paper in the list.  It was subsequently reprinted in the December 2004 issue of Management Science.&lt;ref name=MgtScienceDec2004 /&gt;

{{other uses|Blackwater (disambiguation)}}

'''Blackwater''' is used to describe [[wastewater]] from toilets, which likely contains [[pathogen]]s.  Blackwater can contain [[feces]], [[urine]], water and toilet paper from [[flush toilet]]s. Blackwater is distinguished from [[greywater]], which comes from household use other than toilets.  Greywater results from washing food, clothing, dishes, as well as from showering or bathing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd Revised |author1=Tilley, E.|author2=Ulrich, L.|author3=Lüthi, C.|author4=Reymond, Ph.|author5=Zurbrügg, C.|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwater and greywater are separated in "ecological buildings", such as [[autonomous building]]s. [[Recreational vehicle]]s often have separate holding tanks for greywater from showers and sinks, and blackwater from the toilet.

==Definition==
According to one source:

{{quote|Blackwater is the mixture of [[urine]], [[human feces|feces]] and flushwater along with [[anal cleansing]] water (if water is used for cleansing) and/or dry cleansing materials. Blackwater contains the pathogens of faeces and the nutrients of urine that are diluted in the flushwater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Water coming from domestic equipment other than toilets (e.g., bathtubs, showers, sinks, washing machines) is called greywater. In some sanitation systems, it is preferred to keep the greywater separate from blackwater to reduce the amount of water that gets heavily polluted and to simplify treatment methods for the greywater.

Blackwater is a term dating to at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT3915857&amp;id=poY7AAAAEBAJ US Patent 3915857], issued in October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment processes==
Blackwater contains pathogens that must decompose before they can be released safely into the environment.  It is difficult to process blackwater if it contains a large quantity of excess water, or if it must be processed quickly, because of the high concentrations of organic material.  

=== Composting ===
However, if blackwater does not contain excess water, or if it receives primary treatment to de-water, then it is easily processed through [[composting]].  The heat produced by naturally occurring [[thermophilic]] microorganisms will heat the compost to over {{convert|60|C|F}}, and destroy potential pathogens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Blackwater generation can be avoided by making use of [[composting toilet]]s and [[vermifilter]] toilets. In certain autonomous buildings, such as [[earthship]]s, this is almost always present and allows the water requirements of the building (which, with earthships, are self-generated) to be heavily reduced. Besides saving water, composting toilets allow the user to reuse the nutrients found therein (e.g., for growing crops/trees).

'''CLEAPSS''' is an advisory service providing support in [[science]] and [[technology]] for a consortium of [[local authorities]] and their schools including establishments for pupils with [[special needs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CLEAPSS|url=http://www.cleapss.org.uk/about-cleapss|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Independent school]]s, post-16 colleges, teacher training establishments, curriculum developers and others can apply for associate membership. CLEAPSS offers help from nursery education through to A-level studies or equivalent.

CLEAPSS first started in 1963 as '''CLEAPSE''' (Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Equipment). In 1988 the name was changed to CLEAPSS ('''Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Services''') to reflect a change of emphasis from equipment to a range of services. Since then, [[Local Education Authorities]] became Local Authorities (LAs) and CLEAPSS' services expanded to include [[D&amp;T]], so CLEAPSS was registered as a [[Trade Mark]]. CLEAPSS is now simply a name and not an acronym.

CLEAPSS is based at the [[Brunel University]] Science Park in [[Uxbridge]].

== Career ==
She first thought of becoming a sex surrogate partner after reading ''Surrogate Wife: The Story of a Masters &amp; Johnson Sexual Therapist and the Nine Cases She Treated'' by Valerie Scott. In 1973 she took San Francisco Sex Information's (SFSI) training, and was a member of their training staff for 20 years. She studied the work of [[Masters and Johnson]], and works with many of the San Francisco Bay Area's premiere [[sex therapist]]s.

Cohen Greene is a certified Clinical Sexologist and a sex surrogate partner. Her official title is Surrogate Partner Therapist. She is a  member of IPSA (International Professional Surrogates Association). In October 2004 she received her 'Doctorate in Human Sexuality' from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco. She has stated about her profession: "People have asked me over the years, 'How do you work with people who are differently abled?' I always say, it's not hard for me. I just have to learn what their special needs are." She has appeared on shows like ''[[Larry King Live]]'', the ''[[Joy Behar Show]]'' and ''[[The Jeff Probst Show]]'' discussing her profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/the-reel-breakdown/adams-reel-women-cheryl-cohen-greene-helen-hunt-232704955.html | contribution = Adams on Reel Women: Cheryl Cohen Greene and Helen Hunt fete ‘The Sessions’ | title = The Reel Breakdown | publisher = Yahoo!

'''Chicana feminism''', also called '''Xicanisma''',&lt;ref&gt;IRL
From Chicano to Xicanx: A brief history of a political and cultural identity&lt;/ref&gt; is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical, cultural, spiritual, educational, and economic intersections of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women that identify as [[Chicano|Chicana]]. Chicana feminism challenges the stereotypes that Chicanas face across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality. Most importantly, Chicana feminism serves as a movement, theory and praxis that helps women reclaim their existence between and among the [[Chicano Movement]] and [[Feminism in the United States|American feminist movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1997|isbn=9780415918015|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Emerging out of the identity movements of the 1960s, Chicana feminists created a distinctive trajectory and mapping of feminist political thought and practice that centered their unique experiences with gender, race, class and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;"The Research Context", by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Since many feminist methodologies are similar in practice, Chicana feminists distinguished themselves from other feminists by centering their unique lived experiences with gender, race, class, sexuality and nationalism – offering critiques and responses to their exclusion from both the mainstream Chicano nationalist movement and the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist movement]]. One important way they were able to do this was through the inclusion of different varieties of the Spanish language, a vital component to the preservation of Chicano/a culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurtado|first=Aída|title=Sitios y lenguas: Chicanas theorize feminisms|journal=Hypatia|volume=13|issue=2|pages=134–161|doi=10.2979/HYP.1998.13.2.134|issn=0887-5367|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminism maintains that throughout history, women have been oppressed, and sometimes even abused, in many different societies. In Latin America, just as in Europe, Asia and Africa, many women were, for centuries, treated by their fathers, brothers and husbands with discrimination. Women in Latin America, Mexico included, were seen as child-bearers, homemakers, and caregivers. These women had to watch their children, perform household chores, and cook for their husbands. Many men did not consider women to be capable of working outside the home, which is part of the reason why the term "weaker sex" was coined.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In Latin America, women at those times had to act according to some social standards. In many Latin American cities, for example, women were not seen with good eyes if they spoke to men they did not know. Meanwhile, [[prostitution]], for example, was legal in many Latin American areas, and men were not criticized, but rather seen as heroic, if they had several girlfriends, even if the man was married.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1848, with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Mexico ceded to the US: Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and part of Colorado and Wyoming.  Former citizens of Mexico living in those territories became US citizens.

During the twentieth century, Hispanic [[immigration]] to the United States began to slowly but steadily change American demographics. By 1940, [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] was one of the cities with the largest group of Chicanos in the United States.

Euro-American women also had their own problems: they were also stereotyped as homemakers, caregivers, and child-bearers. Unlike women of minority races, however, white women largely evaded dealing with [[racism]], unless they or their husbands befriended people of Black or Hispanic background. Euro-American women combated this with the emergence of waves of feminism, the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] addressed suffrage while the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] discussed issues of sexuality, private vs. the public sphere, reproductive rights, and marital rape.

=== Origin ===
Chicana feminists challenged their prescribed role in ''la familia'', and demanded to have the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] experiences that they faced recognized. Chicanas identify as being consciously aware, self-determined, proud of their roots, heritage, and experience while prioritizing [[La Raza]]. With the emergence of the Chicano Movement, the structure of Chicano families saw dramatic changes. Specifically, women began to question the role that they were assigned within the family and where their place was within the Chicano national struggle.&lt;ref name="garcia217-238"&gt;Garcia, A. M. (June 1, 1989). The Development of Chicana Feminist Discourse, 1970-1980. Gender and Society, 3, 2, 217-238.&lt;/ref&gt; In the seminal text, La Chicana by Elizabeth Martinez, Martinez writes: “She [La Chicana]  is oppressed by the forces of racism, [[imperialism]], and sexism. This can be said of all non-white women in the United States. Her oppression by the forces of racism and imperialism is similar to that endured by our men. Oppression by sexism, however, is hers alone.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=32–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women  also sought out to battle the internalized struggles of self-hatred rooted in the colonization of their people. This included breaking the mujer buena/mujer mala myth, in which the domestic Spanish Woman is viewed as good and the Indigenous Woman that is a part of the community is viewed as bad. Chicana feminist thought emerged as a response to patriarchy, racism, classism, and colonialism as well as a response to all the ways that these legacies of oppression have become internalized.&lt;ref&gt;'''''Review of Part I: Implications for Feminist Theorizing''''', by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What are the issues happening in Chicana feminism now and then?'''

Chicana feminism have many different movements within the culture and ethnicities, according to Garcia (1989) the Chicana feminist movement was created to adhere to the specific issues which have had on Chicana women of colour which has originated from the Chicano movement because women desired to be treated equally and have the acceptance and motivation to what the Chicanos were doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=A. M|date=1989|title=The development of Chicana feminist discourse|url=|journal=Gender and Society|volume=1|pages=217–238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicana feminist movement has certainly influenced many Chicana women to be more active and to defend their rights not just as single women but women in solidarity who come together forming a society with equal contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez|first=A.N|date=1997|title=Garcia, Chicana feminist thought: the basic historical writings|url=|journal=Chicana feminism|volume=1|pages=52–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminist Garcia (1989) has noted that awareness is only the start such awareness becomes the catalyst for change which is what Chicana feminism is about Chicana feminism is also about creating intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=S|date=1980|title=Toward a feminist pedagogy|url=|journal=A Journal of Women Studies|volume=5|pages=48–51|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political organization (1940s – 1970s)  ===
Beginning in the 1940s, Mexican-Americans led a civil rights movement with a goal of achieving Mexican-American empowerment. By the 1960s, the [[Chicano Movement]], also known as ''El Movimiento'', became a prominent campaign in the lives of many Mexican-American workers and youth.&lt;ref&gt;Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, The [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW) organization was founded by [[Cesar Chavez|César Chávez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = UFW Chronology|url =http://ufw.org/research/history/ufw-chronology/|publisher=United Farm Workers|accessdate = 2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolores Huerta]], and [[Philip Vera Cruz]].

Between the late 1960s through the 1970s, The Chicano Student Movement began in which students fought and organized for better quality education.&lt;ref name="What is the Chicana Movement"&gt;{{cite web|title = What is the Chicana Movement?|url = http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|website = umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first efforts of organizing the Chicana Feminist Movement began in the later part of the 1960s. During the Chicano Movement,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, O. C. (2002, Fall). [http://postcolonialstudies.emory.edu/chicanafeminism/ Chicana Feminism]. Retrieved May 11, 2014, from Emory University website.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicana women formed committees within Chicano organizations. Similar to the organization of other groups in the Women's Movement, the Chicana feminists organized consciousness-raising groups and held conferences specific to the issues that Chicana women faced.&lt;ref name="segura69-92"&gt;Segura, D. A., and Pesquera, B. M. (January 1, 1992). Beyond Indifference and Antipathy: The Chicana Movement and Chicana Feminist Discourse. Aztlan: a Journal of Chicano Studies, 19, 2, 69-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although community organizers were working toward empowering the Mexican-American community, the narrative of the Chicano Movement largely ignored the women that were involved with organizing during this time of civil disobedience.

Chicana Feminism serves to highlight a much greater movement than generally perceived; a variety of minority groups are given a platform to confront their oppressors whether that be racism, homophobia, and multiple other forms of social injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects05/cf/|title=Chicana Feminism|website=www.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana liberation unshackles individuals, as well as the broader group as a whole, allowing them to live lives as they desire – commanding cultural respect and equality.&lt;ref&gt;Blea, Irene I. 1992. La Chicana and the Intersection of Race, Class, and Gender. New York , NY : Praeger Publishers. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminists collectively realized the importance of connecting the issues of gender with need for improvement with respect to other civil liberties such as socioeconomic background, heritage, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Benita. 2004. Separate Roads to Feminism. New York , NY : Cambridge University Press. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chicanas in the Brown Berets ====
The [[Brown Berets]] were a youth group that took on a more militant approach to organizing for the Mexican-American community formed in California in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="kcet.org"&gt;{{cite web|title = ¡La Lucha Continua! Gloria Arellanes and Women in the Chicano Movement|url = http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/east-of-east/gloria-arellanes-and-women-in-the-chicano-movement.html|website = KCET|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chicana feminist organization ====
The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the Chicano Movement and eventually, [[MEChA]]. At the conference women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement|url=http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|publisher=The University of Michigan|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first [[Conferencia de Mujeres por la Raza|National Chicana Conference]] held in Houston, Texas in May 1971, over 600 women organized to discuss issues surrounding regarding equal access to education, reproductive justice, formation of childcare centers, and more (Smith, 2002).  While the event was the first major gathering of its kind, the conference itself was fraught with discord as Chicanas from geographically and ideologically divergent positions sparred over the role of feminism within the Chicano movement. These conflicts led to a walkout on the final day of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=¡Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement|last=Blackwell|first=Maylei|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=1477312668|location=Austin, TX|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary chicanas during this time period while critiquing the inability of the mainstream Chicano nationalist movements to address sexism and misogyny, simultaneously renounced the mainstream Second Wave feminist movement for its inability to include racism and classism in their politics. Chicanas during this time felt excluded from mainstream feminist movements because they had different needs, concerns and demands. Through persistent objections to their exclusions women have gone from being called Chicano women to Chicanas to introducing the adoption of a/o or o/a as a way of acknowledging both genders when discussing the community. Chicanas demanded free day-care centers and a reform of the welfare system, they sought to fight against all three structures of oppression they faced, including sexism, but also prioritizing racism and imperialism.

One of the First Chicana organizations was the [[Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional]] (CFMN), founded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yo Soy Chicana: A Chicana Feminist Movement|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/departures/yo-soy-chicana-a-chicana-feminist-movement|publisher=KCET|accessdate=24 March 2018|language=en|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for the CFMN originated during the National Chicano Issues Conference when a group of attending Chicanas noticed that their concerns were not adequately addressed at the Chicano conference. The women met outside of the conference and drafted a framework for the CFMN that established them as active and knowledgeable community leaders of a people's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, K. (2013). La Hermandad and Chicanas Organizing: The Community Rhetoric of the Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional. Community Literacy Journal, 7(2), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female archetypes ===
Central to much of Chicana feminism is a reclaiming of the female archetypes [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|La Virgen de Guadalupe]], [[La Llorona]], and [[La Malinche]].&lt;ref&gt;'''''The Research Context''''', by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado&lt;/ref&gt; These archetypes have prevented Chicanas from achieving sexual and bodily agency due to the ways they have been historically constructed as negative categories through the lenses of patriarchy and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Women in Early Mexico|last=Schroeder|first=Susan|last2=Wood|first2=Stephanie|last3=Haskett|first3=Robert|publisher=Norman : University of Oklahoma Press|year=1997|isbn=9780806129709|location=|pages=292–312|chapter=14|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting the discourse from a traditional (patriarchal) representation of these archetypes to a de-colonial feminist understanding of them is a crucial element of contemporary Chicana feminism, and represents the starting point for a reclamation of Chicana female power, sexuality, and spirituality.

[[La Virgin de Guadalupe|La Virgen de Guadalupe]] and [[La Malinche]] have become symbolic means of suppressing Chicana women's sexuality through the patriarchal dichotomy of puta/virgin, the positive role model and the negative one, historically and continuously held up before Mexican women as icons and mirrors in which to examine their own self-image and define their self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gloria Anzaldúa's canonical text addresses the subversive power of reclaiming indigenous spirituality to unlearn colonial and patriarchal constructions and restrictions on women, their sexuality, and understandings of motherhood. Anzaldúa writes, "I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice: Indian, Spanish, white".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; La Malinche is a victim of centuries of patriarchal myths that permeate the Mexican woman's consciousness, often without her awareness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Malintzin (also known as Doña Marina by the Spaniards or "La Malinche" post-Mexican independence from Spain) was born around 1505 to noble Indigenous parents in rural Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Marina
MEXICAN NATIVE AMERICAN PRINCESS&lt;/ref&gt; Since Indigenous women were often used as pawns for political alliances at this time, she was betrayed by her parents and sold into slavery between the ages of 12–14, traded to Hernan Cortés as a concubine, and because of her intelligence and fluency in multiple languages, was promoted to his "wife" and diplomat. She served as Cortés's translator, playing a key role in the Spaniard's conquest of Tenochtitlan and, by extension, the conquest of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexican history : a primary source reader|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Jaffary|editor-first=Nora E.|location=|pages=72|chapter=12. The Nahua Interpreter Malintzin Translates for Hernan Cortés and Moteucçoma (1580)|quote=|editor-last2=Osowski|editor-first2=Edward W.|editor-last3=Porter|editor-first3=Susie S.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bore Cortés a son, Martín, who is considered to be the first mestizo and the beginning of the "Mexican" race.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, a scapegoat was needed to justify centuries of colonial rule. Because of Malintzin's relationship with Cortés and her role as translator and informant in Spain's conquest of Mexico, she was seen as a traitor to her race. By contrast, Chicana feminism calls for a different understanding. Since nationalism was a concept unknown to Indigenous people in the 16th century, Malintzin had no sense of herself as "Indian", making it impossible for her to show ethnic loyalty or  conscientiously act as a traitor. Malintzin was one of millions of women who were traded and sold in Mexico pre-colonization. With no way to escape a group of men, and inevitably rape, Malintzin showed loyalty to Cortés to ensure her survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

La Malinche has become the representative of a female sexuality that is passive, "rape-able", and always guilty of betrayal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rather than a traitor or a "whore", Chicana feminism calls for an understanding of her as an agent within her limited means, resisting rape and torture (as was common among her peers) by becoming a partner and translator to Cortés. Placing the blame for Mexico's conquest on Malintzin creates a foundation for placing upon women the responsibility to be the moral compasses of society and blames them for their sexuality, which is counterintuitive. It is important to understand Malintzin as a victim not of Cortés, but of myth. Chicana feminism calls for an understanding in which she should be praised for the adaptive resistance she exhibited that ultimately led to her survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By challenging patriarchal and colonial representations, Chicana writers re-construct their relationship to the figure of La Malinche and these other powerful archetypes, and reclaim them in order to re-frame a spirituality and identity that is both decolonizing and empowering.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Cristina.

===Criticism===
One critique of Chicana feminism was that it was a separatist movement that would divide the Chicano Movement. Loyalist Chicanas felt that the creation of a separate Chicana feminist movement was a dangerous and divisive political tactic, influenced too heavily by the Anglo women's movement. Loyalists believed that racism was the most important issue Chicanos and Chicanas were facing. They felt that the sexual oppression Chicanas faced from Chicanos was the fault of the system rather than the men, and breaking down the racial oppression affecting both Chicanos and Chicanas would resolve the sexual inequality the women experienced.

Similarly, Chicana feminists have been blamed for tearing at the values of Chicano culture. The first reason for this is that loyalists believed Chicana feminists were anti-family, anti-culture, and anti-man, thus pitting them against the Chicano movement. Furthermore, feminism itself was viewed by many as individualistic and as something that was taking away from other issues, such as racism.&lt;ref name="garcia217-238" /&gt;

However, following the contributions of Chicana feminist writers, including [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Cherríe Moraga]], Chicana feminism has gained the support of feminists of diverse backgrounds. The emergence of queer theory and intersectionality in feminist movements has challenged the misogyny of the Chicano movement and has broadened and strengthened the Chicana/o movement to be in solidarity with other people of color in the United States.

== Cultural identities and spirituality ==
The term "Chicano" originates from Aztec indigenous peoples who pronounced it "meshicano" in the native Nahuatl language. However, historically the Spaniards had no "sh" in their vocabulary and pronounced it "mexicano" (spelled mexicano), a pronunciation that has been carried into the present. Historically, the term Chicano has not always been positive and empowering. The term Chicano was for a long time used in a demeaning manner, and was associated with newly arrived Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century until it was later reclaimed by Chicana feminists with the emergence of the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano Nationalist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/20/chicana-feminism/|title=Postcolonial Studies {{!}} Chicana Feminism|website=scholarblogs.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many white Americans used the word Chicano to describe Mexican immigrants as poor, unskilled, and ignorant people. Later, the term was used to distinguish first-generation, American-born Mexican-Americans from the older generations of Mexican immigrants; two groups that were often separated by a language barrier. Most first-generation American Chicanos adopted English as their first language, with some Chicanos blending both English and Spanish to create a hybrid dialect or slang argot called [[Caló (Chicano)|caló]] (also called pachuco). The U.S. media, not being able to fully understand these emerging American identities, stigmatized Chicanos and Mexican in propagating the notion that came from a country of corruption, and that they were criminals, thieves, and immoral people.

The definitions of Chicana/o in the United States are contested. Because many Chicana/os are born to parents who are immigrants from Mexico, one definition of Chicana/o is rooted in the idea that this identity straddles two different worlds. The first world is that of the country of origin from which their families descended from, such as Mexico, Guatemala, or El Salvador. Many Chicanos today, for example, continue to practice the religion, language, and culture of their respective family's countries of origin. Another definition of Chicano is rooted in the identity being completely embedded within the "American" culture. Many Chicana/os have assimilated into "American" culture and use English as their primary language. Despite these two distinctions in definition, some might argue that Chicanos are stigmatized by both cultures because they don't fit into either one completely. For this reason, one view of Chicano identity is that a new culture is created in order to resist oppression and navigate both worlds.

Contemporary renditions of the word Chicano have been to replace the “C-H” beginning with the letter X, making the word Xicano. This is significant because it recenters the Nahua language and pronunciation of the sound “ch”, tying the Xicana/o to indigenous roots and decentering Eurocentric ties to identity.

Chicana feminism has also created another linguistic change, there is another “x” at the end of Xicanx, and it is being used to be inclusive of others gender identities and move away from a colonial imposed binary and gendered language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodríguez|first=Richard T|date=October 2017|title=X marks the spot|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.nau.edu/10.1177/0921374017727880|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume= 29| issue = 3, 2017|pages=203–212|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been resistance to this change in language and there is discussions of whether or not this is useful from academics and community members, Feminists and queer folk are fighting for this change in language be inclusive as well as creating a new formation of history. The usage of Xicanx is powerful due to trying to move back to indigenous roots as well as trying to create more space for Queer folk who have been marginalized by previous Chicano/a movements.  

=== Duality and "The New Mestiza" ===
The concept of "The New Mestiza" comes from feminist author, Gloria Anzaldúa. In her book, ''Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza'', she writes: "In a constant state of mental nepantilism, an Aztec word meaning torn between ways, la mestiza is a product of the transfer of the cultural and spiritual values of one group to another. Being tricultural, monolingual, bilingual or multilingual, speaking a patois, and in a state of perpetual transition, the mestiza faces the dilemma of the mixed breed: which collectivity does the daughter of a dark-skinned mother listen to? [...] Within us and within la Cultura Chicana, commonly held beliefs of the white culture attack commonly held beliefs of the Mexican culture, and both attack commonly held beliefs of the indigenous culture. Subconsciously, we see an attack on ourselves and our beliefs as a treat and we attempt to block with a counterstance."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|last=Anzaldúa|first=Gloria|publisher=|year=1987|isbn=9781879960749|location=|pages=40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anzaldua presents a mode of being for Chicanas, that honors their unique standpoint and lived experience. This theory of embodiment offers a mode of being for Chicanas who are constantly negotiating hybridity and cultural collision, and the ways that inform the way they are continuously making new knowledge and understandings of self, often time in relation to intersecting and various forms of oppression. This theory discloses how a counter-stance cannot be a way of life because it depends on hegemonic constructions of domination, in terms of race, nationality, and culture. A counter-stance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked in mortal combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to a common denominator of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anzaldua|first1=Gloria|title=Borderlans/La frontera|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|isbn=978-1-879960-12-1|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being solely reactionary means nothing is being created, revived or renewed in place of the dominant culture and that the dominant culture must remain dominant for counterstance to exist. For Anzaldua and this theory of embodiment, there must be space to create something new. The “new mestiza” was a canonical text that redefined what it meant to be Chicana. In this theory, being Chicana entails hybridity, contradictions, tolerance for ambiguity and plurality, nothing is rejected or excluded from histories and legacies of oppression. Further, this theory of embodiment calls for synthesizing all aspects of identity and creating new meanings, not simply balancing or coming together of different aspects of identity.

=== Mujerista ===
Mujerista was largely influenced by the African American women's "Womanist" approach proposed by Alice Walker. Mujerista was defined by Ada María Isasi-Díaz in 1996. This Latina feminist identity draws from the main ideas of womanism by combating inequality and oppression through participation in social justice movements within the Latina/o community.&lt;ref&gt;Tijerina-Revilla, A.

[[Nepantla]] is a [[Nahuatl|Nahua]] word which translates to "in the middle of it" or "middle". Nepantla can be described as a concept or spirituality in which multiple realities are experienced at the same time (Duality). As a Chicana, understanding and having indigenous ancestral knowledge of spirituality plays an instrumental role in the path to healing, decolonization, cultural appreciation, self-understanding, and self-love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nepantla Spirituality: My Path to the Source(s) of Healing|last = Medina|first = Lara|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepantla is often associated with author Chicana feminist Gloria Anzaldúa, who coined the term, "Nepantlera". "Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20IV%20Special/AnaLouiseKeating-FM.pdf|title = From Borderlands and New Mestizas to Nepantlas and Nepantleras Anzaldúan Theories for Social Change|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keating|first = AnaLouise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepantla is a mode of being for the Chicana and informs the way she experiences the world and various systems of oppression.

=== Body Politics ===
Suzanne Bost discuss in ''Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature,'' about how body politics has shifted in the way it used to be looked at by Chicana feminism. It has moved beyond just looking at identity politics, it now looks at how “[...]the intersections between particular bodies, cultural contexts, and political needs”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature|last=Bost|first=Suzanne|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780823230846|location=|pages=193–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now looking beyond just looking at race, but incorporating intersectionality and how mobility, accessibility, mental and physical abilities, caregivers and their roles in lives, work with the body of Chicana's. Examples of Frida Kahlo and her abilities are discussed, as well as Gloria Anzaldua’s diabetes, to illustrated how abilities must be discussed when talking about identities. “Since there is no single or constant locus of identification, our analyses must adapt to different cultural frameworks, shifting feelings, and matter that is fluid.[...] our thinking about bodies, identities, and politics must keep moving.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chicana feminism needs to move beyond just looking at singular aspects of identities, but using all of them and contextualizing it’s effects on what is going on in time. Identifying as Chicana/o/x means to be political and the body that you inhabit will be politicized as well, to understand how it is being politicized along with your identities is to look at how it is done. Bost uses examples of contemporary Chicana artists and literature to illustrate this, Chicana feminism hasn’t ended it is just manifesting in different ways now.

=== Queer Interventions ===
Chicana feminist theory evolved as a theory of embodiment and a theory of flesh due to the canonical works of Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga, both of whom identify as queer. Queer interventions in Chicana feminist thought called for an inclusion and honoring of the cultures’ joteria. In La conciencia de la mestiza, Gloria Anzaldua wrote, “the mestizo and the queer exist at this time and point on the evolutionary continuum for a purpose. We are blending that proves that all blood is intricately woven together and that we are spawned out of similar souls”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands La Frontera The New Mestiza, 4th Edition|last=Anzaldua|first=Gloria|publisher=aunt lute|year=1987|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=99–114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intervention centers queerness as a focal part of liberation, a lived experience that cannot be ignored or excluded.

In Queer Aztlan: the Reformation of Chicano Tribe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Latino/a Thought : Culture, Politics, and Society|last=Vázquez|first=Francisco H|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2009|isbn=9780742563544|location=|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherrie Moraga interrogates the construction of Chicano identity in relation with queerness. Offering a critique of the exclusion of people of color from mainstream gay movements as well as the homophobia rampant in Chicano nationalist movements. Moraga also discusses Aztlan, the metaphysical land and nation that belongs to Chicano ideologies, how this communidad and ideas need to move forward into making new forms of culture and community in order to survive. "Feminist critics are committed to the preservation of Chicano culture, but we know that our culture will not survive marital rape, battering, incest, drug and alcohol abuse, AIDS, and the marginalization of lesbian daughters and gay sons".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Moraga brings up criticisms of the Chicano movement and how it has been ignoring the issues within the movement itself, and that need to be addressed in order for the culture to be preserved rightfully.

In "Chicana Lesbians: Fear and Loathing in the Chicano Community," &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Carla Trujillo discusses how being a Chicana lesbian is incredibly difficult due to their culture's expectations on family and heterosexuality. Chicana lesbians who do become mothers break this expectation and become liberated from the social norms of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maythee|first1=Rojas|title=Women of Color and Feminism|date=2009|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Carla Trujillo edited and compiled, the anthology ''Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About|last=Trujillo|first=Carla|publisher=Third Woman Press|year=1991|isbn=9780943219066|location=|pages=186–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1991) was published by Third Woman Press. This anthology was controversial and banned because of its cover art which was a piece by Ester Hernandez titled ''La Ofrenda''. Since its original publication, the book has been re-published however, the cover art has changed. This anthology includes poetry and essays by Chicana women creating new understandings of self through their sexuality and race. This book brings visibility to Lesbian Chicana writers and artists whose work hasn't been as mainstream as other feminist artists. The contributions pages gives information about the writers and their histories, this also makes the book transparent about who is writing and bringing visibility to various different names.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''ECOFEMINISM IN CHICANA FEMINIST MOVEMENT'''

Chicana environmentalism combines the notion of ecofeminism and environmental justice whilst also providing a critique on the westernised view of ecofeminism and the toxicity caused by disregarding a certain race and the knowledge and history that they possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=C.M|date=2010|title=Chicana Environmentalisms: Deterritorialization as a Practice of Decolonization|url=|journal=The Ohio State University Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest terms, Ecofeminism can be defined as the significant connection between the oppression of women and nature, and the ways in which the two can coincide harmoniously.

After the term ‘ecofeminism’ was derived in the 70’s, there has been a significant increase in the amount of recognition women have received regarding creating positive alternatives for sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckingham|first=S|date=2004|title=Ecofeminism in the twenty-first century|url=|journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=170|pages=146–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to environmental sustainability being predominately of a western, patriarchal mindset its important for women, specifically indigenous women, to reject these premises and follow more nurturing, traditional practices. Environmental conservation in Chicana culture can be interpreted in many different ways. Firstly, it can be seen as empowerment of ones’ culture, i.e. rejecting Eurocentric ideologies and believing in the “womanness” of curandera. Curandera in Mexican American culture is believed to have healing powers. Unpacking the notion of spirituality, the practise of curandera are often observed from the view point of the patriarchal spirituality as being the creation of witchcraft. Derived from European Christianity, curandera’s "earth-based healing and nature-based spirituality" was something to be feared by those who disregarded its importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng-Levine|first=J|date=1997|title=Neocolonialism, postcolonial ecology, and ecofeminism in the works of Native American, Chicano/a, and international writers|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco feminism is not just a birth right in Chicana history, but it is also strategic. Eco feminism allows for the empowerment of women and provides an authority position for women in society.  This power comes from an association of being nature goddesses and creates a sense of privilege that would otherwise cease to exist.

Some of the ways in which Chicana women take back their ecological and ontological power can be seen through the use of literature and art. For example, murals in the San Francisco Bay area. Juana Alicia’s La Llorona’s Sacred Waters (2004) and MaestraPeace (1994), a collaboration among Juana Alicia, Miranda Bergman, Edith Boone, Susan Kelk Cervantes, Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton, and Irene Pérez. La Llorana’s Sacred Waters murals exhibits many aspects of ecofeminism in the ways in which it draws to the devastation of colonialism and the ways in which it destroyed both the natural environment and the people that inhabited it. The mural also signifies the clear links between the relationship of women and nature. Chalchiuhtlicue is an indigenous goddess of the lakes and rivers, whilst also being associated with strong fertility. She served as having the power to both give life and take it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=H|date=2003|title=The Handbook of Mesoamerican Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs of Mexico and Central America|url=|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=14|pages=365–366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals in the San Francisco bay area serve as a political statement of the duty of women’s social justice struggle and the constant resistance against colonialism and environmental depredation. In La llorana’s mural, Chalchiuhtlicue has a scroll rendering from her mouth with the message that she is speaking out against the horrid social conditions of her peoples.

Ecofeminism has always been a dominant part of the Chicana history, although very poorly documented. The diversity in the movement accounts for pushing towards an epistemological and ontological form of decolonization. The movement has been amplified through the reorienting of representation and by unpacking the way individuals absorbs the relationships between nature and spiritual relations.

=== Chicana art ===
Through different art mediums both past and contemporary, Chicana artists have continued to push the boundaries traditional Mexican-American values.

=== Chicana literature ===
{{See also|Xicana literature}}
Since the 1970s, many Chicana writers (such as [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Ana Castillo]]) have expressed their own definitions of Chicana feminism through their books. Moraga and Anzaldúa edited an anthology of writing by [[women of color]] titled ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]'' (published by [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press]]) in the early 1980s. Cherríe Moraga, along with [[Ana Castillo]] and [[Norma Alarcón]], adapted this anthology into a Spanish-language text titled ''Esta Puente, Mi Espalda: Voces de Mujeres Tercermundistas en los Estados Unidos''. Anzaldúa also published the [[bilingual]] (Spanish/English) anthology, ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]''. Mariana Roma-Carmona, Alma Gómez, and Cherríe Moraga published a collection of stories titled ''Cuentos: Stories by Latinas'', also published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.

The first Chicana Feminist Journal was published in 1973, called the Encuentro Feminil: The First Chicana Feminist Journal, which was published by Anna Nieto Gomez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Massacre of the Dreamers : Essays on Xicanisma. 20th Anniversary Updated Edition.|last=Castillo|first=Anna|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2014|isbn=9780826353580|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juanita Ramos and the [[Latina Lesbian History Project]] compiled an anthology including [[tatiana de la tierra]]'s first published poem, "De ambiente",&lt;ref&gt;De La Tierra, Tatiana. "Activist Latina Lesbian Publishing: esto no tiene nombre and conmoción." ''I am Aztldn: The Personal Essay in Chicano Studies, ed. Chon A. Noriega and Wendy Belcher (Los Angeles: UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press, 2004)'' 172.&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[oral history|oral histories]] of Latina lesbians called ''Compañeras: Latina Lesbians'' (1987).

Chicana lesbian-feminist poet Gloria Anzaldua points out that labeling a writer based on their [[social position]] allows for readers to understand the writers' location in society. However, while it is important to recognize that identity characteristics situate the writer, they do not necessarily reflect their writing. Anzaldua notes that this type of labeling has the potential to marginalize those writers who do not conform to the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anzaldua, Gloria. (1994). To(o) Queer the Writer—Loca, escritoria y chicana. from Betsy Warland, Ed., ''Inversions: Writings by Queer Dykes and Lesbians'', 263-276. Vancouver: Press Gang Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chicana music ===
Continually left absent from Chicano music history, many Chicana musical artists, such as [[Rita Vidaurri]] and María de Luz Flores Aceves, more commonly known as [[Lucha Reyes (Mexican singer)|Lucha Reyes]], from the 1940s and 50s, can be credited with many of strides that Chicana Feminist movements have made in the past century. For example, Vidaurri and Aceves were among the first [[Mexican people|mexicana]] women to wear [[charro]] pants while performing rancheras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Deborah|title=Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of la Onda|date=2012|publisher=The University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7316-2|page=vii|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=chicana+feminist+music+artists+girl+in+a+coma&amp;ots=oq8eGGUewA&amp;sig=ccwFFqLmIqTLyiM40FGZT1qlHio#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By challenging their own conflicting backgrounds and ideologies, Chicana musicians have continually broken the gender norms of their culture, and therefore created a space for conversation and change in the Latino communities.

There are many important figures in Chicana music history, each one giving a new social identity to Chicanas through their music. An important example of a Chicana musician is [[Rosita Fernández]], an artist from San Antonio, Texas. Popular in the mid 20th century, she was called "San Antonio's First Lady of Song" by [[Lady Bird Johnson]], the [[Tejano]] singer is a symbol of Chicana feminism for many Mexican Americans still today. She was described as "larger than life", repeatedly performing in [[china poblana]] dresses, throughout her career, which last more than 60 years. However, she never received a great deal of fame outside of the San Antonio, despite her long reign as one of the most active Mexican American woman public performers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Deborah|title=Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of la Onda|date=2012|publisher=The University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7316-2|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=chicana+feminist+music+artists+girl+in+a+coma&amp;ots=oq8eGGUewA&amp;sig=ccwFFqLmIqTLyiM40FGZT1qlHio#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery and publishing ==
[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Codex Zographensis'']]
The manuscript was found in the Bulgarian [[Zograf Monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]] in 1843 by the Croatian writer and diplomat [[Antun Mihanović]]. Codex's existence was however made known to public by [[Izmail Sreznevsky]] who published some parts of it in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Кирилометодиевска енциклопедия, т. І, София 1985, с. 739-740&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 monks from the Zograf monastery donated the Codex to Russian emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] who donated it to [[Russian National Library]], where the Codex is being kept today. The first to describe the codex was [[Viktor I. Grigorovič]] in 1877, and two years later the Glagolitic part of the codex was published by Slavist [[Vatroslav Jagić]] in Berlin as ''Quattuor evangeliorum codex glagoliticus olim Zographensis nunc Petropolitanus'', completely transcribed in Cyrillic, with introduction and extensive philological commentary in [[Latin]].&lt;ref name="Damjanovic_2003_p17"/&gt; Jagić's edition has been reprinted as a [[facsimile]] edition in [[Graz]] in 1954. Other scholars who have extensively studied the language of Codex Zographensis include the [[Josef Kurz]] and the [[Leszek Moszyński]].

== Content ==
The manuscript contains 304 [[parchment]] folios. The first few ones have not been preserved, and thus it begins with [[Matthew 3:11]] and ends with [[Gospel of John|John]], with Mt 16:20-24:20 being later insertion in old Macedonian Church Slavonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lunt|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, the first 288 folios are written in Glagolitic and contain Gospel text. In addition, several additional folios from the middle of the manuscript are missing. At the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century some missing folios (from 41 to 57) were replaced with 17 new ones, written in square Glagolitic. They were themselves most likely a [[palimpsest]]. The rest of the 16 folios contain 13th-century [[synaxarium]].

== Origin and linguistic features ==
Along with the slightly older [[Codex Marianus]] it is an important document for its use of the round [[Glagolitic script]], the oldest recorded Slavic alphabet. It exhibits linguistic features characteristic of [[Old Church Slavonic#Western Bulgarian recension|Western Bulgarian]] (Macedonian) recension.

By analyzing the language of the codex it was established that the style and antiquity of the text is nonuniform, second part being more archaic than the first part. Some scholars explain this by gradual adaptation to the language of the source from which the manuscript originated. Generally, phonology of  the language of Codex Zographensis is archaic - vocalizations of [[Havlík's law|strong yers]] are rare, epenthetic ''l'' is preserved, though in most parts of the manuscript ''yers'' are being assimilated.&lt;ref name="Damjanovic_2003_p17"/&gt; It is a bit less archaic with respect to morphology and syntax, though the forms of definite declension of adjectives and older forms of participles are well-preserved (e.g. ''prošь'', ''nošь'' and rarely ''prosivъ'', ''nosivъ'').&lt;ref name="Damjanovic_2003_p17"/&gt;

'''Corrective rape''', also called '''curative'''&lt;ref name="UNreport2011"/&gt; or '''homophobic rape''',&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RASmith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MDSmith"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Merril D.

The term ''corrective rape'' was coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rapes of [[lesbian]]s such as [[Eudy Simelane]] (who was also murdered in the same attack) and Zoliswa Nkonyana became public. Popularisation of the term has raised awareness and encouraged [[LGBT]]+ people in countries across the world to come forward with their own stories of being raped as punishment for and/or in an attempt to change their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.&lt;ref name="Denton"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Denton |first=Michelle |date=2017 |title=Rape Culture: How Can We End It? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5mDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 |location=New York |publisher=Greenhaven Publishing LLC |page=31 |isbn=9781534562929 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some countries have laws protecting LGBT+ people, corrective rape is often overlooked.&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;

== Definitions==
Corrective rape is the use of [[rape]] against people who do not conform to perceived [[Norm (social)|social norms]] regarding [[human sexuality]] or [[gender role]]s. The goal is to punish perceived abnormal behavior and reinforce societal norms.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; The crime was first{{when|date=September 2018 |reason=Which year?}} identified in South Africa,&lt;ref name="Janoff" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2018}} where it is sometimes supervised by members of the woman's family or local community.&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt; One of the earliest known mentions of the term is by South African feminist activist Bernedette Muthien during an August 2001 interview  by [[Human Rights Watch]] in [[Cape Town]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Long |first1=Scott |last2=Brown |first2=A. Widney |last3=Cooper |first3=Gail |date=2003 |title=More Than a Name: State-sponsored Homophobia and Its Consequences in Southern Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZhEqsNtNS4C&amp;pg=PA193 |location= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |page=193 |isbn=9781564322869 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lesbians are particularly targeted for gang rape. African lesbians are more likely to be raped as lesbians in the townships. To what extent are coloured lesbians also targeted for rape because of their sexual orientation? There are no statistics for this, I don't know what percent of coloured lesbians are targeted for corrective rape action. Growing up, I never heard that lesbians were targeted in this way and so I want to know when that started happening. Gangsterism has always existed in the townships, so you can't attribute it to that. I don't know why black lesbians are targeted more, either. I'd like to know how many women are being raped by brothers, fathers, etc., in coloured townships. Why is no one studying this? Has it just been under-reported, not studied, or what?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[UNAIDS]] 2015 Terminology Guidelines suggests that the term ''corrective rape'' should no longer be used, as it gives off the perception that something needs to be fixed. The guidelines propose that the term ''[[homophobic]] rape'' should be used instead.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=UNAIDS 2015 Terminology Guidelines |url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2015_terminology_guidelines_en.pdf |website=UNAIDS.org |date=2015 |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDSmith"/&gt; The words "so-called 'curative' or 'corrective' rape" were mentioned in 2011 in the first UN report on discrimination and violence against [[LGBT+]] people.&lt;ref name="UNreport2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf |title=Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity |author= |work=Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 global study on [[HIV/AIDS]] suggested the term ''[[lesbophobia|lesphobic]] rape'' to emphasize the fact that [[lesbians]] constitute the overwhelmingly majority of victims of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="RASmith"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Raymond A. (ed.) |date=2010 |title=Global HIV/AIDS Politics, Policy, and Activism: Persistent Challenges and Emerging Issues: Persistent Challenges and Emerging Issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdXYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA49 |location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=49 |isbn=9780313399466 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have emphasized that gay men, [[transgender]] people and [[Asexuality|asexuals]] can also be victims of corrective rape.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter-Gault (2015), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDSmith178"&gt;Merrill D. Smith (2018), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denton"/&gt;

==Contributing factors and motivations==
Corrective rape is a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, due to [[homophobia]] and [[heteronormativity]], hate crimes based on sexuality (as opposed to race, gender, class, age, etc.) are often not recognized by authorities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A 2000 study suggested an atmosphere supportive of hate crimes against gay men and lesbians, reactions to hate crimes by the broader community, and responses by police and justice systems contribute to corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt;

Some people believe corrective rape can "fix" people who do not conform to gender norms or who are not heterosexual. [[ActionAid]] reports that survivors remember being told that they were being taught a lesson.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.actionaid.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/hate_crimes_the_rise_of_corrective_rape_in_south_africa_september_2009.pdf|title=ActionAid|last=|first=|date=2009 |publisher=ActionAid|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some perpetrators of the hate crime are impelled by a sense of misogyny and chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, Vasu, Cheryl-Ann Potgieter, and Nonhlanhla Mkhize. "Cloud over the rainbow nation:'corrective rape'and other hate crimes against black lesbians." (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources argue that many cases of corrective rape are caused by [[is–ought problem|drawing moral conclusions]] from the [[nature–nurture debate]]. Despite the scientific community believing that sexual orientation is the result of biology and environment,&lt;ref name="pediatrics2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.113.6.1827 |author=Frankowski BL|author2=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence|title=Sexual orientation and adolescents |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]|volume=113 |issue=6 |pages=1827–32 |date=June 2004|pmid=15173519|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/6/1827.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamanna"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Mary Ann Lamanna, Agnes Riedmann, Susan D Stewart|title=Marriages, Families, and Relationships: Making Choices in a Diverse Society|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=1305176898|year=2014|page=82|accessdate=February 11, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fofaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|quote=The reason some individuals develop a gay sexual identity has not been definitively established &amp;nbsp;– nor do we yet understand the development of heterosexuality.

Because of this, some of these people believe sexual orientation can be changed or, as they see it, fixed.&lt;ref&gt;McCommon B (2006). "Antipsychiatry and the Gay Rights Movement".

== Intersectionality ==
[[Intersectionality]] is ''intersecting'' social identities and related systems of [[oppression]], [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]], or [[discrimination]]. In South Africa, black lesbians face homophobia, [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[classism]]. Research in 2008 by Triangle, a gay rights group, revealed that black lesbians were twice as afraid of sexual assault compared to white lesbians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, black women who identify as lesbians are seen as "un-African" by their peers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=3d95b04c-aa02-4955-8d90-80637d88d9e2%2540sessionmgr104&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=108|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account race and sexuality together is essential when examining corrective rape, as both subjects cross into each other and influence each other heavily.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Feb 2013|title=Rape as a Weapon of Hate: Discursive Constructions and Material Consequences of Black Lesbianism in South Africa|url=|journal=Women's Studies in Communication|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersectionality plays a major role in corrective rape cases, as many occur in underdeveloped countries such as South Africa and India in which race, class, and gender are factors in the rights an individual will receive. Sexuality and gender especially, define the social and political rank of victims. Many are ostracized, and other abusive measures are taken in order to cure individuals of their sexuality.

== Impact on victims ==
Corrective rape and other accompanying acts of violence can result in [[physical trauma|physical]] and [[psychological trauma]], mutilation, unwanted [[pregnancy]], and may contribute to [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt; Corrective rape is a major contributor to [[HIV]] infection in South African lesbians.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; In South Africa approximately 10% of lesbians are HIV positive, with corrective rape being the most likely cause.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; HIV in South Africa is pandemic, and due to homophobia there is a  lack of education about sexually transmitted diseases among lesbians. Homophobic laws and discrimination in South Africa contribute to the poor quality of health care for minorities.

The psychological effects of corrective rape on victims can be detrimental. Many victims in countries such as South Africa and India where corrective rape is most prevalent suffer from a strong sense of insecurity and disempowerment due to strong homophobia in their communities. This homophobia can lead to both physical and psychological violence. There have been at least 30 lesbians who have been murdered in South Africa in the last 15 years because of their sexual orientation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} However, violence against the LGBTQ community in South Africa is seldom reported.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Survivors of corrective rape suffer from triple discrimination for being a female, black, and homosexual.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is especially true in South African townships, where corrective rape is common for lesbian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nduna|first=Mzikazi|date=2012|title=Disempowerment And Psychological Distress In The Lives Of Young People In Eastern Cape, South Africa|url=|journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1018|doi=10.1007/s10826-011-9564-y|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective rape victims may suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], and/or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=du Toit|first=Louise|date=2014|title=Shifting Meanings of Postconflict Sexual Violence in South Africa|url=|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=40|pages=101|doi=10.1086/676895|jstor=10.1086/676895|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to racial and sexual discrimination in health care, victims must often deal with these issues on their own.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== India ===
Children in India have been speaking out about how their parents are sanctioning the child's sexuality by using "corrective rape therapy" (same as corrective rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/parenting/Victims-of-corrective-rape-speak-up/articleshow/47602170.cm|title=Victims of Corrective Rape Speak Up|date=June 2015|work=Times of India|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective rape in India typically happens in order to protect the family name, to avoid shaming from religious communities, and to prevent abnormal perception by the surrounding community. In India, there is a general discomfort with discussing homosexuality, even if an individual identifies as homosexual. This discomfort comes from the overall negative attitude towards homosexuality and the fact is that individuals in India who identify as homosexual are victimized at a higher rate. There is also a high level of negativity towards the trans community in India. Religious commitments tend to be very strong in traditional cultures and this is where much of the tension and poor perception came from. According to statistics from the Crisis Intervention Team of LGBT Collective in Telangana, India, there have been 15 reported instances of corrective rape that have been reported in the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=India's Bollywood Speaks Out Against Rape|last=MM Vetticad|first=Anna|date=10 July 2014|work=Newspaper|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, there has been a 902 percent increase in reported rapes in India from 1971 to 2012; however, it is estimated that 90% of sex crimes in the country go unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/07/india-bollywood-speaks-out-against-rape-201471075423510320.html|title=India's Bollywood speaks out against rape|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|LGBT rights in Jamaica}}

Amnesty International has received reports of violence against lesbians in [[Jamaica]], including rape and other forms of sexual violence. Lesbians reportedly have been attacked on the grounds of mannish physical appearance or other visible signs of sexuality. Some reports of abduction and rape come from inner-city communities, where local non-governmental organizations have expressed concerns about high incidences of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Czyzselska"/&gt;

In Kenya, perpetrators and apologists claim that rape is a method "to straighten" LGBTI people.&lt;ref name="KHRC"/&gt;

In South Africa, women have less sexual and economic power than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mantell|first1=Joanne|last2=Needham|first2=Sarah|last3=Smit|first3=Jennifer Ann|last4=Hoffman|first4=Susie|last5=Cebekhulu|first5=Queen|last6=Adams-Skinner|first6=Jessica|last7=Exner|first7=Theresa|last8=Mabude|first8=Zonke|last9=Beksinska|first9=Mags|last10=Stein|first10=Zena|last11=Milford|first11=Cecilia|title=Gender norms in South Africa: implications for HIV and pregnancy prevention among African and Indian women students at a South African tertiary institution|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|date=February 2009|volume=11|issue=2|pages=139–157|doi=10.1080/13691050802521155|pmc=2782559|pmid=19247859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the factors associated with this inequality is strict gender roles, which has led to one of the highest rates of [[violence against women]] in the world.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt; The South African government conducted a survey in 2009 on sexual assault. One in four men admit to having sex with a woman who did not consent and nearly half of these men admitted to raping more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Clare|title=The Brutality of "Corrective Rape" |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/07/26/opinion/26corrective-rape.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that a woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Corrective rape is used as a punishment for people who are gay or do not fit traditional gender roles (usually women), where often they are [[verbally abused]] before the rape. The perpetrator may claim to be teaching the women a lesson on how to be a "real woman".&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; Because women have less control over their [[economics]], which creates economic vulnerability, they have less control over their own sexual activities.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;  Poor black women who live in townships are more likely to become victims of corrective violence, and gay women are more likely to be isolated with little support, which increases their chances of being targeted.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt;

The [[South African Constitution]] is one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. It states that no person shall be discriminated against based on his or her gender, [[race (human categorization)|race]], or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; [[Equality Act (South Africa)|The Equality Act]] of 2000 specifically bans [[hate crime]]s, crimes in which people are targeted because of one or more aspects of their identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although this technically includes crimes based on sexual orientation, in practice such cases are not brought to trial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Crimes based on sexual orientation are not expressly recognized in South Africa; corrective rape reports are not separated from general rape reports.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt; In December 2009, there had been 31 recorded murders of lesbians in South Africa since 1998, but only one had resulted in a conviction.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;

The reason for this discrepancy between the law and practice is a result of [[heteronormativity]] and homophobia in South Africa. Heteronormativity can be defined as "the institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make heterosexuality not only seem coherent—that is organised as a sexuality—but also privileged".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7107cbc9-729a-47b1-995e-a1608ec7c9aa%2540sessionmgr115&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=108|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe the heteronormativity in South Africa can be attributed to the nation's postcolonial years of racism, and it appears that today many South Africans are recommitted to their traditional heritage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Black South African lesbians are not included in this [[social construction]], and this leads back to the concept of [[intersectionality]]. Black lesbians in South Africa are not only excluded because of their sexual orientation but also because of their ethnicity. As displayed in the media, most homosexuality is displayed as white, leaving black lesbians in South African even more marginalized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In South Africa, homosexuality is regarded as "un-African" by some.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2004, the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Science Research Council]] found that 78% of the respondents thought of homosexuality as unacceptable. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], in the last 20 years, attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] have become worse in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Hazelton" /&gt;

Corrective rape is on the rise in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped weekly to correct their sexual preferences, as estimated by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Contemporary Sexuality" /&gt; It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the [[Western Cape]] live in fear of being [[sexually assaulted]], as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Yet victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Under-reporting is high for sexually violent crimes, thus the number of corrective rapes are likely higher than what is reported.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;

Although it is thought to be uncommon, men also become victims of corrective rape. A study conducted by OUT [[LGBT]] Well-being and the University of South Africa Centre for Applied Psychology (UCAP) showed that "the percentage of black gay men who said they have experienced corrective rape matched that of the black lesbians who partook in the study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Louw|first1=Angelo|title=Men are also 'corrective rape' victims |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-11-men-are-also-corrective-rape-victims|website=Mail&amp;Guardian |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all men admit to being victims of corrective rape.

One South African man stated, "Lesbians get raped and killed because it is accepted by our community and by our culture."&lt;ref name="Middleton" /&gt; Kekelesto explained that her experience as "where men try to turn you into a real African woman" and that she was being taught how to be a black woman.&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt;

Galip Asvat, a successful hair salon business owner, is a gay man born in [[Klerksdorp]].

On his attack, he said, "They thought I was a woman, and when they found out I was a man, that's when they became even more violent."&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; His beating was brutal and the gang of men nearly cut off his genitals.

Sizakele Sigasa, a lesbian activist living in [[Soweto]], and her partner Salome Masooa were raped, [[torture]]d, and murdered in July 2007. South African lesbian-[[gay rights]] organizations, including the umbrella-group Joint Working Group, said the attack was driven by lesbophobia.&lt;ref name="Ndaba"/&gt; Two other rape/murders of lesbians occurred in South Africa earlier in Summer 2007: Simangele Nhlapo, member of an [[HIV-positive]] support group was raped and murdered in June, along with her two-year-old daughter; and Madoe Mafubedu, age 16, was raped and stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pithouse |first=Richard |title=Only Protected on Paper |url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service |accessdate=22 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QiX79Fi5?url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |archivedate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, two writers from South African men's magazine ''[[FHM]]'' were fired as a result of corrective rape jokes they made on Facebook. After a disciplinary hearing on Friday, July 19, 2013, ''FHM'' dismissed both men from their positions, calling their comments "entirely unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-07-19-fhm-fires-rape-comment-writers|title=FHM fires writers over rape comments|first=Staff|last=Reporter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa is a signatory of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which obligates states to remove discriminatory barriers from the full and free exercise of rights by women. The Convention's duty to modify the conduct of private citizens to ensure equality for women covers attitudes that include the inferiority of women and stereotyped gender roles, which arguably encompass the animus toward gay women that motivates many men to commit corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; 66% of South Africa women said they did not report their attack because they would not be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; Of these, 25% said they feared exposing their sexual orientation to the police and 22% said they were afraid of being abused by the police.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;

In August 2011, the [[Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|Department of Justice]] established a National Task Team (NTT) to address the issue of hate crimes against LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team starts work on gay hate crimes |agency=[[South African Press Association|SAPA]]-DPA |date=10 August 2011 |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/team-starts-work-on-gay-hate-crimes-1.1115051 |newspaper=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL News]] |accessdate=15 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RD3RrFs8?url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/team-starts-work-on-gay-hate-crimes-1.1115051 |archivedate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, then [[Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development|Minister of Justice]] [[Jeff Radebe]] launched a National Intervention Strategy for the LGBTI Sector developed by the NTT to address sex-based violence and [[gender-based violence]] against members of the community. The NTT has established a rapid response team to attend to unsolved criminal cases as a matter of urgency and produced an information pamphlet with frequently asked questions about LGBTI persons. Radebe stated that the Department of Justice acknowledged the need for a specific legal framework for hate crimes and that the matter would be subjected to public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Intervention Strategy for LGBTI Sector 2014|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/vg/lgbti/2014-LGBTI-Strategy.pdf|publisher=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radebe launches LGBTI violence programme |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/radebe-launches-lgbti-violence-programme-1.1681563 |accessdate=20 July 2014 |agency=SAPA |newspaper=IOL |date=29 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RD3bz2dy?url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/radebe-launches-lgbti-violence-programme-1.1681563 |archivedate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diale|first1=Lerato|title=Plan to combat gender violence|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/124285-1007-53-Plan_to_combat_gender_violence|accessdate=20 July 2014|work=The New Age|date=30 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720144529/http://www.thenewage.co.za/124285-1007-53-Plan_to_combat_gender_violence|archivedate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, there was an article published that stated that there are about 10 new cases of corrective rape a week in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/92198/south-africa-activism-makes-inroads-corrective-rape|title=Activism makes inroads on 'corrective rape'|date=2011-03-15|website=IRIN|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cape Town|Cape Town, South Africa]] specifically has 2.5 million people and since 2011, the prevalence of Corrective Rape has only increased.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], [[Brandon Teena]] (1972–1993) is one of the best-known victims of corrective rape (and thereafter murder) for being a [[trans man]]. The book ''All She Wanted'' (1996) and the two films ''[[The Brandon Teena Story]]'' (1998) and ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' (1999) were about him.&lt;ref name="MDSmith178"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=McOrmond-Plummer |first1=Louise |last2=Easteal |first2=Patricia |last3=Levy-Peck |first3=Jennifer Y. |date=2014 |title=Intimate Partner Sexual Violence: A Multidisciplinary Guide to Improving Services and Support for Survivors of Rape and Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dnDAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266 |location=London |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |page=266 |isbn=9780857006554 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|LGBT rights in Zimbabwe}}

A U.S. State Department report on Zimbabwe states, "In response to social pressure, some families reportedly subjected their LGBT members to corrective rape and forced marriages to encourage heterosexual conduct. Such crimes were rarely reported to police. Women, in particular, were subjected to rape by male family members."&lt;ref name="USZimbabwe2012"/&gt; 
Following the publication of an earlier report with similar wording,&lt;ref name="USZimbabwe2009"/&gt; Zimbabwean journalist [[Angus Shaw (writer)|Angus Shaw]] said that lesbian women are raped by men to make them enjoy heterosexual acts and gay men are raped by women to remove their sexual orientation tendencies.&lt;ref name="Gonda"/&gt;

==Campaigning and activism==
Child sponsorship charity [[ActionAid]] has published an article discussing corrective rape, and see ending violence against women as a pivotal part of their mission.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; The group joined with 26 gay and women's rights and community groups, to organize a campaign focused on South Africa but also aimed at the international community, to raise awareness of the issues.  The campaign was dedicated to raising awareness about the rape and murder of two lesbian women in a Johannesburg township and called for sexual orientation to be specifically recognised as grounds for protection by police and justice systems.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;

Ndumie Funda, a South African Social Justice Activist, started her work to end Corrective Rape by launching a social campaign on [[Change.org]] in hopes to have the South African Government recognize hate crimes committed due to biases against sexual orientation and provide protection for victims. This particular petition ended up gathering almost 200 thousand signatures from individuals making up over 175 different countries-this forced the government to recognize this issue. The government agreed to meeting Funda and in 2014 South Africa passed its first law against hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/02/south-africa-ndumie-funda|title=Activist takes on mission against "corrective" rape|website=www.thedp.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Neuropsychology}}
In [[neuropsychology]], '''dissociation''' involves identifying the [[neural substrate]] of a particular brain function through identification of case studies, [[neuroimaging]], or neuropsychological testing.

==Dissociation types==

===Single dissociation===
When dissecting complex mental tasks into their subcomponents, a researcher can establish a "single dissociation" between functions. This is done by demonstrating that a lesion to brain structure A disrupts function X but not function Y. Such a demonstration allows one to infer that function X and function Y are independent of each other in some way.

Dr. [[Oliver Sacks]] has described many famous cases of dissociation in his books. An example of "single dissociation" is a patient who cannot name an object when he or she can only see it, but can when he or she uses other senses like touching or smelling. Patient D.F. was unable to place a card in a slot, but could do so when told to place it "as if mailing a letter". From this the conclusion was drawn that judging orientation is one ability (which D.F. had lost) and visual control of an action another (which D.F. could still do).&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;E. Bruce Goldstein: Sensation and Perception. Wadsworth, Pacific Grove (USA), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double dissociation===
To strengthen a single dissociation, a researcher can establish a "double dissociation", a term that was introduced by [[Hans-Lukas Teuber]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10954167_ITM What do double dissociations prove? | Cognitive Science (January, 2001)&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the demonstration that two experimental manipulations each have different effects on two dependent variables; if one manipulation affects the first variable and not the second, the other manipulation affects the second variable and not the first.&lt;ref&gt;Huettel, Scott A.; Song, Allen W.; McCarthy, Gregory: "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging" p. 439. Sinauer Associates, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; If one can demonstrate that a lesion in brain structure A impairs function X but not Y, and further demonstrate that a lesion to brain structure B impairs function Y but spares function X, one can make more specific inferences about brain function and function localization.

In [[cognitive neuroscience]], double dissociation is an experimental technique by which two areas of neocortex are functionally dissociated by two behavioral tests, each test being affected by a lesion in one zone and not the other.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw: ''Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology,'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of patients with [[traumatic brain injury]], one might find two patients, A and B. Patient A has difficulty performing cognitive tests for, say auditory memory but has no problem with visual memory. Patient B has the opposite problem. By using [[neuroimaging]] (or [[neuropathology]] post-mortem) to identify the overlap and dissociation between lesioned areas of the brain, one can infer something about the localization of visual and auditory function in the normal brain.

Establishing a single dissociation between two functions provides limited and potentially misleading information, whereas a double dissociation can conclusively demonstrate that the two functions are localized in different areas of the brain.

To make the difference between single and double dissociations easier to understand, Parkin&lt;ref name=Parkin&gt;A.J. Parkin: Explorations in Cognitive Neuropsychology. Blackwell, Oxford, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If your TV set suddenly loses the color you can conclude that picture transmission and color information must be separate processes (single dissociation: they cannot be independent because you cannot lose the picture and still have the color). If on the other hand you have two TV sets, one without sound and one without a picture you can conclude that these must be two independent functions (double dissociation).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Examples of double dissociations ===
[[Paul Broca]] and [[Carl Wernicke]] were two physicians of the 1800s whose patients were evidence of the double dissociation between generating language (speech) and understanding language. Broca's patients could no longer speak but could understand language ([[non-fluent aphasia]]) while Wernicke's patients could no longer understand language but could produce jumbled speech ([[fluent aphasia]]). Post-mortems revealed lesions in separate areas of the brain in each case (now referred to as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]] respectively). Although the neurophysiology of language is now known to be more complicated than described by Broca or Wernicke, this classic double dissociation acted to begin modern neuropsychological investigation of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = First-Pass versus Second-Pass Parsing Processes in a Wernicke's and a Broca's Aphasic: Electrophysiological Evidence for a Double Dissociation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X97919064|journal = Brain and Language|date = 1998-05-01|pages = 311–341|volume = 62|issue = 3|doi = 10.1006/brln.1997.1906|first = Angela D.|last = Friederici|first2 = Anja|last2 = Hahne|first3 = D. Yves|last3 = von Cramon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions [[Capgras delusion]] and [[prosopagnosia]] have also been argued to represent a double dissociation. In the former, a patient is able to recognise a person but does not get the feeling of knowing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capgras delusion: a window on face recognition|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136466130001620X|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 149–156|volume = 5|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01620-X|first = Hadyn D.|last = Ellis|first2 = Michael B.|last2 = Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, a patient is unable to recognise a familiar person but sometimes has a feeling of knowing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6568">'''Eliezer (Lazer) ben Elijah Ashkenazi''' (1512–December 13, 1585) ({{lang-he|אליעזר בן אליהו אשכנזי}}) was a [[Talmud]]ist, [[rabbi]], physician, and many-sided scholar. Though of a [[Jews of Germany|German]] family (according to some, the relative of [[Joseph Colon]]; see [[Marco Mortara]], ''Indice Alfabetico,'' s.v.), he was probably born in the [[Levant]], and received his Talmudic education under [[Joseph Taitazak]] in [[Salonica]]. Ashkenazi first became rabbi in [[Egypt]] 1538-60, probably at [[Fostat]], where, by his learning and wealth, he became widely known. Compelled by circumstances—doubtless of a political nature—to leave Egypt, he went to [[Cyprus]], remaining there for two years as rabbi at [[Famagusta]].

A desire to visit foreign lands and to observe foreign peoples impelled him to give up this position and to travel. He went first to [[Venice]], but a disagreement with the rabbis [[Meïr Padua]] and his son [[Judah Katzenellenbogen]] caused him to leave the city and in the same year to take up his residence at [[Prague]] (1561). Here—either because he was a rabbi, or, at all events, because he was a leading authority—his was the first signature appended to the constitution of the burial society of the congregation. After leaving [[Bohemia]] and proceeding eastward as far as the [[Crimea]], Ashkenazi returned to [[Italy]], not before 1570. While rabbi of [[Cremona]] he published there (1576) his work, ''Yosef Lekah'' (Increases Learning; compare [[Prov.]] i. 5), dedicated to Joseph Nasi, duke of Naxos, which was several times reprinted. Four years later he was again in eastern Europe, as rabbi of [[Poznań|Posen]]. In 1584 he left that city to take up his abode in Cracow, where he died on December 13, 1585.

== Works ==
Ashkenazi's printed works are as follows: 
* ''Yosef LekaḦ''  A commentary on the [[Book of Esther]]
* ''Ma'ase ha-Shem'' (The Works of God; Venice, 1583; several other editions), a commentary on the historical portions of the [[Pentateuch]], written for the instruction of his son Elijah, and containing also a complete commentary on the [[Passover Haggadah]], which has frequently been published separately
* Eight "[[selihot]]" (penitential prayers), included in the Bohemian liturgy
* A "tokahah" (homily), published by his son.
* His supercommentary to [[Nahmanides]], and his critical marginal notes—said to number one thousand—on [[Joseph Caro]]'s ''Bet Yosef,'' have not been preserved.

== His individuality ==
Ashkenazi's personality was an extraordinary one. He may be called the last survivor of a most brilliant epoch in the history of the [[Sephardim]].  Although educated by a [[kabalist]], and a fellow-pupil of [[Moses Alshech]], yet he was a student—if not a deep one—of philosophy and physics. As a [[Talmudist]], such men as [[Joseph Caro]], [[Moses Isserles]], and [[Solomon Luria]] considered him of equal authority with themselves; however, when the rabbinical decisions of earlier rabbis ran counter to his own judgment, he never sought a sophistical justification for them, as was then the custom, especially in Poland.

Valuable material for a correct estimate of Ashkenazi may be found in several of his decisions preserved in the [[responsa]] literature of the time. In [[Venice]] he decided that a man could be forced to a divorce, if, by immoral conduct, he had incurred his wife's aversion (Isserles, Responsa, No. 96). It was likely this decision which brought upon him the opposition of the above-mentioned Venetian rabbis, though he was connected with them, for Ashkenazi's son was [[Katzenellenbogen]]'s son-in-law. From the standpoint of strict Talmudic interpretation, Ashkenazi's opponents were in the right, since his sentence contravened that of the [[Tosafists]], who for the German-Italian Jews constituted, as it were, a court of last resort.

== Controversies with Polish rabbis ==
It appears that Ashkenazi's fierce confidence and independence led to clashes with the rabbinic establishment in Poland. The following occurrence is one such instance: The "[[Rosh yeshiva|rashei yeshivot]]" (heads of academies) had forbidden their pupils to establish a rival academy in close proximity to their own. Ashkenazi declined to assent to this resolution, even when requested in the name of [[Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon]] ha-Kohen, the "rosh yeshibah" at [[Cracow]]. In a letter to the latter he claimed that, although the decision of the Polish [[rabbis]] was based upon the authority of [[Maimonides]], he considered it unsupported by Talmudic literature and therefore deemed it as needlessly discouraging religious instruction. Ashkenazi even went so far as to question if indeed a great scholar like the rabbi of Cracow had truly requested this at all! Here too, despite the great respect shown Ashkenazi in his reply, the rabbi of Cracow responded forcefully at length, vindicating Maimonides' standpoint by erudite and astute references to the [[Talmud]] (Joseph b. Mordecai Gershon, ''She'erit Yosef,'' No. 19). Consequently, [[J. S. del Medigo]] is quoted as saying that although Ashkenazi lived and taught in Poland in his later years his work was largely unknown to Polish Jews for "his way was hidden from them, and they did not fully understand his views nor his lofty ideas" (Nobeloth Hokhmah, Samuel b. Judah Loeb Ashkenazi, Basilia 1631, p. 46a).

Ashkenazi's wife, Rachel, died at Cracow April 3, 1593. Her epitaph, still extant, bears witness to her piety and benevolence (''Monatsschrift,'' xliv. 360). His son Elijah published the liturgic collection, ''Zibhe Shelamim,'' and wrote a short elegy on his father, which was used as the latter's epitaph.

Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, 1535 pp&lt;/ref&gt;     

Global emissions budgets are calculated according to historical cumulative emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and land-use change, but vary according to the global temperature target that is chosen, the probability of staying below that target, and the emission of other non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases (GHGs)]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Friedlingstein, P., Andrew, R.

''Nature geoscience'', ''7''(10), 709.&lt;/ref&gt; Global emissions budgets can be further divided into national emissions budgets, so that countries can set specific climate mitigation goals. Emissions budgets are relevant to [[climate change mitigation]] because they indicate a finite amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted over time, before resulting in dangerous levels of global warming. Change in global temperature is independent from the geographic location of these emissions, and is largely independent of the timing of these emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zickfeld|first=K.|last2=Arora|first2=V.

An "emissions target" may be distinguished from an emissions budget, as an emissions target may be internationally or nationally set in accordance with objectives other than a specific global temperature. This includes targets created for their political palatability, rather than ones focused on climate science warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babiker|first=Mustafa H.|last2=Eckaus|first2=Richard S.|date=2002-09-01|title=Rethinking the Kyoto Emissions Targets|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016139500611|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|pages=399–414|doi=10.1023/A:1016139500611|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative to budgets set explicitly using temperature objectives, emissions budgets have also been estimated using the [[Representative Concentration Pathways]], which are based on [[radiative forcing]] values at the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vuuren|first=Detlef P. van|last2=Edmonds|first2=James A.|last3=Kainuma|first3=Mikiko|last4=Riahi|first4=Keywan|last5=Weyant|first5=John|date=2011-11-01|title=A special issue on the RCPs|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0157-y|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=109|issue=1-2|pages=1|doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0157-y|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Although temperatures may be inferred from radiative forcing). These were presented in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|International Panel on Climate Change]] Fifth Assessment report.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== National emissions budgets ==
In light of the many differences between nations, including but not limited to population, level of industrialization, national emissions histories, and mitigation capabilities, scientists have made attempts to allocate global carbon budgets among countries using methods that follow various principles of equity.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Ringius, L., Torvanger, A., &amp; Underdal, A. (2002). Burden sharing and fairness principles in international climate policy. ''International Environmental Agreements'', ''2''(1), 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Allocating national emissions budgets is comparable to sharing the burdens of climate change&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;, underlined by some assumptions of state-level responsibility of climate change. Many authors have conducted quantitative analyses which allocate emissions budgets &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;, often simultaneously addressing disparities in historical GHG emissions between nations. 

One common principle that has been used to allocate global emissions budgets to nations is the "responsibility" or "[[Polluter pays principle|polluter-pays" principle]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This principle recognizes nations' cumulative historical contributions to global emissions. So those countries with greater emissions levels over a set time period (for example, since the pre-industrial era to the present) would be responsible for reducing a greater portion of global emissions. Thus, their national emissions budgets would be smaller than those that have polluted less in the past. The concept of national historical responsibility for climate change has prevailed in the literature since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Grübler, A., &amp; Fujii, Y. (1991). Inter-generational and spatial equity issues of carbon accounts. ''Energy'', ''16''(11-12), 1397-1416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K. R. (1992). Allocating responsibility for global warming: The natural debt index. ''Ambio. Stockholm'', ''20''(2), 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, some have quantified cumulative historical emissions of states, while highlighting the ethical challenges of allocating climate responsibilities according to this principle.&lt;ref&gt;Botzen, W. J., Gowdy, J. M., &amp; van den Bergh, J. C. (2008). Cumulative CO2 emissions: shifting international responsibilities for climate debt. ''Climate policy'', ''8''(6), 569-576. doi:10.3763/cpol.2008.0539.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is often favoured by developing countries, as it gives them larger emissions budgets.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pan, J. (2003). Emissions rights and their transferability: equity concerns over climate change mitigation. ''International Environmental Agreements'', ''3''(1), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another common equity principle for calculating national emissions budgets is the "[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian" principle]]. This principle stipulates individuals should have equal rights to pollute, and therefore emissions budgets should be distributed proportionally according to state populations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some scientists have thus reasoned the use of national per-capita emissions in national emissions budget calculations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Baer, P., Athanasiou, T., Kartha, S., &amp; Kemp-Benedict, E. (2009). Greenhouse development rights: A proposal for a fair global climate treaty. ''Ethics place and environment'', ''12''(3), 267-281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=H. Damon|date=January 2016|title=Quantifying historical carbon and climate debts among nations|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2774|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=60–64|doi=10.1038/nclimate2774|issn=1758-6798|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumayer|first=Eric|title=In defence of historical accountability for greenhouse gas emissions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00135-X|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=33|issue=2|pages=185–192|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(00)00135-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle may be favoured by nations with larger or rapidly growing populations.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  

A third equity principle that has been employed in national budget calculations considers national [[Westphalian sovereignty|sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The "sovereignty" principle highlights the equal right of nations to pollute.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The grandfathering method for calculating national emissions budgets uses this principle. Grandfathering allocates these budgets proportionally according to emissions at a particular base year,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and has been used under international regimes such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]]&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (1998). "Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change".(&lt;nowiki&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;) &lt;/ref&gt; and the early phase of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2010) 2010/384/: Commission Decision of 9 July 2010 on the Community-wide quantity of allowances to be issued under the EU Emission Trading Scheme for 2013 (notified under document C(2010) 4658). ''Official Journal of the European Union'' '''L 175''' 36-37 (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0384&lt;/nowiki&gt;) &lt;/ref&gt; This principle is often favoured by developed countries, as it allocates larger emissions budgets to them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''Ernst Peter Wilhelm Troeltsch''' ({{IPA-de|tʁœltʃ|lang}}; 17 February 1865 – 1 February 1923) was a German [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] [[Protestant theologian]], writer on the [[philosophy of religion]] and the [[philosophy of history]], and a [[classical liberal]] politician. He was a member of the [[history of religions school]]. His work was a synthesis of a number of strands, drawing on [[Albrecht Ritschl]], [[Max Weber]]'s conception of [[sociology]], and the [[Baden school]] of [[Neo-Kantianism]].

His ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Church'' (''Die Soziallehren der christlichen Kirchen und Gruppen'', 1912)&lt;ref&gt;Two volume edition in translation by Harper Row, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; is a seminal work in theology.

==Life==
Troeltsch was born into a Lutheran family to a doctor but went to a Catholic school in a predominantly Catholic area before attending university at the [[University of Erlangen]] and then at the [[University of Göttingen]]. His ordination in 1889 was followed in 1891 by a post teaching theology at Göttingen. In 1892, he moved on to teach at the [[University of Bonn]]; in 1894, he moved on again to [[Heidelberg University]]. Finally, in 1915, he transferred to teach at what is now the [[University of Berlin]] where he took the title of professor of philosophy and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Christian Biography|editor=Michael Walsh|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0826452639|page=1108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
Throughout Troeltsch's life, he wrote frequently of his belief that changes in society posed a threat to Christian religion, that "the disenchantment of the world" as described by sociologist [[Max Weber]] was under way. At an academic conference that took place in 1896, following a paper on the doctrine of ''[[Logos (Christianity)|logos]]'', Troeltsch responded by saying "Gentlemen, everything is tottering!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crisis in consciousness: The Thought of Ernst Troeltsch|author=Robert J. Rubanowice|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Tallahassee|page=9|year=1982|isbn=0813007216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troeltsch sought to explain the decline of religion in the modern era through a description of the historical evolution of the role of religion in society. He described European civilisation as having three periods: [[Ancient history|ancient]], [[medieval]] and [[Modern history|modern]]. Troeltsch's understanding of the border between the medieval and modern periods is revisionary: instead of claiming that modernity starts with the rise of [[Protestantism]], Troeltsch argues that early Protestantism should be understood as a continuation of the medieval period. The modern period starts much later on his account, beginning only in the seventeenth century. The Renaissance in Italy and the scientific revolution planted the seeds for the arrival of the modern period, and Protestantism delayed rather than heralded its onset. Protestantism, Troeltsch argued, was "in the first place, simply a modification of Catholicism, in which the Catholic formulation of the problems was retained, while a different answer was given to them".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rubanowice, p. 21, from ''Protestantism and Progress'' (translated by W. Montgomery, 1958), p. 59. Original title: ''Die Bedeutung des Protestantismus für die Entstehung de modernen Welt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Troeltsch saw this distinction between early and late (or "neo-") Protestantism as "the presupposition for any historical understanding of Protestantism".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Cite book|author=Toshimasa Yasukata|title=Ernst Troeltsch: Systematic Theologian of Radical Historicality|year=1986|isbn=1555400698|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, Georgia|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
Troeltsch developed three principles pertaining to critical [[historiography]]. Each of the principles served as a philosophical retort for the issue of the preconceived notions sustained by the historian. Troeltsch's three principles - the principle of criticism, the principle of analogy, and the principle of correlation - were determined to account for the issue surrounding the biases of the historian. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Historian and The Believer: The Morality of Historical Knowledge and Christian Faith|last=Harvey|first=Van Austin|publisher=Macmillan Company|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=13-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principle of criticism ===
Troeltsch's claim in this principle concludes that absolutes within history cannot exist. Troeltsch surmised that judgments about the past must be varied. In such, the absolute truth of historical reality could not exist, rather, he claimed historical situation could only be examined as more likely or less likely to have happened. In this, Troeltsch understood to never create a finite and non-revisable claim. 

=== Principle of analogy ===
This principle pertains to averting the historian from applying anachronism to the past. Troeltsch understands that the probability in the former principle can only be validated if a historians present situation, when assessing the probability, is not radically different from the past. In this, Troeltsch expects that human nature has been fairly constant throughout time, however this clause is still included as a form of accountability for the historian's narrative. 

=== Principle of correlation ===
In regards to a historical events, Troeltsch determined, through this principle, humanity's historical life is interdependent upon each individual. This understanding applies a casual nature to all events, equaling thus, an effect. Any radical event, the historian should assume, effected the historical nexus immediately surrounding that event. Troeltsch determines that in historical explanation it is important to include antecedents and consequences of events. This is in an effort to maintain historical events in their conditioned time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gesammelte Schriften II|last=Troeltsch|first=Ernst|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=729-753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Troeltsch was politically a [[classical liberal]] and served as a member of the Parliament of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. In 1918, he joined the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP). He strongly supported Germany's role in [[World War I]]: "Yesterday we took up arms. Listen to the [[ethos]] that resounds in the splendour of heroism: To your weapons, To your weapons!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/ernst-troeltsch-and-the-power-of-the-pen/a-17547502|title=Ernst Troeltsch and the power of the pen|publisher=DW.de|date=9 April 2014|author=Emma Wallis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the immediate aftermath of Troeltsch's death, his work was considered passé and irrelevant. This was part of a wider rejection of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] thought with the rise of [[Neo-Orthodoxy]] in Protestant theology, especially with the prominence of [[Karl Barth]] in the German speaking world. From 1960 onwards though, Troeltsch's thought has seen a revival of interest in academic circles with a variety of books being published on Troeltsch's theological and sociological work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/article/why-troeltsch-why-today-theology-for-the-21st-century/|title=Why Troeltsch?

'''Estonian Theatre and Music Museum''' is a national museum located in the old town of [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].  The museum was established in 1924.&lt;ref name=Muuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.muuseum.ee/en/muuseumid/eesti_muuseumid/keskmuuseumid?action=details&amp;museum_id=24|publisher=Muuseum|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Visit Estonia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.visitestonia.com/en/estonian-theatre-and-music-museum|publisher=Visit Estonia|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=all-about-estonia.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Information about national and thematic museums in Estonia|url=http://www.all-about-estonia.com/museums-in-estonia.html|publisher=all-about-estonia.com|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Estonian Theatre and Music Museum was established in 1924. Estonian music composer [[Peeter Süda]] made a huge collection of musical instruments, notes, books and other things. The purpose behind establishing this was preserving his collections.&lt;ref name=Culture.ee&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.culture.ee/location/estonian-theatre-and-music-museum|publisher=Culture.ee|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IYP&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre &amp; Music Museum|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/estonia/tallinn/sightseeing/museums/Estonian-Theatre-and-Music-Museum_7009v|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The museum has a large collection of musical and theatrical instruments and props made by local craftsmen and made outside Estonia.&lt;ref name="Visit Estonia" /&gt; The museum has two main departments— music department and theatre department. The music department has musical instruments and hand-written songs and notes of notable music composers. The theatre department provides an overview of the Estonian theatre. There are collections of old theatre photos, costumes and documents. The museum has a separate library.&lt;ref name=Culture.ee /&gt;

A '''first-person narrative''' is a [[narrative mode|mode of storytelling]] in which a narrator relays events from their own [[Narration#Narrative point of view|point of view]] using the [[grammatical person|first person ]] {{no wrap| i.e. "I" or "we", etc.}}&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: First-person narrative|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095820156|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be narrated by a first person [[protagonist]] (or other [[focal character]]), first person re-teller, first person witness,&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature Glossary - First-person Narration|url=http://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/first-person-narration.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanzel1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanzel, F.K.|title=A Theory of Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=13 March 1986|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-31063-5|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847),&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; in which the [[title character]] is also the narrator telling her own story,&lt;ref name=schmoop1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Eyre Narrator Point of View|url=http://www.shmoop.com/jane-eyre/narrator-point-of-view.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of Writing in First Person|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-writing-in-first-person.html#OlI0VVEcAI4abdEW.99|website=YourDictionary|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This device allows the audience to see the narrator's [[mind's eye]] view of the [[fictional universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evers|first1=Stuart|title=The dangers of first-person narrative|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/13/thedangersoffirstpersonnar|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view.&lt;ref name=schmoop1/&gt; Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An [[unreliable narrator]] is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiehardt|first1=Ginny|title=How to Recognize and Create an Unreliable Narrator|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-unreliable-narrator-in-fiction-1277141|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Balance|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point of view device==
The telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of "I." An example would be [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which begins "Call me Ishmael."&lt;ref name=Perdue&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/terms/firstperson.html "First Person Narration", Perdue University College of Liberal Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt; First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.

===Identity===
A story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Point of View and Narrative Voice|url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref/fiction/pov.html|website=Literary Analysis|publisher=Ohio University|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
First-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid. ''The Narrator'', Iran:Baqney. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.

Character weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. [[Unreliable narrators]] are not uncommon.

In the first-person-plural [[Narrative mode|point of view]], narrators tell the story using "we". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:

* [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "[[A Rose for Emily]]" (Faulkner was an avid experimenter in using unusual points of view; see also his ''[[Spotted Horses]]'', told in third person plural).
* [[Frank B. Gilbreth]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]'s memoir ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.
* [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "Crate."
* [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[Man Plus]]''.
* [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]''.
* [[Karen Joy Fowler]]'s ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club]]''.
* [[Joshua Ferris]]'s ''[[Then We Came to the End]]''.
* [http://thenormalschool.com/fiction/ Heidi Vornbrock Roosa's short story "Our Mother Who Art."]

Other examples include ''[[Twenty-Six Men and a Girl]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]], ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar'' by [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], ''During the Reign of the Queen of Persia'' by [[Joan Chase]], ''Our Kind'' by [[Kate Walbert]], ''[[I, Robot]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], and ''We Didn't'' by [[Stuart Dybek]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3DF1538F93BA25757C0A9629C8B63|title=We the Characters|publisher=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2007-02-25|date=April 18, 2004 | first=Laura | last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narrators can also be multiple, as in [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s ''[[In a Grove]]'' (the source for the movie ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'') and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner's]] novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''. Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.

There can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their "own" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak "live" about the same event.

The first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' or [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as "first person major" or "first person minor" points of view.

The narrator can be the [[protagonist]] (e.g., [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]] in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions ([[Dr. Watson]] in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called "frame narrators": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by [[Emily Brontë]]; and the unnamed narrator in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.

A rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are ''[[The Book Thief]]'' by [[Markus Zusak]], where the narrator is [[Death]], and ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' by [[Alice Sebold]], where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, [[Out-of-body experience|extracorporeal]] viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.

==Autobiography==
In [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]], the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include [[Jim Carroll]] in ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]'' and [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]] in ''[[Timequake]]'' (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—"the book in your hands"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]], and ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]]. Another example is a fictional "Autobiography of James T. Kirk"  which was "Edited" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's '''Star Trek''') as he wrote the novel.

==Detective fiction==
Since the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for [[detective fiction]], so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the "Watson", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of [[Doctor Watson|Dr Watson]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

==Forms==
First-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]]''; dramatic monologue, also in [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]''; or explicitly, as [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]].''

Other forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.

==Styles==
With a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

First-person narratives can tend towards a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|Interior monologue]], as in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a [[false document]], such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a [[frame story]] presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

First-person narrators are often [[unreliable narrator]]s since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''), lie (as in ''[[The Quiet American]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], or ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' series by [[Gene Wolfe]]), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], or in [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'']]). [[Henry James]] discusses his concerns about "the romantic privilege of the 'first person'" in his preface to ''[[The Ambassadors]]'', calling it "the darkest abyss of [[Romanticism|romance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goetz |first=William R. |title=Henry James and the Darkest Abyss of Romance |year=1986 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=0-8071-1259-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=35807&amp;pageno=11 ''The Ambassadors'' (p. 11) on Project Gutenberg] Accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a multi-level narrative structure is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which has a double framework: an unidentified "I" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an "I" narrator introducing a storyteller as "he" (Marlow), who talks about himself as "I" and introduces another storyteller as "he" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of "I".

==Film==
First person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23453">The [[fair trade]] movement has undergone several important changes since its early days following [[World War II]]. Fair trade, first seen as a form of charity advocated by religious organizations, has radically changed in structure, philosophy and approach. The past fifty years have witnessed massive changes in the diversity of fair trade proponents, the products traded and their distribution networks.

==The origins of fair trade==

Fair trade principles have deep roots in European societies long before the first structured [[alternative trading organization]]s (ATOs) emerged following World War II. Many of the fundamental concepts behind fair trade actually show a great resemblance with pre-capitalist ideas about the organization of the economy and society.

The notion of the ‘old moral economy’ is a fitting example of such conceptions. [[E. P. Thompson]], in his  work on 18th century England, described a society where "notions of common well being, often supported by paternalistic traditional authorities, imposed some limits on the free operations of the market".&lt;ref name="Fridell, Gavin 2003"&gt;Fridell, Gavin (2003). ''Fair Trade and the International Moral Economy: Within and Against the Market.'' CERLAC Working Paper Series.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers were then not allowed to manipulate prices by withholding their products to wait for price increases. The actions of the middlemen were always considered legally suspect, were severely restricted and the poor were provided opportunities to buy staple foods in small parcels. Fair trade was already seen as a way to address market failures; although the concept mainly revolved around consumer, rather than producer, rights.&lt;ref name="Fridell, Gavin 2003"/&gt;

In 1827 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], a moral and economic [[boycott]] of slave-derived goods began with the formation of the "Free Produce Society", founded by [[Thomas M'Clintock]] and other [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). In the [[Free produce movement]], they sought to fight against slavery with a new tactic, one that emphasized the value of the honest labor of free men and women, and to try to determine the unseen added costs to goods such as cotton and sugar which came from the toil of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard S.

In 1838, supporters from a number of states came together in the American Free Produce Association, which promoted their cause by seeking non-slave alternates to products from slaveholders, forming non-slave distribution channels, and publishing a number of pamphlets, tracts, and the journal ''Non-Slaveholder''. The movement did not grow large enough to gain the benefit of the [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]], and the cost of "free produce" was always higher than competing goods. The national association disbanded in 1847, but Quakers in Philadelphia continued until 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, Peter and McKivigan, John, editors. Williams, R. Owen, assistant editor.

There have been a few instances in which fair trade in the 'old moral economy' was focused on producer rights: as early as 1859, Dutch author [[Multatuli]] (the pen name of Eduard Douwes Dekker) questioned the injustice of the colonial and capitalist system towards commodity producers in his novel ''[[Max Havelaar]]''. The fictional tale recounts the story of Max Havelaar, a Nederlandse Trade Company employee, who leaves everything to work in solidarity with local Indonesian workers. This account draws a direct correlation between the wealth and the prosperity of Europe and the poverty of the suffering of other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P.

==Early fair trade initiatives==

In 1897 [[The Salvation Army]] launched the [[Hamodava]] Tea Company. Hamodava pioneered a fair trade model which sought to pay fair prices to the tea farmers, whilst also offering a scheme by which they could purchase plantation land on a co-operative giving them financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz/our-community/faith-in-life/our-people-our-stories/the-social-cup|title=The social cup|website=www.salvationarmy.org.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fair trade movement was shaped in the years following [[World War II]]. Early attempts to commercialize in Northern markets goods produced by marginalised producers were initiated by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).

The [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml Crafts and Food]. Accessed August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The products, almost exclusively [[handicrafts]] ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold by volunteers in 'charity stores' or 'ethnic shops'. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Hockerts, K. (2005). [http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf The Fair Trade Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071706/http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf |date=2006-08-23 }}. p1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solidarity trade==
[[File:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb|left|Fair Trade goods sold in Worldshops]]
The modern fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against [[neo-imperialism]]: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The global free market economic model came under attack during that period and fair trade ideals, built on a [[Post Keynesian economics]] approach to economies where price is directly linked to the actual production costs and where all producers are given fair and equal access to the markets, gained in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p4&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan at the time, "Trade not Aid", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the [[developing world]].&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history2.shtml Where did it all begin?] URL accessed on August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the first ATO was created: British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched "[[Helping-by-Selling]]", a program which later developed into [[Bridge (program)|Bridge]]. The scheme sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the [[United Kingdom]] and from mail-order catalogues with a circulation of almost 100,000 copies. The program was created to support the work of [[cooperative]]s and community enterprises in the developing world. The program was highly successful: it remained one of the largest and most influential in the sector and then changed in 2002 as more mainstream retailers were persuaded to carry fair trade products. Globally Oxfam still works in many countries on fair trade programs and runs hundreds of shops across Europe and Australia selling and promoting fair trade goods.

In 1969, the first Worldshop opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods such as handcrafts produced under fair trade terms in "underdeveloped regions". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and in other Western European countries.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from [[Angola]] and [[Nicaragua]] in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world’s market, and you support their self-determined sustainable development. The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then at least in terms of dozens of ATOs being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Julius Nyerere]] and the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]]: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world’s markets and consumers.

==Handcrafts vs. agricultural goods==
In the early 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced a major challenge: the novelty of some fair trade products started wearing off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look "tired and old fashioned" in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Redfern A. 2002 p6"&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p6&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, fair trade supporters during this period became increasingly worried by the impact of the fall of agricultural [[commodity]] prices on poor producers. Many then believed it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and to find innovative remedies to address the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations the perfect substitute to the stagnating handicrafts market. The collapse of the [[International Coffee Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/business/coffee-price-talks-foreseen.html |title=Coffee Price Talks Foreseen - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989 fueled the extraordinary growth of the [[fair trade coffee]] market, providing a powerful narrative for a new breed of fair trade brand that engaged producers directly in consumer operations. Cafédirect is a good example of this new thinking and was the first fair trade brand to be found in UK supermarkets. Dedicated to the mainstream, Cafédirect created focused on consumer engagement and language and built a reputation for quality, justifying its premium positioning with the tag-line "We pay more, so you get the pick of the crop".

The first fair trade agricultural products were [[coffee]] and [[tea]], quickly followed by dried [[fruits]], cocoa, sugar, [[fruit juices]], [[rice]], [[spices]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Coffee quickly became the main growth engine behind fair trade: between 25 and 50% of the total alternative trading organization turnover in 2005 came from coffee sales.&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history4.shtml Market Access and Fair Trade Labeling]. URL accessed on August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm in 1992, in 2002 handcrafts accounted for 25.4% of sales while commodity food lines were up at 69.4%.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. &amp; Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to agricultural commodities was further highlighted in 2002, when Oxfam decided to abandon its loss-making handcrafts trading program after 27 years of existence. Oxfam’s move had significant consequences on the entire fair trade movement. Some ATOs saw this as an opportunity to restructure and partner up with mainstream businesses in an effort to find economic efficiencies and broaden their appeal, while others (such as Alternativ Handel in [[Norway]]), unable to adjust to the market and plagued by financial difficulties, were forced to close.

Today, many ATOs still exclusively sell handcrafts - which they judge culturally and economically preferable to agricultural commodities. While these are still considered fair trade flagship products, academics have described them as a [[niche market]] that now only appeals to relatively small segments of the population, mostly fair trade core supporters who buy products on the basis of the story behind the product.&lt;ref name="Redfern A. 2002 p6"/&gt;

==Rise of labelling initiatives==
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to product labelling''
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]] --&gt;&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Oldftlogos2.jpg for rationale --&gt;Sales of fair trade products however only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade labelling]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small Worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, [[North America]]. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, M.-C., (2003). Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions. Journal of Rural Studies, 19, 87-96.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade label, Max Havelaar, was launched under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans van der Hoff]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[ecumenical]] [[development agency]] [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the [[worldshops]] and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p7&lt;/ref&gt;

On the producer end, the Max Havelaar initiative offered disadvantaged producers following various social and environmental standards a fair price, significantly above the market price, for their crop. The coffee, originating from the [[UCIRI]] cooperative in Mexico, was imported by Dutch company [[Van Weely]], roasted by [[Neuteboom]], sold directly to [[world shops]] and, for the first time, to mainstream retailers across the [[Netherlands]].

The initiative was groundbreaking as for the first time Fairtrade coffee was sold in supermarkets and mass-retailers, therefore reaching a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labelling also allowed consumers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the farmers at the end of the [[supply chain]].
The initiative was a great success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called "Max Havelaar" (in [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[France]]), "Transfair" (in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Italy]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]]), or carrying a national name: "Fairtrade  Mark" in the UK and [[Ireland]], "Rättvisemärkt" in [[Sweden]], and "Reilu Kauppa" in [[Finland]].

|}Initially, the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs each had their own Fairtrade standards, product committees and monitoring systems. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives") – started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.

The Fairtrade Certification Mark harmonization process is still under way – today, all but two labelling initiatives ([[Transfair USA]] &amp; [[TransFair Canada]]) have adopted the new International Fairtrade Certification Mark. Full transition to the new Fairtrade Mark should become reality as it gradually replaces the old certification marks at various speeds in various countries.

In January 2004, FLO was divided into two independent organizations: [[FLO International]], which sets Fairtrade standards and provides producer business support, and [[FLO-CERT]], which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.

At present, over 20 Labelling Initiatives are members of FLO International. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO’s certification for [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mangoes]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juices]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herbs]] and [[spices]], [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]] etc.

== WFTO and the FTO Mark ==
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade certification system and allow for example handcraft producers to also sell their products outside [[worldshops]], the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), formerly the International Fair Trade Association (founded 1989), launched a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations in 2004 (as opposed to products in the case of Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and guarantees that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour and the environment.

The FTO Mark gave for the first time Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable recognition amongst consumers, existing and new business partners, governments and donors.

==Fair trade today==
Global fair trade sales have soared over the past decade. The increase has been particularly spectacular among Fairtrade labelled goods:  In 2007, [[Fairtrade certification|Fair trade certified]] sales amounted to approximately €2.3 billion (US $3.62 billion) worldwide, a 47% year-to-year increase.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2008). http://www.fairtrade.net/single_view.html?&amp;cHash=d6f2e27d2c&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=104&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=41.

An '''induction''' in a [[Play (theatre)|play]] is an explanatory scene, summary or other text  that stands outside and apart from the main action with the intent to comment on it, moralize about it or in the case of [[dumb show]] to summarize the plot or underscore what is afoot. Typically, an induction precedes the main text of a play. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and performed in the [[Renaissance]] period, including those of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the address to the audience by Puck in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. Another example, in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' by [[Thomas Kyd]], is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise, Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' opens with induction scenes which involve characters watching the play proper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4211">'''Manomet, Inc.''' is a non-profit organization headquartered in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], with an office in [[Brunswick, Maine]].

Manomet scientists work with private industry, nonprofit and governmental partners across North and South America to create a more sustainable world. Manomet works in the areas of conservation, business sustainability and science education.

==History==
Manomet is a non-profit research organization which was founded as the '''Manomet Bird Observatory''' in 1969 and was called '''Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences''' until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://www.manomet.org/about-us|publisher=Manomet Center for Conservation Science|accessdate=14 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628031617/http://www.manomet.org/about-manomet/our-story|archivedate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Manomet is named for the coastal village in New England where its headquarters have been for more than 45 years. A Native American word, the name Manomet means portage path.

Manomet focuses its programs where they will have measurable impact and opportunity for scale: 
*Climate Services — Integrating science and stakeholder networks to identify and implement nature–based solutions to climate change.
*Landbird Conservation — Using long-term research and education to connect people to nature.
*Shorebird Recovery — Engaging a diverse coalition of people and organizations across the Americas to develop and implement science-based solutions to conserve imperiled shorebirds.
*Sustainable Economies — Advising partners on practices to enhance economic viability and human well-being while measurably reducing their environmental footprint

==Recent Studies==
In June 2010, Manomet published the Biomass Sustainability and Carbon Policy Study. The study, which was commissioned by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, investigated questions about generating electricity from biomass fuel, including the net effect of biomass energy on atmospheric carbon balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass Sustainability and Carbon Policy Study|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eoeeaterminal&amp;L=4&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Energy%2C+Utilities+%26+Clean+Technologies&amp;L2=Renewable+Energy&amp;L3=Biomass&amp;sid=Eoeea&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=doer_arra_bscps&amp;csid=Eoeea|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from [[wood fuel|burning wood]] are initially higher than from fossil fuels, but the carbon sequestered by regrowing forests can yield lower greenhouse gas levels over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zeller|first=Tom|title=Q. and A.: Woody Biomass, Pros and Cons|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/q-and-a-woody-biomass-pros-and-cons/|accessdate=August 1, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manomet is also known for its long-term shorebird research in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winn|first=Brad|title=The Boston Globe's Green Blog: The Stark Drama Of Nature |url=https://www.manomet.org/news/boston-globes-green-blog-stark-drama-nature | publisher = Manomet Bird Observatory |accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service selected Manomet to lead a $3 million, seven-month study to assess the impact on shorebirds from the massive [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daley|first=Beth|title=Manomet Center Leads Gulf Shorebird Study|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/greenblog/2010/09/manomet_center_leads_gulf_shor.html|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neanderthal genome ==
In July 2006, the Max Planck Institute for [[Evolutionary Anthropology]] and [[454 Life Sciences]] announced that they would be [[sequencing]] the [[Neanderthal Genome Project|Neanderthal genome]]. Results of the study were published in the May 2010 journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' detailing an initial draft of the Neanderthal genome based on the analysis of four billion base pairs of Neanderthal DNA. It was thought that a comparison of the Neanderthal genome and human genome would expand our understanding of Neanderthals, as well as the evolution of humans and human brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Neanderthal genome project launches | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13955661/ | accessdate = 2006-08-22 | author = Moulson, Geir | publisher = Associated Press | work = [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/ MSNBC.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study determined that some mixture of genes occurred between Neanderthals and [[anatomically modern humans]] and presented evidence that elements of their genome remain in that of non-African modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Green RE, Krause J, Briggs AW, etal |title=A draft sequence of the Neandertal genome |journal=Science |volume=328 |issue=5979 |pages=710–22 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20448178 |doi=10.1126/science.1188021 |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/press/presskit-neandertal/pdf/Science_Green.pdf |pmc=5100745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/press/presskit-neandertal/pdf/PR_MPI_Neandertal_EN.pdf The Neanderthal in Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA researcher [[Svante Pääbo]] tested more than 70 Neanderthal specimens and found only one that had enough DNA to sample. Preliminary DNA sequencing from a 38,000-year-old bone fragment from a [[femur]] found in 1980 at [[Vindija Cave]] in Croatia shows that [[Neanderthal]]s and ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' share about 99.5% of their DNA. It is believed that the two species shared a common ancestor about 500,000 years ago. The authors of the ''Nature'' article have calculated that the species diverged about 516,000 years ago, whereas fossil records show a time of about 400,000 years ago. From DNA records, scientists hope to confirm or deny the theory that there was interbreeding between the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/15/science/16neanderthalcnd.html | work=The New York Times | title=New Machine Sheds Light on DNA of Neanderthals | first=Nicholas | last=Wade | date=November 15, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early ''Homo sapiens'' ==
Dating carried out by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig revealed that the [[Jebel Irhoud]] site and its ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were far older than first thought. Fresh excavations revealed the remains of at least five people and a number of stone tools. The finds included part of a skull, a jawbone, teeth and limb bones which had come from three adults, a juvenile, and a child aged about seven and a half years old.&lt;ref name="HublinBen-Ncer2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hublin|first1=Jean-Jacques|last2=Ben-Ncer|first2=Abdelouahed|last3=Bailey|first3=Shara E.|last4=Freidline|first4=Sarah E.|last5=Neubauer|first5=Simon|last6=Skinner|first6=Matthew M.|last7=Bergmann|first7=Inga|last8=Le Cabec|first8=Adeline|last9=Benazzi|first9=Stefano|last10=Harvati|first10=Katerina|last11=Gunz|first11=Philipp|title=New fossils from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco and the pan-African origin of Homo sapiens|journal=Nature|volume=546|issue=7657|year=2017|pages=289–292|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature22336}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bones looked similar facially to those of humans today, but had much larger lower jaws and elongated braincases. They have similar features to a [[Florisbad Skull|skull]] dating to 260,000 years ago found at the other end of the continent, in [[Florisbad]], [[South Africa]], which has been attributed to ''Homo sapiens'' on the basis of the Jebel Irhoud finds.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/07/oldest-homo-sapiens-bones-ever-found-shake-foundations-of-the-human-story|title=Oldest Homo sapiens bones ever found shake foundations of the human story|last=Sample|first=Ian|work=The Guardian|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HublinBen-Ncer2017" /&gt;

[[File:Hublin at Jebel Irhoud.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Jacques Hublin]] at Jebel Irhoud (Morocco), pointing to the crushed human skull (Irhoud 10) whose orbits are visible just beyond his finger tip.]]
The tools were found alongside gazelle bones and lumps of charcoal, indicating the presence of fire and probably of cooking in the cave. The gazelle bones showed characteristic signs of butchery and cooking, such as cut marks, notches consistent with marrow extraction, and charring.&lt;ref name="RichterGrün2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richter|first1=Daniel|last2=Grün|first2=Rainer|last3=Joannes-Boyau|first3=Renaud|last4=Steele|first4=Teresa E.|last5=Amani|first5=Fethi|last6=Rué|first6=Mathieu|last7=Fernandes|first7=Paul|last8=Raynal|first8=Jean-Paul|last9=Geraads|first9=Denis|last10=Ben-Ncer|first10=Abdelouahed|last11=Hublin|first11=Jean-Jacques|last12=McPherron|first12=Shannon P.|title=The age of the hominin fossils from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, and the origins of the Middle Stone Age|journal=Nature|volume=546|issue=7657|year=2017|pages=293–296|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature22335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tools had been burned due to fires being lit on top of them, presumably after they had been discarded. This enabled the researchers to use [[thermoluminescence dating]] to ascertain when the burning had happened, and by proxy the age of the fossil bones, which were found in the same deposit layer. The burnt tools were dated to around 315,000 years ago, indicating that the fossils are of about the same age. This conclusion was confirmed by recalculating the age of the Irhoud 3 mandible, which produced an age range compatible with that of the tools at roughly 280,000 to 350,000 years old. This would make the remains the earliest known examples of ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/science/human-fossils-morocco.html|title=Oldest Fossils of Homo Sapiens Found in Morocco, Altering History of Our Species|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|work=The New York Times|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdYong2017June"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/the-oldest-known-human-fossils-have-been-found-in-an-unusual-place/529452/ |title= Scientists Have Found the Oldest Known Human Fossils |last=Yong|first=Ed |author-link= Ed Yong |date=7 June 2017 |work= [[The Atlantic]] |accessdate= 7 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This suggests that, rather than modern humans arising in East Africa around 200,000 years ago, it appears that humans may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to Jean-Jacques Hublin, "The idea is that early ''Homo sapiens'' dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a "green [[Sahara]]", around 300,000 to 330,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/world-s-oldest-homo-sapiens-fossils-found-morocco|title=World’s oldest Homo sapiens fossils found in Morocco|last=Gibbons|first=Ann|work=[[Science (magazine)|Science]]|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Atlas of Language Structures ==
In 2005, the [[World Atlas of Language Structures]], a project of the institute's former Department of Linguistics, was published. The Atlas consists of over 140 maps, each displaying a particular language feature – for example [http://wals.info/feature/87 order of adjective and noun] – for between 120 and 1370 languages of the world. In 2008 the [http://wals.info/ Atlas was also published online] and the underlying database made freely available.

They used to maintain also the [[Glottolog]] until 2015, when it was taken over by the [[Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History]] in [[Jena]].

== Early childhood language acquisition ==

{{main|Language acquisition#Chunking}}

Researchers at the institute have developed a computer model analyzing early toddler conversations to predict the structure of later conversations. They showed that toddlers develop their own individual rules for speaking with slots into which they could put certain kinds of words. The rules inferred from toddler speech were better predictors of subsequent speech than traditional grammars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news173979856.html "Toddlers develop individualized rules for grammar", October 5, 2009, [[PhysOrg]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mexican Institute of Petroleum''' (in [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]: '''''Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo, IMP''''') is a public research organization dedicated to develop technical solutions, conduct [[basic research|basic]] and [[applied research]] and provide specialized training to [[Pemex]], the state-owned [[government-granted monopoly]] in [[Mexico]]'s [[petroleum industry]].&lt;ref name="imp"&gt; {{citeweb | author = Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo | title = Acerca del IMP | url = http://www.imp.mx/acerca/ | language = Spanish | accessdate = 2008-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was founded on 23 August 1965 by federal decree and is based in [[Mexico City]]. Despite facing significant budget constraints in recent years and being accused of depending excessively on foreign technology by noted physicist [[Leopoldo García-Colín]],&lt;ref name="fortuna"&gt;

'''Neuropsychiatry''' is a branch of [[medicine]] that deals with [[mental disorders]] attributable to diseases of the [[nervous system]]. It preceded the current disciplines of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]], which had common training,&lt;ref name=YH2002&gt;

Nevertheless, neuropsychiatry has become a growing subspecialty of [[psychiatry]] and it is also closely related to the fields of [[neuropsychology]] and [[behavioral neurology]].

==The case for the rapprochement of neurology and psychiatry==
Given the considerable overlap between these subspecialities, there has been a resurgence of interest and debate relating to neuropsychiatry in academia over the last decade.&lt;ref name=YH2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=M2002&gt;{{cite journal

Most of this work argues for a rapprochement of neurology and psychiatry, forming a specialty above and beyond a subspecialty of psychiatry. For example, Professor [[Joseph B. Martin]], former Dean of [[Harvard Medical School]] and a [[neurologist]] by training, has summarized the argument for reunion: "the separation of the two categories is arbitrary, often influenced by beliefs rather than proven scientific observations. And the fact that the brain and mind are one makes the separation artificial anyway."&lt;ref name="M2002"/&gt; These points and some of the other major arguments are detailed below.

===Mind/brain monism===
Neurologists have focused objectively on [[organic (model)|organic]] nervous system [[pathology]], especially of the [[brain]], whereas psychiatrists have laid claim to illnesses of the [[mind]]. This [[:wikt:antipodal|antipodal]] distinction between brain and mind as two different entities has characterized many of the differences between the two specialties. However, it has been argued that this division is fictional; evidence from the last century of research has shown that our mental life has its roots in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=M2002/&gt; Brain and mind have been argued not to be discrete entities but just different ways of looking at the same system (Marr, 1982). It has been argued that embracing this mind/brain [[monism]] may be useful for several reasons. First, rejecting dualism implies that all mentation is biological, which provides a common research framework in which understanding and treatment of mental disorders can be advanced. Second, it mitigates widespread confusion about the legitimacy of mental illness by suggesting that all disorders should have a footprint in the brain.

In sum, a reason for the division between [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] was the distinction between mind or first-person experience and the brain. That this difference is taken to be artificial by proponents of mind/brain monism supports a merge between these specialties.

===Causal pluralism===
One of the reasons for the divide is that [[neurology]] traditionally looks at the causes of disorders from an "inside-the-skin" perspective ([[neuropathology]], [[genetics]]) whereas [[psychiatry]] looks at "outside-the-skin" [[Causality|causation]] (personal, interpersonal, cultural).&lt;ref name=K2005/&gt; This dichotomy is argued not to be instructive and authors have argued that it is better conceptualized as two ends of a causal continuum.&lt;ref name=K2005/&gt; The benefits of this position are: firstly, understanding of [[etiology]] will be enriched, in particular between [[brain]] and [[social environment|environment]]. One example is [[eating disorders]], which have been found to have some neuropathology (Uher and Treasure, 2005) but also show increased incidence in rural Fijian school girls after exposure to [[television]] (Becker, 2004). Another example is [[schizophrenia]], the risk for which may be considerably reduced in a healthy family environment (Tienari et al., 2004).

It is also argued that this augmented understanding of etiology will lead to better remediation and rehabilitation strategies through an understanding of the different levels in the causal process where one can intervene. It may be that non-organic interventions, like [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), better attenuate disorders alone or in conjunction with drugs. Linden's (2006) demonstration of how [[psychotherapy]] has neurobiological commonalities with [[pharmacotherapy]] is a pertinent example of this and is encouraging from a patient perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.

In sum, the argument is that an understanding of the mental disorders must not only have a specific knowledge of brain constituents and genetics (inside-the-skin) but also the context (outside-the-skin) in which these parts operate (Koch and Laurent, 1999). Only by joining neurology and psychiatry, it is argued, can this nexus be used to reduce human suffering.

===Organic basis===
To further sketch psychiatry's history shows a departure from structural neuropathology, relying more upon [[ideology]] (Sabshin, 1990). A good example of this is [[Tourette syndrome]], which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of [[masturbation]] caused by sexual repression. However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in attenuating symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained pathophysiological support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000). This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting [[neurology]] and [[psychiatry]] because both are dealing with disorders of the same system.

===Improved patient care===
Further, it is argued that this nexus will allow a more refined [[nosology]] of mental illness to emerge thus helping to improve [[therapy|remediation]] and [[psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] strategies beyond current ones that lump together ranges of symptoms. However, it cuts both ways: traditionally neurological disorders, like [[Parkinson's disease]], are being recognized for their high incidence of traditionally psychiatric symptoms, like [[psychosis]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]] (Lerner and Whitehouse, 2002). These symptoms, which are largely ignored in [[neurology]],&lt;ref name="YH2002"/&gt; can be addressed by neuropsychiatry and lead to improved patient care. In sum, it is argued that patients from both traditional psychiatry and neurology departments will see their care improved following a reuniting of the specialties.

===Better management model===
Schiffer et al. (2004) argue that there are good management and financial reasons for rapprochement.

==US institutions==
"Behavioral Neurology &amp; Neuropsychiatry" fellowships are accredited by the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS; [http://www.ucns.org www.ucns.org]), in a manner analogous to the accreditation of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] residencies in the United States by the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]] (ABPN).

The [[American Neuropsychiatric Association]] (ANPA) was established in 1988 and is the American medical subspecialty society for neuropsychiatrists. ANPA holds an annual meeting and offers other forums for education and professional networking amongst subspecialists in behavioral neurology &amp; neuropsychiatry as well as clinicians, scientists, and educators in related fields. American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. publishes the peer-reviewed ''[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]]'', which is the official journal of ANPA.

==International organizations==
The International Neuropsychiatric Association was established in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Neuropsychiatric Association|url=http://www.inawebsite.org/|website=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; INA holds congresses biennially in countries around the world and partners with regional neuropsychiatric associations around the world to support regional neuropsychiatric conferences and to facilitate the development of neuropsychiatry in the countries/regions where those conferences are held. Prof. Robert  Haim Belmaker &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://haimbelmaker.co.il/en/|title=אתר הבית של פרופ' חיים בלמקר|website=haimbelmaker.co.il|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current President of the organization whereas [[Ennapadam Srinivas Krishnamoorthy|Prof. Ennapadam S Krishnamoorthy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neurokrish  - The Neuropsychiatry Center|url=http://neurokrish.com/founder-team/our-founder/}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as President-Elect with Dr. Gilberto Brofman as Secretary-Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Neuropsychiatric Association|url=http://www.inawebsite.org/#!committees-/ieaoy/|website=Committee Members }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British NeuroPsychiatry Association (BNPA) was founded in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/pbrcpsych/12/5/174.2.full.pdf|title=Bulletin Of The Royal College Of Psychiatrists|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the leading academic and professional body for medical practitioners and professionals allied to medicine in the UK working at the interface of the clinical and cognitive neurosciences and psychiatry.

Recently, a new non-profit professional society named [[Neuropsychiatric Forum|Neuropsychiatric Forum (NPF)]] was founded. NPF aims to support effective communication and interdisciplinary collaboration, develop education schemes and research projects, organize neuropsychiatric conferences and seminars.

[[File:Material on conveyor during commissioning (7548464136).jpg|thumb|Commissioning of a conveyor where equipment is being tested to its maximum rating and capacity of operation.]]

'''Project commissioning''' is the process of assuring that all systems and components of a [[building]] or [[industrial plant]] are designed, installed, tested, operated, and maintained according to the operational requirements of the owner or final client. A commissioning process may be applied not only to new [[project]]s but also to existing units and systems subject to expansion, [[renovation]] or [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|revamping]].&lt;ref&gt; HORSLEY, D. Process Plant Commissioning, a User Guide, Institution of Chemical Engineering, 1998. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; FARES, F., MONTENEGRO, B., PRATES, A., ''Commissioning of Oil &amp; Gas Projects – Current Status, Evolution and Trends''. in: Rio Oil &amp; Gas 2010, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, set 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the commissioning process comprises the integrated application of a set of [[engineering]] techniques and procedures to check, inspect and test every operational component of the project, from individual functions, such as [[measurement instrument|instrument]]s and equipment, up to complex amalgamations such as [[Modular design|module]]s, [[subsystem]]s and [[system]]s.

Commissioning activities, in the broader sense, are applicable to all phases of the project, from the basic and detailed [[design]], [[procurement]], [[construction]] and [[manufacturing|assembly]], until the final handover of the unit to the owner, including sometimes an [[assisted operation]] phase.

== Independent discipline ==
Commissioning of large civil and industrial projects is a complex and sophisticated technical specialty which may be considered as a specific and independent  [[:Category:Engineering disciplines|engineering discipline]]. As such, it can be as important as the more traditional ones, i.e. [[civil engineering|civil]], [[naval architecture|naval]], [[chemical engineering|chemical]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[instrumentation]], [[automation]], or [[telecommunications engineering|telecom]] engineering. Large projects for which this statement can be made include chemical and petrochemical [[plants]], [[oil platform|oil and gas platforms]] and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], metallurgical plants, paper and cellulose plants, coal handling plants, thermoelectric and hydroelectric plants, buildings, bridges, highways, and railroads.

However, there is currently no formal education or university degree which addresses the training or certification of a "Project Commissioning Engineer". Various short training courses and on-line training are available, but they are designed for qualified engineers. Commissioning for buildings is a specific discipline in itself, and there are qualifications available for this.

The International Association of Commissioning Engineers (IACE) was formed in 2015 by a group of Commissioning Professionals, and launched in January 2016. IACE is preparing accredited qualifications to fill the gap in the academic landscape for Commissioning Engineers.

== Objective and impact  ==

The main objective of commissioning is to affect the safe and orderly [[handover]] of the unit from the constructor to the owner, guaranteeing its [[operability]] in terms of [[performance]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], safety and information [[traceability]]. Additionally, when executed in a planned and effective way, commissioning normally represents an essential factor for the fulfillment of schedule, costs, safety and quality requirements of the project. &lt;ref&gt; BENDIKSEN, T., YOUNG, G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GNOPuByI6eoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commissioning of Offshore Oil and Gas Projects: The Manager's Handbook], AuthorHouse Publishers, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Commissioning management systems  ==

For complex projects, the large volume and complexity of commissioning data, together with the need to guarantee adequate information traceability, normally leads to the use of powerful [[Information technology|IT]] tools, known as [[commissioning management systems]], to allow effective planning and monitoring of the commissioning activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3293">{{Refimprove|article|date=September 2008}}'''Pyrophilia''' is a relatively uncommon [[paraphilia]] in which a subject derives gratification from [[fire]] and fire-starting activity. It is distinguished from [[pyromania]] by the gratification being of a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] nature.

==Description==
While the erotic focus immediately raises the diagnostic issue of pyromania, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV]] classifies this disorder as an [[impulse-control disorder]], with nothing to indicate or suggest an overlap between this disorder and the paraphilias.

Other than the purposeful act of fire-setting itself, there is no mention of the possibility that the tension or affective arousal experienced before the act; the fascination with, interest in, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (for example, [[paraphernalia]], uses, consequences); or the pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting, witnessing, or participating in the aftermath of fires might be sexual in nature or even contain a [[sexual arousal]] component.

Some described cases of pyrophilia do not include behaviors commonly associated with pyromania, such as being a regular “watcher” at fires in his neighbourhood; setting off [[false alarm]]s; deriving pleasure from institutions, equipment, and personnel associated with fire, spending time at the local [[fire station]], setting fires in order to be affiliated with the fire department; and either showing indifference to the consequences to life and property caused by the fire or deriving satisfaction from the resulting destruction of property. [[Orgasm|Sexual gratification]] need not involve actual fire; arousal or [[masturbatory]] aids may include fantasies or talk of setting a fire. In other instances, the patient may derive arousal primarily from setting or watching their fire.

Pyrophilia has been diagnosed in very few instances, and is not fully accepted by the general [[psychological]] community.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}.

Pyrophilia is the main subject of [[Ricardo Abdahllah]]'s novel [[Pyretta Blaze]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Type O Negative]] song inspired by and named after the book. Pyrophilia is also seen in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s novel series [[A Song of Ice and Fire]], where several characters including [[Aerys Targaryen]] show symptoms of Pyrophilia and Pyromania.

'''Recruit training''', more commonly known as '''basic training''' or colloquially '''boot camp''', refers to the initial instruction of new [[military personnel]]. Recruit training is a physically and psychologically intensive process, which [[Resocialization|resocializes]] its subjects for the demands of military employment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title='Joining the ranks: The role of indoctrination in transforming civilians to service members', (in 'Military life: The psychology of serving in peace and combat [vol. 2]')|last=McGurk et al.|first=|publisher=Praeger Security International|year=2006|isbn=978-0275983024|location=Westport|pages=13–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major characteristics ==
Initial military training is an intensive residential programme normally lasting several weeks or months, which aims to induct [[Military recruitment|newly recruited military personnel]] into the [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and essential tasks of the armed forces. Common features include [[foot drill]], inspections, physical training, weapons training, and a [[Passing out (military)|graduation parade]].

The training process [[resocialization|resocializes]] recruits to the demands made of them by military life. Psychological conditioning techniques are used to shape attitudes and behaviours, so that recruits will obey all orders, face mortal danger, and kill their opponents in battle.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/publications/docs/LCIreport.pdf|title=Final report of the Learning Culture Inquiry|last=Australia, Department of Defence|first=|date=2006|website=|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winslow|first=Donna|date=2004|title=Misplaced Loyalties: The Role of Military Culture in the Breakdown of Discipline in Two Peace Operations|url=http://jmss.org/jmss/index.php/jmss/article/view/214|journal=Journal of Military and Strategic Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|issn=1488-559X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427757599|title=On killing : the psychological cost of learning to kill in war and society|last=Dave.|first=Grossman,|date=2009|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|isbn=9780316040938|edition=Rev.|location=New York|oclc=427757599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25283124|title=Squaddies : portrait of a subculture|last=John.|first=Hockey,|date=1986|publisher=University of Exeter|isbn=9780859892483|location=Exeter, Devon|oclc=25283124}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an expert in United States military training methods, [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]], recruit training makes extensive use of four types of conditioning techniques: [[role model]]ing, [[classical conditioning]], [[operant conditioning]], and [[brutalization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the Canadian military historian [[Gwynne Dyer]], inductees are required to partially submerge their individuality for the good of their unit; this is essential because military organizations, unlike civilian ones, require their members to endure stress and perform actions that are normally absent in civilian life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The resocialization of recruit training operates in several ways, as follows:

=== Confinement and suppression ===

Once their training has begun, the right of recruits to leave the military estate (or to quit the armed forces) is denied or tightly restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/about-policies-standards-defence-admin-orders-directives-5000/5002-1.page#cc|title=DAOD 5002-1 - Enrolment|last=Canada, National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces|first=|date=2017|website=www.forces.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf|title=Terms and conditions of service|last=British Army|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072744/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-01|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.time.com/2012/05/04/why-is-getting-out-of-the-u-s-army-so-tough/|title=Why Is Getting Out of the U.S. Army So Tough?|last=Kristiansen|first=Ryan|work=Time|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By shaving the head, issuing uniforms, denying privacy, and prohibiting the use of first names, individuality is suppressed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Control and conformity ===
Recruits' daily routine is highly controlled, in the manner of the '[[total institution]]' described by the Canadian-American sociologist [[Erving Goffman]]. For example, the training regime determines how recruits must make their beds, polish boots, and stack their clothes; mistakes are punished.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Peter G.|date=1967-05-01|title=Some Observations on the Psychosocial Phenomena Seen in Basic Training|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.1967.11023507|journal=Psychiatry|volume=30|issue=2|pages=187–196|doi=10.1080/00332747.1967.11023507|issn=0033-2747|pmid=27791700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[File:Postawa.zasadnicza.jpg|thumb|[[Polish Armed Forces|Polish army]] recruits on [[foot drill]], 2007]]
Throughout their training, recruits are conditioned to [[Conformity|conform]] to military [[Norm (social)|norms]]. In particular, recruits are repeatedly instructed to stand, march, and respond to orders in a ritual known as [[foot drill]], which is derived from 18th-century military practices and trains recruits to obey orders without hesitation or question. According to [[Finnish Army]] regulations,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} for example, foot drill is essential for the [[esprit de corps]] and cohesion; gets the recruits used to instinctive obedience; enables large units to be marched and moved in an orderly manner; and creates the basis for action in the battlefield.

=== Stress and punishment ===
The training process applies [[stressor]]s continuously. Instructors may deprive recruits of sleep, food, or shelter; shout personal [[insult]]s; use physical [[aggression]]; or give orders intended to [[Humiliation|humiliate]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to specialists in US recruit training, the conditions of continuous stress deplete recruits' resistance to the demands made of them:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The intense workload and sleep restriction experienced by military recruits leaves them little attention capacity for processing the messages they receive about new norms… Therefore, recruits should be less likely to devote their remaining cognitive effort to judging the quality of persuasive messages and will be more likely to be persuaded by the messages…"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Evidence from Canada, the UK, the US and elsewhere shows that [[punishment]]s are used routinely to condition group conformity and discourage poor performance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenhart|first=R. Wayne|date=1975-10-01|title=You Can't Hack It Little Girl: A Discussion of the Covert Psychological Agenda of Modern Combat Training|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1975.tb01008.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=13–23|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1975.tb01008.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of group punishment in [[Canadian Army|Canadian army]] training, for example, has been described as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Coming from civilian society that elevates the individual, recruits are now in a world where the institutional value of the group is supreme. One has to be a team player or risk ostracism. The military does things quite deliberately to intensify the power of group pressure within its ranks. The group is made responsible for each member... even though it may seem manifestly unfair to make the group suffer for the individual."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Bonding and the hierarchy of esteem ===
As a buffer against the stressful conditions of their training, the trainee group normally forms a strong bond of mutual [[loyalty]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dornbusch|first=Sanford M.|date=1955-05-01|title=The Military Academy as an Assimilating Institution|url=https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/33/4/316/2225997|journal=Social Forces|volume=33|issue=4|pages=316–321|doi=10.2307/2573000|issn=0037-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in the US have described it as an intense "we-feeling", which can feel more powerful than the civilian bonds that recruits are familiar with.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2006, an official report on [[Australian Defence Force]] training explained the importance of the group bond:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Willingness to apply [[Deadly force|lethal force]] requires… sufficient bonding within the team to override each individual’s natural human resistance to kill. The toughness and bonding required increases the closer the contact with the [[enemy]]."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Recruits are taught to be proud of their identity as professional military personnel, and of their [[Military unit|unit]] in particular.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Heroic [[regiment]]al stories and symbols are used to ennoble the recruits' own unit above others, and above other branches of the armed forces, thereby establishing a [[hierarchy]] of esteem (also known as a hierarchy of [[respect]]); the same stories are used to draw a contrast with inferior [[Norm (social)|norms]] associated with civilian life.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/569431|title=The soldier and the state : the theory and politics of civil-military relations|last=P.|first=Huntington, Samuel|date=1957|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674817364|location=Cambridge|oclc=569431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/369563/19931021-Army_Discipline_and_Standards_Paper-AG.pdf|title=The Discipline and Standards Paper|last=British Army|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/433769/QR_Army.pdf|title=Queen's Regulations for the Army (Annex B: Values and Standards of the British Army)|last=British Army|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/07/the-widening-gap-between-military-and-society/306158/|title=The Widening Gap Between Military and Society|last=Ricks|first=Thomas E.|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aggression and objectification ===
[[File:Drill instructor at the Officer Candidate School.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] [[drill instructor]] shouts at [[Officer cadet|officer]] trainees, 2009.]]
Evidence from Australia, the UK and the US shows that recruit training systematically stimulates [[aggression]], particularly in those enlisted for ground [[close combat]] roles.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=No more heroes: Masculinity in the infantry (in P Highgate [ed.], 'Military masculinities: Identity and the state')|last=Hockey|first=J|publisher=Praeger|year=2003|isbn=|location=Westport, CT|pages=15–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Forces TV|title=VIP Visitor Adds Pressure to Parachute Regiment Recruits {{!}} Forces TV|date=2014-06-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tCOcLqHqNI|accessdate=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Bayonet]] practice is an example, as the strong language of this instruction from a [[British Army|British army]] [[corporal]] illustrates:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I wanna see it in your eyes that you wanna kill these fuckers.

To further enable recruits to kill on demand, they are taught to [[Objectification|objectify]] ([[Dehumanization|dehumanize]]) their opponent in battle as an ‘enemy target’ to ‘be engaged’, which will ‘fall when hit’.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Fieldcraft and fitness ===
Recruits are taught the basic skills of their profession, such as [[military tactics]], [[first aid]], managing their affairs in the field, and the use of [[weapon]]ry and other equipment.

Throughout, the [[physical fitness]] of recruits is tested and developed, although evidence from Israel, Norway, South Africa, the UK and the US has found that the heavy strain on the body also leads to a high rate of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milgrom|first=C.|last2=Finestone|first2=A.|last3=Shlamkovitch|first3=N.|last4=Rand|first4=N.|last5=Lev|first5=B.|last6=Simkin|first6=A.|last7=Wiener|first7=M.|date=January 1994|title=Youth is a risk factor for stress fracture.

=== Graduation and drop-out ===
Recruits who complete their initial training normally take part in a [[Passing out (military)|graduation parade]] (also called passing-out or marching-out). The parade is observed by their family and friends, and senior military personnel. Recruits then pass to the next stage of their training, if applicable.
[[File:US Navy 111007-N-CM124-001 Recruit Division 339 marches into Midway Ceremonial Drill Hall at Recruit Training Command,.jpg|thumb|US Navy recruits complete their initial training with a graduation parade, 2011.]]
A large minority of recruits drop out of training. For example, attrition among [[Infantry of the British Army|British infantry]] recruits has been found to be above 30% during the first 12 weeks.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiernan|first=Matthew D.|last2=Repper|first2=Julie|last3=Arthur|first3=Antony|date=2015-01-01|title=Why do they fail?

== Variations in recruit training ==
Recruit training varies by nation according to the national requirement and can be voluntary ([[volunteer military]]) or mandatory ([[conscription]]). Some nations operate both volunteer and conscription systems simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/louder-than-words-1|title=Louder than words: An agenda for action to end state use of child soldiers|last=|first=|date=|website=Child Soldiers International|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruit training differs according to [[military branch]]:
* [[Army]] and [[Marine (military)|Marine]] recruits are nearly always trained in basic [[marksmanship]] with individually assigned [[weapon]]s, field maintenance of weapons, [[physical fitness]] training, [[first aid]], and basic survival techniques.
* [[Navy]] and [[Coast Guard]] training usually focuses on water survival training, physical fitness, basic seamanship, and such skills as shipboard [[firefighting]], basic [[engineering]], and signals.
* [[Air force]] training usually includes physical fitness training, military and classroom instructions, and field training in basic marksmanship and first aid.
The training further differs according to military role:

Recruits for [[close combat]] roles (e.g. [[infantry]], [[marines]]) are trained to fight at [[Close quarters combat|close quarters]], including with a [[bayonet]]; training for these positions is normally more vigorous and aggressive than that for other roles (e.g. [[Military logistics|logistics]]).

== Australia ==
{{Main|Australian Army Recruit Training}}
Most of the recruit training in the [[Australian Army]] is currently held at [[Army Recruit Training Centre]] (ARTC) at [[Kapooka]], near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales. Recruit training lasts 80 days for members of the [[Australian Regular Army]] and 35 days for members of the [[Australian Army Reserve]]. In basic training recruits are taught drill, weapons and workplace safety, basic equipment maintenance, marksmanship, fieldcraft, radio use and defensive/offensive operations.

===Regional Force Surveillance Units===
Training for recruits in the [[Regional Force Surveillance Unit]]s usually differs greatly from training in the rest of the Army. For instance, [[NORFORCE]] recruits attend a 2-week course at the Kangaroo Flats. Recruits from areas covered by the RFSUs often come from indigenous cultures radically different from that of the general Australian population, and as such many regular standards and methods of training are not as applicable in their case.

===Royal Military College Duntroon===
Recruit Training for Officers in the Australian Army (known as ICT - Initial Cadet Training) takes place at [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC). The ICT is conducted for approximately 7 weeks after which staff cadets continue military instruction in skills such as weapons training, military history, leadership, strategic studies and other such skills at Section, Platoon and Company levels. Trainees at RMC hold the rank of Staff Cadet and, if successful in completing the course are commissioned as Lieutenants (pronounced Left-tenant). The overall full-time Officer Training course at RMC is 18 months long.

== Canada ==
[[File:RMC Sandhurst 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] cadets compete in the prestigious Sandhurst Competition.]]
Centralized recruit training in the Canadian Army did not exist until 1940, and until the creation of Basic Training Centres across Canada, recruit training had been done by individual units or depots.

The [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] were [[unification of the Canadian Forces|unified into one service]], the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1968. The Canadian Forces Training System, a unified system for all the services, was devised and remains in place today.

Most non-commissioned CF recruits in the Regular Force (full-time) participate in the 10-week [[Basic Military Qualification]] (BMQ) at [[Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School]] at [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]]. Regular Force officers complete their 15-week [[Basic Military Officer Qualification]] (BMOQ) at CFLRS as well, before moving on to Second Language Training or their occupational training.

After basic training, personnel are trained in the specialty of their "environment". Members of the Royal Canadian Navy undergo a five-week sea environment training course; with members of the Canadian Army undergo a 20-day Soldier Qualification course, while officers go through a 12-week Common Army Phase (now renamed to Basic Military Officer Qualification-Land); while members from the Royal Canadian Air Force move on directly to their trade training.

Reservists, particularly the Army Reserve, may conduct basic and trades training part-time, generally alternating weekends with their own units. Due to increased integration of the Regular and Reserve Force, many reservists attend courses hosted by the Regular Force. Members of the Army Reserves complete an 8-week BMQ/SQ combined course (Basic Military Qualification and Soldier Qualification) during the summer. Formerly the Naval and Air Reserve jointly conduct BMQ for its recruits at the Naval Reserve Training Division [[Borden, Ontario]] equivalent to Regular Force BMQ, at [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]]. Now the Naval Reserve conducts the Basic Military Naval Qualification in CFB Valcartier by the Canadian Forces Fleet School Québec (a combination of recruit training and naval environmental training which leads to savings in the training). Navy trains its personnel in [[seamanship]], [[firefighting]], damage control and other skills after BMQ, in the Naval Environmental Training Program (NETP) in either [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]] or [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

The [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is the military academy of the Canadian Forces, and is a degree-granting university. The [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] is a Canadian military academy located on the site of [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)]],

== China ==
{{Main|Military education and training in China}}

==Denmark==
The [[Danish Army]] conducts the HBU (Hærens Basisuddannelse, Army Basic Training course) at 8 bases around the country. The course lasts four months, and has its focus on training skills used in connection with the Danish total defence, and on recruiting for the army's international missions, and for the NCO-schools. The recruits are technically conscripts, but during recession years, many young men and woman have volunteered for HBU.

==Finland==
Training lasts 5.5 to 11.5 months total. All Finnish conscripts undergo two months of basic training (''peruskoulutuskausi''), which is essentially the same for all servicemen. It includes assault rifle ([[Rk 62|RK-62]]/[[Rk 95 Tp|RK-95]]) marksman training, few other basic weapon training, battle training, short field medic training and camping skills. At the end of this training, all men are promoted to their first military rank. After this, specialized training is given depending on the person (5,5–11,5 months). The NCO trainees go to AUK (NCO school) and become corporals or sergeants, from which some are selected to [[Reserve Officer School|RUK (Reserve officer school)]] and become second lieutenants. The officer and NCO training always lasts a total of 11,5 months.

==France==
In the French army, the Formation Generale Initiale (FGI) is a 12 weeks course which occurs in a Centre de Formation Initiale des Militaires du Rang (CFIM). There are 10 CFIM in the country. Prior to this course, new recruits are joining the regiment they are going to serve during 3 to 5 years for reception week where they get gears, filling administrative documents, and last medical exam before starting training =&gt; in France any enlisted soldier signs not only for a MOS but also a unit to serve.

After completing the 12 week FGI course, recruits are receiving the AFFIM certificate (say BCT graduation) and are considered as private 2nd class. After one week of leave, they go back to their regiment for the Formation de Spécialité Initiale (FSI) =&gt; MOS training

After FGI+FSI, they can start training with their platoon for external deployment. Usually, Private 1st class rank is earned after 6 to 12 month of time in service.

For some units (mountain troops - airborne), there is also during first year a Formation d'Adaptation (FA)  for basic mountain training (2 × 2 weeks) or parachute school (3 weeks)

Content of FGI is the following one:

Drills,
First aid and chemical warfare,
PT and obstacle course,
First weapon qualification (FAMAS, pistol and grenade), 
Signals,
Basic field and infantry training (even if not MOS11B later on),
Presentation of French army, soldiers duties and reports.

==Germany==
The Allgemeine Grundausbildung (AGA) (i.e. ''general basic training'') of the [[Bundeswehr]] covers the first three months of military service.

The contents of the "Allgemeine Grundausbildung" includes

* Formal training (ranks, flags, orders and other fundamentals)
* Weapon Drill and Basic Combat training for all soldiers (Rifle, Pistol and machine gun drills are mandatory for every soldier)
* Theoretical Courses about Democracy and legal regulations
* Sports: the Basic Fitness Test (BFT) and the German Sports Badge (DSA)
* Guard duty training (ATB SichSdt)
* First Aid

A notable peculiarity of German basic training is rooted in German military tradition that prefers initiative to obedience. Rather than "breaking" the personality of new recruits through intimidation and aggression, German basic training generally tries to "mold" a recruit's personality in the hope of producing soldiers with stronger personalities and more own initiative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Greece==
While until 2000 the Greek Army was mainly conscript based, since then a large Professional Enslisted institution has been adopted, which combined with the reduction of conscript service will produce an approximate 1:1 ratio between conscript and professional enlisted. While initially training of the two institutions was shared, it has since then diverged, and conscript training has been reduced in length while professional enlisted training has been increased.

Professional Enlisted, signing 7-year contracts, are called once per year. They go through a 14-week initial training, which is broken into a 6-week basic training period which ends with the oathing ceremony, and a 8-week combat course. After that period they proceed to specialty training which can last from 4 to 42 weeks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=ekpsi_emth_epop_dekp&amp;la=1|title=Γενικό Επιτελείο Στρατού - Εκπαίδευση ΕΜΘ-ΕΠΟΠ|website=www.army.gr|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscripted enlisted, serving a 9-month obligation, are called 6 times per year. They report to various recruit camps spread over the country. The first week is the reception week, followed by a 3-week basic soldier training course, which ends with the oathing ceremony. Depending on their awarded specialty the conscript recruits are then transferred to specialty training camps or to operational units. In the operational units the recruits go through a 3-week 'advanced' recruit training course, followed occasionally (depending on whether they have already received specialty training or not), by a 2 to 6 week specialty training course, conducted by the unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==India==
{{Main|Military academies in India}}
The Indian military services have established numerous and distinguished academies and staff colleges across India for the purpose of training professional soldiers in new generation military sciences, warfare command and strategy, and associated technologies.

==Israel==
{{Main|Tironut}}
The recruit training of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (called '''''tironut''''' in Hebrew) varies depending on the unit: virtually every unusual unit completes a different training course. Recruits are certified as riflemen after the completion of the training, while most non-combat units train in all-army bases for the certification of Rifleman 02. Individuals who want to become officers must apply to be trained at a facility in the Negev desert called "Bahad One" (abbreviation of "Basis Hadracha", Instruction Base).

==Pakistan==
{{Main|Pakistan Military Academy}}
The Pakistan Military Academy (or '''PMA''') is a [[Military Academy]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]. It is located at [[Kakul]] in [[Abbottabad]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The Pakistan Military Academy is analogous to [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], [[West Point]] or [[Tironut]] and undertakes training of the prospective officers of Pakistan Army. The academy has four training battalions and sixteen companies. A Cadet is trained and passed out as an officer of the Pakistan Army in 2 years.

Enlisted Men undertake training at the Regimental Center of their chosen regiment.

National Service (NS) in Singapore is compulsory for all able-bodied male citizens and second generation permanent residents who have reached the age of 18. Conscripts enlisted into the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) are required to attend Basic Military Training (BMT) at the beginning of their NS. They are known as Full Time National Servicemen (NSFs).

Based on their Physical Employment Status (PES) grade determined by a pre-enlistment medical examination, NSFs may undergo either a standard, enhanced, modified, or obese BMT at the [[Basic Military Training Centre]] (BMTC) on the offshore island of [[Pulau Tekong]] or at the various military units that directly accept mono-intake PES A and B recruits.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/mindef/mindef-nsmen|title=NS Portal|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Singapore Armed Forces|access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2016}}

Throughout their BMT, NSFs will acquire the basic skills required of a SAF soldier by:
* Executive basic drills
* Physical training
* Passing the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT)
* Operating and firing a [[SAR 21]] assault rifle
* Throwing both practice and live SFG 87 hand grenades
* Complete a Standard Obstacle Course (SOC) and Battle Inoculation Course (BIC)
* Going through a field camp

At the end of BMT, NSFs will typically complete a 24 kilometer long route march in Full Battle Order (FBO) and attend a Passing Out Parade (POP).{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

After BMT, NSFs will receive their posting orders to their respective vocations, which are determined by their PES status, suitability for deployment, and manpower requirements. Some of them will be directly posted to a military unit while others may undergo vocational training at certain institutes before being posted to units.

NSFs who have performed well during BMT may progress to either the [[Specialist Cadet School]] (SCS) or [[Officer Cadet School (Singapore)|Officer Cadet School]] (OCS) for further leadership training to become [[Specialist (Singapore)|Specialist]]s (non-commissioned officers) or Officers.

NSFs will serve the remaining part of their NS in their respective units until their Operationally-Ready Date (ORD), whereupon they will be known as Operationally-Ready National Serviceman (NSmen, or [[reservist]]s). NSmen may still be required to attend reservist training or In-Camp Training (ICT) for ten annual cycles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, officer training is carried out at the [[General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University]] and at the respective [[Military Academies]] of each respective service.

Recruit training for enlisted personal of the [[Sri Lanka Army]] is organised by the [[Army Training School]] and carried out at its premises and at several other locations. Following basic training specialized training would be carried out at Regimental Training Centres.

Basic training for new recruits of the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] which is approximately six months are conducted at  ''Advanced Naval Training Center'', SLNS 'Nipuna'; ''Naval Artificer Training Institute'', SLNS 'Thakshila', Welisara; and at Naval Recruit Training Centres at several shore establishments . This basic training will be followed by ''on-the-job'' training on-board fleet units and at shore establishments. Combat Training School at SLNS 'Pandukabaya' conducts combat training for [[Sri Lanka Navy#Naval Patrolmen|Naval Patrolmen]].

Basic training for airmen of the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] is handled by the Training Wing of the [[SLAF Diyatalawa]]. This is followed by secularized training at '' Advanced &amp; Specialized Trade Training School''.

== Sweden ==
Since conscription ended in 2010, all recruits who seek employment within the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] have to go through ''Grundläggande Militär Utbildning'' (GMU) (Basic Military Training) for three months.

After a recruit has completed GMU, he/she may continue with further, specialized training with any of the branches of the military, as long as the candidate fits the requirements.

There is also a shorter volunteer training program for people who seek service within the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard]] called GU-F. GU-F training takes only 14 days, but following a completed GU-F, a guardsman may go through additional training in order to specialize within the Home Guard.

Basic training as part of GMU as well as GU-F usually takes place at any of the [[Swedish Army]] training units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jobb.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/vagen-in/grundutbildning/|title=Grundutbildning|last=Försvarsmakten|website=Försvarsmakten|language=sv-SE|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
British armed forces recruits train in two phases. Phase One is initial recruit training lasting approximately three months, bringing all recruits to a similar standard of basic military ability. Phase Two consists of courses of varying duration to prepare recruits for their assigned role. Infantry training is an exception, combining Phase One and Phase Two in a course lasting six months.

The [[British Army]], [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Air Force]] manage their own Phase One and Phase Two training establishments.

The first six weeks of training are the most demanding. Recruits are not permitted to leave the military estate or end their contract with the armed forces during this time.

==United States==
In the United States, recruit training in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is called [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Combat Training]]; U.S. Army Combat Arms MOS (11 Series, 19 series, 13 series, 12 series) undergo OSUT (One Station Unit Training) which involves BCT, Advanced Individual Training and Specialized Training (such as Bradley, or Mortar School, or Gunnery) all in one. In the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] it is called [[Basic Military Training]] or "BMT". In the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] it is called Recruit Training (commonly known as Boot Camp), and in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]], it is called "Basic Training."

Some services present a badge or other award to denote completion of recruit training. The Army typically issues the [[Army Service Ribbon]] (issued after completion of Advanced Individual Training), and the Air Force presents the [[Air Force Training Ribbon]] and the [[Airman's coin|Airman's Coin]]. The Marine Corps issue the [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] once initial training is complete to signify that the recruits are now Marines. The Navy replaces the "RECRUIT" ball cap the recruits have worn throughout training with the "NAVY" ball cap upon successful completion of "Battle Stations". The United States Coast Guard's basic training graduates place a Coast Guard Medallion on their ball cap.

For honor graduates of basic training, the Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy present a [[Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon]]. The Navy and Marine Corps often meritoriously advance the top graduates of each division one pay-grade (up to a maximum of E-3).

[[File:Army Bayonet Training.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Army recruit practices bayonet training at [[Fort Jackson, South Carolina]].]]
{{Main|United States Army Basic Training}}

In the [[United States Army]], recruits are sent to Basic Combat Training in a location designated according to the military [[Military Occupational Specialty]], or MOS, which is selected upon enlistment.

Initial Entry Training (IET) is divided into two parts, which commonly take place at two different locations, depending on the chosen MOS:
*Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is a ten-week training cycle. Keep in mind, this period does not include "Reception Week" during which recruits are being slotted to their training companies (troops for cavalry).
*Advanced Individual Training, or AIT, is where new soldiers receive specific training in their chosen MOS. The length of AIT training varies depending on the MOS and can last anywhere from four weeks to nearly one year.
*Several MOSs (mainly combat arms) combine both basic training and AIT in a single combined course called One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which can last up to 22 weeks. The attitude and environment remain the same throughout the entire training cycle, including drill instructors.  Essentially, OSUT is an extended version of Basic Training, especially for Infantry OSUT, which remains on the same basic soldiering tasks for the entire cycle, although in greater detail. Infantry OSUT is conducted at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at Fort Benning, and lasts 15–17 weeks.
The U.S. Army has four sites for BCT:
*[[Fort Benning]] in Columbus, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]
*[[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]] in Columbia, [[South Carolina]]
*[[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] in St. Robert, [[Missouri]]
*[[Fort Sill]] in Lawton, [[Oklahoma]]

During Basic Combat Training, Army recruits learn a variety of basic combat skills including: Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM), land navigation, patrolling, securing and defending a position, drill and ceremony, fireteam formations and assaults, communications and use of AN/PRC-119 radio, combat lifesaving skills, 9-line medevac, reporting intelligence, hand grenades, Claymore mines, M203/M320 grenade launcher, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), M240B machine gun, M2 .50 caliber machine gun, MK-19, and AT-4 anti-tank weapon. Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, the Confidence Course, conducting marches of varying distances up to 12 miles, physical training, and Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP), a martial arts program based on the combination of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, Muay Thai, Boxing, and a number of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Combatives#Modern Army Combatives]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recruits are trained to adopt the Army "Warrior Ethos", and to memorize and live by the [[Soldier's Creed]].

BCT is divided into three phases. During Phase I, (also known as "Red Phase") recruits are subject to "Total Control," meaning their every action is monitored and constantly corrected by drill sergeants. The first week of training is commonly referred to as "Hell Week," due to the intense period of adjustment required on the part of the new recruits. Marches are common throughout basic training. Recruits are sent to the "gas chamber" during Phase I, as part of training for defensive chemical warfare. They are also introduced to their standard-issue weapon, the [[M16A2 rifle]], the [[M16A4]] rifle, or [[M4 carbine]].

In Phase II (also known as "White Phase") soldiers begin actually firing weapons, starting with the rifle or carbine ([[M4A1]]). Other weapons the recruit becomes familiarized with include various grenades (such as the M67 fragmentation grenade) and grenade launchers (such as the M203). Recruits are then familiarized with the [[bayonet]], anti-tank/armor weaponry and other heavy weapons. The course also includes an obstacle course which the soldiers are expected to negotiate in a certain amount of time. Additionally, Phase II includes continual, intense PT, along with drill and ceremony training. At the conclusion of Phase II, Soldiers are to demonstrate proficiency with the various weaponry with which they trained.

Phase III or "Blue Phase," is the culmination and the most challenging of all the training phases. A final PT test is administered during the first week. Recruits who fail are frequently retested, often up until the morning of their cycle's graduation. If they do not pass, then they are recycled to another platoon until they meet the fitness standards. The final PT Test is the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). Usually, a Soldier needs to score at least 60 points in each APFT category (pushups, sit-ups, and 2 mile run) to pass, but in Basic Combat Training, only 50 points are required; the Soldier will nevertheless take another APFT with a 60-point requirement at AIT. During Blue Phase, the recruits move on to such longer and more intensive "bivouac" and FTX ([[Field Training Exercise]]s) as nighttime combat operations. Drill sergeants will make much of this an adversarial process by working against the recruits in many of the night operations and trying to foil plans, etc.

Upon completion of Basic Combat Training, a recruit is now a soldier, and has developed skills to operate in a combat environment, as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her MOS-specific duties under fire.

===U.S. Marine Corps===
{{Main|United States Marine Corps Recruit Training}}
[[File:Marine Corps Platoon.jpg|thumb|In August 2005, a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Drill Instructor]] inspects his [[platoon]] shortly before [[Taps|Lights Out]] at MCRD Parris Island, South Carolina.]]

The United States Marine Corps Recruit Depots are located at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]], South Carolina, and [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]], California. All female enlisted Marines go to Parris Island. Men go to either, depending on whether they were recruited east or west of the [[Mississippi River]].  Marine Corps boot camp is the longest basic training regimen in the U.S. Armed Forces, and is physically demanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nation.time.com/2011/06/02/the-few-the-proud-the-broken/|title=The Few, the Proud, the Broken|first=Mark|last=Thompson|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017|via=nation.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, recruits were referred to as either "(the) Private(s)" or "(the) recruit(s)" from day one of Recruit Training. Since the 1990s, they are referred to as "(the) recruit(s)" alone until they earn the title of Marine.

Marine Corps Recruit Training (MCRT) is a 13-week program that is divided up into three four-week phases and further broken down into individual training days.&lt;ref name="mcrt-1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are 69 individual training days, recruits also go through pre- and post-training processing where recruits are afforded relatively little freedom. Phase one mainly consists of learning recruit life protocol, physical training, [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program|MCMAP]] training, academic classes, initial drill, a series inspection, and the confidence course. West coast recruits also do swim qualification during this phase. Phase two is completely in the field at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] for west coast recruits, with the first two weeks being spent on marksmanship training and qualification with the M16A4 service rifle, and the last week in the field learning skills such as fireteam formations, land navigation, and hikes. For east coast recruits, phase two is swim qualification, rifle qualification, and Team Week, a week of maintenance duties for the island as a show of how to perform base support tasks while still keeping military bearing and attention to detail. Phase three brings the San Diego recruits back to the recruit depot where they finish up with final drill, final inspection, more PT and confidence courses, and graduation. During third phase, west coast recruits also go back into the field one last time to do the Crucible event. Parris Island recruits finish with field training, final drill and inspection, the Crucible, and graduation. Note that recruits going to either depot receive exactly the same training, if in a different order. An important part of this process is training recruits to adopt and live by the motto, "Every Marine a rifleman".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation_needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion, recruits proceed to receive further training at the [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|School of Infantry (SOI)]]. All non-infantry [[List of United States Marine Corps MOS|MOS]] Marines are trained at the Marine Combat Training Battalion (MCT), while infantry MOS Marines are trained at the Infantry Training Battalion (ITB).&lt;ref name="soi-1"&gt;{{cite web

Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, conducting marches, physical training, and Marine Corps Martial Arts Program. Upon completion of Marine Combat Training, the Marine is to have gained the knowledge and ability to operate in a combat environment as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her primary duties under fire.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry]]&lt;/ref&gt; (The main contrast with Army recruit training is that nearly identical training is integrated into Basic Combat Training, so there is no follow-on school.) Upon completion, Marines proceed to their MOS-specific school.

In Infantry Training Battalion (ITB), [[infantry]] [[List of United States Marine Corps MOS|MOS]] (03XX) Marines receive 59 days of training in infantry skills, including advanced marksmanship, combat patrolling, land navigation, and a wide array of other infantry skills. Upon completion of ITB, newly qualified Marine infantrymen proceed to their assigned units.

===U.S. Navy===
[[File: Instructional Training exercises at RTC Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|In March 2002, a U.S. Navy Recruit Division Commander conducts "Instructional Training" to correct substandard performance during boot camp.]]
{{Main|Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois}}
The [[United States Navy]] currently operates boot camp at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at [[Naval Station Great Lakes]], near [[North Chicago, Illinois]]. Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Navy has RDCs (Recruit Division Commanders) that are assigned to each division. Training lasts approximately eight weeks (although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated processing cycle). Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on, for example, 7-3 for week 7 day 3. The first approximate week is counted P-1, P-2, etc. which denotes that it is a processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period. Recruits are instructed on military drill, basic seamanship, basic shipboard damage control, firefighting, familiarization with the [[M9 pistol]] and [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun (the Navy no longer gives instruction on the [[M16 rifle|M16]] in boot camp), pass the confidence chamber (tear-gas-filled chamber), PT, and the basic essentials on Navy life. Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault Victim Intervention, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], recognition of naval aircraft and vessels, and more. In order for recruits to pass boot camp, they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting, first-aid knowledge, survival at sea, mass casualties, shipboard flood control, bomb detection, and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks. After completion of boot camp, freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various "A" Schools located across the United States—where they begin training to receive their [[List of United States Navy ratings|ratings]] (jobs)—or to apprenticeship training, where they then enter the fleet without a designation.

The Navy formerly operated Recruit Training Centers in San Diego, California; Orlando, Florida; Meridian, Mississippi; and [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge|Port Deposit (Bainbridge), Maryland]]. From 1942 to 1946—during and immediately following World War II—the Navy had two additional training sites: Naval Training Station (USNTS) Sampson (renamed [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in 1950), near Seneca Lake, New York, where over 400,000 recruits were trained, and [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] in Bayview, Idaho.

===U.S. Air Force===
[[File: Air Force Military Training Instructor.jpg|thumb|upright|A formation of USAF airmen]]
{{Main|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}
The U.S. Air Force's Basic Military Training (BMT) is eight and a half weeks long, as they do not count the first week ("Week 0"). BMT is 63 calendar days long. It is conducted at [[Lackland Air Force Base|Lackland AFB]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Formerly, trainees were referred to as "Airman" from day one of BMT. This has been changed; now, personnel are referred to as Trainees until the Airman's Coin Ceremony in the seventh week of training, when they receive their Airman's Coin.  Trainees receive military instruction (including the Air Force core values, flight and individual drill, and living area inspections), academic classes (covering topics such as Air Force history, dress and appearance, military customs and courtesies, ethics, security, and alcohol/drug abuse prevention and treatment), and field training (including protection against biological and chemical attack, basic marksmanship on the [[M16 (rifle)|M16]] rifle as well as first aid).  Following BMT, Airmen go to a technical school (or 'tech school') where they learn the specifics of their [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC), which is similar to the MOS ([[Military Occupational Specialty]]) in the Army and Marines, the Navy's NEC (Naval Enlisted Classification) code, or the Coast Guard's ratings.

All non-prior-service enlistees are required to complete BMT, including those enlisting in the [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve Command]]. Reserve component enlistees receive the same training as their active-duty counterparts. Credit can be given on a case-by-case basis for enlistees with college credit, Eagle Scouts and service in the [[Civil Air Patrol]] qualify for promotion to E-2 ([[Airman]]) or E-3 ([[Airman First Class]]) upon graduation from BMT. The stripes are not worn until graduation, though trainees are paid at the higher pay grade.

Lackland AFB has been associated with BMT for almost the Air Force's entire history. From 1950 to 1956, 300,000 airmen received BMT at [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in New York.  In 1951, [[Parks Air Force Base]] in [[Dublin, California]] became a BMT center, with training beginning in March 1952. BMT at Parks AFB ceased later in the decade and the installation was transferred to the US Army in 1959. For a brief time between 1966 and 1968, the Air Force operated a second BMT at [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo AFB]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]].

Unlike the Army and Navy, but like the Marine Corps (throughout boot camp) and Coast Guard (during the first section of boot camp), trainees are required to refer to all Airmen, enlisted and NCO's as well as commissioned and warrant officers, as "sir" or "ma'am". Trainees are required to preface speaking to Military Training Instructors with their reporting statement: "Sir/Ma'am, Trainee (the recruit's surname) reports as ordered".

An additional 2 weeks of BMT was added to the program on November 1, 2008, extending the duration of BMT from six and a half weeks to eight and a half weeks. BMT has been tailored to incorporate some of the additional warfighting skills to coincide with increased Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations and more frequent support of its sister services during those rotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|title=BMT extended, NCOs to learn new languages|date=17 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717031836/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 BMT was shortened once again to seven and a half weeks. Trainees still stay at Lackland for eight and half weeks, however, the eighth week following graduation they are moved to a more relaxed environment under a program called Airman's Week, which is designed to transition trainees to technical training.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
[[File: USCG Basic Training.jpg|thumb|A Coast Guard Company Commander instructs a recruit during basic training.]]
Recruit training for the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] is held at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|title=USCG Recruit Training|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official standard recruit training cycle lasts eight weeks. A limited number of recruits may face reversion to earlier weeks of training should one exhibit egregious deficiencies in attitude and/or aptitude.
  
The U.S. Coast Guard recruit basic training offers an additional, abbreviated, route to serve as an enlisted member of the Fleet.  Namely, Direct Entry Petty Officer Training (DEPOT): "The goal of the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training Course is to produce petty officers who on the basis of their civilian professions, prior military experience, or a combination of both"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/Depot/|title=DEPOT|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are otherwise duly qualified.

The U.S. Coast Guard is unique in that it fires the [[SIG Sauer P229|SIG Sauer P229R]] pistol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|title=Military Life|first=|last=Military.com|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the training. The training also covers basic seamanship, drill, military bearing and firefighting. The Coast Guard base on Government Island (now known as [[Coast Guard Island]]) Alameda, California was also used as a second major recruit training center until it was closed in 1982 and converted into the base for the USCG Pacific Area Command, the Eleventh Coast Guard District, the Marine Safety Office San Francisco Bay, the USCG Maintenance &amp; Logistics Command Pacific and the Integrated Support Command Center - Alameda.

Although the Coast Guard is a part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], rather than the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], it is by law and tradition a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. As with all military members, Coast Guard personnel are subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). Due to the Coast Guard's unique mission set – including [[CONUS]] and [[CONUS#CONUS/OCONUS|OCONUS]] defense operations, search and rescue and maritime law enforcement – there are added requirements to maintain high physical fitness standards and intense military bearing. Due to its extremely unusual, diverse and difficult mission, the U.S. Coast Guard is the most selective in recruiting and training standards. As an example, the [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard Academy]] is the only service academy that uses competitive admissions for prospective officer candidates.

During their time at Cape May, recruits are subjected to the usual "boot camp" atmosphere of direct instruction and intense motivation. The recruits are designated as Seaman Recruits (SR; E-1). Unique to the Coast Guard among the services, recruits successfully completing basic recruit training are advanced to the rank of Seaman Apprentice/Fireman Apprentice (SA/FA; E-2) or Seaman/Fireman (SN/FN; E-3) upon graduation—the difference generally based on level of higher education one possess. They must adhere to strict rules such as hygiene and uniform regulations and obey all lawful orders. Coast Guard drill instructors are called "company commanders" and hold a rank ranging from Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5) up to Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8). Coast Guard companies have approximately two or three company commanders and anywhere from 20 to over 100 recruits.

After completing boot camp, recruits can select their rate and then attend an "A" school. Not all graduates go straight to "A" school, many spend time in the fleet as "non-rates". "A" school is a long-term technical school providing specific instruction about a rate. The "A" schools last two to six months and usually occurs at [[Training Center Yorktown|TRACEN Yorktown]], Yorktown, Virginia or [[Training Center Petaluma|TRACEN Petaluma]], Petaluma, California. Some rates have an available apprenticeship training option instead of attending an "A" school, known as "striking".

{{Ecological economics|People}}
'''Robert Underwood Ayres''' (born June 29, 1932) is an American-born physicist and economist. His career has focused on the application of physical ideas, especially the laws of [[thermodynamics]], to [[economics]]; a long-standing pioneering interest in material flows and transformations ([[industrial ecology]] or [[industrial metabolism]])—a concept which he originated.&lt;ref name=AyresBio2010/&gt; His most recent work challenges the widely held [[Economic growth|economic theory of growth]].

==Career==
Trained as a physicist at the [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and [[King's College London]] (PhD in Mathematical Physics), Ayres has dedicated his professional life to advancing the environment, technology and resource end of the [[sustainability]] agenda. His major research interests include technological change, [[environmental economics]], "industrial metabolism" and "eco-restructuring". He has worked at the [[Hudson Institute]] (1962–67), Resources for the Future Inc (1968) and International Research and Technology Corp (1969–76). From 1979 until 1992 he was Professor of Engineering and Public Policy at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, except for two years (and six summers) on leave at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) in Laxenburg Austria. In 1992 he moved to the international business school [[INSEAD]] in Fontainebleau, France as Sandoz (later Novartis) Professor of Environment and Management. Since his formal retirement in 2000 he has been Jubilee Visiting Professor (2000–2001) and king Karl Gustav XVI professor of environmental science (2004–2005) at [[Chalmers Institute of Technology]] Gothenburg (Sweden). He is currently an Institute Scholar at IIASA.

He remains an active researcher. He has written or co-authored 20 books, edited or coedited another dozen books, written or co-authored more than 200 journal articles and book chapters not to mention many unpublished reports, on subjects ranging from environmental effects of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] to theoretical economics. But most of his life-work is [[interdisciplinary]]. He was a pioneer of a new field, sometimes called Industrial Metabolism or [[Industrial Ecology]]. He has contributed to [[futures studies]], [[technological forecasting]], transportation and energy studies, material flow studies (`dematerialization'), environmental technology, [[environmental economics]], thermodynamics and economics, and the theory of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/rayres/ |title=insead - faculty &amp; research - Robert U.

Here taken from one of his recent papers are two paragraphs that provide a flavor of his recent work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mainstream economics today is based to a large extent on bad ideas. Economic concepts, from foundational issues like markets, supply and demand and “free trade”,  to money and finance, lack any systematic awareness of the physical process of production or the implications of the Laws of Thermodynamics  for those processes. A corollary, almost worthy of being a separate bad idea on its own, is that energy doesn’t matter (much) because the cost share of energy in the economy is so small that it can be ignored e.g. {Denison, 1984 #6184}. The so-called “production functions” used by all schools of economic thought that build growth models omit any necessary role for energy, as if output could be produced by labor and capital alone—or as if energy is merely a form of man-made capital that can be produced (as opposed to extracted) by labor and capital.

The essential truth missing from economic education today is that energy is the stuff of the universe, that all matter is also a form of energy, and that the economic system is essentially a system for extracting, processing and transforming energy as resources into energy embodied in products and services. This is a thermodynamic process, as the Rumanian economist Georgescu-Roegen said half a century ago (Georgescu-Roegen 1971). The economic process is subject to both the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of mass/energy; nothing can be created or destroyed) and the second law of thermodynamics (increasing entropy; all transformation processes are irreversible). The “first law” implies that the notion of “consumption” as applied to products is misleading: material transformation processes unavoidably generate large quantities of material wastes or residuals {Ayres, 1969 #284;{Ayres, 1989 #424}.  Some of those wastes are merely inconvenient but others are harmful or toxic. The second law says that energy becomes less useful (exergy is destroyed) by every action.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is much more to be said along these lines. Key publications reflecting these (and some other) important ideas are given in the bibliography below.

[[File:Soweto township.jpg|thumb|Shanty town in [[Soweto]], South Africa, 2005]]

A '''shanty town''' or '''squatter area''' is a settlement of improvised housing which is known as shanties or [[shack]]s, made of [[plywood]], [[corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated metal]], sheets of plastic, and cardboard boxes. Such settlements are usually found on the periphery of cities, in public parks, or near railroad tracks, rivers, lagoons or city [[landfill|trash dump]] sites. Sometimes called a squatter, [[housing#Informal housing in developing countries|or spontaneous settlement]], a typical shanty town often lacks adequate infrastructure, including proper sanitation, safe water supply, electricity, hygienic streets, or other basic necessities to support human settlements.

Shanty towns are mostly found in [[Developing country|developing nations]], but also in some parts of developed nations.&lt;ref name=ta2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/6147072/Greek-immigration-crisis-spawns-shanty-towns-and-squats.html Greek immigration crisis spawns shanty towns and squats] Nick Squires and Paul Anast, The Telegraph, (September 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/150824559/showdown-looms-over-europes-largest-shantytown Showdown Looms Over Europe's Largest Shantytown] LAUREN FRAYER, National Public Radio (Washington DC), April 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Müllgebiet Ezbet Al Nakhl.jpg|thumb|Shanty towns sometimes have an active [[informal economy]], such as garbage sorting, pottery making, textiles, and leather works. This allows the poor to earn an income. The above shanty town image is from Ezbet Al Nakhl, in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where garbage is sorted manually. Residential area is visible at the top of the image.]]
Since construction is informal and unguided by urban planning, there is typically no formal [[grid plan|street grid]], house numbers, or named streets. Such settlements also lack some or all basic public services such as a sewage network, [[electric power|electricity]], safe running water, rain water drainage, garbage removal, access to public transport, or insect and disease control services. Even if these resources are present, they are likely to be disorganized, unreliable, and poorly maintained. Shanty towns also tend to lack basic services present in more formally organized settlements, including policing, mail delivery, medical services, and fire fighting. Fires are a particular danger for shanty towns not only for the lack of fire fighting stations and the difficulty fire trucks have traversing the settlement in the absence of formal street grids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2009/07/04/ccs_art_solo-tres-unidades-d_1460015.shtml|title=Sólo tres unidades de bomberos atienden 2 mil barrios de Petare|author=Jorge Hernández|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because of the high density of buildings and flammability of materials used in construction.&lt;ref&gt;See the report on shack fires in South Africa by Matt Birkinshaw [http://abahlali.org/files/Big_Devil_Politics_of_Shack_Fire.pdf] as well as the wider collection of articles in fires in shanty towns at [http://www.abahlali.org/taxonomy/term/841]&lt;/ref&gt; A sweeping fire on the hills of [[Shek Kip Mei]], Hong Kong, in late 1953 left 53,000 dwellers homeless, prompting the colonial government to institute a resettlement estate system.

Shanty towns have high rates of [[crime]], [[suicide]], [[recreational drug use|drug use]], and [[disease]]. However, Swiss journalist [[Georg Gerster]] has noted (with specific reference to the ''invasões'' of [[Brasilia]]) that "squatter settlements [as opposed to [[Slum|slums]]], despite their unattractive building materials, may also be places of hope, scenes of a counter-culture, with an encouraging potential for change and a strong upward impetus".&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Gerster]], ''Flights of Discovery: The Earth from Above'', 1978, London: Paddington, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stewart Brand]] has also written, more recently, that "squatter cities are [[environmentally friendly|Green]]. They have maximum density—a million people per square mile in Mumbai—and minimum energy and material use. People get around by foot, bicycle, rickshaw, or the universal [[shared taxi]] ... Not everything is efficient in the slums, though. In the Brazilian favelas where electricity is stolen and therefore free, Jan Chipchase from Nokia found that people leave their lights on all day. In most slums recycling is literally a way of life." (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Brand, "[http://newurbannetwork.com/article/stewart-brand-new-urbanism-and-squatter-communities-13243 Stewart Brand on New Urbanism and squatter communities]", ''The New Urban Network'', reprinted from ''Whole Earth Discipline'', Penguin,&lt;/ref&gt;

The above Khayelitsha Township is Africa's largest, with shanty homes served with disorganized electrical lines, with one shed showing a car parked inside.]]

===Developing countries===
Shanty towns are present in a number of countries. The largest shanty town in Asia is [[Orangi]] in [[Karachi]], Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/5-biggest-slums-world-381338 5 biggest slums in the world] Daniel Tovrov, IB Times (December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[francophone]] countries, shanty towns are referred to as ''[[wikt:bidonville#French|bidonvilles]]'' (French for "can town" - can being a reference to tin metal); such countries include [[Tunisia]] and [[Haiti]]. Other countries with shanty towns include [[South Africa]] (where they are often called ''[[Township (South Africa)|Townships]]'') or Imijondolo, [[Kenya]] (including the [[Kibera]] and [[Mathare]] slums), the [[Philippines]] (often called ''squatter areas''), [[Venezuela]] (where they are known as [[barrio]]s), Brazil ([[favela]]s), [[Argentina]] ([[villas miseria]]), [[West Indies]] such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] (where they are known as shanty towns), and [[Peru]] (where they are known as [[pueblos jóvenes|"young towns"]]). There is also a major shanty town population in countries such as [[Bangladesh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isuh.org/download/dhaka.pdf|title=ISUH home|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=1419&amp;section=insight Demolitions limit slum villages to city outskirts.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502012550/http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=1419&amp;section=insight |date=2009-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200509/09/eng20050909_207472.html|title=People's Daily Online -- "Slums" sting Chinese cities, hamper building of harmonious society|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article288 Jane Kelly, Review: Planet of Slums, by Mike Davis, Verso, 2006, £15.99.

===Developed countries===
Although shanty towns are less common in [[developed country|developed countries]], there are some cities that have them. While shanty towns are less common in Europe, the growing influx of immigrants have fueled shantytowns in cities commonly used as a point of entry into the EU, including [[Athens]] and [[Patras]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/6147072/Greek-immigration-crisis-spawns-shanty-towns-and-squats.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first1=Nick |last1=Squires |first2=Paul |last2=Anast |title=Greek immigration crisis spawns shanty towns and squats |date=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Madrid]], Spain, a low-class neighborhood named [[Cañada Real]] (which is considered a shanty town) has no formal education system, professional nurseries or modern health clinics and is considered the largest slum in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/in-spains-heart-a-slum-to-shame-europe-6268652.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Alasdair |last=Fotheringham |title=In Spain's heart, a slum to shame Europe |date=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, shanty towns known as "barracas" or "bairros de lata" are made up of immigrants from former Portuguese African colonies and [[Romani People|Roma]] from Eastern Europe. Most of them are located in [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]]. In the United States, some cities such as [[Newark, New Jersey#Poverty and lack of investment|Newark]] and [[Oakland#Demographics|Oakland]] have witnessed the creation of [[Tent city|tent cities]]. Other settlements in developed countries that are comparable to shanty towns include the [[Colonia (United States)|Colonias]] near the border with Mexico, and [[poverty in France#Bidonvilles|bidonvilles in France]], which may exist in the peripheries of some cities.

In some cases, shanty towns can persist in gentrified areas that local governments have yet to redevelop, or in regions of political dispute. Examples of this include [[Ras Khamis]] in Israel and the [[Kowloon Walled City]] in Hong Kong.

==Development==
[[File:Shanty housing in Hong Kong.jpeg|thumb|Shanty towns may be large or small settlements. Above shanty town is in [[Hong Kong]].]]
While most shanty towns begin as precarious establishments haphazardly thrown together without basic social and civil services, over time, some have undergone a certain amount of development. Often the residents themselves are responsible for the major improvements.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohaforum.org/2011/08/16/some-young-towns-in-lima-not-so-young-anymore/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823044812/http://cohaforum.org/2011/08/16/some-young-towns-in-lima-not-so-young-anymore/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 August 2011|title=Some "Young Towns" in Lima Not So Young Anymore|publisher=COHA Staff|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community organizations sometimes working alongside [[NGO]]s, private companies, and the government, set up connections to the municipal water supply, pave roads, and build local schools.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"/&gt; Some of these shanties have become middle class [[suburbs]]. One such extreme example is the [[Los Olivos District|Los Olivos]] Neighborhood of [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. Chameh is, one of Lima's largest, along with [[gated communities]], [[casino]]s, and even plastic surgery clinics, are just a few of many developments that have transformed what used to be a decrepit shanty.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"/&gt; A few Brazilian [[favelas]] have also seen improvements in recent years, enough so to attract tourists who flock to catch a glimpse of the colorful lifestyle perched atop [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/megacities/2011/05/16/favela-tourism-provides-entrepreneurial-opportunuties-in-rio/|title= Favela Tourism Provides Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Rio |work=Forbes |first=Felicity |last=Clarke |date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development occurs over a long period of time and newer towns still lack basic services. Nevertheless, there has been a general trend whereby shanties undergo gradual improvements, rather than relocation to even more distant parts of a metropolis and replacement by [[gated communities]] constructed over their ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1324/87|title=Informality: Re-Viewing Latin American Cities|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many shanty towns are starting to implement the use of [[composting toilets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/bill-gates-foundation-puts-money-on-solar-powered-toilet|title=Thomson Reuters Foundation|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416032241/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/bill-gates-foundation-puts-money-on-solar-powered-toilet|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[solar panels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5172|title=Youth Bring Low-Cost Solar Panels to Kenyan Slum|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the people living in slums may have access to cell phones and even the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/oct/17/itforschools.schools5 |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=IT for schools, Schools, Education, Technology, UK news, Online learning e-learning (Education) |date=May 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of all this, inequality associated with shanty towns has only increased over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN study says wealth gap in Latin America increases- A study by the United Nations suggests the gap between the rich and the poor in much of Latin America is widening.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19339636|accessdate=6 January 2013 |work=BBC News|date=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Jakarta slumlife66.JPG|thumb|A shanty town in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]
Shanty is probably from Canadian French ''chantier'', a winter station established for the organization of lumberjacks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible derivation is from the [[Irish language]] ''sean tí'' meaning ''old house''.

Hutment means an "encampment of huts". When the term is used by the military, it means "temporary living quarters specially built by the army for soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hutment |title=Hutment |publisher=Free Dictionary |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also a synonym for shanty town, particularly in [[developing country|developing countries]].

A '''singing school''' is a school in which students are taught to sightread [[vocal music]]. Singing schools are a long-standing cultural institution in the [[U.S. Southern states|Southern United States]]. While some singing schools are offered for credit, most are informal programs.

Historically, singing schools have been strongly affiliated with [[Protestant]] Christianity. Some are held under the auspices of particular Protestant denominations that maintain a tradition of [[a cappella]] singing, such as the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]] and the [[Primitive Baptists]]. Others are associated with [[Sacred Harp]], [[Southern Gospel]], and similar singing traditions, whose music is religious in character but sung outside the context of church services.

Often the music taught in singing schools uses [[shape note]] or "buckwheat" notation, in which the notes are assigned particular shapes to indicate their pitch. There are two main varieties: the four-note, or ''fasola'', system used in Sacred Harp music, and the seven-note system developed by [[Jesse B. Aikin]] used in southern gospel music. Some churches, including some Baptist churches (though fewer and fewer), use [[hymnal]]s printed in shape notes.

==History==
===Origins===

[[File:1783 April5 SingingSchool NewHampshireGazette.png|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Dearborn]]'s singing school announcement in the New Hampshire Gazette, April 5, 1783]]

The first American singing schools began in [[New England]] in the early 1700s as an effort to spread the use of [[written music]] in [[congregational singing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sing with Understanding |last=Eskew |first=Harry |author2=Hugh T. McElrath  |year=n.d. |isbn=0-8054-6809-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithCreek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithcreekmusic.com/Hymnology/American.Hymnody/Singing.Schools/Singing.School.movement.html |title=The American Singing School Movement |publisher=Smith Creek Music |year=2001 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[religious denomination|denominations]], controversies existed on whether congregations should sing audibly, and whether singing should be limited to the [[Psalms of David]]. This New England controversy centered around "regular singing" versus the "usual way". The "usual way" consisted of the entire congregation singing in unison tunes passed on by [[oral tradition]], often by [[lining out]].&lt;ref name="SmithCreek"/&gt; "Regular singing" consisted of ''singing by note'' or ''rule''.&lt;ref&gt;The word "regular" nowadays has multiple meanings; what was meant by "regular" at the time (Marini 2003, 75) was "according to rule", following the original Latin ''regula'', meaning "rule". See [[Oxford English Dictionary]], entry for "regular".&lt;/ref&gt; Though intended for the entire congregation, "regular singing" sometimes divided the congregation into singers and ''non-singers''. [[Massachusetts]] [[Religious minister|minister]]s [[John Tufts (music educator)|John Tufts]] and [[Thomas Walter (minister)|Thomas Walter]] were among the leaders in this "reform movement". Tufts' ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes'' is generally considered the first singing school manual. By the middle of the 18th century, the arguments for "regular singing" had generally won the day.

[[File:Merrill, Ella and Singing School of Keene New Hampshire (4538193052).jpg|thumb|Singing school of Keene, New Hampshire, circa 1880's]]

By the end of the 18th century, the singing school manuals had become standardized in an oblong-shaped ''tunebook'', usually containing tunes with only one stanza of text. [[William Billings]] was one of the most important of the New England singing school teachers of this period. One of his singing schools was held in 1774 in Stoughton, Massachusetts. According to Hall, "The school taught by William Billings is the first and only one with all the pupils given." A few members of this singing school later helped organize the [[Stoughton Musical Society]] in 1786, now the oldest surviving choral society in the United States.

New systems of [[music notation]], including [[shape note]]s, were developed by singing school teachers as an aid in learning to sing by sight. Early shape note systems were an extension of "Old English" or "Lancashire" [[Solfège|sol-fa]], developed in Britain in the 17th century, with the intention of teaching school children to sing, and remained in use there until the 20th. This system was used in America from the late 17th century. The use of "shape-notes" themselves was an American innovation, first put into use in 1798 in Philadelphia and soon popular in the many hymn collections published in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes. P., ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', Oxford, 1970, (p.564) &lt;/ref&gt; The four-shape "fasola" system was prominent before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and survives largely in the [[Sacred Harp]] tradition, while various seven-shape systems gained popularity beginning in the 1860s and are still seen in some denominational hymnals and in [[Southern Gospel]] music.

By the 1820s, the "Yankee singing school" had become a nationwide phenomenon. However, advocates of [[European classical music]] like [[Lowell Mason]] sought to suppress the tradition in favor of a more cosmopolitan idiom, which came to be taught at public school (United States)|public schools]].&lt;ref name="SmithCreek"/&gt; Eventually, singing schools in the north faded to obscurity, while in the south and west they became a prominent social event for small-town Americans looking for something to do.

===Continued use in the South===
Singing schools were often taught by traveling singing masters who would stay in a location for a few weeks and teach a singing school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blevins|first1=Brooks|title=Where Everything New Is Old Again|journal=Southern Cultures|date=2016|volume=22|issue=4|pages=135-149|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=120126150&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A singing school would be a large social event for a town; sometimes nearly everyone in the town would attend and people would come from many miles away. Many young men and women saw singing schools as important to their [[courtship|courtship traditions]]. Sometimes the entire life of a town would be put on hold as everyone came out to singing school. In this way, singing schools resembled [[tent revival]]s.

[[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] related attending a singing school as a young lady in ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'', one of the [[Little House on the Prairie|''Little House'' books]]. Her husband, [[Almanzo Wilder]], courted her there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=These Happy Golden Years |last=Wilder |first=Laura Ingalls |authorlink=Laura Ingalls Wilder |year=2003 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=0-06-052315-8 |pages=232–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common tradition was the "singing school picture" taken of the teacher and students on the last day of school. Many old black and white photographs exist as records of these events from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; [[genealogy|genealogical researchers]] often find these records useful. The pictures were often taken in front of a blackboard with the name of the teacher and date of the school. Some of these pictures show small classes, while others record very large schools.

[[File:Singing school conducted at Jacksonville as part of six-day Extension school in August, 1915. - (3856643518).jpg|thumb|left|Singing school conducted at Jacksonville as part of six-day Extension school in August, 1915.]]

Singing schools underwent many changes as cities grew and the population moved away from an agrarian lifestyle. One of the most notable changes was the length of schools; at one time it was common for schools to last four weeks. This was shortened over time, and today most of the larger singing schools last for two weeks, though the Gospel Singers of America School of Gospel Music still lasts for three weeks.

Singing schools began to hold less interest for the general public as time went on and could rarely get attendance from an entire town. Instead, schools were attended by interested students from a much larger region. In the case of Sacred Harp singing schools, students usually attended because of their interest in the Sacred Harp singing tradition; in other schools, students attended because of an interest in vocal church music, especially for those churches that maintain an all-''a capella'' music tradition.

The tradition of having singing school masters who traveled between various towns where they held singing schools faded away in favor of holding annual schools in the same location. Primitive Baptists have established three permanently located singing schools in the state of [[Texas]] (Harmony Hill at [[Azle, Texas|Azle]], Harmony Plains at [[Cone, Texas|Cone]], and Melody Grove at [[Warren, Tyler County, Texas|Warren]]). There are several non-denominational seven-shape singing schools throughout the southern United States, including the North Georgia School of Gospel Music in Georgia, [[Ben Speer]]'s Stamps-Baxter School of Music in Tennessee, Cumberland Valley School of Gospel Music in Tennessee and the Alabama School of Gospel Music in Alabama. Camp Fasola, which was founded in 2003, is an attempt by Sacred Harp enthusiasts to establish a permanent annual singing school.

Singing schools are also common in Missionary Baptist churches, as well as rural churches across the South, including Methodist, Church of God, Southern Baptist, and other denominations. Many of these churches still prefer to use shape note hymnals, as opposed to round note versions that many denominational publishing houses provide. In southern gospel singing schools, [[convention songbook]]s are used to teach sight-singing, music theory, and conducting. Some music publishing companies have also published music theory books for use in the schools.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Rudiments of Music'' and ''Understanding Harmony'', published by ''jeffress/phillips music co.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==

The basic subjects taught at singing schools are [[music theory]] and [[sight reading]] (the ability to sing a piece of music on first reading). Most southern gospel schools also focus extensively on song leading, the ability to direct a group in vocal music. Song leading requires both music theory skills and [[public speaking]] skills. In addition, many schools teach composition and ear training. Most song leading classes are open to both genders, but some schools are associated with Christian religious traditions that allow only male leadership and therefore only offer such classes to males.
 
Sacred Harp singing schools use one or more of the 20th century editions of ''The Sacred Harp'' as curriculum. Some of these schools are one-day workshops held in conjunction with a singing convention. The emphasis is on teaching newcomers and advanced musicians the note system and traditions of Sacred Harp.

Many singing schools have published their own small textbooks on music theory, harmony, and song and lyric composition. These are often offered to students as part of the tuition charge of the school.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}Some schools, such as Cumberland Valley School of Gospel Music, include in the tuition charge a convention songbook rather than a textbook.  At some schools students purchase a [[pitch pipe]] or [[tuning fork]]. Primitive Baptists commonly practice pitching by ear rather than with a pitch pipe. Southern gospel schools primarily use the [[piano]] as accompaniment. Pitch pipes are sometimes used in individual classes for brief practice.

It is common for students to continue to return to their singing school year after year, even after completing the entire curriculum the school offers, for additional practice as well as for the social opportunity the school represents. Many singing school students eventually become teachers. Though singing schools are not as prominent today as they were, for many people they are still an important yearly event.

[[File:Clare College, Cambridge, July 2010 (16).JPG|thumb|Clare College, University of Cambridge a regular venue for the Social Stratification Seminars.]]
The '''Social Stratification Research Seminar (UK)''' is an annual research colloquium for original, empirically informed [[Sociology|sociological]] presentations on [[social stratification]]. The Social Stratification Research Seminars have been running almost every autumn since 1968. The seminars have mainly been hosted at the [[University of Cambridge]] and were often organised by the [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/social-science-research-group Social Science Research Group (formerly the Sociological Research Group)]. The seminars have also been held at the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff (]]2003-5), the [[University of Edinburgh]] (2014, 2017), the [[University of Milan]] (2015), the [[University of Stirling]] (2007, 2011) and [[Utrecht University]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/stratif/conf_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The original movers and shakers behind the seminar were three distinguished British scholars working in the field of social stratification - [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/professor-robert-martin-bob-blackburn Professor Robert (Bob) Blackburn],  [https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/about/people/fellows-profiles/professor-ken-prandy Professor Ken Prandy,] and Professor Alexander (Sandy) Stewart. Since the early part of this [[Year 2000|millennium]] the seminar has been organised by [https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/255764 Professor Paul Lambert], who is Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Stirling]] and a longstanding fan of [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion F.C]]. The annual call for papers is usually issued in the spring and the seminar is usually held on two consecutive days in the early September. Proposals for papers for presentations are invited from any area of research into social stratification and social inequality.  The organizers do not usually limit the number of delegates attending. There are no parallel sessions and therefore there is an upper limit on the number of paper presentations that can be accommodated.

A salient feature of the Social Stratification Research Seminars has been how to appropriately measure social stratification in contemporary societies. An approach that has been developed by researchers who are regular contributors to the seminars are Social Interaction and Stratification Scales.&lt;ref&gt;See Stewart, A., PRANDY, K. and Blackburn, R.M., 1973. Measuring the class structure. ''Nature'', ''245''(5426), p.415.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is the foundation of the [http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/ CAMSIS Project] which is an internationally comparative assessment of the structures of social interaction and stratification across a number of countries.

A number of prominent research publications contain work that was developed and showcased at the seminars. These works include an edited volume entitled [https://www.routledge.com/Social-Stratification-Trends-and-Processes/Connelly-Gayle-Lambert/p/book/9781409430964 ''Social stratification:Trends and processes'']&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, P., Connelly, M.R., Blackburn, R.M. and Gayle, V. eds., 2013. ''Social stratification: Trends and processes''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd..&lt;/ref&gt;'','' and special issues of the journal ''[https://rsa.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/11/2-3?nav=tocList Contemporary Social Science]'' and the [https://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ijssp/28/7%2F8 ''International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy''] [https://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ijssp/28/5%2F6].

Notable sociological scholars in the field of social stratification who have attended the Social Stratification Research Seminars include [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=-abxxmUAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate Professor Harry Ganzeboom], [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=gscMj2wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra Dr Wendy Bottero], [https://www.ncl.ac.uk/gps/staff/profile/geoffpayne.html#publications Professor Geoff Payne], [https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/Administration-Services/The-President-s-Office/Institutional-Development/Sustainability/Research/Social-Sciences.html Professor Max Bergman], and [http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/profile.aspx?KeyValue=l.platt@lse.ac.uk Professor Lucinda Platt]. The meeting is also attended by early career researchers such as [https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/266076 Jennifer Ferguson].

It contributes to reading promotion and [[reading education]] through programmes, scientific research, and political recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EURead|title=The social context of the foundation's work|url=http://www.euread.com/organisations/details/stiftung_lesen/|website=www.euread.com|publisher=Stiftung Lesen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To create a basis for the development of reading skills, and to enhance the overall level of literacy, Stiftung Lesen established adequate and accessible programmes for every member of society – regardless of financial, cultural or social background.

== Objective ==
Stiftung Lesen acts as an advocate for reading and media competency in Germany to ensure that every child and adult in Germany develops crucial reading and media skills, and enjoys reading. Stiftung Lesen’s initiatives and programmes as well as pilot and research projects complement and build on each other. The programmes support early infant development in the family and nurseries when the basis of reading competency is laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EURead|title=The social context of the foundation's work|url=http://www.euread.com/organisations/details/stiftung_lesen/|website=www.euread.com|publisher=Stiftung Lesen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Older children and teenagers are reached through projects in- and outside school, covering their future development. In addition to the children benefitting directly, actors chaperoning the children’s development such as parents, childcare workers, teachers, booksellers and librarians are integrated in the programmes. To promote its activities the foundation has partnered with such well-known organizations as ''[[Die Zeit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Susan Lynn "Suze" Orman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|z|i}} {{respell|SOO|zee}}; born June 5, 1951) is an American author, [[financial advisor]], [[motivational speaker]], and [[television host]]. She earned a degree in social work then worked as a financial advisor for  [[Merrill Lynch]]. In 1983, she became a vice president of retail customer investments at [[Prudential Bache Securities]]. In 1987, she founded the Suze Orman Financial Group. In 2002, her program ''The Suze Orman Show'' began airing on [[CNBC]]. In 2006, she won a [[Gracie Allen Awards|Gracie Award]] for Outstanding Program Host on ''The Suze Orman Show''.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite news|author=Curry, Ann |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11642946 |title=''Dateline'' wins Gracie Award|work=MSNBC|date=March 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written several books on the topic of personal finance.

==Early life and education==
Orman was born on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side of Chicago]] on June 5, 1951, to Jewish parents of Russian and Romanian origin, Ann and Morry Orman.&lt;ref name=spiritual&gt;{{cite news|title=Suze Orman's Spiritual Side|work=The Jewish Daily Forward|first=Elissa|last=Strauss|date=October 17, 2007|publisher=The Forward Association, Inc.|url=http://forward.com/articles/11820/a-financial-guru-s-spiritual-side-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dignitymemorial.com/en-ca/obituaries/boca-raton-fl/ann-orman-5228598&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother worked as a secretary for a local rabbi, while her immigrant father from [[Kiev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Millennial Money Moves|date=February 7, 2015|series= The Suze Orman Show|network=CNBC.com|url=https://www.cnbc.com/live-tv/the-suze-orman-show/full-episode/millenial-money-moves/394285635704}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked in a chicken factory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17orman-t.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|first=Susan|last=Dominus|title=Suze Orman Is Having a Moment|date=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1318/is_n11_v52/ai_21225107|work=Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine|title=If you knew Suze…|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foir1-2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/tv_suze_orman_isnt_all_about_the_money_she_has_a_spiritual_side_too|title=News - Suze Orman|work=The Jewish Journal|accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and managed Morry's Deli &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Spiselman| first        = Anne| title= Morry's Deli| url= http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/morrys-deli/Location?oid=1360950| newspaper= Chicago Reader| | access-date  = 2016-09-05 |quote=in the mid-1970s—when you might have found college student Suze Orman working behind the counter for her dad, the original owner...}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]].&lt;ref name="Orman2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantor|first=Danielle|title=Successful Women: Suze Orman|publisher=Jewish Women International|work=Jewish Woman|issue=Fall 2004|url=http://www.jwmag.org/site/c.fhLOK0PGLsF/b.2440689/k.3442/Suze_Orman.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923123457/http://www.jwmag.org/site/c.fhLOK0PGLsF/b.2440689/k.3442/Suze_Orman.htm|archivedate=2008-09-23|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orman1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloom|first=Nate|title=Celebrity Jews: Briefly noted|publisher=San Francisco Jewish Community Publications Inc.|website=jewishsf.com|date=2004-06-11|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/22714/edition_id/455/format/html/displaystory.html|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orman3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Iwata|first=Edward|title=Personal finance guru Suze Orman is keepin' it real despite her astounding success|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=1999-05-04|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/archive/1999/05/04/BUSINESS10622.dtl|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[social work]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="dailyillini.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Post to Wall|url=http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/2009/05/18/suze-orman-receives-honorary-degree-addresses-university-graduates|title=Suze Orman receives honorary degree, addresses University graduates.|website=Dailyillini.com|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Orman received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;ref name="dailyillini.com"/&gt;

==Career==
After finishing school, Orman moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where she worked as a waitress. In 1980, she borrowed $52,000 from friends and wellwishers to open a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suzeorman.com/aboutsuze/index.cfm|title=History from Orman's website|website=Suzeorman.com|accessdate=2012-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701103049/http://www.suzeorman.com/aboutsuze/index.cfm|archivedate=2012-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmE8YHpVl1gC |title=Women &amp; money: owning the power to control your destiny|pages= 27–28|publisher= Random House, Inc.|date= 2007|isbn=0-385-51931-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PublishersWeekly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WomenAndMoney"&gt;{{cite video|people=Orman, Suze|title=Women and Money|medium=TV-program|date=2008-06-05|location=PBS pledge programming|publisher=PBS|url=http://wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=3204814&amp;episode_id=3204816|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615041808/http://www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=3204814&amp;episode_id=3204816|archivedate=2008-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still an investment novice, she invested that money through a representative at [[Merrill Lynch]], who promptly lost her entire investment in trading options. Later, Orman trained as an account executive for [[Merrill Lynch]], where she learned that the type of investment her broker had put her in was not suitable for her needs, as option trading is considered a high-risk but high-reward investment suitable only for high net worth individuals. It was explained to her that because her broker was the highest producing representative in the office, his actions went unchecked. After completing her training with Merrill Lynch, she remained at the firm until 1983, when she left to become a vice president of investments at [[Prudential Bache Securities]].

In 1987, Orman resigned from Prudential and founded the Suze Orman Financial Group, in [[Emeryville, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Emeryville became a boom town|work=USA Today|date=June 13, 1988|page=8B|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0ED02A6F0FCB2CCA&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_queryname=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catastrophic Coverage Raises Some Questions|work=The Times-Picayune|location=New Orleans, Louisiana|date=May 9, 1989|first=Jay|last=Goldinger|page=E4|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0FADA1870A704F01&amp;p_docnum=3&amp;p_queryname=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, she published a booklet, ''The Facts on Single Premium Whole Life'', which compared single-premium whole life, universal life, and single-premium deferred annuities; she distributed copies of the booklet for free to anyone who requested one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Closed-end Funds Offer Good Value for the Investor|work=The Times-Picayune|location=New Orleans, Louisiana|date=September 19, 1989|page=D3|first=Jay|last=Goldinger|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0FADA0310C91E9E0&amp;p_docnum=5&amp;p_queryname=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was director of the firm until 1997.&lt;ref name="PublishersWeekly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Andriani|first=Lynn|title=The Dollars and Sense of Suze Orman|publisher=Publishers Weekly|date=2003-02-24|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA278785.html?display=archive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920223930/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA278785.html?display=archive|archivedate=2008-09-20|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orman published three books between 1997-99: ''The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom'' (1997), ''You Earned it Don't Lose it'' (1999), and  ''The Courage to be Rich'' (1999). Other books by Orman include: ''The Road to Wealth'' (2001) and ''The Laws of Money, The Lessons of Life'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_bks&amp;q=Suze+Orman&amp;fq=dt%3Abks Suze Orman], WorldCat.org; accessed 2013-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Suze Orman Show'' began airing on [[CNBC]] in 2002.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In February 2008, Orman gave away copies of her book ''Women and Money'' for free following an appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', generating almost two million downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17orman-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|first=Susan|last=Dominus|title=Suze Orman Is Having a Moment|date=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orman has been featured on the [[Food Network]]'s ''[[Paula's Party]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In January 2011, Orman appeared on ''Oprah's Allstars''. In January 2012, Orman's six-episode TV series ''America's Money Class with Suze Orman'' premiered on [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2012/01/09/americas-money-class-with-suze-orman "America's Money Class with Suze Orman"], channelguidemag.com, 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orman writes a financial advice column for ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Orman, Suze (January 6, 2010) [http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/personal/01/06/o.orman.easy.money.list/index.html Easy Money], CNN.com; accessed January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She is the former author of  [[Yahoo!]]'s "Money Matters" and has written for the ''[[Costco]] Connection Magazine''. She contributes to ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''Lowes MoneyWorks'', and ''Your Business at Home Magazine''.&lt;ref name="ybah"&gt;Orman, Suze.

While she has proven herself a wealth of information about credit and very general financial issues, Orman's understanding of comprehensive financial planning has been questioned by many in the industry. Senior ''MarketWatch'' columnist Chuck Jaffe, for example, states that Orman "scores very high on the personality index, but very low on the knowledge and understanding of the complex issues that face a lot of her audience. She's giving generic, simple solutions to people's most difficult problems, and judging from her [own personal investment] portfolio she's taking them on a path she really hasn't traveled herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/outing-suze-ormans-investment-portfolio|title=Outing Suze Orman's portfolio|author=Chuck Jaffe|date=Mar 8, 2007|website=[[MarketWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orman's final episode of ''The Suze Orman Show'' aired on March 28, 2015, so Orman could develop a new series, ''Suze Orman's Money Wars'', for Warner Bros. [[Telepictures Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Suze Orman to Exit CNBC for 'Money Wars' Series with Telepictures|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/suze-orman-to-exit-cnbc-after-14-years-1201364521/|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orman hoped the show would premiere in the fall of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/so-long-suze-orman-show-tvs-only-sane-space-in-a-money-crazed-culture/2015/03/27/068c9524-d331-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html|title=So long, ‘Suze Orman Show,’ TV’s only sane space in a money-crazed culture|last=Stuever|first=Hank|date=2015-03-27|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-10|last2=Stuever|first2=Hank|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suze Orman "Approved" prepaid debit card==
In 2012, Orman introduced a prepaid [[debit card]], backed by Bancorp Bank, aimed at [[Working class in the United States|budget-challenged consumers]]. In personal appearances, she claimed the card would contribute to improving the cardholder's [[FICO]] score, even though only one credit agency – [[TransUnion]] – had reviewed the proposal and had agreed only to "examine data from [the] cards". The website for the debit card claimed, "I am proud to say that the Approved card is the first prepaid card in history to share information with TransUnion, a major credit bureau."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/business/truth-behind-suze-ormans-new-debit-card-1C7101032 The truth behind Suze Orman's devit card] [[NBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the program was quietly ended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/business/suze-ormans-approved-prepaid-debit-cards-are-quietly-discontinued.html?_r=0 Suze Orman's prepaid debit cards are quietly discontinued] ''[[New York Times]]'' 2014/06/17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}

In [[linguistics]], '''syntax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|t|æ|k|s}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in a given [[Natural language|language]], usually including [[word order]]. The term ''syntax'' is also used  to refer to the study of such principles and processes.&lt;ref name="Chomsky def"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2002 |origyear=1957 |title= Syntactic Structures |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SNeHkMXHcd8C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22syntax+is%22 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the [[Universal grammar|syntactic rules]] common to all languages.

In mathematics, ''syntax'' refers to the rules governing the notation of mathematical systems, such as [[formal language]]s used in [[logic]]. (See [[Syntax (logic)|logical syntax]].)

== Etymology ==
The word ''syntax'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]]: {{wikt-lang|grc|σύνταξις}} "coordination", which consists of {{lang|grc|σύν}} ''syn'', "together", and {{lang|grc|τάξις}} ''táxis'', "an ordering".

==Sequencing of subject, verb, and object==

A basic feature of a language's syntax is the sequence in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (S), [[verb]] (V), and [[object (grammar)|object]] (O) usually appear in sentences. Over 85% of languages usually place the subject first, either in the sequence [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] or the sequence [[subject-object-verb|SOV]]. The other possible sequences are [[verb-subject-object|VSO]], [[verb-object-subject|VOS]], [[object-verb-subject|OVS]], and [[object-subject-verb|OSV]], the last three of which are rare.

== Early history ==
Works on [[grammar]] were written long before modern syntax came about; in [[Ancient India|Ancient]] [[India]], the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 4th century BC) is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortson IV |first=Benjamin W. |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1405188968 |page=186 |quote=[The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī''] is a highly precise and thorough description of the structure of Sanskrit somewhat resembling modern generative grammar...[it] remained the most advanced linguistic analysis of any kind until the twentieth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as "traditional grammar" began with the work of [[Dionysius Thrax]].

For centuries, work in syntax was dominated by a framework known as {{lang|fr|grammaire générale}}, first expounded in 1660 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] in a book of the same title. This system took as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and therefore there is a single, most natural way to express a thought.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, in the 19th century, with the development of [[historical-comparative linguistics]], linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic. It became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought, and therefore [[logic]] could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal grammar]] modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic. (Indeed, large parts of the [[Port-Royal Logic]] were copied or adapted from the ''Grammaire générale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnauld |first=Antoine |title=La logique |year=1683 |edition=5th |location=Paris |publisher=G. Desprez |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-57444 |quote={{lang|fr|Nous avons emprunté...ce que nous avons dit...d'un petit Livre...sous le titre de Grammaire générale.}} |pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Syntactic categories were identified with logical ones, and all sentences were analyzed in terms of "subject – copula – predicate". Initially, this view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as [[Franz Bopp]].

The central role of syntax within [[theoretical linguistics]] became clear only in the 20th century, which could reasonably be called the "century of syntactic theory" as far as linguistics is concerned. (For a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries, see the monumental work by Giorgio Graffi (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Giorgio |first=Graffi |year= 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/200_Years_of_Syntax.html?id=mydolrE-PPkC |title= 200 Years of Syntax: A Critical Survey |format=googlebook preview |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=9789027284570  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

== Theories ==
There are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax. One school of thought, founded in the works of [[Derek Bickerton]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=Language and Species |author=Bickerton, Derek |year=1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-04610-9}} and, for more recent advances, {{cite book |title=Biological foundations and origin of syntax |editor1=Derek Bickerton |editor2=Eörs Szathmáry |year=2009 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human [[mind]]. Other linguists (e.g., [[Gerald Gazdar]]) take a more [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonistic]] view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract [[formal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Briscoe, 2 May 2001, [http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html#SECTION00040000000000000000 Interview with Gerald Gazdar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122163306/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html |date=2005-11-22 }}. Retrieved 2008-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others (e.g., [[Joseph Greenberg]]) consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages.

=== Generative grammar ===
{{Main|Generative grammar}}
The hypothesis of generative grammar is that language is a structure of the human mind. The goal of generative grammar is to make a complete model of this inner language (known as ''[[i-language]]''). This model could be used to describe all human language and to predict the [[grammaticality]] of any given utterance (that is, to predict whether the utterance would sound correct to native speakers of the language). This approach to language was pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]]. Most generative theories (although not all of them) assume that syntax is based upon the constituent structure of sentences. Generative grammars are among the theories that focus primarily on the form of a sentence, rather than its communicative function.

Among the many generative theories of linguistics, the Chomskyan theories are:
* [[Transformational grammar]] (TG) (Original theory of generative syntax laid out by Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1957)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures''. The Hague/Paris: Mouton, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government and binding theory]] (GB) (revised theory in the tradition of TG developed mainly by Chomsky in the 1970s and 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minimalist program]] (MP) (a reworking of the theory out of the GB framework published by Chomsky in 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1995). The Minimalist Program. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are:
* [[Arc pair grammar]]
* [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG; now largely out of date)
* [[Generative semantics]] (superseded by Semantic Syntax &lt;ref&gt;Seuren, P. A. M. 2018. ''Semantic Syntax''. Revised edition. Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)
* [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG)
* [[Nanosyntax]]&lt;!--Commenting out until explained: the link seems to be about something unrelated. HPSG and LFG also fall into the category of [[unification]] grammars.--&gt;
* [[Relational grammar]] (RG) (now largely out of date)

=== Dependency grammar ===
{{Main|Dependency grammar}}
[[Dependency grammar]] is an approach to sentence structure where syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation, as opposed to the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s. Dependencies are directed links between words. The (finite) verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on this root. Some prominent dependency-based theories of syntax are:

* [[Recursive categorical syntax]], or Algebraic syntax
* [[Functional generative description]]
* [[Meaning–text theory]]
* [[Operator grammar]]
* [[Word grammar]]

[[Lucien Tesnière]] (1893–1954) is widely seen as the father of modern dependency-based theories of syntax and grammar. He argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] that is associated with the grammars of his day (S → NP VP) and which remains at the core of most phrase structure grammars. In the place of this division, he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Tesnière's rejection of the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate and in favor of the verb as the root of all structure, see Tesnière (1969:103–105).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorial grammar ===
{{Main|Categorial grammar}}
[[Categorial grammar]] is an approach that attributes the syntactic structure not to rules of grammar, but to the properties of the [[syntactic categories]] themselves. For example, rather than asserting that sentences are constructed by a rule that combines a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) (e.g., the [[phrase structure rule]] S → NP VP), in categorial grammar, such principles are embedded in the category of the [[head (linguistics)|head]] word itself. So the syntactic category for an [[intransitive]] verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a [[function word]] requiring an NP as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output. This complex category is notated as (NP\S) instead of V. NP\S is read as "a category that searches to the left (indicated by \) for an NP (the element on the left) and outputs a sentence (the element on the right)." The category of [[transitive verb]] is defined as an element that requires two NPs (its subject and its direct object) to form a sentence. This is notated as (NP/(NP\S)) which means "a category that searches to the right (indicated by /) for an NP (the object), and generates a function (equivalent to the VP) which is (NP\S), which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an NP and produces a sentence."

[[Tree-adjoining grammar]] is a categorial grammar that adds in partial [[tree structure]]s to the categories.

=== Stochastic/probabilistic grammars/network theories ===
Theoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon [[probability theory]] are known as [[stochastic grammar]]s. One common implementation of such an approach makes use of a [[neural network]] or [[connectionism]].

=== Functionalist grammars ===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functionalist theories, although focused upon form, are driven by explanation based upon the function of a sentence (i.e., its communicative function). Some typical functionalist theories include:
* [[Cognitive grammar]]
* [[Construction grammar]] (CxG)
* [[Emergent grammar]]
* [[Functional discourse grammar]] (Dik)
* [[Prague linguistic circle]]
* [[Role and reference grammar]] (RRG)
* [[Systemic functional grammar]]

'''''The Century of the Self''''' is a 2002 British television [[documentary]] series by filmmaker [[Adam Curtis]]. It focuses on the work of psychoanalysts [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Anna Freud]], and PR consultant [[Edward Bernays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Adams |first= Tim |date= 10 March 2002 |title= How Freud got under our skin |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/mar/10/medicalscience.highereducation |newspaper= [[The Observer]] |accessdate= 13 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In episode one, Curtis says, "This series is about how those in power have used Freud's theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy."

== Overview ==
[[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], changed our perception of the mind and its workings. The documentary explores the various ways that governments and corporations have used Freud's theories. Freud and his nephew [[Edward Bernays]], who was the first to use psychological techniques in [[public relations]], are discussed in part one. His daughter [[Anna Freud]], a pioneer of child psychology, is mentioned in part two. [[Wilhelm Reich]], an opponent of Freud's theories, is discussed in part three.

{{Quote box | quote = To many in politics and business, the triumph of the self is the ultimate expression of democracy, where power has finally moved to the people. Certainly, the people may feel they are in charge, but are they really? ''The Century of the Self'' tells the untold and sometimes controversial story of the growth of the mass-consumer society. How was the all-consuming self created, by whom, and in whose interests? | source = BBC publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/century_of_the_self.shtml|title=BBC Four Documentaries - The Century of the Self |work=[[BBC Online]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514032526/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/century_of_the_self.shtml|archivedate=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; | width = 20% | align = left}}

Along these lines, ''The Century of the Self'' asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of [[consumerism]] and [[commodification]] and their implications. It also questions the modern way people see themselves, the attitudes to [[fashion]], and [[superficiality]].

The business and political worlds use psychological techniques to read, create and fulfill the desires of the public, and to make their products and speeches as pleasing as possible to consumers and voters. Curtis questions the intentions and origins of this relatively new approach to engaging the public.

Where once the political process was about engaging people's rational, conscious minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a group, [[Stuart Ewen]], a historian of public relations, argues that politicians now appeal to [[Instinct|primitive impulses]] that have little bearing on issues outside the narrow self-interests of a consumer society.

The words of Paul Mazur, a leading [[Wall Street]] banker working for [[Lehman Brothers]] in 1927, are cited: "We must shift America from a needs- to a desires-culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been entirely consumed. [...] Man's desires must overshadow his needs."&lt;ref&gt;Note: the quote is from a 1927 article by Mazur in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part four the main subjects are [[Philip Gould]], a political strategist, and [[Matthew Freud]], a PR consultant and the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud. In the 1990s, they were instrumental to bringing the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the US and [[New Labour]] in the United Kingdom back into power through use of the [[focus group]], originally invented by psychoanalysts employed by US corporations to allow consumers to express their feelings and needs, just as patients do in psychotherapy.

Curtis ends by saying that, "Although we feel we are free, in reality, we—like the politicians—have become the slaves of our own desires," and compares Britain and America to 'Democracity', an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] created by Edward Bernays.

'''Theoretical astronomy''' is the use of the analytical models of physics and chemistry to describe [[astronomical objects]] and astronomical phenomena.

[[Ptolemy]]'s [[Almagest]], although a brilliant treatise on theoretical [[astronomy]] combined with a practical handbook for computation, nevertheless includes many compromises to reconcile discordant observations. Theoretical astronomy is usually assumed to have begun with [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630), and [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]]. It is co-equal with observation. The general history of astronomy deals with the history of the descriptive and theoretical astronomy of the Solar System, from the late sixteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century. The major categories of works on the history of modern astronomy include general histories, national and institutional histories, instrumentation, descriptive astronomy, theoretical astronomy, positional astronomy, and astrophysics. Astronomy was early to adopt computational techniques to model stellar and galactic formation and celestial mechanics. From the point of view of theoretical astronomy, not only must the mathematical expression be reasonably accurate but it should preferably exist in a form which is amenable to further mathematical analysis when used in specific problems. Most of theoretical astronomy uses Newtonian theory of gravitation, considering that the effects of general relativity are weak for most celestial objects. The obvious fact is that theoretical astronomy cannot (and does not try to) predict the position, size and temperature of every star in the heavens. Theoretical astronomy by and large has concentrated upon analyzing the apparently complex but periodic motions of celestial objects.

The aim of astronomy is to understand the physics and chemistry from the laboratory that is behind cosmic events so as to enrich our understanding of the cosmos and of these sciences as well.&lt;ref name=Narlikar/&gt;

==Integrating astronomy and chemistry==
{{Main|Astrochemistry}}
'''Astrochemistry''', the overlap of the disciplines of [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]], is the study of the abundance and reactions of [[chemical elements]] and molecules in space, and their interaction with radiation. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [[Molecular cloud|molecular gas cloud]]s, is of special interest because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

Infrared astronomy, for example, has revealed that the [[interstellar medium]] contains a suite of complex gas-phase carbon compounds called aromatic hydrocarbons, often abbreviated ([[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s or PACs). These molecules composed primarily of fused rings of carbon (either neutral or in an ionized state) are said to be the most common class of carbon compound in the galaxy. They are also the most common class of carbon molecule in [[meteorite]]s and in cometary and asteroidal dust ([[cosmic dust]]). These compounds, as well as the amino acids, nucleobases, and many other compounds in meteorites, carry [[deuterium]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) and [[isotope]]s of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that are very rare on earth, attesting to their extraterrestrial origin. The PAHs are thought to form in hot circumstellar environments (around dying carbon rich [[red giant]] stars).

The sparseness of interstellar and interplanetary space results in some unusual chemistry, since symmetry-forbidden reactions cannot occur except on the longest of timescales. For this reason, molecules and molecular ions which are unstable on earth can be highly abundant in space, for example the [[Protonated molecular hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ion. Astrochemistry overlaps with [[astrophysics]] and [[nuclear physics]] in characterizing the nuclear reactions which occur in stars, the consequences for [[stellar evolution]], as well as stellar 'generations'. Indeed, the nuclear reactions in stars produce every naturally occurring [[chemical element]]. As the stellar 'generations' advance, the mass of the newly formed elements increases. A first-generation star uses elemental [[hydrogen]] (H) as a fuel source and produces [[helium]] (He). Hydrogen is the most abundant element, and it is the basic building block for all other elements as its nucleus has only one [[proton]]. Gravitational pull toward the center of a star creates massive amounts of heat and pressure, which cause [[nuclear fusion]]. Through this process of merging nuclear mass, heavier elements are formed. [[Lithium]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] are examples of elements that form in stellar fusion. After many stellar generations, very heavy elements are formed (e.g. [[iron]] and [[lead]]).

==Tools of theoretical astronomy==
Theoretical astronomers use a wide variety of tools which include [[mathematical model|analytical models]]  (for example, [[polytrope]]s to approximate the behaviors of a [[star]]) and [[computation]]al  [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525|author=Roth H |title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=39|issue=3 |pages=525–9 |date=1932 |bibcode=1932PhRv...39..525R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eddington&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eddington AS |title=Internal Constitution of the Stars |date=1926 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-33708-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy theorists endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps observers look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. Consistent with the general scientific approach, in the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

==Topics of theoretical astronomy==
Topics studied by theoretical astronomers include:
# [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]];
# [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]];
# [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]]  of [[matter]]  in the [[Universe]];
# origin of [[cosmic ray]]s;
# [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and [[astroparticle physics]].

Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')[[physics]] and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

==Astronomical models==
Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]] are the [[Big Bang]], [[Cosmic inflation]], [[dark matter]], and fundamental theories of [[physics]].

==Leading topics in theoretical astronomy==
[[Dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] are the current leading topics in astronomy,&lt;ref&gt;http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/dark_matter.html third paragraph, "There is currently much ongoing research by scientists attempting to discover exactly what this dark matter is". Retrieved 2009-11-02&lt;/ref&gt; as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the galaxies.

==Theoretical astrophysics==
Of the topics approached with the tools of theoretical physics, particular consideration is often given to stellar photospheres, stellar atmospheres, the solar atmosphere, planetary atmospheres, gaseous nebulae, nonstationary stars, and the interstellar medium. Special attention is given to the internal structure of stars.&lt;ref name=Sobolev&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sobolev VV |title=Course in theoretical astrophysics |date=1985 |pages=504 |edition=3rd revised and enlarged |publisher=Izdatel'stvo Nauka |location=Moscow |bibcode=1985cta..book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak equivalence principle===
The observation of a neutrino burst within 3 h of the associated optical burst from [[Supernova 1987A]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC) gave theoretical astrophysicists an opportunity to test that neutrinos and photons follow the same trajectories in the gravitational field of the galaxy.&lt;ref name=Krauss&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Krauss LM|author2=Tremaine S |title=Test of the Weak Equivalence Principle for Neutrinos and Photons |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |date=Mar 1988 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=176–7 |url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.176 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.176 |bibcode=1988PhRvL..60..176K |pmid=10038467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermodynamics for stationary black holes===
A general form of the first law of thermodynamics for stationary [[black hole]]s can be derived from the microcanonical functional integral for the gravitational field.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brown JD|author2=York JW Jr. |title=Microcanonical functional integral for the gravitational field |journal=Phys. Rev. D |date=Apr 1993 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=1420–31 |url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.47.1420 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.47.1420 |arxiv = gr-qc/9209014 |bibcode = 1993PhRvD..47.1420B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary data
# the gravitational field as described with a micocanonical system in a spatially finite region and
# the density of states expressed formally as a functional integral over Lorentzian metrics and as a functional of the geometrical boundary data that are fixed in the corresponding action,
are the thermodynamical extensive variables, including the energy and angular momentum of the system.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; For the simpler case of nonrelativistic mechanics as is often observed in astrophysical phenomena associated with a black hole event horizon, the density of states can be expressed as a real-time functional integral and subsequently used to deduce Feynman's imaginary-time functional integral for the canonical partition function.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

==Theoretical astrochemistry==
Reaction equations and large reaction networks are an important tool in theoretical astrochemistry, especially as applied to the gas-grain chemistry of the interstellar medium.&lt;ref name=Vasyunin&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vasyunin AI|author2=Semenov DA|author3=Wiebe DS|author4=Henning T |title=A UNIFIED MONTE CARLO TREATMENT OF GAS-GRAIN CHEMISTRY FOR LARGE REACTION NETWORKS. I. TESTING VALIDITY OF RATE EQUATIONS IN MOLECULAR CLOUDS |journal=Astrophys. J. |date=Feb 2009 |volume=691 |issue=2 |pages=1459–69 |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0004-637X/691/2/1459 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/691/2/1459 |bibcode=2009ApJ...691.1459V|arxiv = 0810.1591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical astrochemistry offers the prospect of being able to place constraints on the inventory of organics for exogenous delivery to the early Earth.

===Interstellar organics===
"An important goal for theoretical astrochemistry is to elucidate which organics are of true interstellar origin, and to identify possible interstellar precursors and reaction pathways for those molecules which are the result of aqueous alterations."&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ehrenfreund P|author2=Charnley SB|author3=Botta O |title=A voyage from dark clouds to the early Earth ''In: Astrophysics of life: proceedings of the Space Telescope Science Institute Symposium held in Baltimore, Maryland, May 6–9, 2002, Volume 16 of Space Telescope Science Institute symposium series'' |date=2005 |editor=Livio M |editor2= Reid IN |editor3=Sparks WB |pages=1–20 of 110 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=9780521824903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the ways this goal can be achieved is through the study of carbonaceous material as found in some meteorites. Carbonaceous chondrites (such as C1 and C2) include organic compounds such as amines and amides; alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones; aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; sulfonic and phosphonic acids; amino, hydroxycarboxylic, and carboxylic acids; purines and pyrimidines; and [[kerogen]]-type material.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund/&gt; The organic inventories of primitive meteorites display large and variable enrichments in deuterium, [[carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), and [[nitrogen-15]] (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N), which is indicative of their retention of an interstellar heritage.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund/&gt;

===Chemistry in cometary comae===
The chemical composition of comets should reflect both the conditions in the outer solar nebula some 4.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; ayr, and the nature of the natal interstellar cloud from which the [[Solar system]] was formed.&lt;ref name=Rodgers&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rodgers SD|author2=Charnley SB |title=A model of the chemistry in cometary comae: deuterated molecules |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=Mar 2002 |volume=330 |issue=3 |pages=660–74 |bibcode=2002MNRAS.330..660R |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05165.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; While comets retain a strong signature of their ultimate interstellar origins, significant processing must have occurred in the protosolar nebula.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt; Early models of coma chemistry showed that reactions can occur rapidly in the inner coma, where the most important reactions are proton transfer reactions.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt; Such reactions can potentially cycle deuterium between the different coma molecules, altering the initial D/H ratios released from the nuclear ice, and necessitating the construction of accurate models of cometary deuterium chemistry, so that gas-phase coma observations can be safely extrapolated to give nuclear D/H ratios.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt;

==Theoretical chemical astronomy==
While the lines of conceptual understanding between theoretical astrochemistry and theoretical chemical astronomy often become blurred so that the goals and tools are the same, there are subtle differences between the two sciences. Theoretical chemistry as applied to astronomy seeks to find new ways to observe chemicals in celestial objects, for example. This often leads to theoretical astrochemistry having to seek new ways to describe or explain those same observations.

===Astronomical spectroscopy===
The new era of chemical astronomy had to await the clear enunciation of the chemical principles of spectroscopy and the applicable theory.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Merrill PW |title=Great Epochs in Astronomy |journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets |date=1954 |volume=7 |pages=41–8 |bibcode=1954ASPL....7...41M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry of dust condensation===
Supernova radioactivity dominates light curves and the chemistry of dust condensation is also dominated by radioactivity.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Clayton DD|author2= Liu W |title=Radioactivity Frontier for Supernova Chemistry |journal=Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. |date=1999 |volume=31 |pages=739 |bibcode=1999HEAD....4.3602C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dust is usually either carbon or oxides depending on which is more abundant, but Compton electrons dissociate the CO molecule in about one month.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; The new chemical astronomy of supernova solids depends on the supernova radioactivity:
# the radiogenesis of &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca  from &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti decay after carbon condensation establishes their supernova source,
# their opacity suffices to shift emission lines blueward after 500 d and emits significant infrared luminosity,
# parallel kinetic rates determine trace isotopes in meteoritic supernova graphites,
# the chemistry is kinetic rather than due to thermal equilibrium and
# is made possible by radiodeactivation of the CO trap for carbon.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;

==Theoretical physical astronomy==
Like theoretical chemical astronomy, the lines of conceptual understanding between theoretical astrophysics and theoretical physical astronomy are often blurred, but, again, there are subtle differences between these two sciences. Theoretical physics as applied to astronomy seeks to find new ways to observe physical phenomena in celestial objects and what to look for, for example. This often leads to theoretical astrophysics having to seek new ways to describe or explain those same observations, with hopefully a convergence to improve our understanding of the local environment of Earth and the physical [[Universe]].

===Weak interaction and nuclear double beta decay===
Nuclear matrix elements of relevant operators as extracted from data and from a shell-model and theoretical approximations both for the two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes of decay are used to explain the weak interaction and nuclear structure aspects of nuclear double beta decay.&lt;ref name=Suhonen&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00087-2|author=Suhonen J|author2=Civitarese O |title=Weak-interaction and nuclear-structure aspects of nuclear double beta decay |journal=Phys.

===Neutron-rich isotopes===
New neutron-rich isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Na, and &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Si have been produced unambiguously for the first time, and convincing evidence for the particle instability of three others, &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Na, and &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Mg has been obtained.&lt;ref name=Notani&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=6|author=Notani M|author2=Sakurai H|author3=Aoi N|author4=Yanagisawa Y|author5=Saito A|author6=Imai N|author7=Gomi T|author8=Miura M|author9=Michimasa S|author10=Iwasaki H|author11=Fukuda N|author12=Ishihara M|author13=Kubo T|author14= Kubono S|author15=Kumagai H|author16=Lukyanov SM|author17=Motobayashi T|author18=Onishi TK|author19=Penionzhkevich YE|author20=Shimoura S|author21=Teranishi T|author22=Ue K|author23=Ugryumov V|author24=Yoshida A |title=New neutron-rich isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Na and &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Si, produced by fragmentation of a 64 A MeV 48Ca beam |journal=Phys.

==Theory of astronomical time keeping==
Until recently all the time units that appear natural to us are caused by astronomical phenomena:
# Earth's orbit around the Sun =&gt; the year, and the seasons,
# [[Moon]]'s orbit around the Earth =&gt; the month,
# Earth's rotation and the succession of brightness and darkness =&gt; the day (and night).

High precision appears problematic:
# amibiguities arise in the exact definition of a rotation or revolution,
# some astronomical processes are uneven and irregular, such as the noncommensurability of year, month, and day,
# there are a multitude of time scales and calendars to solve the first two problems.&lt;ref name=Husfeld&gt;{{Cite web|author=Husfeld D|author2=Kronberg C |title=Astronomical Time Keeping |url=http://www.maa.mhn.de/Scholar/times.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these time scales are [[sidereal time]], [[solar time]], and [[universal time]].

===Atomic time===
{{Main|International Atomic Time}}
[[File:Clock accuracy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Historical accuracy of atomic clocks from [[NIST]].]]
From the [[International System of Units|Systeme Internationale]] (SI) comes the second as defined by the duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles of a particular hyperfine structure transition in the ground state of [[caesium-133]] (&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs).&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; For practical usability a device is required that attempts to produce the SI second (s) such as an [[atomic clock]]. But not all such clocks agree. The weighted mean of many clocks distributed over the whole Earth defines the [[International Atomic Time|Temps Atomique International]]; i.e., the Atomic Time TAI.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; From the [[General theory of relativity]] the time measured depends on the altitude on earth and the spatial velocity of the clock so that TAI refers to a location on sea level that rotates with the Earth.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt;

===Ephemeris time===
{{Main|Ephemeris time}}
Since the Earth's rotation is irregular, any time scale derived from it such as [[Greenwich Mean Time]] led to recurring problems in predicting the [[Ephemeris|Ephemerides]] for the positions of the [[Moon]], [[Sun]], [[planet]]s and their [[natural satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; In 1976 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) resolved that the theoretical basis for ephemeris time (ET) was wholly non-relativistic, and therefore, beginning in 1984 ephemeris time would be replaced by two further time scales with allowance for relativistic corrections. Their names, assigned in 1979,&lt;ref name=Guinot&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Guinot B|author2=Seidelmann PK |title=Time scales&amp;nbsp;– Their history, definition and interpretation |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=Apr 1988 |volume=194 |issue=1–2 |pages=304–8 |bibcode=1988A&amp;A...194..304G }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized their dynamical nature or origin, [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]] (TDB) and [[Terrestrial Dynamical Time]] (TDT).  Both were defined for continuity with ET and were based on what had become the standard SI second, which in turn had been derived from the measured second of ET.
{{See also|Dynamical time scale}}
During the period 1991–2006, the TDB and TDT time scales were both redefined and replaced, owing to difficulties or inconsistencies in their original definitions. The current fundamental relativistic time scales are [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG) and [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB). Both of these have rates that are based on the SI second in respective reference frames (and hypothetically outside the relevant gravity well), but due to relativistic effects, their rates would appear slightly faster when observed at the Earth's surface, and therefore diverge from local Earth-based time scales using the SI second at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=Klioner&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Klioner S |display-authors=etal |title=Units of relativistic time scales and associated quantities |journal=IAU Symposium |volume=261 |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The currently defined IAU time scales also include [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT) (replacing TDT, and now defined as a re-scaling of TCG, chosen to give TT a rate that matches the SI second when observed at the Earth's surface),&lt;ref name=Resol&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://syrte.obspm.fr/IAU_resolutions/Resol-UAI.rtf |title=IAU 2000 resolutions, at Resolution B1.9. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a redefined Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), a re-scaling of TCB to give TDB a rate that matches the SI second at the Earth's surface.

===Extraterrestrial time-keeping===
{{Main|Timekeeping on Mars|Martian calendar}}

===Stellar dynamical time scale===
For a [[star]], the dynamical time scale is defined as the time that would be taken for a test particle released at the surface to fall under the [[star]]'s potential to the centre point, if pressure forces were negligible.  In other words, the dynamical time scale measures the amount of time it would take a certain [[star]] to collapse in the absence of any [[internal pressure]].  By appropriate manipulation of the equations of stellar structure this can be found to be

&lt;math&gt; \tau_{dynamical} \simeq \frac{R}{v} = \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{2GM}} \sim 1/\sqrt{G\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

where R is the [[radius]] of the star, G is the [[gravitational constant]], M is the [[mass]] of the star and v is the [[escape velocity]].  As an example, the [[Sun]] dynamical time scale is approximately 1133 seconds.  Note that the actual time it would take a star like the Sun to collapse is greater because internal pressure is present.

The 'fundamental' oscillatory mode of a star will be at approximately the dynamical time scale. Oscillations at this frequency are seen in [[Cepheid variables]].

==Theory of astronomical navigation==

===On earth===

The basic characteristics of applied astronomical navigation are
# usable in all areas of sailing around the earth,
# applicable autonomously (does not depend on others&amp;nbsp;– persons or states) and passively (does not emit energy),
# conditional usage via optical visibility (of horizon and celestial bodies), or state of cloudiness,
# precisional measurement, sextant is 0.1', altitude and position is between 1.5' and 3.0'.
# temporal determination takes a couple of minutes (using the most modern equipment) and ≤ 30 min (using classical equipment).&lt;ref name=Stajic/&gt;

The superiority of satellite navigation systems to astronomical navigation are currently undeniable, especially with the development and use of GPS/NAVSTAR.&lt;ref name=Stajic&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Stajic D |title=Astronomical navigation at the beginning of the third millenium |journal=Publ Astron Obs Belgrade ''In: Proceedings of the XIII National Conference of Yugoslav Astronomers, Belgrade, October 17–20, 2002'' |date=Oct 2003 |volume=75 |pages=209–16 |bibcode=2003POBeo..75..209S }}{{sic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This global satellite system
# enables automated three-dimensional positioning at any moment,
# automatically determines position continuously (every second or even more often),
# determines position independent of weather conditions (visibility and cloudiness),
# determines position in real time to a few meters (two carrying frequencies) and 100 m (modest commercial receivers), which is two to three orders of magnitude better than by astronomical observation,
# is simple even without expert knowledge,
# is relatively cheap, comparable to equipment for astronomical navigation, and
# allows incorporation into integrated and automated systems of control and ship steering.&lt;ref name=Stajic/&gt; The use of astronomical or celestial navigation is disappearing from the surface and beneath or above the surface of the earth.

'''Geodetic astronomy''' is the application of [[astronomy|astronomical]] methods into [[Wiktionary:Network|network]]s and technical projects of [[geodesy]] for
* [[apparent places]] of stars, and their [[proper motion]]s
* precise astronomical [[astro navigation|navigation]]
* astro-geodetic [[geoid]] determination and

* [[Satellite geodesy]] using the stellar background (see also [[astrometry]] and cosmic triangulation)
* Monitoring of the [[Earth rotation]] and polar wandering
* Contribution to the time system of physics and [[geosciences]]

'''Astronomical algorithms''' are the [[algorithm]]s used to calculate [[ephemeris|ephemerides]], [[calendar]]s, and positions (as in [[celestial navigation]] or [[satellite navigation]]).

Many astronomical and navigational computations use the [[Figure of the Earth]] as a surface representing the earth.

The [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), formerly the International Earth Rotation Service, is the body responsible for maintaining global time and [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] standards, notably through its Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) and [[International Celestial Reference System]] (ICRS) groups.

===Deep space===
{{Main|Deep Space Network}}
The '''Deep Space Network''', or '''DSN''', is an international [[Wiktionary:network|network]] of large [[#Antennas|antenna]]s and communication facilities that supports [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] [[spacecraft]] missions, and [[radio astronomy|radio]] and [[radar astronomy]] observations for the exploration of the [[solar system]] and the [[universe]]. The network also supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL).

===Aboard an exploratory vehicle===
An observer becomes a deep space explorer upon escaping Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name=Kawakatsu&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.12.019|author=Kawakatsu Y |title=Concept study on Deep Space Orbit Transfer Vehicle |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=Dec 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11–12 |pages=1019–28 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576507001300|bibcode=2007AcAau..61.1019K}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Deep Space Network]] maintains communication and enables data download from an exploratory vessel, any local probing performed by sensors or active systems aboard usually require astronomical navigation, since the enclosing network of satellites to ensure accurate positioning is absent.

'''Trikonic''', is a technique of triadic analysis-synthesis which has been developed by Gary Richmond based on the original idea of a possible applied science making three categorial distinctions, which [[philosopher]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], its creator, called “Trichotomic.” Peirce introduces trichotomic as the "art of making three-fold divisions.”

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 1.0 The Trikonic Symbol.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1.0 The Trikonic Symbol]]

The symbol shown in Figure 1.0 is referred to as the ‘trikon’ symbol by Richmond (2005).  It displays the divisions of three categorial elements and their relationship for the subject in consideration

== Trikonic Analysis/Peircean Category Theory ==
A major part of trikonic analysis is the three Peircean categories; these consist of firstness, secondness and thirdness:
* ''"Firstness is the mode of being that of which is such as it is, positively and without reference to anything else.
* ''Secondness is the mode of being that which is such as it is, with respect to a second but regardless of any third.
* ''Thirdness is the mode of being that which is such as it is, in bringing a second and third into relation to each other."''

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 2.0 The Three Peircean Categories.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 2.0 The Three Peircean Categories]]

Another way of describing the basic understanding of these notions is from Sowa:
:''“First is the conception of being or existing independent of anything else. Second is the conception of being relative to, the conception of reaction, with something else. Third is the conception of mediation, whereby a first and a second are brought into relation. (1891)”''

Trikonically represented, the categories are (Figure 2.0):

There are many ways in which these notions can be interpreted.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  These are can be represented as:

Peirce's Three Universes of Experience (Figure 3.0):

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 3.0 Peirce's Three Universes of Experience.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 3.0 Peirce's Three Universes of Experience:]]

These in turn represent Peirce's three Universal Categories (Figure 4.0 The Universal Categories):

[[Image:Universal Categories.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 4.0 The Universal Categories:]]

In addition to the universal categories, there are equivalent ''Existential Categories'' (Figure 5.0 The Existential Categories):

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 5.0 The Existential Categories.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 5.0 The Existential Categories:]]

We can also trikonically analyse thought, by identifying three ''Logical Modalities''{{According to whom|date=February 2016}} (Figure 6.0 The Logical Modalities):

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 6.0 The Logical Modalities.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 6.0 The Logical Modalities:]]

With these representations in mind, firstness, secondness and thirdness can be defined as the following{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}:

*'''Firstness''' is concerned with ideas, character, qualities, feeling, image and possibility.
*'''Secondness''' signifies events, brute actions, reactions, existence and character.
*'''Thirdness''' brings together firstness in relation to secondness.

== Vector Analysis==
[[Image:Vectors.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 7.0 The Vectors]]
There are six vectors{{According to whom|date=February 2016}} that can be used in trikonic vector analysis; these are shown in Figure 7.0.

These six vectors have also been referred to as “directions of movement through the trikon” (Richmond, 2005).  They are authentic permutations of the triad, i.e. they are different arrangements of the order of firstness, secondness and thirdness{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}. They represent the relationships between firstness (1ns), secondness (2ns) and thirdness (3ns) for the object that is being analysed.

*'''''Vector of Process''''' – (1ns) chance sporting, then follows patterns of habit formation (3ns) which leads to some actual structural change in an organism (2ns).
*'''''Vector of Order''''' – thesis (1ns), subsequently antithesis (2ns) leading to synthesis (3ns).
*'''''Vector of Representation''''' – An engineer (3ns) create a CAD drawing (1ns) of a signalling design (2ns).
*'''''Vector of Analysis''''' – 3ns which involves 2ns which in turn involves 1ns.
*'''''Vector of Determination''''' – The object determines (2ns) a sign (1ns) for an interpretant (3ns).
*'''''Vector of Aspiration''''' - (2ns), (3ns), (1ns), represents the unique character specifically in human community development.

[[Image:Triknoic-Figure 8.0 The Determination Vector.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 8.0 The Determination Vector]]

Within trikonic are six directions, which are all permutations of logical paths of relations keeping the notion of 1ns, 2ns and 3ns throughout the object under consideration.

You can interpret these in many ways, for example, the Determination Vector and Representation Vector (Please refer to Figure 8.0 and Figure 9.0).{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 9.0 The Representation Vector.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 9.0 The Representation Vector]]

The reasoning behind the exploration of the six vectors within the triad aims at bringing a new view on analysis and a more systematic treatment to some of the difficult issues which arise especially in semiotic analysis, i.e. the vector process is a graphically logical analysis with aspects of dependence and constraint, and correlation, which tie in with the "living" reflection of the categories by the semiotic triad.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}

The reasoning behind the vector analysis is to use the permutations within the triad for the theory and any actual semiosis, mostly the analysis of complex virtual communicative projects.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  [[Semiosis]] is defined as:

"Semiosis is the making or production of meaning. The term was introduced by Charles Peirce (1839-1914) to describe the process of signification within the science of signs now termed semiology".

Trikonic analysis could lead to a kind of trikonic synthesis (the combination of separate elements or substances to form a coherent whole producing fundamental change in the further evolution of virtual community development.{{Weasel inline|date=February 2016}}

== Trikonic Analysis in HCI ==
Richmond suggests that ''“not all things can be trikonically analysed”'' (2005).  However, there has been investigation into whether trikonic can be applied to HCI related issues.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  Especially, those issues concerned with websites and culture, trikonic analysis using the Peircean Category Theory has been used to analyse how trust is invoked in a user when using websites.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  It may be possible to use 1ns, 2ns and 3ns to categorise features of a website, for example the visual elements, colours or text used, layout, the content of the website, credibility, how the elements relate to the users actual purpose of using the website etc.{{Weasel inline|date=February 2016}}

One of the purposes of trikonic is to explore whether it can help to identify what elements of a website actually influence the user to perceive it to be credible or not.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}

== Trikonic Analysis on the Interoperability of Conceptual Graph (CG) Tools ==
When approaching software problems like the interoperability of CG tools, it is often useful to look at a situation from a software engineering perspective to find a solution. However, with the use of trikonic it is possible to approach the software engineering problem in this way. Trikonic analysis is a very sophisticated method,{{Weasel inline|date=February 2016}} and as shown in the examples above it can be used in many different ways and scenarios. Again, using the notions of 1ns, 2ns and 3ns it may be possible to see how certain elements of the CG tools relate to each other in this way and produce a good solution from this.{{Weasel inline|date=February 2016}}

Examples of the three categories could be the programming language, the CG language and the architecture of the software. From this you could say, that:

“this CG language is a possibility” (1ns), “the programming language needs to be…” (2ns), “the architecture of the software is…” (3ns).

The '''United States Forest Service''' ('''USFS''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] that administers the nation's 154 [[United States National Forest|national forests]] and 20 [[United States National Grassland|national grasslands]], which encompass {{convert|193|e6acre|km2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency/newsroom/by-the-numbers|title=By the Numbers {{!}} US Forest Service|website=www.fs.fed.us|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Major divisions of the agency include the National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Business Operations, and the Research and Development branch.&lt;ref name=organization/&gt; Managing approximately 25% of [[federal lands]], it is the only major national land agency that is outside the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="gao.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=General Accounting Office|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-223|title=Federal Land Management: Observations on a Possible Move of the Forest Service into the Department of the Interior|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of the United States Forest Service}}

The concept of the National Forests was born from [[Theodore Roosevelt]]’s conservation group, [[Boone and Crockett Club]], due to concerns regarding [[Yellowstone National Park]] beginning as early as 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheldon|first1=William G.|title=History of the Boone and Crockett Club Pg 64-80|url=http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1000&amp;context=sheldon&amp;type=additional|website=Scholar Works, University of Montana|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club|accessdate=1 February 2017|ref=Pg. 65-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Congress created the office of Special Agent in the Department of Agriculture to assess the quality and conditions of forests in the United States. [[Franklin B. Hough]] was appointed the head of the office. In 1881, the office was expanded into the newly formed '''Division of Forestry'''. The [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]] authorized withdrawing land from the public domain as "forest reserves," managed by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. In 1901, the Division of Forestry was renamed the '''Bureau of Forestry'''. The Transfer Act of 1905 transferred the management of forest reserves from the [[General Land Office]] of the Interior Department to the Bureau of Forestry, henceforth known as the '''United States Forest Service'''. [[Gifford Pinchot]] was the first [[United States Chief Foresters|United States Chief Forester]] in the [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt]].

Significant federal legislation affecting the Forest Service includes the [[Weeks Act]] of 1911, the [[Multiple Use – Sustained Yield Act of 1960]], P.L. 86-517; the [[Wilderness Act]], P.L. 88-577; the [[National Forest Management Act]], P.L. 94-588; the [[National Environmental Policy Act]], P.L. 91-190; the [[Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act]], P.L. 95-313; and the [[Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act]], P.L. 95-307.

In February 2009, the [[Government Accountability Office]] evaluated whether the Forest Service should be moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, which already includes the [[National Park Service]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], and the [[Bureau of Land Management]], managing some {{convert|438000000|acre|km2}} of public land.&lt;ref name="gao.gov"/&gt;

== Organization ==

=== Overview ===
As of 2009, the Forest Service has a total budget authority of $5.5 billion, of which 42% is spent fighting fires. The Forest Service employs 34,250 employees in 750 locations, including 10,050 firefighters, 737 law enforcement personnel, and 500 scientists.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/documents/USFS_An_Overview_0106MJS.pdf|title=The U.S. Forest Service - An Overview|publisher=U.S. Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Forest Service is "To sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations."&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Its motto is "Caring for the land and serving people." As the lead federal agency in natural resource conservation, the US Forest Service provides leadership in the protection, management, and use of the nation's forest, rangeland, and aquatic ecosystems. The agency's ecosystem approach to management integrates ecological, economic, and social factors to maintain and enhance the quality of the environment to meet current and future needs. Through implementation of land and resource management plans, the agency ensures sustainable ecosystems by restoring and maintaining species diversity and ecological productivity that helps provide recreation, water, timber, minerals, fish, wildlife, wilderness, and aesthetic values for current and future generations of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/opinion/20heinrich.html | work=The New York Times | title=Clear-Cutting the Truth About Trees | first=Bernd | last=Heinrich | date=December 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday work of the Forest Service balances resource extraction, resource protection, and providing recreation. The work includes managing {{convert|193000000|acres|km2}} of national forest and grasslands, including {{convert|59000000|acres|km2}} of [[roadless area]]s; 14,077 recreation sites; {{convert|143346|mi|km}} of trails; {{convert|374883|mi|km}} of roads; and the harvesting of 1.5 billion trees per year.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Further, the Forest Service fought fires on {{convert|2996000|acres|km2}} of land in 2007.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

The Forest Service organization includes ranger districts, national forests, regions, research stations and research work units and the Northeastern Area Office for State and Private Forestry. Each level has responsibility for a variety of functions.

=== National Places ===
The Chief of the Forest Service is a career federal employee who oversees the entire agency. The Chief reports to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), an appointee of the President confirmed by the Senate. The Chief's staff provides broad policy and direction for the agency, works with the Administration to develop a budget to submit to Congress, provides information to Congress on accomplishments, and monitors activities of the agency. There are five deputy chiefs for the following areas: National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Research and Development, Business Operations, and Finance.

=== Research stations and research work units ===
[[File:U.S. Forest Products Lab.jpg|thumb|left|The Forest Products Laboratory, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].]]
The [[Forest Service Research and Development]] deputy area includes five research stations, the [[Forest Products Laboratory]], and the [[International Institute of Tropical Forestry]], in Puerto Rico. Station directors, like regional foresters, report to the Chief. Research stations include Northern, Pacific Northwest, Pacific Southwest, Rocky Mountain, and Southern. There are 92 research work units located at 67 sites throughout the United States. there are 80 Experimental Forests and Ranges that have been established progressively since 1908; many sites are more than 50 years old. The system provides places for long-term science and management studies in major vegetation types of the {{convert|195|e6acre|km2}} of public land administered by the Forest Service. Individual sites range from 47 to 22,500&amp;nbsp;ha  in size.

Operations of Experimental Forests and Ranges are directed by local research teams for the individual sites, by Research Stations for the regions in which they are located, and at the level of the Forest Service.

Major themes in research at the Experimental Forests and Ranges includes:
develop of systems for managing and restoring forests, range lands, and watersheds; investigate the workings of forest and stream ecosystems; characterize plant and animal communities; observe and interpret long-term environmental change and many other themes.

=== Regions ===
[[File:USFS regions map.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the nine regions]]
There are nine regions in the USDA Forest Service; numbered 1 through 10 (Region 7 was eliminated
in 1965 when the current Eastern Region was created from the former Eastern and
North Central regions.&lt;ref&gt;The Land We Cared for... A History of the Forest Service's Eastern Region.
1997, Conrad, David E., Forest Service.&lt;/ref&gt;
). Each encompasses a broad geographic area and is headed by a regional forester who reports directly to the Chief. The regional forester has broad responsibility for coordinating activities among the various forests within the region, for providing overall leadership for regional natural resource and social programs, and for coordinated regional land use planning.
*'''Northern Region''': based in [[Missoula, Montana]], the Northern Region (R1) covers six states (Montana, Northern Idaho, North Dakota, Northwestern South Dakota, Northeast Washington, and Northwest Wyoming), twelve National Forests and one National Grassland.
* '''Rocky Mountain''': based in [[Golden, Colorado]], the Rocky Mountain Region (R2) covers five states (Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and most of Wyoming and South Dakota), sixteen National Forests and seven National Grasslands.
*'''Southwestern''': based in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], the Southwestern Region (R3) covers two states (New Mexico and Arizona) and eleven National Forests.
*'''Intermountain''': based in [[Ogden, Utah]], the Intermountain Region (R4) covers four states (Southern Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Western Wyoming), twelve national forests.
*'''Pacific Southwest''': based in [[Vallejo, California]], The Pacific Southwest Region (R5) covers two states (California and Hawaii), eighteen National Forests and one Management Unit.
* '''Pacific Northwest''': based in [[Portland, Oregon]] the Pacific Northwest Region (R6) covers two states (Washington and Oregon), seventeen National Forests and one National Scenic Area.
* '''Southern''': based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the Southern Region (R8) covers thirteen states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma and Virginia; and Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands), and thirty-four National Forests.
* '''Eastern''': based in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], the Eastern Region (R9) covers twenty states (Maine, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Delaware, and New Jersey), seventeen National Forests, one Grassland and America's Outdoors Center for Conservation, Recreation, and Resources.
* '''Alaska''': based in [[Juneau, Alaska]], the Alaska Region (R10) covers one state (Alaska), and two National Forests.

=== National Forest or Grassland ===
{{further|List of U.S. National Forests|United States National Grassland}}
The Forest Service oversees 155 national forests and 20 grasslands. Each administrative unit typically comprises several ranger districts, under the overall direction of a forest supervisor. Within the supervisor's office, the staff coordinates activities among districts, allocates the budget, and provides technical support to each district. Forest supervisors are line officers and report to regional foresters.

=== Ranger District ===
The Forest Service has over 600 ranger districts. Each district has a staff of 10 to 100 people under the direction of a district ranger, a line officer who reports to a forest supervisor. The districts vary in size from {{convert|50000|acre|km2}} to more than {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}}. Most on-the-ground activities occur on ranger districts, including trail construction and maintenance, operation of campgrounds, and management of vegetation and wildlife habitat.&lt;ref name=organization&gt;{{USFS|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency/organization|article=Agency Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major divisions ==

=== Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations ===
[[File:United States Forest Service LEI Patch.gif|thumb|Patch of the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit]]
[[File:United States Forest Service Horse patrol.jpg|thumb|A horse patrol of the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit]]

The U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit (LEI), headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], is a [[List of law enforcement agencies|federal law enforcement agency]] of the U.S. government. It is responsible for enforcement of federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. All Law Enforcement Officers and Special Agents Receive their training through [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC).

Operations are divided into two major functional areas:
* Law enforcement: uniformed, high-visibility enforcement of laws
* Investigations: [[special agent]]s who investigate crimes against property, visitors, and employees

Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) enforce federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. LEOs also enforce some or all state laws on National Forest Lands. As part of that mission, LEOs carry firearms, defensive equipment, make arrests, execute [[search warrant]]s, complete reports, and testify in court. They establish a regular and recurring presence on a vast amount of public lands, roads, and recreation sites. The primary focus of their jobs is the protection of natural resources, protection of Forest Service employees and the protection of visitors. To cover the vast and varied terrain under their jurisdiction, they use [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]s, special service [[SUV]]s, horses, [[Police dog|K-9 units]], helicopters, [[snowmobile]]s, dirt bikes, and boats.

[[Special Agents]] are criminal investigators who plan and conduct investigations concerning possible violations of criminal and administrative provisions of the Forest Service and other statues under the [[United States Code]]. Special agents are normally plainclothes officers who carry concealed firearms, and other defensive equipment, make arrests, carry out complex criminal investigations, present cases for prosecution to [[U.S. Attorneys]], and prepare investigative reports. All field agents are required to travel a great deal and usually maintain a case load of ten to fifteen ongoing criminal investigations at one time. Criminal investigators occasionally conduct internal and civil claim investigations.

=== National Forest System ===
[[File:106mm Recoilless Rifle.jpg|thumb|left|Forest Service team uses a 106&amp;nbsp;mm [[Recoilless Rifle]] for [[avalanche control]] at [[Mammoth Mountain]] in the [[Inyo National Forest]] in [[California]]. Note the [[Minarets (California)|Minarets]] in background.]]
The {{convert|193|e6acre|km2}} of public land that are managed as national forests and [[grassland]]s are collectively known as the National Forest System. These lands are located in 44 states, Puerto Rico, and the [[Virgin Islands]] and comprise about 9% of the total land area in the United States. The lands are organized into 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands. The mission of the National Forest System is to protect and manage the forest lands so they best demonstrate the sustainable multiple-use management concept, using an ecological approach, to meet the diverse needs of people.

=== State and Private Forestry ===
The mission of the State and Private Forestry program is to provide technical and financial assistance to private landowners, state agencies, tribes, and community resource managers to help sustain the United States' urban and rural forests and to protect communities and the environment from wildland fires, insects, disease, and [[Invasive species|invasive]] plants. The program employs approximately 537 staff located at 17 sites throughout the country. The delivery of the State and Private Forestry program is carried out by eight National Forest System regions and the Northeastern Area.

=== Research and development ===
[[File:USFS PNW lab.jpg|thumb|right|The U.S. Forest Service [[R&amp;D]] lab in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], Washington]]
The [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service works to improve the health and use of the United States' forests and [[grassland]]s. Research has been part of the Forest Service mission since the agency's inception in 1905. Today, Forest Service researchers work in a range of biological, physical, and social science fields to promote sustainable management of United States' diverse forests and rangelands. Research employs about 550 scientists and several hundred technical and support staff, located at 67 sites throughout the United States and in [[Puerto Rico]]. Discovery and technology development and transfer is carried out through seven research stations.

Research focuses on informing policy and land management decisions and includes addressing [[Invasive species|invasive]] insects, degraded [[river ecosystem]]s, or sustainable ways to harvest forest products. The researchers work independently and with a range of partners, including other agencies, academia, nonprofit groups, and industry. The information and technology produced through basic and applied science programs is available to the public for its benefit and use.

In addition to the Research Stations, the USFS R&amp;D branch also leads several National Centers such as the [[National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation]].

=== International programs ===
The Forest Service plays a key role in formulating policy and coordinating U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources. It works closely with other agencies such as [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], the [[U.S. Department of State|State Department]], and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], as well as with nonprofit development organizations, wildlife organizations, universities, and international assistance organizations. The Forest Service's international work serves to link people and communities striving to protect and manage forests throughout the world. The program also promotes [[sustainable land management]] overseas and brings important technologies and innovations back to the United States. The program focuses on conserving key natural resource in cooperation with countries across the world.

== Activities ==
[[File:US-national-forest-service-lands.png|thumb|350px|left|More than 80% of the 193 million acres (780,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land managed by the United States Forest Service is in the western states.

Although a large volume of [[Lumber|timber]] is [[Logging|logged]] every year, not all [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] are entirely forested. There are tidewater glaciers in the [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Alaska]] and ski areas such as [[Alta, Utah]] in the [[Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. In addition, the Forest Service is responsible for managing [[National Grassland]]s in the midwest. Furthermore, areas designated as wilderness by acts of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], prohibit logging, mining, road and building construction and land leases for purposes of farming and or livestock grazing.

Since 1978, several [[President of the United States|Presidents]] have directed the USFS to administer  [[U.S. National Monument|National Monuments]] inside of preexisting National Forests.

* [[Admiralty Island National Monument]] – Alaska
* [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] – California
* [[Misty Fjords National Monument]] – Alaska
* [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]] – Washington
* [[Newberry National Volcanic Monument]] – Oregon
* [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]] – California (jointly with the [[Bureau of Land Management]])

The Forest Service also manages [[Grey Towers National Historic Site]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], the home and estate of its first Chief, [[Gifford Pinchot]].

=== Fighting fires ===
{{See also|History of wildfire suppression in the United States}}
[[File:Smokey3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Smokey Bear]] poster]]

In August 1944, to reduce the number of [[wildfire|forest fires]],  the Forest Service and the [[Wartime Advertising Council]] began distributing fire education posters featuring a [[American black bear|black bear]]. The poster campaign was a success; the black bear would later be named "[[Smokey Bear]]", and would, for decades, be the "spokesbear" for the Forest Service.  Smokey Bear has appeared in innumerable TV commercials;  his popular catch phrase, "Only YOU can prevent forest fires", is one of the most widely recognized slogans in the United States. A recent study found that 95% of the people surveyed could complete the phrase when given the first few words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/fireprevention/smokeybear.php?p=1.1.3.4 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129032801/http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/fireprevention/smokeybear.php?p=1.1.3.4 |archivedate=2010-11-29 |title=The Story of Smokey Bear |publisher=United States Forest Service |accessdate=2008-01-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}

In September 2000, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior developed a plan to respond to the fires of 2000, to reduce the impacts of these wildland fires on rural communities, and to ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future. The report is entitled "Managing the Impacts of Wildfire on Communities and the Environment: A Report to the President In Response to the Wildfires of 2000"—The National Fire Plan for short. The National Fire Plan continues to be an integral part of the Forest Service today. The following are important operational features of the National Fire Plan:
*Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy: The 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and the subsequent 2001 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy act as the foundation of the National Fire Plan.
*Basic Premise of the National Fire Plan: Investing now in an optimal firefighting force, hazardous fuels reduction, and overall community protection will provide for immediate protection and future cost savings.
*Funding: Initially (2001), the National Fire Plan provided for an additional $1,100,994,000 for the Forest Service for a total wildland fire management budget of $1,910,193,000. In 2008, the total amount for the Forest Service in wildland fire management (not including emergency fire suppression funding) is $1,974,276,000.

In August 2014, Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, announced that the agency will have to put $400 to $500 million in wildfire prevention projects on hold because funding for firefighting is running low as the fiscal year ends. The decision is meant to preserve resources for fighting active fires burning in California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Politicians of both parties have indicated that they believe the current funding structure is broken, but they have not agreed on steps to fix the funding allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freking|first1=Kevin|title=MONEY ALLOCATED FOR FIGHTING FIRES TO RUN OUT|url=http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/local/california/2014/08/05/money-allocated-fighting-fires-run/13636869/|work=Associated Press|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Budget ==
Although part of the Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service receives its budget through the Subcommittee on Appropriations—Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.

[[File:Robert Bray Lassie 1967.JPG|right|upright|thumb|[[Lassie]] with [[Robert Bray]] as U.S. Forest Ranger [[Corey Stuart]]]]
The U.S. Forest Service achieved widespread awareness during the 1960s, as it became the setting for the long running classic TV show ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', with storylines focusing on Lassie's adventures with various forest rangers.&lt;ref name="jcs" /&gt;

The iconic collie's association with the Forest Service led to Lassie receiving numerous awards and citations from the [[U.S. Senate]] and the Department of Agriculture, and was partly responsible for a bill regarding soil and water pollution that was signed into law in early 1968 by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], which was dubbed by some as "The Lassie Program".&lt;ref name="jcs"&gt;{{cite web

== Controversies ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The history of the Forest Service has been fraught with controversy, as various interests and national values have grappled with the appropriate management of the many resources within the forests. These values and resources include [[grazing]], [[Lumber|timber]], [[mining]], [[recreation]], wildlife habitat, and [[wilderness]]. Because of continuing development elsewhere, the large size of National Forests have made them de facto wildlife reserves for a number of rare and common species. In recent decades, the importance of mature forest for the [[spotted owl]] and a number of other species led to great changes in timber harvest levels.

In the 1990s, the agency was involved in scandal when it illegally provided surplus military aircraft to private contractors for use as [[airtanker]]s. (See [[U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal]].)

Another controversial issue is the policy on road building within the National Forests. In 1999, President Clinton ordered a temporary moratorium on new road construction in the National Forests to "assess their ecological, economic, and social values and to evaluate long-term options for their management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTFzMTAwjQL8h2VAQAJp-nEg!!/?ss=119930&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;navid=091000000000000&amp;pnavid=null&amp;ttype=roadmain&amp;cid=FSE_003853&amp;position=RELATEDLINKS&amp;pname=Roadless-Home|work=Roadless Area Conservation|title=Home|publisher=US Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five and half years later, the Bush administration replaced this with a system where each state could petition the Forest Service to open forests in their territory to road building.

Some years the agency actually loses money on its timber sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 draft report describing the legal basis which provides federal land managers a scope of decision making authority exceeding that of state fish and game departments has proven unexpectedly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/forest-service-tried-to-quash-paper-debunking-montana-wildlife-authority/article_91ef1437-4df9-5ea0-8667-728e6f63ae91.html|title=Forest Service tried to quash paper debunking Montana wildlife authority|last=Chaney|first=Rob|date=2017-09-25|work=[[Missoulian]]|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory has been a centre for atmospheric measurements and meteorological observations since 1970. Keeping of weather records was originally started by the University College of Reading (a precursor of the university) in 1901, with a near complete daily record from January 1908&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/home/atmospheric-observatory/|title=University of Reading|website=University of Reading|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The location of the site was moved, Originally sited on the London Road campus (nearer central Reading), it was moved to Whiteknights campus in January 1968, but took up its current location (still on Whiteknights campus) in January 1970.

[[File:Jefferson_Bethke.jpg|thumb|right|Jefferson Bethke]]
'''''Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus''''' is a [[viral video]] created by [[Christian]] speaker Jefferson Bethke, who uploaded his work that rose him to fame onto [[YouTube]] and [[GodTube]], under the [[screenname]] bball1989.&lt;ref name="Christian Post"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/why-i-hate-religion-but-love-jesus-viral-video-sparks-faith-debate-67119/ | title = 'Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus' Viral Video Sparks Faith Debate|author=Ravelle Mohammed|publisher = [[The Christian Post]]| quote= The video, titled "Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus..."|accessdate = 13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crosswalk"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.crosswalk.com/video/why-i-hate-religion-but-love-jesus.html | title = Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus: Posted by 'bball1989' on GodTube.com |publisher = Crosswalk.com|accessdate = 13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video has thus far received more than 33.1 million views.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IAhDGYlpqY&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of the video revolves around "the difference between [[Jesus]] and [[Pseudoreligion|false religion]]."&lt;ref name= "Christian Post"/&gt; Underneath his video, Bethke delineated its purpose:

{{quote|text=A poem I wrote to highlight the difference between Jesus and false religion. In the scriptures Jesus received the most opposition from the most religious people of his day. At its core Jesus' gospel and the [[Good News (Christianity)|good news]] of the Cross is in pure opposition to self-righteousness/self-justification. Religion is man-centered, Jesus is God-centered. This poem highlights my journey to discover this truth. Religion either ends in pride or despair. Pride because you make a list and can do it and act better than everyone, or despair because you can't do your own list of rules and feel not good enough for God. With Jesus, though, you have humble confident joy because He represents you, you don't represent yourself and His sacrifice is perfect, putting us in perfect standing with God!&lt;ref name="Crosswalk"/&gt;}}

Jefferson Bethke repudiated those who used his video to criticize the [[Christian Church|Church]], stating "The Church is His vehicle to reach a lost world. A hospital for sinners. Saying you love Jesus but hate the Church, is like a fiancé saying he loves his future bride, but hates her kids."&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/why-i-hate-religion-but-love-jesus-viral-video-sparks-faith-debate-67119/| title = 'Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus' Viral Video Sparks Faith Debate|author=Ravelle Mohammed | publisher = The Christian Post|quote= "The Church is Jesus' bride..." | accessdate = 13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the author of the video stated that he wanted to expose the [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]] prevalent in many houses of worship.&lt;ref name = "Post2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/why-i-hate-religion-but-love-jesus-viral-video-sparks-faith-debate-67119/ | title = 'Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus' Viral Video Sparks Faith Debate|author=Ravelle Mohammed|publisher = The Christian Post|quote=Bethke clarifies that he loves the church...| accessdate = 13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular rapper [[Lecrae]], on his [[Facebook]], encouraged his fans to think about the video by linking an article titled "Does Jesus hate religion? Kinda, sorta, not really" by [[Kevin DeYoung]] who had, since writing it, spoken with Jefferson Bethke about it and the video.&lt;ref name=TGC&gt;{{cite web|last=DeYoung|first=Kevin|title=Does Jesus Hate Religion?

[[File:Thornton sheild.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Domestic armorial window]] 
'''William Warrington''', (1796–1869), was an English maker of [[stained glass]] windows. His firm, operating from 1832 to 1875, was one of the earliest of the English [[Gothic revival|Medieval revival]] and served clients such as Norwich and Peterborough Cathedrals.  Warrington was an historian of medieval glass and published an illustrated book ''The History of Stained Glass''.

In his youth, Warrington first trained with his father as a painter of [[Heraldry|armorial]] shields. He then moved for a time into the stained glass workshop of [[Thomas Willement]], one of the earliest such workshops to be of high renown. In 1832 Warrington established his own stained glass company, where he produced windows that well satisfied the rising fashion of [[Gothic Revival]] and in which his own skills as an armorial painter were utilised in the production of domestic as well as ecclesiastical windows. 

From studying existent ancient windows and emulation of the leading techniques of the master Thomas Willement, Warrington developed a style which allowed him to create windows strongly resembling those of the [[Gothic art|13th and 14th centuries]] in appearance. His windows became the preferred choice of the architect [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]] who used them in most of his earliest churches, between 1838 and 1842. 

But Pugin was soon to fall out with Warrington, claiming ''“The Glass-Painters will shorten my days, they are the greatest plague I have. The reason I did not give Warrington the window at the hospital is this. He has lately become so conceited and got nearly as expensive as Willement.”''&lt;ref&gt;extract from a letter by Pugin in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=January 2014}} Warrington produced drawings of windows to be used by Pugin in the Houses of Parliament, but the firms that Pugin employed were [[Ballantine and Allen]] and [[Hardman &amp; Co.]]

In 1848 Warrington published ''“The History of Stained Glass, from the Earliest Period of the Art to the Present Time”'' . The book came out in a folio edition with coloured lithographs illustrating British stained glass windows from the 11th to the 15th centuries. However Warrington expressed his dislike of the glass of the centuries that followed as being "a misconception and misapplication of this art." 

Among Warrington's significant commissions was the tiered arrangement of windows for the Eastern Apse of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. He also designed for [[Ely Cathedral]], where his work may still be seen, both installed and on display in the Stained Glass Museum.

After Warrington’s death in 1869, the firm continued until 1875.

== Style ==

Warrington was able to reproduce closely the geometric and foliate backgrounds of the 13th century and create pictorial rondels composed of small pieces of glass that gave a similar impression to the Medieval originals, though tending to let through more light and have less luminosity, because the nature of the glass was less flawed and therefore less refractive. Warrington's windows often contain a background comprising a distinctive pattern of little red and blue diagonal checks which was copied from medieval originals.
Many of Warrington’s [[Gothic Revival]] windows have a pleasant simplicity about them, the stylised foliage which takes up much of the window space being less heavy in appearance than some of his rivals, such as Clutterbuck, and based more closely upon recognisable plants. 

The balance and arrangements of pictorial scenes within their formal background shows Warrington as a much more skilful designer than his teacher Willement, in whose windows the overall arrangement has a fairly arbitrary quality. Warrington’s figurative painting strives towards the [[Gothic art|Medieval]] in its forms, which are somewhat elongated and elegant, with simply-painted drapery falling in deep folds in such a way that line and movement is emphasised in the pictorial composition. His painting of the details, particularly of faces, is both masterly and exquisite. Towards the end of his career he also designed windows in a more painterly and less Gothic manner to suit changing tastes.

A '''wrong''' (from [[Old English]] ''wrang ''– ''crooked'')&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter=crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an act that is illegal or [[immoral]].&lt;ref name="oxdic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Law|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198607563|author=Elizabeth A. Martin|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Legal wrongs''' are usually quite clearly defined in the [[law]] of a [[State (polity)|state]] and/or [[jurisdiction]]. They can be divided into [[civil wrong]]s and [[crime]]s (or ''criminal offences'') in [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries,&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; while [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries tend to have some additional categories, such as [[contraventions]].

'''[[Morality|Moral]] wrong''' is an underlying concept for legal wrong. Some moral wrongs are punishable by law, for example, [[rape]] or [[murder]].&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as parking  offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs.&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt;

==Legal wrong==
In law, a wrong can be a legal [[injury]], which is any damage resulting from a violation of a [[legal right]]. A legal wrong can also imply the state of being contrary to the principles of justice or law. It means that something is contrary to conscience or morality and results in treating others unjustly. If the loss caused by a wrong is minor enough, there is no compensation, which principle is known as ''[[De minimis|de minimis non curat lex]]''. Otherwise, damages apply.

The law of England recognised the concept of a "wrong" before it recognised the distinction between [[civil wrong]]s (governed by [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]]) and [[crime]]s (defined by [[criminal law]]), which distinction was developed during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]], [[A First Book of English Law]], Sweet and Maxwell, 4th ed., 1960, pp. 207, 208, 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center'''&lt;ref&gt;"Yongbyon" is spelled and pronounced 녕변 (Nyŏngbyŏn) in North Korea and 영변 (Yŏngbyŏn) in South Korea.&lt;/ref&gt; is [[North Korea]]'s major nuclear facility, operating its first [[nuclear reactor]]s. It is located in [[Nyongbyon County]] in [[North Pyongan Province]], about 100&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Pyongyang]]. The center produced the [[fissile material]] for North Korea's [[List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea|six nuclear weapon tests from 2006 to 2017]], and since 2009 is developing indigenous [[light water reactor]] nuclear power station technology. Since early 2018, nuclear testing at Yongbyon has ceased and the site has seen hardly any movement in activity.&lt;ref name=oct31 /&gt;

==Facilities==
The major installations include all aspects of a [[Magnox]] [[nuclear fuel cycle|nuclear reactor fuel cycle]], based on the use of [[natural uranium]] fuel:
* a [[Nuclear fuel|fuel]] fabrication plant,
* a 5&amp;nbsp;[[MWe]] experimental reactor producing power and district heating,
* a short-term [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] storage facility,
* a [[Nuclear reprocessing|fuel reprocessing]] facility that recovers [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] from [[spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] using the [[PUREX]] process.

Magnox spent fuel is not designed for long-term storage as both the casing and [[uranium]] metal core react with water; it is designed to be reprocessed within a few years of removal from a reactor.&lt;ref name=RWMAC&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rwmac/reports/reprocess/16.htm |title=RWMAC's Advice to Ministers on the Radioactive Waste Implications of Reprocessing, Annex 4: Dry storage and disposal of Magnox spent fuel |author=Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee |publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] |date=November 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819040238/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rwmac/reports/reprocess/16.htm |archivedate=19 August 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[carbon dioxide]] cooled, [[Nuclear graphite|graphite]] [[Neutron moderator|moderated]] Magnox reactor does not require difficult-to-produce [[enriched uranium]] fuel or a [[heavy water]] moderator it is an attractive choice for a wholly indigenous nuclear reactor development.

The Magnox facilities were disabled in 2007 in accord with the [[six-party talks]] agreement, but following the breakdown of that agreement were partially re-enabled in 2009 to reprocess existing stocks of spent fuel.  On 15 September 2015, North Korea announced that the reactor had resumed operation.&lt;ref name=bbc-20150915&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34254634 |title=North Korea Yongbyon nuclear site 'in operation' |publisher=BBC |date=15 September 2015 |accessdate=15 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915114315/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34254634 |archivedate=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center also has an IRT-2000 pool-type [[research reactor]], supplied by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1963, operational since 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Reactor Details – IRT-DPRK |url=http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/rrdb.page.pl/rrdeta.htm?country=KP&amp;site=IRT-DPRK&amp;facno=258 |date=30 July 1996 |accessdate=14 February 2007 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor fuel is IRT-2M type assemblies of 36% and 80% [[highly enriched uranium]].&lt;ref name=hecker-20080314&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://fsi.stanford.edu/publications/report_of_visit_to_north_korea_to_senate_foreign_relations_committee/ |title=Report of Visit to North Korea to Senate Foreign Relations Committee |author=Siegfried S.

In 2009 the building of a small indigenous experimental [[light water reactor]] started. In 2010 a [[uranium enrichment]] plant began operating.&lt;ref name=hecker-20101120/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yongbyon 5 MWe reactor - fuel channels access ports.jpg|thumb|left|The 5&amp;nbsp;MWe reactor, showing the fuel channels access ports]]
Construction of the 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor began in 1980, and the reactor first went [[Critical mass|critical]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=nyt-19920517/&gt; This reactor was an initial small technology proving reactor for a following development program of larger Magnox reactors. The [[spent nuclear fuel]] reprocessing facility appeared to still be under construction in 1992.&lt;ref name=nyt-19920517&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/world/north-korean-site-has-a-bomb-hints.html |title=North Korean site has A-bomb hints |author=Sheryl WuDunn |newspaper=New York Times |date=17 May 1992 |accessdate=18 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329145325/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/world/north-korean-site-has-a-bomb-hints.html |archivedate=29 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor operated intermittently until 1994 when it was shut down in accordance with the [[U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework]]. Following the breakdown of the Agreed Framework in 2002, operation restarted in February 2003, creating [[plutonium]] within its fuel load at a rate of about 6&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name=bridge-hecker-2010&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://cisac.stanford.edu/publications/north_koreas_choice_bombs_over_electricity/ |title=North Korea's Choice: Bombs Over Electricity |author1=Siegfried S.

Another 200&amp;nbsp;MWe Magnox full-scale power reactor was being constructed at [[Taechon]], 20&amp;nbsp;km north-west of Yongbyon, ({{Coord|39.928|125.569|type:landmark_region:KP|display=inline}}) until construction was also halted in 1994 in accord with the Agreed Framework. By 2005 reconstruction of this reactor was uneconomic.

The reactor designs were based on declassified information about the British [[Magnox]] design at [[Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] and elsewhere, and the spent fuel reprocessing plant on the multi-national ''European Company for the Chemical Processing of Irradiated Fuels'' (EUROCHEMIC) plant at [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]]-[[Dessel]] in Belgium.&lt;ref name=bridge-hecker-2010 /&gt;

===2007 shutdown===
[[File:Yongbyon, disabled nuclear fuel fabrication facility machine shop.jpg|thumb|Empty machine shop in the disabled fuel fabrication facility]]
On 13 February 2007, an agreement was reached at the [[Six-party talks|Six party talks]] that [[North Korea]] will shut down and seal the Magnox nuclear reactor and associated facilities and invite back [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] personnel to conduct all necessary monitoring and verifications.&lt;ref name="IAEA-GOV/2007/45-GC(51)/19"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC51/GC51Documents/English/gc51-19_en.pdf |title=Application of Safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) |date=17 August 2007 |id=GOV/2007/45-GC(51)/19 |publisher=IAEA |accessdate=9 August 2009 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509080157/http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC51/GC51Documents/English/gc51-19_en.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return for this [[North Korea]] will receive emergency energy assistance from the other five parties in the form of 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil.

[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspectors arrived at the site on 28 June to discuss verification and monitoring arrangements for the shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/06/27/koreas.nuclear.ap/index.html?section=cnn_latest U.N. nuke inspectors go to N.

===2008 cooling tower demolition===
On Friday 27 June 2008, North Korea destroyed the most visible symbol of its nuclear weapons program – the [[cooling tower]] at its main atomic reactor in the complex.  The implosion was witnessed by a number of international journalists and diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23933319-2703,00.html|title=Blast gets North Korea off US blacklist|date=28 June 2008|work=The Australian|accessdate=10 July 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demolition of the {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall cooling tower, which carried off waste heat to the atmosphere, is a response to U.S. concessions after the North delivered a declaration of its nuclear programs to be dismantled. The United States paid the US$2.5 million demolition fee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Possible reactivation===
During 2008 tensions resurfaced between North Korea and the U.S. due to disagreements over the [[six-party talks]] disarmament process. On 8 October 2008, [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] inspectors were forbidden by the North Korean government to conduct further inspections of the site. However two days later the U.S. removed North Korea from the U.S. [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] list and the Yongbyon deactivation process resumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90e15f8c-970d-11dd-8cc4-000077b07658.html |title=Bush removes North Korea from terror list |author=Demetri Sevastopulo |date=10 October 2008 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=10 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012123110/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90e15f8c-970d-11dd-8cc4-000077b07658.html |archivedate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 resumption of reprocessing===
According to the state-run North Korean news agency KCNA website, the DPRK resumed the reprocessing of spent fuel to recover plutonium on 25 April 2009 in response to the UN's condemnation of its recent [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2|rocket launch]]. This material supplemented that used for nuclear weapons testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title = North Korea says it has started reprocessing spent fuel rods  | place = Nexis   | publisher = BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific – Political | date = 25 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light water reactor development===
In 2009 North Korea announced its intention to build an indigenous experimental [[light water reactor]] (LWR) and the uranium enrichment technology to provide its nuclear fuel.&lt;ref name=kcna-20090613&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200906/news13/20090613-10ee.html |title=DPRK Foreign Ministry Declares Strong Counter- Measures against UNSC's "Resolution 1874" |date=13 June 2010 |publisher=[[Korean Central News Agency]] |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609220635/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200906/news13/20090613-10ee.html |archivedate=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a 2,000 [[gas centrifuge]] uranium enrichment plant to produce [[low enriched uranium]] (LEU) fuel began operating, and construction started on the experimental 25 to 30 MWe LWR, with a target operation date for the reactor of 2012.&lt;ref name=hecker-20101120&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://cisac.stanford.edu/publications/north_koreas_yongbyon_nuclear_complex_a_report_by_siegfried_s_hecker/ |title=A Return Trip to North Korea’s Yongbyon Nuclear Complex |author=Siegfried S.

===Suspension of uranium enrichment===
In February 2012, North Korea announced that it would suspend uranium enrichment at Yongbyon, and not conduct any further tests of nuclear weapons while productive negotiations involving the United States continue. Additionally, North Korea would allow IAEA inspectors to monitor operations at Yongbyon. The U.S. reaffirmed that it does not have hostile intent toward the DPRK, and is prepared to improve bilateral relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201202/news29/20120229-37ee.html |title=DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Result of DPRK-U.S. Talks |publisher=Korean Central News Agency |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304080511/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201202/news29/20120229-37ee.html |archivedate=4 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184869.htm |title=U.S.-DPRK Bilateral Discussions |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302195255/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184869.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear enrichment was presumably resumed following the collapse of the Leap Day Deal.

===2013 planned restart of operation===
In March 2013, North Korea announced that they would be restarting operation of the 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor.&lt;ref name=bbc-20130402&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21999193 |title=North Korea 'to restart Yongbyon nuclear reactor' |publisher=BBC |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407063220/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21999193 |archivedate=7 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to do so, the disabled secondary cooling system will have to be restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://38north.org/2013/04/yongbyon040313/ |title=Satellite Images Show New Construction at North Korea’s Plutonium Production Reactor; Rapid Restart? |author1=Nick Hansen |author2=Jeffrey Lewis |lastauthoramp=yes |date=3 April 2013 |work=38 North, [[School of Advanced International Studies]] |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407180539/http://38north.org/2013/04/yongbyon040313/ |archivedate=7 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2015, North Korea announced that the Yongbyon nuclear site is in full operation, including the 5&amp;nbsp;MWe experimental reactor.&lt;ref name=bbc-20150915/&gt; However, satellite imagery in April 2016 suggested it was not operating at a high power level.&lt;ref name=38north-20160415&gt;{{cite news|url=http://38north.org/2016/04/yongbyon041516/ |title=More Evidence of Possible Reprocessing Campaign at Yongbyon; Progress at Experimental Light Water Reactor |author=Joseph S.
